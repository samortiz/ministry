Mark is not as profound as the Gospel of John, and it does not contain as many teachings as are found in the Gospel of Matthew
Some readers of the New Testament may think of Mark as the Galilee of the four Gospels and some may wonder what good can come out of Galilee
If we would have a history of the Lord's life and ministry on earth, we need to learn how to put together the Gospels of John and Mark
We need to see that the record in the Gospel of Mark is a record primarily of the Lord's move not in Judea but in Galilee
In the first chapter of the Gospel of John we have a record of profound matters related to Christ's incarnation
In the first chapter of his Gospel John goes on to say that the law was given through Moses, but grace and reality came through Jesus Christ
In verse 18 John says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
In contrast to the profound matters revealed in the Gospel of John, in Mark's Gospel we see the Lord as the Slave-Savior
In the Gospel of Mark we do not have the God-Savior, as in John, the King-Savior, as in Matthew, or the Man-Savior, as in Luke
Paul's writings are on a divine level, on God's level, and reveal the divine dispensing for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose
Whereas Paul's writings are on a divine level, the book of James is on a human level and emphasizes practical Christian perfection
How can we compare practical Christian perfection with the divine economy, or compare living ethically with living Christ?
As recorded in Johns Gospel the Lord says such profound things as I am the life I am the light of the world and I am the resurrection
The word 'synoptic' indicates that the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke all have the same view, the view of the Lord's humanity
The excellency of such a man in his presidency could not compare with the excellency in his becoming a janitor
How beautiful for a person, after occupying the high office of President of the United States, to become a janitor!
How excellent it would be to see a former President working as a janitor, for we would see in him excellent human virtue!
In the Gospel of Matthew we see the Lord Jesus in His kingship, but in the Gospel of Mark we see the Lord in His slavery
The reason is that Mark's purpose is to provide a detailed record to show the beauty of the Lord as a Slave in His human virtues
A key to understanding the Gospel of Mark is that in this Gospel we see much more of the Lord's acts than of His words
He includes many small points in order to present a portrait of the beauty and excellence of the humanity of Christ as the Slave-Savior
He accompanied Barnabas and Saul in their ministry , and joined Paul in the first journey of his ministry to the Gentiles
The record is according to historical sequence and gives more details of historical facts than the other Gospels do
If we would know the actual incidents of the Lord's life according to historical sequence, we need the Gospel of Mark
Since Mark presents the Savior as a Slave, he does not tell His genealogy and status, as the ancestry of a slave is not worthy of note
If you read chapter two of the Gospel of Luke, you will see Christ growing up like a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground
The Lord was raised in the home of a poor carpenter in the despised town of Nazareth and in the despised province of Galilee
He turned His back toward those who wanted to smite Him, He gave His cheeks to the persecutors, and He did not hide His face from shame
Isaiah 423 and 4 say A bruised reed shall he not break and the smoking flax shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth
He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law'
On the other hand, according to these verses, He would not faint as a dimly burning flax, nor would He be crushed as a bruised reed
The chastisement of our peace, that is, the chastisement for our peace, was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed
From these verses we see that God laid on Him the iniquity of us all, bruised Him, put Him to grief, and made His soul a trespass offering
Now after His resurrection He, as the righteous Servant of God, justifies the many, whose iniquities He has borne
Isaiah 52:13 speaks of the Lord's exaltation: 'Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high'
He also became a light to the Gentiles, to the heathen, through the preaching of the gospel carried out by His disciples
According to Philippians 2:6, although Christ subsisted in the form of God, He did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped
In Philippians 2:7 Paul goes on to say, 'But emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men'
Having emptied Himself, the Lord came as a man, taking the form of a slave and becoming in the likeness of men
In His incarnation the Lord did not alter His divine nature, but altered only His outward expression of the form of God to that of a slave
The form of God implies the inward reality of Christ's deity; the likeness of men denotes the outward appearance of His humanity
If the same brother would put on work clothes and begin to vacuum the carpet, we may say that he has the form of a janitor
To the Jews the death of a cross was a curse , and to the Gentiles it was a death sentence imposed upon malefactors and slaves
In Philippians 2:9 Paul says, 'Wherefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name'
Because Mark presents the Savior as a Slave, he does not tell His genealogy or status, since the ancestry of a slave is not worthy of note
The record concerning Christ as the Slave of God in the Gospel of Mark is not mainly a record of His wonderful words
These deeds displayed both His lovely humanity in its virtue and perfection and His deity in its glory and honor
By giving His life as a ransom for sinners, the Lord as the Slave-Savior accomplished the eternal purpose of God, whom He served as a Slave
The Lord's humanity is lovely in its virtue and perfection, and His deity is magnificent in its glory and honor
The Lord's humanity is revealed in its virtue and perfection, and His deity is revealed in its glory and honor
Mark begins with the beginning of the gospel, the service of Jesus as a lowly Slave of God , not with the origin of His Person
The compound title 'Jesus Christ, the Son of God' denotes the Lord's humanity as Jesus Christ and His deity as the Son of God
Although we realize that the word gospel means glad tidings, we need to consider more fully what the gospel actually is
Because man failed to do this, the third dispensation-human government-came as the replacement of the second dispensation
After the flood God required that man would come under the control of human government because he failed to live according to his conscience
The fourth dispensation began with God's calling of Abraham out of the fallen, corrupted, and rebellious human race
Concerning the coming of Christ, John 1:17 says, 'For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ'
The dispensation of grace will last until the Lord's second coming, at which time He will set up the kingdom on earth
There will be a new universe with a new heaven and a new earth and with the New Jerusalem as its center for eternity
As we have indicated, some Bible teachers prefer to say that in the Scriptures there are four major dispensations
According to this understanding the second dispensation, covering the time from Moses to Christ, is the dispensation of the law
The third dispensation is the dispensation of grace, lasting from Christ's first coming until His second coming
We have the promise that Abraham's seed would be a great blessing to all mankind, for all nations would be blessed through his seed
He does not say, And to the seeds, as concerning many, but as concerning one, And to your seed, who is Christ'
According to the book of Revelation, this serpent, the Devil, Satan, will be bound and cast into the abyss during the millennium
Rarely do today's gospel preachers point out that the seed of the woman in Genesis 3:15 is for the destruction of the serpent
In John 3:14 the Lord said that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so the Son of Man would be lifted up
As the seed of woman the Lord accomplished the destruction of the poisonous serpent by which mankind has been bitten and poisoned
Whereas the seed of woman is for the destruction of the serpent, the seed of Abraham is for the blessing of God to be brought to us
After the promises, we have the custody of the law, and during the period of this custody God gave prophecies to confirm the promises
In Isaiah 714 we have a prophecy that confirms this promise Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Immanuel
Next He decreed the law for the preservation of His chosen people, and then He sent prophets to utter prophecies to confirm the promises
We use the word 'initiated' not in the sense of originating something, but in the sense of ushering someone into a new sphere
The gospel is the fulfillment of the promises and prophecies concerning the unique seed, the seed of woman and the seed of Abraham
Now we are no longer dependent on the Old Testament promises, the law, and the prophecies, for Christ, the unique seed, has come
As the fulfillment of the promises, He is also the fulfillment of the prophecies, which were given to confirm the promises
The unique seed is the fulfillment of the promises and the prophecies and the removal of the custody of the law
The seed of woman has destroyed the serpent, and the seed of Abraham has brought in the blessing of the Triune God
On the one hand James preached Christ on the other hand he still kept the believers under the law in the old fold which God had given up
We need to be impressed with the fact that in the gospel we no longer have the dispensation of the law, the promises, and the prophecies
No longer did they have the promises, the prophecies or the law; they had the Lord Jesus as the seed of woman and as the seed of Abraham
Other types in the Old Testament are the Passover lamb the manna in the wilderness the cleft rock with the flowing river and the tabernacle
John the Baptist, the forerunner of the Lord Jesus, pointed to Him and said, 'Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world'!
In this message we shall continue to consider the beginning of the gospel and the initiation of the Slave-Savior
The beginning of the gospel of the Slave-Savior is even as what is written in Isaiah concerning the ministry of John the Baptist
Not only did the beginning of the gospel start the dispensation of grace, but it also germinated the dispensation of grace
The use of the word 'wilderness' here indicates that the new way of God's New Testament economy is against religion and culture
Verse 4 says, 'John the baptizer came in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins'
Verse 6 says, 'John was clothed in camel's hair and had a leather girdle around his loins; and he ate locusts and wild honey'
As a priest, John, according to the regulations of the law should have worn the priestly garment, which was made mainly of fine linen
He also should have eaten priestly food, which was composed mainly of fine flour and the meat of the sacrifices offered to God by His people
His commission was to introduce God's New Testament economy, which is constituted solely of Christ and the Spirit of life
When John came out in an uncultured and unreligious way announcing repentance, that was the beginning of the gospel
The dispensation of law ended with the coming of John the Baptist, and the dispensation of grace began also with him
Some say that this dispensation began at the day of Pentecost and others claim that it began with the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ
The paths are all the minor, inner sections of our being: thoughts, likes and dislikes, intentions, desires, decisions
The gospel is not merely an objective matter, for the gospel is actually Jesus Christ Himself as the embodiment of the living God
If we preach the gospel properly, eventually the way will be prepared for Christ to come into people and occupy them
When they repented through John's preaching, John immersed them into the death-water to bury them, to terminate them
In this way he prepared them to be raised up by the germinating of the SlaveSavior with the Holy Spirit through the confession of their sins
To be baptized in water is to be put into death and buried, and to be raised up from the water means to be resurrected from death
Although John preached a baptism of repentance, the goal of his ministry was a wonderful Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God
According to 1:8, John the Baptist said, 'I baptized you in water, but He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit'
The first was a sign of John's ministry of repentance; the latter, a sign of the Slave-Savior's ministry of life
The Holy Spirit, into whom the Slave-Savior baptized those who believed in Him, is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God
Mark 1:9 says, 'And it came about in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John'
By being baptized He lived and ministered in resurrection even before His actual death and resurrection three and a half years later
Since the baptism of John was the baptism of repentance, some may wonder why it was necessary for the Lord Jesus to be baptized by him
Even if someone is not wrong, he would still need to repent, to change his mind and no longer do things by himself or be someone in himself
If we realize this we shall see that the Lords coming to be baptized indicates that He did not want to live act speak or work by Himself
The Lords baptism indicates that He would not live speak or do anything by Himself but would live by God walk by God and minister by God
The Lord's baptism was the first step of His initiation into His gospel service, which is the ministry of the gospel
Mark's record of a Slave does not reflect the splendor of the status of this Slave's Person, but reflects the diligence of His service
By the Spirit of God descending upon Him as a dove the Lord Jesus ministered in gentleness and singleness focusing solely on the will of God
While the descending of the Spirit is the anointing of Christ, the speaking of the Father is a testimony of Him as the beloved Son
Is a picture of the divine Trinity the Son went up from the water the Spirit descended upon the Son and the Father spoke concerning the Son
The beasts of the earth, in a negative sense, and the angels from heaven, in a positive sense, were also used for this test
In the foregoing messages we have considered the beginning of the gospel and the initiation of the Slave-Savior
We have seen that the Slave-Savior was initiated into His ministry by two steps-the steps of baptism and testing
In 1:14-10:52 the Slave-Savior carries out the ministry into which He has been initiated, a ministry that is for the spreading of the gospel
Both the fulfillment of the promises, prophecies, and types and the removal of the law are a living Person, Jesus Christ
Now that we have seen what the gospel is, we need to go on to consider the contents of the gospel service revealed in 1:14-45
In simple terms, the contents of the Slave-Savior's gospel service are preaching, teaching, casting out demons, healing, and cleansing
It is possible to read 1:14-45 a number of times without realizing that these verses portray the contents of the gospel service
The gospel service was initiated by the ministry of the Slave-Savior's forerunner in Judea, the region of honor
It continued by the ministry of the Slave-Savior in Galilee, the despised region, for a period of about three years
Mark narrates nothing of the Slave-Savior's ministry in Jerusalem and Judea during this time, as John does in his Gospel
The reason for this is that they have not developed the skill to teach the gospel, although they have the burden to preach the gospel
Regarding our need to develop the skill of teaching the gospel, certain meetings of the church should be like a class for instruction
It is very difficult to be an elder in a local church because an elder must be able to do a number of different things
Since the church is the restaurant, an elder must know how to prepare nourishing spiritual food for the saints
Since the church is a hospital, an elder must learn to care for the brothers and sisters as a spiritual doctor
Since the church is a gymnasium an elder should know how to be a coach training the members of the team in their spiritual exercise together
The reason for this lack of effectiveness or fruitfulness is that the preaching of some saints is lacking in content
Of arguing and denying that we are heretical and cultic, you should take the opportunity to give this one a 'diamond' of the truth
The right way to deal with those who accuse us of being heretical or cultic is to share with them the precious truths of the Word of God
If you argue with someone, denying the false accusation that we are a cult, you may fail to give away any 'diamonds'
Although this number is actually quite small consider what the effect would be if all the saints were trained to report the truth day by day
Even though our society may emphasize the importance of education, people are still ignorant of the divine truth
They do not know God, they do not know the meaning of human life, and they do not know where they came from or where they are going
As a Slave serving God, the Lord Jesus preached the gospel and taught the truth to the people who were ignorant and were in darkness
We need to be faithful to follow the Lord's steps in the matters of preaching the gospel and teaching the truth
It was such a kingdom of God that had drawn near and that the gospel of the Slave-Savior would bring His believers into
As used in Mark 1:15, the word 'repent' literally means to think differently afterward, that is, to have a change of mind
On the positive side, to repent is to turn to God in every way and in everything for fulfilling His purpose in making mankind
His teaching released the word of light to enlighten those in the darkness of death so that they might receive the light of life
A man with an unclean spirit cried out, and the Lord Jesus rebuked him, saying, 'Be quiet, and come out of him'!
The fallen angels worked with Satan in the air , and these demons, the unclean spirits, move with him on the earth
For His gospel service, the Slave-Savior had divine authority not only to teach people , but also to cast out demons
Today, in a highly cultured and civilized country like the United States, apparently there no longer are cases of demon possession
In order to do this, we must learn how to pray to receive the power, even the authority, to cast out the possessing element
We need the power to cast out the satanic element used by the enemy to possess people in today's modern countries
If we do this, then in our preaching and teaching there will be power and authority to cast out the evil possessing element of the enemy
Verse 30 says, 'And Simon's mother-in-law was lying down with a fever, and immediately they tell Him about her'
Because every fallen person is spiritually sick we in the local churches must learn to preach the gospel and teach the truth like physicians
In our teaching and preaching we should give people a heavenly prescription, a divine medicine for their healing
All the saints among us should learn how to preach the gospel and teach the truth in such a way that people are healed
As we are teaching and preaching, we should give others an injection of spiritual medicine that will heal them
The Slave-Savior did not do the evangelical service by Himself independent of God or according to His own will
Rather, He carried out this service according to God's will and pleasure by being one with God to fulfill His purpose
Verse 40 says, 'And a leper comes to Him, entreating Him, and falling on his knees says to Him, If You are willing, You can cleanse me'!
Leprosy is the most contaminating and damaging disease, much more serious than fever , isolating its victim both from God and from men
The Slave-Savior's compassion and willingness issuing from His love were dear and precious to the hopeless leper
Leprosy not only requires healing as do other diseases it also requires cleansing like sin because of its filthy and contaminating nature
They may be saved in the sense of receiving the forgiveness of sin, but they may not be cleansed from the contaminating nature of sin
We need to seriously consider the fact that this picture of the Lord's gospel service concludes with the cleansing of the leper
We see that man's activity according to the natural concept frustrates the Slave-Savior's service according to God's purpose
For this reason, we may read Mark a number of times and still not be able to make an outline of this book or divide it into sections
The Lord cared for their need so that they might be rescued from their captivity and brought back to the God of enjoyment
He did this as God with divine authority so that He might release the sick one from Satan's oppression and restore him to God
He caused His followers to be merry and happy without fasting, as a bridegroom with the sons of the bridechamber
He allowed His followers to pick the ears of grain in the grainfields on the Sabbath that they might satisfy their hunger
He indicated that in God's New Testament economy it is not a matter of keeping regulations but of imparting life
We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that chapter one of the Gospel of Mark is concerned with the gospel
Having seen the contents of the gospel service in chapter one, we need to see the ways of carrying out the gospel service in 2:1-3:6
The five incidents recorded in 2136 may be taken merely as stories stories used in childrens meeting or for reading to children at bedtime
In no other chapter of the Scriptures do we have such a full display of the gospel as we have in chapter one of Mark
Let us now go on to consider the first incident related to this, the incident of forgiving the sins of the sick
In carrying out the gospel service, the first thing we must do is to show people how they may have their sins forgiven
Because all the problems of mankind are the result of sin, sin must be dealt with if people are to be restored to God
Many of us can testify that in the past we tried our best to get a good education so that we might have a promising future
They were blinded by their traditional religion from seeing Him in God's economy, and they plotted to kill Him
They did not realize that the One who forgave the sins of the paralytic was actually the forgiving God incarnated in the form of a lowly man
A striking point in the Gospel of Mark is that this Gospel presents the Lord in the likeness of man and in the form of a slave
The Lord's word to the sick man to rise, pick up his bed, and go home was not a word of teaching; it was a word of authority
In this case we see the Lord's humanity displayed in its virtue and perfection and His deity manifested in its glory and honor
When the paralytic picked up his bed and walked away, the mouths of the opposers, the scribes and the Pharisees, were shut
According to the incident in 2:1-12, the first thing we must learn in our preaching of the gospel is to help others have their sins forgiven
Another way to help people experience the forgiveness of sins is to read Mark 2:1-12 with them in a living way
Verse 14 says, 'And passing by, He saw Levi the son of Alpheus, sitting at the tax office, and He says to him, Follow Me!
Even though Matthew was a tax collector, he was called by the Slave-Savior and later chosen and appointed as one of the twelve apostles
There must have been some attracting power with the Lord, either in His word or appearance, that caused Matthew to follow Him
To believe in the Lord is to be saved , and to follow Him is to enter the narrow gate and walk the constricted way
Soon afterward, the Lord called James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in a boat mending nets
The Lord saw Levi, or Matthew, at the tax office and told him to follow Him, and Matthew simply rose up and followed Him
If we had been invited to such a feast, we probably would have declined the invitation, not wanting to feast with such people
If we read the Gospel of Mark carefully, we shall realize that the scribes followed the Lord like spies wherever He went
In verse 16 the scribes were self-righteous in condemning the Slave-Savior for His feasting with tax collectors and sinners
The scribes' word to the Lord's disciples indicates that, in their self-righteousness, they did not know the grace of God
The judgment of a judge is according to righteousness, whereas the healing of a physician is according to mercy and grace
In carrying out the service of the gospel, the Lord Jesus first forgives our sins and then brings us into the enjoyment of God
Many of us can testify that when we recall our experience of salvation, we can still taste the joy we experienced
The cleansing of the leper in 1:40-45 signifies the recovering of a sinner to fellowship with God and with men
The case of the leper was much more serious than that of Peter's mother-in-law, for she did not need cleansing, but needed only healing
The third case of sickness in Marks Gospel is the case of the paralytic the case of a man who was disabled as the result of being paralyzed
The cases of Peter's mother-in-law and the paralytic indicate that men are disabled by sin and that women have a fever because of sin
These three cases reveal that the Slave-Savior serves those who are sick with a fever, those who are paralyzed, and those who are lepers
In 2:1-12 we have a case of the forgiveness of sins by the Son of Man, who was the forgiving God incarnated in the form of a Slave
The first basic factor is the Bridegroom: 'Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?
The fourth incident, recorded in 2:23-28, is that of the Lord's caring for His followers' hunger rather than for religion's regulation
Because we are satisfied, we can testify, 'We don't care to keep the regulations of religion and remain hungry
Let us review the five words used to describe these five incidents: forgiveness, enjoyment, joy, satisfaction, and freedom
According to the historical sequence recorded in Mark, first we have forgiveness and then enjoyment, joy, satisfaction, and freedom
These five events took place under the Lord's sovereignty according to the actual sequence of the enjoyment of His salvation
We can testify from our experience of the Lord's salvation that when we have the forgiveness of sins we also have enjoyment and joy
As we consider the sequence of these five incidents in the Gospel of Mark, we realize once again that the Bible truly is the Word of God
Apart from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, no human being could compose such a writing as we have in the Gospel of Mark
To be sure, the Greek in the Gospel of Mark is not as high as that in the Gospel of Luke or in the Epistles of Paul
They come and say to Him, Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast'?
In contrast to the disciples of John and the Pharisees, who were fasting, the Lord's disciples were full of joy
In 2:19 the Lord said to the disciples of John and the Pharisees, 'Can the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?
The Lord seems to be saying to the disciples of John and the Pharisees, 'Why do you ask Me why My disciples are not fasting?
In the second chapter of the Gospel of Mark we see that even those who were tax collectors and sinners became sons of the bridechamber
When the Lord heard this, He said to the scribes, 'Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are sick
It was necessary for them to fast because, as far as they were concerned, the Messiah and the kingdom had not yet come
The Lord answered the disciples of John and the Pharisees not in a direct way but by using certain figures of speech
The Lord seemed to be saying, 'Why should My disciples fast when they have everything they need to make them joyful?
They have Me as the Bridegroom, and they have Me as their righteousness, their new cloth, and also as their life, their new wine
The Greek word is agnaphos, formed with a-, which means not, and gnapto, which means to card or comb wool; hence, to dress or full the cloth
The old garment here signifies man's good behavior, good deeds, and religious practices by his natural life, the life of the old creation
If a patch made of unshrunk cloth is sewn on an old garment, it will take away from it, the new from the old, and the tear will become worse
To imitate what the Lord Jesus did in His human life on earth can be compared to putting a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment
We should take the crucified and resurrected Christ as our new garment to cover us as our righteousness before God
Of trying to put Christ into different religious rituals and formalities, we should put the new wine into fresh wineskins
The Greek word for fresh here is kainos, which means new in nature, quality, or form; unaccustomed, unused; hence, fresh
The fresh wineskins signify the church life as the container of the new wine, which is Christ Himself as the exciting life
What we have today is not fasting or other religious practices; instead, we have the church life with Christ as our content
He, as the Shepherd, led all of His followers, His sheep, into the grainfields, and those fields became their pasture
According to their meager knowledge, they cared for the ritual of keeping the Sabbath, not for the hunger of the people
The Pharisees said that it was not lawful for the Lord's disciples to pick the ears in the grainfields and eat
Have you not read how David entered into the house of God, ate the bread of the presence, and also gave it to those who were with him?
Although they were regarded as Bible scholars, they knew the Scriptures only in a superficial way and in the way of doctrine in dead letters
Now the real David and His followers were also rejected and took action to eat, seemingly against the sabbatical regulation
In 2:27 the Lord went on to say to the Pharisees, 'The Sabbath came into being for man's sake, and not man for the Sabbath's sake'
He, the Son of Man, was the very God who ordained the Sabbath, and He had the right to change what He had ordained concerning the Sabbath
His use of the word 'even' here implies that He is not merely the Lord of one thing, but the Lord of everything, including the Sabbath
The Lord's word implies and indicates that He is the almighty God, the very One who ordained the Sabbath in Genesis 2
We have the last incident of the five recorded in 2:1-3:6, the case of the healing of a man with a withered hand
Sabbath or no Sabbath, the Lord is interested in healing the members of His Body who are in need, even healing the members who are dead
The first instance of breaking the Sabbath took place in the grainfields; the second took place in a synagogue
In verse 4 the Lord said to those in the synagogue, 'Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill'?
According to this picture, the Lord's salvation includes forgiveness, enjoyment, joy, satisfaction, and freedom
By stretching out his hand, the man took the Lord's life-giving word, and his withered hand was restored by the life in His word
In this message and in the message following we shall consider these auxiliary acts for the Slave-Savior's gospel service
In carrying out a ministry which God has commissioned to us, we shall face problems, opposition, and frustration
A crowd, a multitude, for the most part may help us to have a movement, but it does not help the ministry in life
In this portion of the Gospel of Mark the word 'press' is used in a negative sense, whereas the word 'touch' has a positive meaning
Today the Lord is ministering His life to those in the church; He is also ministering from within the church to others
The facts of history indicate that a great crowd causes a loss, not a benefit, to the genuine ministry of life
When the crowd followed Him, He asked that a little boat be made ready in order that He might go away from the crowd that pressed upon Him
As we avoid the crowd, we need to allow others to contact us, to touch us, directly in order to receive the genuine ministry of life
Mark 3:11 and 12 say, 'And the unclean spirits, when they beheld Him, fell before Him and cried out, saying, You are the Son of God!
We have seen that the Slave-Savior first needed the sea and then a little boat to avert the pressing of the crowd
In order to avoid the pressing of the crowd, He went to the sea, where He ministered to the sincere ones who touched Him directly
We see that the Lord's purpose in going up into the mountain was to call certain ones and to make them His apostles
When it became day, He called His disciples to Him; and He chose from them twelve, whom He also named apostles'
Two of them, James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, were given the name Boanerges, which means sons of thunder
As we consider what brothers may bear the eldership in a local church, it may seem to us that no one is qualified
We need to learn from the Lord that the natural view is different from the view that is according to spiritual insight
If we have a natural view of the saints in the church life, we may feel that we are the only ones qualified to do certain things
One of the Lord's auxiliary acts in carrying out His ministry was to select certain unqualified ones to be His apostles
Not long after the Lord Jesus was crucified and resurrected, Peter could stand up on the day of Pentecost as a leading apostle
It is very important for us to learn not to view the Lord's ministry or the church according to the natural concept
We have seen that the Lord Jesus turned from the crowd and then asked for a little boat to be made ready for Him
Mark 3:20 and 21 say, 'And He comes into a house; and a crowd comes together again, so that they could not even eat bread
There seems to be a contradiction between the Lord's behavior in averting the crowd in 3:7-12 and His behavior in 3:20-21
When the Lord's relatives heard of the situation, they went out to lay hold of Him, saying that He was beside Himself
In this message we shall consider the last two-the binding of Satan and the Lord's not remaining in the relationship of the natural life
Verse 22 says, 'And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and by the ruler of the demons He casts out the demons'
It was changed in contempt by the Jews to Baalzebel, which means lord of the dunghill, and was used for the ruler of the demons
We need to remember that the door for such a defamation was opened by the word of the Lords relatives their word that He was beside Himself
From this we see that it is possible for our relatives' natural love for us to open the door for Satan to come in
He has his authority and his angels , who are his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world
In Mark 3:26 the Lord points out that if 'Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand, but has an end'
If we did not have the Lord's word recorded in verse 27, we would not realize that when we preach the gospel we should plunder Satan's house
His concept is that the preaching of the gospel to save sinners is the plundering of Satan's house to release his captives
When Paul was called by God to preach the gospel, he was told to turn people from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God
Today when we preach the gospel to sinners we also should turn them Satans captives from the authority of darkness unto God and His kingdom
In particular, by the Holy Spirit He preached the gospel in order to plunder Satan's house and destroy his kingdom
The gospel service is not only a matter of preaching; the gospel service also involves fighting and plundering
From the Lord's auxiliary act here we realize our need to be empowered by the Holy Spirit in order to preach the gospel
Mark 3:31 and 32 say, 'And His mother and His brothers came, and standing outside they sent to Him, calling Him
A crowd sat around Him, and they said to Him, Behold, your mother and your brothers and your sisters are outside seeking you'
After the opposers blasphemy instigated by Satan the relatives of the SlaveSavior came again to trouble Him by their natural concern for Him
In order to defeat the evil one's schemes and fulfill His gospel service, He would not remain in the relationship of the natural life
Whoever does the will of His Father is His brother for helping, His sister for sympathizing, and His mother for tenderly loving
Here the Lord Jesus denied His natural relationship with His mother and said that the one who does the will of God is His mother
From this auxiliary act we see that in order to be powerful in God's ministry we need to deny the natural relationships
The greatest entanglement to God's ministry is the natural relationship with father or mother, husband or wife, children or relatives
If we would follow the Lord to have these auxiliary acts today, we should not give ground to natural concepts or relationships
In order to follow the Lord in these matters, everything must be spiritual, divine, holy, and according to God
In particular, we need to be impressed never to consider the Lord's recovery, the Lord's ministry, and the Lord's move in a natural way
These five cases, five incidents, and five acts, happened according to God's sovereignty in an excellent sequence
In this message we come to chapter four of the Gospel of Mark, a crucial chapter concerning the kingdom of God
Although we see in these three sections a complete view concerning the gospel, we do not see the intrinsic essence of the gospel
In 1:15 we have the first utterance of the Lord Jesus in His gospel preaching: 'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near
In order to have such an expression, God needs a sphere, and this sphere is a kingdom, a realm where God can exercise His authority
The book of Genesis records the experiences of these patriarchs and of the children of Israel and their sojourn in Egypt
As we study the Old Testament, we see that God was not able to accomplish His purpose with Adam, Noah, or the nation of Israel
Although the kingdom of God was expressed in the kingdom of Israel, God was not able to reach His goal through the children of Israel
Not being able to fulfill His purpose through the first Adam and his descendants, God came through incarnation as the last Adam
The Lord declared that the kingdom of God had drawn near and that people must repent in order to enter into the kingdom
Those who repent because the kingdom of God has drawn near will be able to participate in the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose
When the Lord Jesus preached the gospel, He spoke concerning the kingdom of God, and He told them to repent for the kingdom
The Lord said, 'I will build My church,' and then, 'I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens'
These teachers go on to say that after the Lord and the kingdom were rejected, the Lord suspended the kingdom and began to build the church
In the Life-study of Matthew we pointed out that at the end of Matthew 13 the rejection of the Lord Jesus by the Jews was complete
We see that during the forty days between His resurrection and ascension, the Lord spoke to His disciples concerning the kingdom
Acts 28:23 and 31 say that Paul 'expounded and solemnly testified the kingdom of God' and was 'proclaiming the kingdom of God'
We should not reject the weaker ones regarding the matter of eating, because the kingdom of God is not a matter of food and drink
In Galatians 5:21 Paul says that those who practice the works of the flesh will not inherit the kingdom of God
Going to heaven' would be a matter in the future, whereas entering into the kingdom of God is a matter for the present
If we use the phrase 'kingdom life' along with 'church life,' this may remind us that today we are in the kingdom life
To be in the church life is to be in the kingdom, for the church today is the kingdom, and the kingdom is the reality of the church life
Concerning this, 4:2 and 3 say, 'And He taught them many things in parables, and said to them in His teaching: Listen!
When we speak of the seed of the gospel, we mean that this seed is the gospel, just as a carnation seed is a carnation
Our heart is the field, the soil, into which the Lord Jesus has sown Himself as the seed of life, which is the seed of the gospel
The time from the Lord's coming forth to preach the gospel until the day of Pentecost was less than four years
The seed continued to grow and develop until the day of Pentecost when the kingdom was clearly present with Peter and the one hundred twenty
Apparently, the gospel is a matter of preaching, teaching, casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing the lepers
Whenever a person receives the gospel, he receives God incarnate as the intrinsic element, the seed, of the gospel
In the Godhead, they claim, there are three separate Persons, and these separate Persons are the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Those who claim that the Son is in us but not the Father say that whereas the Son lives in us, the Father is on the throne in the heavens
In the case of the forgiving of the sins of the paralytic recorded in Mark 2, we see the Triune God in humanity
In order for us to contact Him today, there is no need for anyone to break through the roof as the zealous ones did in Mark 2
Because the God-man as the gene of the kingdom has been sown into us, we spontaneously love one another and enjoy marvelous fellowship
We may say that the church in the Lord's recovery is the real melting pot of the different races, nationalities, and cultures
Between the issue and goal we have the church life as the continuation of the issue of the marvelous gene that is within us
As we have pointed out, it is not the intention of this Gospel to give us a record of the Slave-Savior's words or teaching
If we compare chapter four of Mark with chapter thirteen of Matthew, we shall see that Mark 4 is much shorter than Matthew 13
We need to be impressed with the fact that the kingdom of God is not a matter of teaching, activity, or organization
The kingdom of God is the Triune God in His incarnation sown into His chosen people to grow and develop in them into a kingdom
In this brief definition of the kingdom we have a statement of the intrinsic element of the entire teaching of the New Testament
When this man, Jesus Christ, began to preach the gospel and teach the truth, He was sowing Himself into others
His preaching of the gospel and His teaching of the truth were actually a sowing of Himself into those who heard Him
When those who had been chosen by God heard His word and received it, they received the seed, the gene, of the kingdom
In the Gospels we do have some spreading, first from one Sower to twelve sowers and then from twelve sowers to seventy sowers
According to 2 Peter 1:3, God's 'divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness'
Those who are the firstfruit spoken of in Revelation 14 will be among those who will be co-kings with Christ in the millennium
From God's point of view, the thousand years of the millennium will simply be one day for Him to display His wonderful kingdom
All the rebellious element that is in the fallen humanity of these co-kings will have been swallowed up by the kingdom gene
In 1 and 2 Corinthians Paul speaks of the growth and transformation we are experiencing today in the church life
In 1 and 2 Corinthians we have one chapter concerned with the growth in life and another chapter concerned with the transformation of life
All those who throughout the centuries have received the gene will become kings through the development of the gene within them
That full development of the kingdom gene will be an exhibition to the nations, to the angels, and to the Devil, Satan
We need to read chapter four of the Gospel of Mark in the light of what we have seen concerning the gene of the kingdom
God's economy concerning His kingdom was a hidden mystery, which has been unveiled to the disciples of the Slave-Savior
In verses 21 and 22 the Lord says, 'Does the lamp come that it should be placed under the bushel or under the bed?
For nothing is hidden except that it may be manifested, nor has become concealed but that it should become manifest'
The kingdom of God is the reality of the church brought forth by the resurrection life of Christ through the gospel
Mark 4:27 goes on to say, 'And sleep and rise night and day, and the seed sprouts and lengthens-how, he does not know'
The words 'sleep and rise night and day' and 'how, he does not know,' should not be applied to the Slave-Savior
The earth here is the good earth and signifies the good heart created by God for His divine life to grow in man
Verse 29 concludes, 'But when the fruit permits, immediately he sends forth the sickle, because the harvest has come'
In verses 30 through 32 the Lord says, 'How shall we liken the kingdom of God, or in what parable shall we put it?
In Matthew 13:31 and 32 we see that the grain of mustard seed not only becomes greater than all the herbs, but eventually becomes a tree
The parable of the mustard seed corresponds to the third of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the church in Pergamos
The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard, sojourning on the earth
According to verse 15, this indicates that Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown into certain ones
In the foregoing messages we have covered the kingdom of God as revealed in chapter four of the Gospel of Mark
If we read the New Testament carefully and properly, we shall see the importance of the church and the kingdom
John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, 'Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
Receiving a revelation from the Father, Simon Peter answered and said, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God'
The 'rock' here is not merely Christ Himself; it is also the realization, knowledge, experience, and possession of Christ
If we do not realize Christ in our experience, we shall not have the foundation for the building of the church
Our knowing, experiencing, enjoying, and possessing of Christ will be the foundation upon which He will build the church
The Lord's word to Peter in Matthew 16:19 regarding the keys of the kingdom of the heavens was fulfilled in the book of Acts
In the house of Cornelius, as recorded in chapter ten of Acts, Peter used the second key to open the door for the Gentiles to come in
We need to be impressed with the fact that in Matthew 16:18 we have the church and then in the following verse we have the kingdom
Although the church is clearly mentioned in Matthew 16, nothing is said concerning the church in the Gospel of Mark
As a help in answering the question concerning where the church is in 4:26-29, we may consider Paul's word about God's farm
In the Epistles this seed grows and develops, and, eventually, in the book of Revelation, there will be a harvest
There is only one kingdom, the unique kingdom of God, and the kingdom of the heavens is part of this unique kingdom
When the saints, the plants, reach maturity, they will be qualified to be kings with Christ in the kingdom of God
In 1 Corinthians 1:2 we have the church, for this Epistle is addressed to 'the church of God which is in Corinth'
Chapter four of Mark is a wonderful chapter concerned with the seed, the gene, of the kingdom and its full development
Perhaps you are wondering how the last part of chapter four fits in with 4:1-34, in which we have the parables of the kingdom
Immediately after the Slave-Savior spoke a strong word on the kingdom of God, He said to His disciples, 'Let us pass over to the other side
Because of this 'a great windstorm came, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already filling'
The SlaveSavior was sleeping and resting in the boat beaten by the windstorm but at the same time the disciples were threatened by the storm
As long as the disciples had Him with them in their boat they should, by faith in Him , share His rest and enjoy His peace
Because of their fear, they awakened the sleeping Slave-Savior and said to Him, 'Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing'?
While the disciples were following Him, the Slave-Savior, as a Man with divine authority, controlled the storm that threatened them
The Lord rebuked the wind and commanded the sea to be silent because of the rebellious angels and demons that were behind the scene
Between the word concerning the kingdom and the carrying out of the kingdom, there is the incident of the stormy sea
Mark 4:41 says that the disciples 'feared greatly and said to one another, Who then is this, that both the wind and the sea obey Him'?
Because the rebellion was subdued, the Slave-Savior and His disciples 'came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes'
Mark 5:2 says, 'And when He came out of the boat, immediately there met Him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit'
As soon as the Lord Jesus came into the country of the Gerasenes, the situation there was exposed to Him and His disciples
There was a man possessed by a legion of demons, and the people in that country were in the business of raising hogs
Whenever human beings are occupied by demons, they will be engaged in some form of unclean business or industry
If there had been only twenty demons, each demon would have had to cause a hundred hogs to rush down the slope into the sea
In 5:21-43 we have the record of the healing of a woman with a flow of blood and the raising up of a dead girl
In this record also of the miraculous deeds of the Slave of God in His gospel service, Mark gives us more details than Matthew
When his death-sickness of sin is dealt with by the Savior's redeeming death , he rises up out of death into life
Immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she knew in her body that she was cured from the plague'
And immediately, Jesus realizing in Himself that power had gone out of Him, turned around in the crowd and said, Who touched My garments'?
The Lord had the inner sense that His virtue, His power, had gone out of Him and had been transfused into someone else
The disciples being natural and seeing the crowd pressing upon Him said You see the crowd pressing upon You and You say Who touched Me
By such a touch His divine power was transfused into the touching one through the perfection of His humanity and became her healing
God, who dwells in unapproachable light, became touchable in Him through His humanity for her salvation and enjoyment
In verse 34 the Lord said to the woman, 'Daughter, your faith has healed you; go in peace and be well from your plague'
If you consider today's society, you will realize that with every sinful person there is the illness of the leaking out of the life essence
The whole world is involved in the industry of hog raising because the world is under the control of legions of possessing demons
In addition, all fallen people are dying; that is, they are suffering from the leaking out of the life essence
These certainly are characteristics of today's human society: rebellion, demon possession with hog raising, and the leaking out of life
We have seen that the record in 5:21-43 merges the case of the woman with the flow of blood with that of the ruler's daughter
The healing of the woman and the raising up of the girl are a picture of our experience in receiving the gospel
When the gospel came to us, we heard it, we received it, and we were healed of the disease of the leaking out of the life essence
We are glad to testify that the Lord Jesus has dealt with the rebellion, with the 'stormy sea,' in our environment
Even though He left them because of their rejection of Him, this does not mean that He was disappointed or that He gave them up
Mark 6:5 says, 'And He could not do any work of power there, except to lay His hands upon a few sick people and heal them'
The rejection of the Jews in His country did not disappoint Him; rather, that rejection encouraged Him to send out His disciples
Human society and every individual human being as well is full of storms of rebellion demons unclean industry deathsickness and death
Of being disappointed, we should be encouraged by the negative attitude shown by the worldly people toward the gospel
Immediately after the Lord did the wonderful work of bringing in the blessings of the kingdom, He came to His own country
The Lord Jesus then said to them, 'A prophet is not dishonored except in his own country and among his relatives and in his own house'
In His deity He was the Branch of Jehovah for beauty and glory , the Son of God marked out in power according to the Spirit
My silence was an indication that we are not concerned about how many of the church members have a doctoral degree
Neither do they have much of the riches of Christ or the knowledge of the depths of the truths in the Word of God
No matter how rich He was or how much He knew the truth in the holy Scriptures, He was despised and rejected instead of welcomed
Although the Lord has shown us something of the depths of the divine truth in the Word, we in the Lord's recovery are not welcomed
Often those who have only a superficial knowledge of biblical truth take the lead to reject us and oppose what we are presenting
One of these false accusations is that we are pantheistic, that we believe that everything in the universe is God
We see that the twelve were sent out to do three things: preach, cast out demons, and anoint the sick and heal them
We need to present the truth not only of the growth in life and of transformation by life, but even the truth of initial salvation
They have not heard that genuine sanctification has two aspects: the positional aspect and the dispositional aspect
We can testify that every truth that the Lord has shown us from the Word is a useful medicine to kill these germs
As they take in this healthy food, they will receive the medicine they need to deal with the germs within them
You may say to a fellow believer, 'Do you realize that according to the New Testament sanctification has two aspects?
We have seen that all those in the Lord's recovery should go forth to preach the gospel, present the truth, and minister life
Now we need to go on to see that to minister life to others is equal to anointing the sick with oil and healing them
The real need today is not the outward laying on of hands, as practiced among many in the charismatic or Pentecostal movement
You may testify how you have been saved and captured by the Lord how the Lord satisfies you and how you experience and enjoy Him day by day
In the foregoing message we saw that in 616 the SlaveSavior was despised by the Nazarenes and that in 6713 He sent out the twelve to preach
As a result of hatred, darkness, and the indulgence in lust, the righteous and holy forerunner of the gospel was put to death
His expression of compassion exhibited the Slave-Savior's virtue in His humanity, which was carried out by the power of His deity
When the disciples suggested to the Lord that He send the crowd away, He answered, 'You give them something to eat'
When we present what we have to Him, He will pour out the blessing, bestowing His unlimited blessing on what we present to Him
We should not be bothered or disappointed by the fact that the number of those in the Lord's recovery in this country is still rather small
We should not be frightened by the fact that it is our destiny to be rejected, hated, imprisoned, and even martyred
Of discouraging us from taking the Lord's way in His recovery, this should encourage us to present what we have to the Lord
According to the second picture, we shall be despised and experience rejection, hatred, injustice, and martyrdom
After the martyrdom of the forerunner of the gospel, the Lord gained the five thousand, fed them, and satisfied them
The Slave-Savior did not do this gospel service by Himself as one independent of God and according to His own will
Rather, He carried out the gospel service according to God's will and pleasure by being one with God to fulfill His purpose
In Mark we have a record that is according to the sequence of events that took place in the life of the Lord Jesus
All of a sudden, certain religious 'spies,' certain Pharisees and scribes, 'gathered together to Him when they had come from Jerusalem'
Verses 3 and 4 explain that the Pharisees, holding the tradition of the elders, do not eat unless they carefully wash their hands
The things that took place before chapter seven are related to man's outward situation, not to his inward condition
The Lord Jesus exposed man's inward situation not only to the Pharisees and scribes, but also to the crowd and especially to His disciples
Concerning this, in chapter seven of the Gospel of Mark we have an important step in the Slave-Savior's gospel service
The Pharisees and scribes, as opposers, provided the Lord an excellent opportunity to touch the inward condition of fallen man
If we had been among the followers of the Slave-Savior at that time, we certainly would have been happy about the situation
These trained, professional spies thought they had ground to accuse the Lord Jesus in the matter of eating with unwashed hands
On the other hand, as indicated by the record in chapter seven, He was frank with the professional opposers, calling them hypocrites
In verses 8 and 9 the Lord went on to say to them, 'Leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men
By this we see that the Pharisees and scribes were wrong not only in the worship of God, but even in the way they dealt with their parents
Concerning the matter of honoring father and mother, they invalidated the commandment of God through the keeping of their tradition
The word 'corban' in verse 11 is from the Hebrew word qorban, an offering, a gift, signifying anything offered to God
The Lord rebuked the Pharisees and scribes for being wrong in the matter of honoring their parents and taking care of them
They actually taught others to neglect to honor their parents, and in so doing they invalidated the commandments of God
After the Pharisees and scribes disappeared, the Lord called the crowd to Him again and said to them, 'Hear Me, all of you, and understand
Verse 17 says, 'And when He entered into a house from the crowd, His disciples questioned Him concerning the parable'
We need to see from the Lord's word in chapter seven of the Gospel of Mark what our inward condition really is
Not only do evil things come out of man's heart; they continually proceed out from his heart, coming forth one after another
In particular, the two evil things-fornication and theft-are crouching behind us, waiting for an opportunity to ruin us
Throughout the centuries, many Christians, including pastors and ministers, have fallen into the snare of fornication
It is a fact that evil reasonings proceed out of man's heart, and these reasonings are related to fornication and theft
It is very significant that in chapter seven of Mark the Slave-Savior in His gospel service touches the inward condition of man
We should remember that the Lord's word in 7:21-23 is a word uttered not to the crowd but to His intimate followers
In 7:22 the Lord goes on to speak of wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, a wicked eye, blasphemy, arrogance, and foolishness
The thirteen items listed by the Lord are sufficient to describe the actual condition and situation of the heart of fallen man
In the Gospel of Mark we may not find the word 'life,' but in this book we have life in actuality, if not in terminology
In His gospel service the SlaveSavior took the opportunity afforded Him by the opposers to expose analyze and diagnose mans inward condition
Every human being has a heart problem, and the Lord's diagnosis of the condition of man's heart applies to each one of us
Concluding His diagnosis of man's heart, in 7:23 the Lord says, 'All these wicked things proceed from within, and they defile a man'
When worldly people come back to work after the weekend, they often speak about the evil things they have been indulging in
They may be educated and well-mannered, but from within their heart and out of their mouth comes a procession of evil, defiling things
In chapter seven, however, we have only the diagnosis; we do not yet have the dealing with the heart in a positive way
If we study 7:1-23 carefully, we shall see that the Lord's word here actually covers all of the Ten Commandments
The Lord even uses the word 'commandment' in verse 8: 'Leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men'
In verse 13 the Lord speaks of the word of God, pointing out that the religious ones were invalidating the word of God by their tradition
For the Pharisees and scribes to invalidate the word of God meant that they were invalidating the Ten Commandments
It is important for us to see that in this section of the Gospel of Mark the Ten Commandments are covered by the Lord's word
The Lord even says that the Pharisees and scribes 'nicely set aside the commandment of God' so that they could keep their tradition
Whereas the Pharisees and scribes were concerned with the washing of hands, there is no mention of such washing in the Ten Commandments
We have also seen that, in chapter four, the Lord Jesus gave a strong word concerning the intrinsic element of the kingdom of God
Following this, He exercised His authority, the authority of the kingdom, to deal with man's outward situation
In chapter seven there is a turn from the dealing with man's outward situation to the dealing with the inward condition of man's heart
She was a Syrian by tongue, Phoenician by race , and, the Phoenicians being descendants of the Canaanites, a Canaanite woman
He indicated to them that He is the bread of God, the One who 'comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world'
Although a word concerning this was clearly given in John 6, there is not such a word in the synoptic Gospels, in Matthew, Mark, or Luke
What the Lord says concerning the children's bread in verse 27 indicates that He did not come simply to do miracles
Many of those who received benefit from the Lord's ministry did not realize that, as He was ministering to them, He was feeding them
In a similar way, many of today's Christians do not realize that the Lord desires to distribute Himself as bread
In His conversation with this woman, the Lord revealed that what He was doing was not merely the performing of miracles-it was a feeding
Having seen all this, now we need to see in 7:24-30 that the Lord is distributing Himself as the food supply needed by us all
After taking that step, the Lord goes on to indicate that in His gospel service He was not merely doing miracles
The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying to the Syrophoenician woman, 'You think that you need Me to heal your daughter
It is not very difficult for us to understand how the Lord is the Physician, the Bridegroom, and the Emancipator
We know from 7:29 that the Lord Jesus said to the Syrophoenician woman, 'Because of this word, go; the demon has gone out of your daughter'
The crucial point is that in His gospel service the Lord Jesus is distributing Himself to people as their bread, as their inner supply
In chapter seven of the Gospel of Mark the Lord opened Himself to the Syrophoenician woman to let her know that He was her food
In 7:24-30 the Lord takes a further step to cause us to see that if what we have is only inward cleansing, we shall still be empty
In addition to the cleansing of our heart on the negative side, we need the supply of bread on the positive side
Probably after coming into the church life, we learned to enjoy the Lord inwardly as our bread, as our life supply
Mark 7:32 says, 'And they bring to Him one who was deaf and spoke with difficulty, and they entreated Him that He would lay His hand on him'
Many of us can testify that before we enjoyed the Lord's feeding in the church life, it was difficult for us to pray publicly in a meeting
Not only did we not have the proper hearing, the hearing that becomes our speaking; we did not enjoy the Lord as our food
According to the sequence in Mark 7, after the case of the Syrophoenician woman, we have the case of the healing of a deaf and dumb person
If we would receive the particular healing of our ears and tongue, we need the Lord to touch us in a definite way
For the healing of our tongue we need something that proceeds out of the Lord's mouth to be applied to our tongue
We cannot speak, we are dumb, because we lack the Lord's 'spittle,' the essence of the word that proceeds out of His mouth
If we allow the Lord to anoint our tongue with the essence of His word, then our stammering tongue will be able to speak fluently
Mark 8:2 says, 'I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with Me now three days, and they do not have anything to eat'
The Slave-Savior's virtues of compassion, sympathy, and tender care are vividly and sweetly displayed here in His humanity
If we do not listen carefully to God's speaking and if we do not have an anointed tongue, we shall not be able to feed others
Only when we have been healed in a particular way, not merely in a general way, shall we be qualified to feed others
After the feeding of the four thousand the Pharisees came out and began discussing with Him seeking from Him a sign from heaven tempting Him
The leaven of the Pharisees was their hypocrisy , and the leaven of Herod was his corruption and injustice in politics
The Lord warned His disciples to beware of these two kinds of leaven, the Pharisees' leaven of hypocrisy and Herod's leaven of injustice
By taking hold of the blind man's hand the Slave-Savior expressed His intimate and loving care in His humanity for the needy one
The significance of such spitting of the SlaveSavior plus that of His laying on of hands was much richer than the significance of His touch
The Lord's laying His hands on the blind man indicates His identification with him in order to transfuse His healing element into him
At the initial stage of his spiritual recovery, he may see spiritual things like this blind man beholding men as trees walking
Verse 25 says, 'Then again He laid His hands upon his eyes, and he looked intently and was restored, and he saw all things clearly'
In order for the disciples to be brought to the point described in 8:27-9:13, it was necessary for them to pass through a number of steps
From chapter one to chapter eight, Peter and the other faithful followers passed through a number of different steps
It took Him at least two years to bring His followers through all the steps that enabled them to come to this point
They were able to see a wonderful Person, a Person who is the secret of the universe and a mystery to all mankind
In order to see the vision concerning this Person, the disciples had to pass through the steps recorded in the preceding chapters
To the Lord's question the disciples replied, 'John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, one of the prophets'
When Peter made the declaration that Jesus is the Christ, he may not have been very clear concerning this point
He realized something that is very particular concerning the Lord, that He is the Christ, God's anointed One, the Messiah
After Peter made the declaration that Jesus is the Christ, 'He warned them that they should tell no one concerning Him'
We see that after the revelation of the mystery concerning Christ, we have the revelation of the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ
In order for Him to fulfill God's purpose, Christ had to go to the religious center, pass through crucifixion, and enter into resurrection
In verse 31 the Lord opened up some of the mysteries of God's economy concerning Himself as the Christ, the anointed One of God
The Lord said that He would suffer many things, be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and even be killed
It is doubtful, however, that this word concerning the Lord's rising from among the dead made an impression on Peter
Only the Gospel of Mark, neither Matthew nor Luke, gives us this detail concerning Peter's taking the Lord aside
In verse 33 the Lord said specifically that Peter was not setting his mind on the things of God, but on the things of men
If we want to gain the Lord in this way, experiencing Him, enjoying Him, and partaking of Him, we must deny ourselves
In chapter eight of Mark we have a revelation not only concerning the wonderful Person of Christ, but also concerning His marvelous death
When we come to partake of Him, we need to deny ourselves; that is, we need to put ourselves aside and forget ourselves
The Lord's word here concerning His death requires all the Epistles written by the Apostle Paul for its definition
If we do not have an adequate understanding of the Epistles of Paul we shall not be able to understand thoroughly the Lords word in 83437
According to the revelation regarding Christ's death in Paul's Epistles, Christ went through the process of death for God and for us
His allinclusive death dealt with sins our sinful nature the self our flesh the old creation the Devil the world and all the ordinances
Based upon the fact that we have been crucified with Christ , we should deny ourselves, take up our cross, and follow the Lord
In 8:34 the Lord Jesus says, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me'
In the foregoing message we pointed out that to come after the Lord is to gain Him, experience Him, enjoy Him, and partake of Him
Those who have passed through hardships in life and have become strong in their will are extremely difficult to touch
Eventually, when such a person reaches the age of sixty or seventy, he may have become so strong in his will that he cannot be changed
If we do this, we shall realize not that we are suffering, but that we are terminated, finished, put to an end
To some extent at least, this misunderstanding of the cross has been promoted by a famous book entitled The Imitation of Christ
Because in resurrection He has become the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit , we follow Him in our spirit
Our soul life is embodied in and lived out by our self, and our self is expressed through our mind, thought, concept, opinion
When we set our mind, not on the things of God, but on the things of man, our mind grasps the opportunity to act and express itself
Many readers of the Gospel of Mark misinterpret the Lord's word about losing our soul life for His sake and the gospel's
The phrase for the gospels must mean for the sake of the preaching of the gospel for the sake of the effectiveness and result of the gospel
In 8:27-38 we have an unveiling not only of the Lord's wonderful Person, but also of His death and resurrection
Mark 92 says And after six days Jesus takes with Him Peter and James and John and brings them up into a high mountain by themselves alone
To receive the revelation concerning Christ and His death and resurrection, we need to be far away from the religious environment
In verse 4 the record continues, 'And there appeared to them Elijah together with Moses, and they were conversing with Jesus'
God purposely did these two things so that Moses and Elijah might appear with Christ on the mount of His transfiguration
Now Moses and Elijah appeared and conversed with Christ concerning His death as it had been prophesied in the Old Testament
In God's economy the law and the prophets were only a testimony to Christ; they should not be put on the same level with Him
Mark 9:7 says, 'And a cloud came overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, This is My Son, the Beloved
In chapter nine of Mark a miniature of the millennium appeared briefly as an example that was shown to the Lord's disciples
At that time, Peter, James, and John did not understand what the Lord meant when He said that the Son of Man should rise from the dead
On the day of Pentecost, when Peter stood up with the eleven, he was clear and could testify strongly concerning Christ's resurrection
We have the healing of the ears and the tongue of a deaf and dumb man and also the healing of the eyes of a blind man
After these particular healings, we may say that we have a complete person whose organs have been healed in a particular way
Now this one is prepared and qualified to receive the revelation of Christ's Person and His death and resurrection
In the realm of mysterious, divine things, the revelation concerning Christ and His death and resurrection is foremost
We may say that in Mark 7 the Slave-Savior conducts Himself as a surgeon, for He opens our heart and exposes its condition
In chapter seven we see the Lord not only as the divine Surgeon but also as the One who feeds us with Himself as bread
Once these chosen ones were nourished by receiving the life supply-the Lord as their bread-their organs were healed
At this point the Slave-Savior brought them to Caesarea Philippi, to a place where the spiritual atmosphere was clear
For this reason, the Lord went on to tell His disciples that He would be crucified and that after His death, He would rise up
He showed His disciples not only His Person; He also revealed to them His wonderful death and His marvelous resurrection
When the Lord Jesus revealed to His disciples the matters of His death and resurrection, they may have been confused
The Lord rebuked Peter saying Go away behind Me Satan because you are not setting your mind on the things of God but on the things of men!
The Lord went on to say, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me'
To take the cross means to admit that we have been terminated by Christ's death and to apply this termination to ourselves
Whenever we apply the cross of Christ, the life-giving Spirit, as the reality of Christ's resurrection, comes in to be our real replacement
As a result, we can declare that we have been crucified with Christ and that we live no longer, but Christ lives in us
In order to interpret these verses from chapters eight and nine of the Gospel of Mark, we need the fourteen Epistles written by Paul
Praise the Lord for this highlight in the Gospel of Mark, the place where we have a revelation of Christ with His death and resurrection!
Mark 9:28 says, 'And when He entered into a house, His disciples questioned Him privately, Why were we not able to cast it out'?
The disciples seemed to be saying to the Lord, 'We have been following You and learning of You for a long period of time
In verse 29 we have the Lord's answer to the disciples' question: 'This kind cannot come out by anything, except by prayer'
The Lord's word here indicates that the disciples failed to pray, and that was the reason they could not cast out the demon
Perhaps they said to themselves, 'We have been watching the Lord cast out demons for more than two years, and we have learned of Him
It had been revealed to the disciples that Christ is the entire replacement through His death and resurrection
According to the case of the casting of the dumb spirit out of the man's son, this vision is applied by prayer
If a husband and wife never exchange words and are never troubled by their temper, most problems in married life would be eliminated
If you ask the Lord why you are not able to cast out the demon of your temper, He may say, 'This kind cannot be cast out except by prayer
The case in 9:14-29 points out that if we would be replaced by Christ, we need to pray instead of trying in ourselves to cast out demons
We cannot be trained to practice this only by one instance, for a particular case is limited in what it can accomplish
He called the twelve and said to them, If anyone wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all'
By taking the young child in His arms the Lord expressed His humanity in His tender love toward the little ones
The Lord is teaching the disciples the same lesson as in the case that involved the casting out of the dumb spirit
We see the Slave-Savior's tolerance, in the practice of the gospel service, toward His believers who were different from those closer to Him
The maxim in 9:40 speaks of the outward formality in practice regarding those who are not against the Slave-Savior
Eternal salvation is by faith, having nothing to do with our work , whereas reward is for our work after we are saved
The believers should not cause one another to stumble; neither should they be caused to stumble by their own fleshly members
To inherit eternal life is to be rewarded in the coming age with the enjoyment of the divine life in the manifestation of the kingdom
Dispensational punishment by fire in the coming age is in the same principle as God's chastisement through sufferings as by fire in this age
In verse 50 the Lord Jesus concludes, 'Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltness, with what will you restore its saltness?
In such a case, they have become the same as earthly people and can no longer be distinguished from unbelievers
The entire section at the close of chapter nine presents the SlaveSaviors teaching concerning the believers tolerance for the sake of unity
We need to understand 9:38-50 in the light of the vision given in 8:27-9:13 concerning Christ, His death, and His resurrection
When the Lord was speaking to the disciples concerning humility, John even went on in verse 38 to change the subject
The Lord may have been saying, 'Instead of forbidding this one to cast out demons in My name, you should give him a cup of water to drink
In verses 43 through 48 the Lord turns from the matter of causing others to stumble to causing ourselves to stumble
It is serious to cause another believer to stumble, and it is also serious for us to be caused to stumble by any part of our fleshly body
In the coming age the one who gives a disciple a cup of cold water to drink because that one is Christ's, will be rewarded
As we have seen, here it is not a matter of receiving eternal life; instead, it is a matter of entering into eternal life
Peter considered the persecution the believers suffered as such a burning furnace used by God to purify their life
Many Bible teachers realize that it is possible that God's redeemed people may suffer God's punishment in this age
In a similar way, God knows what is the best time for Him to discipline His children, and he also knows the best way
The fact that God may discipline the believers does not mean that Christ's redemption is not complete or adequate
Even though Christ's redemption is fully complete and adequate, we still need to take Christ and be replaced by Him
We need to have a life of prayer and continually call on the name of the Lord, telling Him, 'Lord, it is no longer I, but You
You will be a person taking Christ as your replacement, enjoying Him as everything in your daily living, and living Him in a practical way
Of being caused to stumble, you will be able to praise the Lord and say, 'Hallelujah, it is no longer I, but Christ!
If we see what is revealed in these verses, we shall pray, 'Lord Jesus, may it be no longer I, but You in my daily living
If we live such a life, we shall not cause others to stumble, and we shall not be caused to stumble by any lust that is within us
We have pointed out that in this portion of the Gospel of Mark we have the Lord's teaching concerning tolerance for the sake of unity
Throughout chapter nine the Lord was teaching the disciples to realize that they should be terminated and be nothing
We need to see that if we forbid others in the way John did in verse 38, this indicates that we consider ourselves greater than others
The evil one may use the members of our body-the hand, the foot, or the eye-to express lust and cause us to stumble
If we do not consider ourselves to be someone great, someone greater than others, we shall not cause others to stumble
We all need to learn to take the cross, to bear the cross, and to apply the Lord's terminating death to our situation
As a result, there will not be any ground for the enemy to come in to utilize the members of our body to cause us to stumble
If this is our situation, then eventually when the kingdom age comes, we shall need salting because we are still full of 'germs'
As in 1 Corinthians 3:13 and 15, this fire will purge, in the kingdom age, those believers who commit sin and are unrepentant in this age
Dispensational punishment by fire in the coming age is in the same principle as God's chastisement through sufferings as by fire in this age
In 9:50, which is the Lord's concluding word in this section, we see the real significance of this portion of Mark
In response to John's word, the Lord seems to be saying in these verses, 'That one who cast out demons in My name did not follow you
Mark 9:7 says, 'And a cloud came overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, This is My Son, the Beloved
If we do not salt ourselves with Christ's death and resurrection, we shall miss the opportunity to receive grace
The disciples' formality was to follow the Lord Jesus, but the formality of this other party was not to follow Him with the disciples
The second maxim is in Matthew 12:30: 'He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who is not gathering with Me is scattering'
In particular it was spoken concerning the Pharisees who said This man does not cast out the demons except by Beelzebub ruler of the demons
It is not possible for any among us to say, 'Even though we are not one with you, we are still for the Lord's recovery'
We do not believe that someone can be for the Lord's recovery and yet not be one with those who are in the recovery
In 9:14-50 we have a training of the disciples in the light of what has been unveiled in the preceding chapters
We should not isolate any part of chapter ten from the vision concerning Christ with His death and resurrection to be our replacement
Rather, we need to see this in relation to the heavenly vision concerning Christ with His death and resurrection
According to what is revealed regarding the human heart in chapter seven, we are inwardly unclean, unclean in our heart
If we are lacking in the divine light and if we are short of experience, we shall not be able to see much in the Word, if anything at all
We thank the Lord for showing us something marvelous concerning Christ with His death and resurrection to be our replacement
Especially we need to read chapter ten according to the vision of Christ with His death and resurrection to be our all-inclusive replacement
The gospel service was initiated by the ministry of John the Baptist, the forerunner of the Slave-Savior, in Judea , the region of honor
It was continued by the ministry of the Slave-Savior in Galilee, a despised region, for a period of approximately three years
Because they cared for tradition and were occupied by it instead of caring for the pure Word, they did not see this matter
Although the scribes did not know when the Messiah would be cut off, the Lord Jesus knew the time when He would be put to death
He knew that He would be put to death on the Passover, that is, on the fourteenth day of the first month in the Jewish calendar
It was necessary for Him to be crucified on Mount Moriah, at the very place where Abraham offered Isaac and received God's provision
If we fall under the influence of traditional teachings, our eyes also will be veiled from seeing the revelation in the pure Word
In verse 27 the Lord went on to explain, 'With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God'
To enter into this enjoyment in the coming age is to enter into the coming kingdom and participate in its enjoyment of eternal life
The Lord's word here is related to receiving the kingdom of God and, in particular, to entering into the kingdom in the coming age
In 10:2-31 we see three matters that may frustrate us from entering into the coming kingdom: marriage, oldness, and riches
If we would enter into the coming kingdom, we need to learn to handle rightly the three matters of marriage, age, or oldness, and money
Mankind was brought into existence through God's creation, and God ordained that mankind be propagated through marriage
We need to see that marriage is honorable and holy, for it is ordained for the propagation of mankind for the fulfillment of God's purpose
Apart from the creation of man and the propagation of mankind through marriage, there cannot be the fulfillment of God's purpose
We shall realize that marriage is for the propagation of mankind so that God's eternal purpose may be fulfilled
Since we are on our way to enter into the kingdom of God, we especially need to be firm in our standing regarding marriage
After you are engaged, and especially after you are married, you should close your eyes to the defects of the other party and be blind
According to 10:2, the Pharisees questioned the Lord Jesus 'whether it is lawful for a man to put away a wife'
When He asked what Moses commanded them, they replied, 'Moses permitted us to write a certificate of divorce and put her away'
It was given by Moses, not according to God's ordination from the beginning, but temporarily because of the hardness of man's heart
Perhaps the most difficult thing for Christians to deal with regarding entering into God's kingdom is their oldness
In 10:14-15 the Lord Jesus says, 'Allow the young children to come to Me; do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God
The fact that John forbade someone from casting out demons in the Lords name was an indication that John had become old spiritually speaking
We may use the gathering of manna in the Old Testament as an illustration of our need to be new and fresh every day
In a similar way, God's truth does not change, but the way to present this truth should be newer and fresher all the time
Because oldness has nothing to do with God's kingdom, we must be reborn, renewed, in order to enter into the kingdom
We have seen from chapter seven that the Lord Jesus is a Surgeon operating on our heart and exposing its condition
Before 1949, we never spoke about being one spirit with the Lord, and we did not use the term 'life-giving Spirit'
Be assured that in the future more new things will come forth, and more striking terms and expressions will be used
We have seen that two matters that can hinder us from entering into the kingdom of God are the way we handle marriage and oldness
Paul did not tell them, 'Corinthians, if you mean business with the Lord, you must sell all that you have and give to others'
We shall handle marriage with Christ, we shall deal with the matter of oldness with Christ, and we shall manage money with Christ
In the matters of marriage, oldness, and wealth we are replaced by Christ so that we may enter into the kingdom of God
If we do not have Christ and His death and resurrection we shall not have the way to handle the three matters of marriage oldness and wealth
The only way to handle these things properly is to be replaced by Christ through His all-inclusive death and His wonderful resurrection
The Lord made this move deliberately so that He might die in Jerusalem for the accomplishment of God's eternal plan
At the end of Mark 10, the move of the Slave-Savior's gospel service is concluded with the healing of Bartimaeus, a blind beggar
The first time the Lord revealed His death to the disciples was in Caesarea Philippi, before His transfiguration
It is important for us to have this view as we consider the remainder of chapter ten and then the last six chapters of the Gospel of Mark
According to the record of Mark, we can see that Peter, John, and James in particular were put to death with the Lord Jesus
On the day of Pentecost Peter and the one hundred twenty were people in Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension
It was not an accident that on the day of Pentecost the one hundred twenty were witnesses of the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ
The incidents recorded in 103545 prove that the SlaveSaviors disciples were blind with respect to the vision of His death and resurrection
They certainly had not been replaced by Christ, and they had not been crucified and brought into the Lord's resurrection
According to the account in the Gospel of Matthew, it was the mother of the sons of Zebedee who made this request
The cup signifies that His death was the God-given portion for Him to take for the sinners whom He would redeem for God
Baptism denotes that His death was the God-ordained way for Him to pass through for the accomplishment of God's redemption for sinners
The selfish entreaty of John and James afforded the Lord an opportunity to reveal the way to enter into the kingdom
In verse 45 the Lord goes on to say For even the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give His life a ransom for many
The word 'ransom' here indicates that even the Slave-Savior's redemption was His service rendered to sinners for God's plan
As we shall see more fully in the next message, in making their request James and John were actually blind sons of Timaeus, blind beggars
As blind men begging for position, they needed the Lord to open their eyes so that they could see Him and see His death and resurrection
The Lord had spoken to them three times concerning His death but because they were blind they were not able to understand what He was saying
Even though the Lord's disciples had been following Him for more than three years, in chapter ten they were still blind
It was of God's sovereignty that the Lord and His disciples came to Jericho, into a place where there was a blind man
When James and John asked to sit at the Lord's right and left, He said to them, 'You do not know what you are asking
The cup signifies that His death was the God-given portion for Him to take for the sinners whom He would redeem for God
Baptism signifies that His death was the God-ordained way for Him to pass through for the accomplishment of redemption
The Lord's wise answer implied that the disciples were in darkness, that they did not know what they were asking
In the church we have death not only as a portion for us to drink, but also as a process through which we must pass
When some hear about the portion and process of death in the church life, they may say, 'Brother Lee, we are frightened
As we have seen, this word was given to John and James, the sons of thunder, who wanted to sit at the Lord's right and left
Mark 10:47 says, 'And hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and to say, Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me'!
There was a significant difference: James and John begged in a wrong way, but Bartimaeus begged in a right way
The Lord did not give them a position at His right and left, but He certainly was willing to heal their blindness
Mark 10:50, speaking of blind Bartimaeus, says, 'And throwing away his garment, he leaped up and came to Jesus'
When he heard that Jesus called him, he immediately cast aside his garment and went to the Lord to receive sight
By means of these twenty-nine matters, the Lord Jesus prepared His disciples to be brought into His death and resurrection
The answer to this question is that the disciples could not participate in the enjoyment of the Lord otherwise
We enter into the kingdom through the enjoyment of the Lord, through the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ as the universal replacement
The Lord worked on the disciples to make them ready to be brought into the process of His death and resurrection
By entering into the Lords death and resurrection the disciples could have the enjoyment of the Lord and experience Him as their replacement
As a result, on the day of Pentecost the one hundred twenty were those who had been replaced by the Lord and who were enjoying Him
Through His death and resurrection they were participating in Him, a living, all-inclusive Person, as their replacement
Through the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the disciples also had a rich entrance into the kingdom of God
As we read the chapters of this Gospel it is as if we are watching a heavenly television and scene after scene is telecast into our spirit
At the end of chapter ten, they are fully made ready to come to Jerusalem, that is, to enter into the death and resurrection of Christ
We may say that the greatest miracle in the universe was the Lord's entering into and accomplishing His all-inclusive death
It is a very significant matter that in carrying out His all-inclusive death, the Lord brought all of us into death with Him
In the last six chapters of this Gospel we no longer have such things as the casting out of demons or the healing of the sick
Not many readers of the Gospel of Mark realize that chapter eleven is concerned with the Lord's preparation for His redemptive service
The Lord went to Jerusalem ahead of time in order to carry out this preparation, as recorded in 11:1 through 14:42
Rather, all the matters recorded here are related to the Slave-Savior's preparation for the accomplishment of His redemptive service
The first aspect of the preparation of the Slave-Savior for His redemptive service was to enter into Jerusalem and lodge in Bethany
The words shouted by the people were quoted from Psalm 118:26, a prophecy concerning the coming of the Messiah
When He comes the second time, He will be riding on a cloud, not on a colt, and He will be coming from the heavens, not from Jericho
What we have in Mark 11:9 and 10 is a foretaste or a prefigure of the welcome the Lord will receive in that day
The Lord saw the fig tree with nothing on it except leaves, and in verse 14 He said to it, 'May no one eat fruit of you forever'!
The temple, which should have been a house of prayer for all nations, the Gentiles as well as the Jews, had become a den of robbers
As the Lord was doing these things, no one dared to oppose Him outwardly, for He had already received the people's approval
Remembering what the Lord Jesus had said the previous day, Peter said to Him, 'Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which You cursed has withered'
As a result, those who came with the intention of finding fault with Him had to become those who could prove His qualities
In 11:1-26 there are three main points: entering into Jerusalem and lodging in Bethany, cursing the fig tree, and cleansing the temple
These three things all must have come as a great surprise, even as a shock, to the followers of the Slave-Savior
During those years, they had observed how the Lord conducted Himself, how He did things, and how He treated people
They had come with Him from Galilee, a despised region, to Judea, even to the city of Jerusalem, the most important place in the country
Jerusalem was the place where the temple was located and where the Sanhedrin, the great council of the Jews, met
Having been trained by the Lord, the disciples did not express any opinion about what the Lord commanded them to do
In a foregoing message we pointed out that when blind Bartimaeus heard that the Lord was calling him, he threw away his garment
To be sure, they never imagined that the Lord Jesus, a carpenter from Galilee, would be so warmly welcomed by the crowd in Jerusalem
After cursing the fig tree, the Lord entered the temple and began to cast out those who were selling and buying there
We have seen that by cursing the fig tree and cleansing the temple the Lord was making the necessary preparations for His redemptive service
In particular, His cleansing of the temple stirred up the chief priests and the scribes, who sought how they might destroy Him
Suppose the Lord Jesus had come into the temple and simply looked around, behaving Himself in a very polite manner
No doubt, the cursing of the fig tree and the cleansing of the temple made a deep impression on the Lord's followers
In chapter eleven of Mark, we can see that Peter, John, James, and the other disciples were very much under the influence of tradition
To them, Jerusalem was blessed by God, and the fig tree was a symbol of the nation of Israel, a nation chosen by God
On the day the Lord Jesus cursed the fig tree and cleansed the temple, the disciples did not have much understanding of what had taken place
My point here is that the Lord in an unusual way was preparing all things and all people, especially His followers, for His death
Of course, they did not actually suffer death with the Lord; nevertheless, they went through the process of His death
They also saw how He prepared the environment for His death and even prepared His opposers, who put Him to death
They saw how the Lord was arrested, judged according to Jewish law, and judged by the Roman governor according to Gentile law
Through death and resurrection, the very Slave-Savior revealed in Mark became the life-giving Spirit, who was poured out upon the disciples
Through this outpouring of the Spirit, the one hundred twenty received the reality of all the visions they had seen
Eventually, the resurrected Christ as the living Spirit will pour out Himself upon you to make whatever you see a reality to you
From this we see that it took the Lord six days to complete the preparation and bring the new creation into being
In the six days that concluded with His death, the Lord did everything necessary to bring the new creation into existence for God
After cursing the fig tree the symbol of the Jewish nation the Lord entered into the temple and turned over the tables of the moneychangers
No doubt, that evening the disciples must have talked with one another about what the Lord had done in Jerusalem
The chief priests, scribes, and elders seemed to be saying, 'You cursed the fig tree, and then you overturned the tables in the temple
Realizing that there was no way for them to answer the Lord's question without losing the case, they decided to lie
Since they would not tell Him what they knew concerning John the Baptist, neither would He answer their question
After the Slave-Savior was examined by the chief priests, scribes, and elders, He was tested by the Pharisees and Herodians
Mark 12:13 says, 'And they send to Him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians that they might catch Him in His speech'
If the Lord Jesus said that it was lawful to give tribute to Caesar, He would offend the Jews, whose leaders were the Pharisees
The Pharisees would have said, 'You are betraying your country, for you are working for the Roman imperialists'
When they answered, 'Caesar's,' the Lord went on to say, 'The things of Caesar pay to Caesar, and the things of God to God'
To pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar's is to pay tribute to Caesar according to his governmental regulations
The testing and examining of the Slave-Savior took place during the days immediately before the feast of the Passover
After the chief priests, scribes, and elders were defeated by Him, the Pharisees and Herodians tried to catch Him in His speech
Both the Pharisees and the Sadducees were denounced by John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus as a brood of vipers
In Mark 12:18-27 the Sadducees thought that they could defeat the Lord Jesus regarding the matter of resurrection
The Lord Jesus said to them, 'Are you not deceived because of this-not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God'?
the Scriptures' refer to the verses of the Old Testament concerning resurrection, and 'the power of God' refers to the power of resurrection
We should not think that to understand the Bible it is sufficient to know the original languages of the Bible, Hebrew and Greek
If we do not receive light from the Lord, we may read the Gospel of Mark again and again without seeing anything
The lawyers were versed in the law of Moses; they were professional interpreters of the law of the Old Testament
Knowing that He had answered well those who were disputing with Him, the scribe asked the Lord, 'Which is the first commandment of all'?
He died not only for the Jews, represented by the Jewish leaders, but also for the Gentiles, represented by the Roman governor
Mark 12:35 says, 'And Jesus, teaching in the temple, answered and said, How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David'?
The modernistic Sadducees questioned Him concerning fundamental belief, in particular concerning belief in resurrection
The chief priests, scribes, and elders asked the Slave-Savior a question related to typical, bona fide religion
As we have pointed out, the Sadducees, who may be considered ancient modernists, did not believe in resurrection
The scribe was asking the Slave-Savior how He interpreted the Bible with respect to which commandment was first
If you had been one of the Lord's disciples observing how He handled the opposers, would you not have spoken to the others about it?
As His followers, we are seeing from the Gospel of Mark a series of heavenly visions, visions that are being 'telecast' into our being
The leaven of the Pharisees was their hypocrisy , and the leaven of Herod was his corruption and injustice in politics
The ancient scribes taught people according to the Old Testament, but they did not have the light concerning Christ
We need to discern whether a particular message or teaching has Christ as its center, reality, and living essence
Certain preachers and teachers are naturally eloquent and can present doctrine to others in a way that pleases the itching ears
A message or teaching may be scholarly, academic, scriptural, and eloquent, providing a great deal of Bible knowledge
In 11271237 we have four kinds of questions related to mans culture followed by the question of questions the question concerning Christ
A scribe is someone among the Lord's people who speaks vanity, but this widow signifies a believer with inward reality
Thank the Lord that among us there are a good number of real widows, a good number of those with inward reality
The Lord had a little meeting with His disciples, a meeting in which He spoke to them concerning the scribes and a widow
In particular, we see the significance of the Lord's warning against the scribes and His appraising the poor widow
We may be poor in every way, but we can have within us the reality of the Lord on whom we call, a reality toward the very God whom we serve
The reason money proves a believer's inward reality is that in human life nothing is more tangible than money or material possessions
When we open ourselves to the life-giving Spirit to have sway over us, all these visions will come back to us in a real and living way
In 12:35 the Lord Jesus, teaching in the temple, says, 'How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David'?
The fact that the scribes liked to walk around in long robes indicates that they cared for position, honor, and glory
They may not have the reality of the God-man, the One who is both God and man, the all-inclusive Christ as our universal replacement
We should be warned concerning those who lack the inward reality of Christ and yet are seeking position, respect, honor, and glory
The preparations had been made by the Lord for the opposers to put Him to death at the appointed time, on the day of the Passover
Although the opposers had been put to silence, they did not cease from their endeavors to put the Lord to death
Preparing the disciples for His death, the Slave-Savior first told them, in chapter thirteen, the things to come
These are the things that would take place in the world during the church age after His resurrection until the time of His coming back
Such an enlightening word to the Slave-Savior's suffering followers is like a 'lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawns'
He brought certain of His disciples out of Jerusalem to the Mount of Olives, to a higher level where the atmosphere was clear
Sitting on the Mount of Olives with them, He spoke about the future in order to prepare them for what was coming
When one of His disciples spoke to Him about the wonderful stones and buildings the Lord Jesus said to him Do you see these great buildings
We have seen that the Lord Jesus received a warm welcome from the people, that He cursed the fig tree, and that He cleansed the temple
For this reason, on the day after He cleansed the temple, He confronted the opposers, who examined Him and asked Him different questions
As we have pointed out, the temple was no longer God's house; it was 'your house,' the house of those who had made it a den of robbers
In his writings, Josephus, a Jewish historian, records the details of the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple
He could peacefully sit down on the mountaintop and look at the forsaken city of Jerusalem and the forsaken temple
In verse 7 the Lord goes on to say And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars do not be alarmed it must happen but the end is not yet
The 'end' in verse 7 is the consummation of this age , which will be the three and a half years of the great tribulation
If you know world history, you will realize that from the day the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens, wars have been increasing
According to history, war brings in famine, signified by the black horse of the third seal in Revelation 6:5-6
From the time of Christs ascension earthquakes have been increasing through all the centuries and will be intensified at the end of this age
Referring to wars, earthquakes, and famine, the Lord Jesus says in verse 8, 'These things are the beginning of birth pangs'
In order to understand this expression, we need to realize that from the time of the Lord's resurrection, a birth has been taking place
The birth, or delivery, of this new man began with the Lord's resurrection, for we, God's called people, were all resurrected with Christ
Throughout the centuries, many of the Lord's faithful ones have suffered these pangs, and today many are still suffering birth pangs
The reason these birth pangs continue is that the delivery of the universal new man has not yet been completed
In another sense, the universal new man, revealed in chapters two and four of Ephesians, has not yet been fully delivered
What the Lord says in Mark 13:1-8 is related to the birth pangs for the bringing forth of the universal new man
In this message we shall go on to consider the other matters concerning which the Lord spoke to His disciples on the Mount of Olives
The sanhedrins and synagogues are related to the Jews, but the governors and the kings refer to the rulers of the Gentiles
The gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole earth for a testimony to all nations before the end of the age comes
Verse 14 says, 'But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not , then let those in Judea flee to the mountains'
It refers to the image of Antichrist set up in the temple of God as an idol at the beginning of the great tribulation
With Titus there was the third destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, and with the coming Antichrist Jerusalem will be destroyed again
Unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen, whom He chose, He shortened the days'
For false Christs and false prophets will be raised up, and they will show signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, the chosen
They need to be warned that Messiah, the Christ, will not arise 'here' or 'there' on earth, but will descend on the cloud from heaven
Antichrist will be the last of the false Christs and will work signs and lying wonders with the power of Satan to deceive the perishing
Another beast' in Revelation 13:11 will be the last of the false prophets and will do great signs to deceive the earth's dwellers
In verse 26 the Lord continues, 'And then they shall see the Son of Man coming in clouds with much power and glory'
After the great tribulation at His coming back to earth the Lord will gather the scattered Jews from all parts of the earth to the holy land
In verses 29 and 30 the Lord goes on to say, 'So also you, when you see these things happening, you know that He is near, at the doors
It is the generation according to the moral condition of the people as the generation in Matthew 1116 1239 41 42 45 and Proverbs 301114
In verses 31 and 32 the Lord says, 'The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away
To be sure, the Lord's word about watching is more than a prophecy; it is also a charge to all the believers of the Slave-Savior
Although its branch has already become tender and it has begun to put forth its leaves, we do not yet see any fruit
We need to follow the Slave-Savior to Jerusalem, where He prepared the environment, the opposers, and His disciples for His redemptive work
From our study of the Scriptures we know what the Lord is doing, and we know the purpose of the world situation
Through His death and resurrection we may have the full enjoyment of the wonderful Person of Christ as our replacement
After cleansing the temple, the Lord Jesus dealt with the leaders of Judaism, those who were especially concerned for the temple
For the disciples to still have such a regard for the temple meant that they were fully occupied with their old religion
He was canceling annulling the things of the old dispensation in order to prepare the way for His disciples to take Him as their replacement
He was preparing them to be brought into His death and resurrection so that He might be their all-inclusive replacement
The period of time between Christ's resurrection and ascension and His coming back is for the delivery of the new man
The Jews, the Gentiles, and all the cultures and civilizations of the world have been part of these birth pangs
From the time Peter stood up to preach the gospel on the day of Pentecost, this persecution has been taking place
Persecution first came from the Jews with their religion and then from the Gentiles, including the Roman rulers in their politics
During the past nineteen hundred years, two things have been going on continually: the preaching of the gospel and persecution
Century after century, the Lord's faithful ones have preached the gospel at any cost, even at the risk of their lives
Meanwhile, Satan, having usurped the old creation with the old man and his society and culture, has instigated a great deal of persecution
When the Lord Jesus comes back, there will be a rapture, and this rapture will be the final delivery of the new man
In this germination we enjoy the all-inclusive, universal replacement, who is the living, wonderful, marvelous Person of Christ, the God-man
When we enjoy Christ as the universal replacement, He will become everything to us, for He will replace everything with Himself
Today this wonderful Person is the compound Spirit to be our enjoyment so that God may have the new man for His expression
The delivery takes place through the gospel, and the preaching of the gospel is always accompanied by persecution
The crucial matter here is that the Lord was telling His close followers that the entire world situation is for the producing of a new man
He told the people that the One they despised and crucified has been honored by God, for God raised Him from among the dead
We have seen that Christ's death was the termination of the old creation and that His resurrection was the germination of the new creation
Our aim is to help the believers know that we need to enter into the all-inclusive death of Christ so that we may be in His resurrection
As we live in the Spirit and even live this Spirit, He will make Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension real to us
The entire world situation is for the completion of the re-formation of Israel and also for the completion of the birth of the new man
Because we have a clear view concerning these two matters, we can see something that statesmen and politicians cannot see
We are in the death and resurrection of Christ, and we are in the enjoyment of Him as our all-inclusive replacement
It was not in an external, outward way that the New Testament believers entered into the death and resurrection of Christ
From the Gospel of Mark we see that the early disciples, our representatives, followed the Lord from the very beginning
Eventually, they, and also we, passed through the process leading into Christ's all-inclusive death and into His resurrection
If we see the vision of the allinclusive death of Christ we shall realize that when He was crucified we were crucified with Him and in Him
In 14:1-11 He prepares them by enjoying their love, while His opposers conspire to kill Him, and one of His disciples plots to betray Him
Simultaneously, Judas Iscariot, 'one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests that he might deliver Him up to them'
Although the chief priests and the scribes wanted to kill the Lord Jesus they said Not at the feast lest there be an uproar of the people
Eventually, under God's sovereignty, they did kill the Lord Jesus at the feast for the fulfillment of the type
Christ is the Lamb of God that God may pass over us, the sinners, as portrayed in typology by the Passover in Exodus 12
According to the type, the Passover Lamb had to be examined for blemishes during the four days preceding the feast of the Passover
Before His crucifixion, Christ came to Jerusalem the last time, six days before the Passover , and was examined by the Jewish leaders
There was no blemish found in Him, and He was proved to be perfect and qualified to be the Passover Lamb for us
Going to the Mount of Olives with some of His disciples, He prophesied to them that the temple they admired would be destroyed
In chapter fourteen we see that after leaving the temple, the Lord came to a house of a cleansed leper in Bethany
Being grateful to the Lord and loving Him, he spread a feast in his house for the Lord and His disciples in order to enjoy His presence
For this ointment could have been sold for over three hundred denarii and given to the poor; and they were scolding her'
According to verses 6 and 7, the Lord Jesus said to those who were scolding the woman, 'Let her alone; why are you causing her trouble?
For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want you can do them good; but you do not always have Me'
The Lord's word, 'You do not always have Me,' indicates that we must love the Lord and seize the opportunity to love Him
In verse 8 the Lord went on to say, 'She has done what she could; she anointed My body beforehand for the burial'
The story of the gospel is that the Lord loved us, and the story of the woman who anointed the Lord is that she loved Him
She knew that the One she loved would soon be killed and that she would not have another opportunity to anoint Him
We can be like the woman in Mark 14, who entered into the Lord's death and resurrection and thereby enjoyed Him as her full replacement
Because she took in the Lord's word regarding His death, she also seized the opportunity to anoint Him for burial
The feast was a matter of inner satisfaction, and the anointing was a matter of pouring out upon the Lord something with a sweet savor
While one of the Slave-Savior's followers expressed her love to Him to the uttermost, another was about to betray Him
In the history of Gods economy that was the last feast of Passover for from that time the feast of Passover was replaced by the Lords table
He would show them a large upper room furnished and ready, and in that room the disciples would make the necessary preparations
And the disciples went out, and came into the city, and found it even as He had told them, and they prepared the Passover'
Mark 14:22 says, 'And as they were eating He took bread, and blessed and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, Take; this is My body'
The bread denotes life , the life of God, the eternal life, and the cup denotes blessing , which is God Himself as their portion
They testify of His rich and marvelous salvation to the entire universe, displaying His redeeming and life-imparting death
The Slave-Savior wanted His followers to know this and to live a life based upon this and according to it after His resurrection
The Lord is speaking of the manifestation of the kingdom, in which He will drink with us after His coming back
By participating in this life, we become the mystical Body of Christ , which is also signified by the bread of the table
Through being broken on the cross, the Lord was able to release the divine life from within Him so that we might participate in this life
As His enlargement, Christ's mystical Body is also signified by the bread on the table, as indicated in 1 Corinthians 10:17
Concerning the Lord's table , the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God's blessing
Christ has drunk that cup for us , and His blood has constituted the cup of salvation for us , the cup that runs over
In this new covenant, God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings
The Lord shed the blood, God established the covenant, and we enjoy the cup, in which God and all that is of Him are our portion
The blood is the price Christ paid for us, the covenant is the title deed God made to us, and the cup is the portion we receive from God
The blood is the price paid by Christ, the covenant is the title deed of our inheritance, and the cup is the portion we receive and enjoy
By instituting His table the Lord Jesus was indicating to His followers that they would enter into His death and resurrection
The Lord served them not only with His body and blood but also with His death resurrection Himself and His enlargement His mystical Body
At His table He served His disciples with Himself, with His death and resurrection, and with His mystical Body as His enlargement
At His table we have a revelation of the Lord's death, resurrection, the Lord Himself, and His mystical Body as His enlargement
When this process has been fulfilled, the Lord Jesus will come back to receive this new man and to have the kingdom
In this section of the Gospel of Mark concerned with the Lord's preparation, there are two feasts in addition to the feast of the Passover
Throughout the centuries, much has been said concerning the feast set up by Simon to show his love for the Lord Jesus
The significance of the feast prepared for the Lord by certain of His disciples is shallow compared to the significance of the Lord's table
In the feast prepared by the Lord's disciples, we have the matter of appreciation of the Lord's preciousness, worthiness, and loveliness
The anointing of the Lord Jesus was also an expression of appreciation of the Lord's loveliness and worthiness
When the Lord Jesus instituted His supper, 'He took bread, and blessed and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, Take; this is My body'
He took the cup, gave it to them, and said, 'This is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many'
The Lord Jesus said, 'I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever,'
When we eat this bread of life, He comes into us to be digested by us and to be assimilated into us organically
Taking in the Lord to digest and assimilate Him that He may become life to us is signified by the eating of the loaf on the table
When the Lord Jesus instituted His supper, 'He took bread, and blessed and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, Take; this is My body'
According to Luke 22:19, the Lord Jesus said, 'This is My body which is given for you; do this unto the remembrance of Me'
The bread on the table is not for us to analyze or merely think about; the bread is for us to take in, to eat, as our life supply
Eating the bread of the Lord's table indicates that the Lord comes into us as our life supply and then actually becomes us
Not only is there an organic union between us and the food we eat digest and assimilate we are mingled with the food we assimilate into us
We have pointed out that eating food involves something much more than an organic union between us and the food
We use this matter of assimilating food to illustrate the deep significance of eating the bread of the Lord's table
In God's economy there is only one kind of blood that is good for us to drink, and that is the blood of the Lord Jesus
In principle, drinking the blood is the same as eating the loaf: whatever we drink saturates us and becomes our being
The body of the Lord Jesus is signified by the loaf, the bread, and His blood is signified by the cup with its content
In 1 Corinthians 11:26 Paul says, 'As often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord's death until He comes'
In order for the Lord Jesus to become our food, entering into us as our life supply, it was necessary for Him to pass through death
We have seen that the Lord's table signifies the Lord Himself, His death, His resurrection, and His mystical Body as His increase
We may say that whenever we eat the Lord and digest and assimilate Him as our life supply, we experience an inward resurrection
In its totality the kingdom of God is an organism, the new man, produced by Christ's replacing us through His death and resurrection
Cranfield says that the Lord was 'in the grip of a shuddering horror in the face of the dreadful prospect before Him'
The Lord said to Peter, James, and John, 'My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death; remain here and watch
Going forward a little, He fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from Him'
Why is it that after the Lord Jesus instituted His supper, He warned the disciples of their stumbling and charged them to watch and pray?
The reason is that whenever the Lord reveals something concerning Himself in God's economy, He exposes our real situation
The institution of the Lord's table reveals the Lord's death, His resurrection, the Lord Himself, and His enlargement, His mystical Body
As we read chapters fourteen and fifteen of the Gospel of Mark, we see that Peter was brought into the Lord's crucifixion
After denying Him, 'Peter remembered the word Jesus had said to him, Before a cock crows twice, you will deny Me three times
Perhaps you are wondering what indication there is in the Gospel of Mark that Peter entered into Christ's resurrection
Go, tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him, even as He told you'
Even though the Lord had instituted the supper and they had all partaken of it, they were nevertheless in the flesh
After warning His disciples concerning their stumbling, the Lord Jesus brought three of them-Peter, James, and John-with Him to Gethsemane
At the time the Lord Jesus was being arrested, it was necessary for Him to perform a miracle to heal the ear of the high priest's slave
He was a crucified, resurrected, and ascended person, a reproduction of the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ
Having been brought into the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ, Peter was also saturated with Christ
The record in the Gospel of Mark indicates that Peter passed through a lengthy process in order to become a reproduction of Christ
As a result, on the day of Pentecost Peter was a person who had been brought into the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ
Eventually, all that the enemy can do through persecution and conflict only helps release the flow of resurrection life
Through the Lord's death and resurrection we enjoy Him as the all-inclusive, universal replacement for the producing of the new man
In this message we shall begin to consider the death and resurrection of the Slave-Savior for the accomplishment of God's redemption
Before Judas came with those who arrested the Lord Jesus, the Lord was praying in Gethsemane concerning His death
No matter how evil Judas was, because he was still a human being, he was ashamed to remain with the Lord and His disciples
After Judas left, he went to the high priest and led a company to the place where they arrested the Lord Jesus
It is commonly thought that this means that the Lord Jesus came to do everything according to God's will in a general way
By means of that prayer, He had the confirmation that it was God's will for Him to die to replace all the offerings
Mark 14:53 says, 'And they led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes come together'
In 14:55-60 we see that the Lord Jesus said nothing in answer to those who were falsely testifying against Him
Verses 63 and 64 say, 'And the high priest, having torn his garments, says, What further need do we have of witnesses?
Verse 65 says, 'And some began to spit at Him, and to cover His face, and to beat Him with their fists, and to say to Him, Prophesy!
Mark 15:15 tells us that Pilate, seeking to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them and delivered up Jesus to be crucified
Crucifixion was a heathen practice , adopted by the Romans for the execution of slaves and heinous criminals only
The fact that the Lord was judged by the Jewish leaders and the Roman governor is a strong sign that He was tested by the entire world
The account in the Gospel of Mark merges the judgment of the Lord Jesus by the Jews and the Gentiles with the exposure and judgment of Peter
Everything that happened related to the crucifixion of Jesus was a fulfillment of either the types or the prophecies in the Old Testament
We have pointed out that, as a fulfillment of the type of the Passover lamb, the Lord Jesus was crucified on the day of the Passover
Immediately after He was sentenced, He was taken to Golgotha, and beginning at nine o'clock in the morning, He was crucified
Although He was asked whether He was the Son of the Blessed, that is, the Son of God, the Lord referred to Himself as the Son of Man
The Lord's use of the word 'Power' indicates that the Jewish leaders were not the government, but that He is the government
No doubt, later, after the Lord's resurrection and ascension, Peter came to realize that he had entered into the Lord's crucifixion
Mark 1516 says And the soldiers led Him away into the courtyard which is the Praetorium and they called together the whole band of soldiers
In verses 18 and 19 the soldiers continued their mockery of the Lord Jesus: 'And they began to salute Him, Hail, King of the Jews!
The Lord here, as the Passover Lamb to be sacrificed for our sins, was brought like a lamb to the slaughter, fulfilling Isaiah 53:7-8
According to 15:22, 'They bring Him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, Place of a Skull'
Also the chief priests with the scribes, mocking with one another, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save'!
According to 15:33, 'And when the sixth hour had come, darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour'
God forsook Christ on the cross because He took the place of sinners , bearing our sins , and being made sin for us
The fact that the veil was torn from the top to the bottom indicates that the rending of the veil was God's doing from above
If we study the Bible carefully, we shall realize that cherubim were embroidered on the veil, and cherubim are signs of God's creatures
Mark 15:39 says, 'And the centurion standing by opposite Him, seeing how He expired, said, Truly this man was God's Son'!
After the Lord accomplished His redemptive death, His situation of suffering immediately changed into an honorable one
In human honor of such a high standard the Lord rested on the Sabbath day , waiting for the time to resurrect from among the dead
Although the Lord could rest on the Sabbath, having accomplished the work of redemption, the disciples were not able to rest
We have seen that the Lord Jesus was on the cross for six hours, from nine o'clock in the morning until three o'clock in the afternoon
The Lord Jesus said in John 5:43 that He came in the name of the Father: 'I have come in the name of My Father'
Does God's forsaking of Christ mean that the One who remained on the cross was merely a man and no longer had the divine nature?
If this were the situation, then the Lord's redeeming power would not be eternal, for there would not be the divine, eternal element in it
We must be very careful, therefore, in answering the question concerning what it meant for God to forsake the crucified Christ
If we would understand this properly, we need a thorough consideration of what the Scriptures reveal concerning the Trinity
The conception of the Lord Jesus was the conception of God in a human virgin, a conception that involved both divinity and humanity
The Lord had been born of the Spirit, the Spirit was one of the essences of His being, and He did have the Holy Spirit within Him
Because He had been conceived of the Holy Spirit in a virgin, His being was constituted of two essences, divinity and humanity
Why then, since He already had the Holy Spirit within Him, was it necessary for the Holy Spirit to descend upon Him?
In the words of Martin Luther, if we could fully understand the Triune God, this would mean that we are the teachers of God
He already had the divine nature and the human nature, for the Holy Spirit was one of the essences of His being
The Lord's offering Himself to God through the eternal Spirit can be compared to His ministering on earth by the Spirit
Especially as He was presenting Himself to God on the cross as the all-inclusive offering, He presented Himself through the eternal Spirit
When the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Spirit in Mary's womb, that was the incarnation of the Son of God, the Word becoming flesh
His humanity qualifies Him to be our Redeemer and our Substitute; His divinity gives eternal power to this qualification
What the Lord has shown us concerning these matters from His holy Word is somewhat different from traditional teachings
Romans 8:3 says that God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin and condemned sin in the flesh
According to the Bible and also according to our experience, we have seen that sin is actually the sinful nature of Satan
When man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he took into him the sinful nature of Satan
Praise the Lord that Christ's all-inclusive death has not only solved the problem of our sins, but has also judged and condemned sin!
When a building is in such pitiful condition that it must be torn down, the government may condemn that building
Whether we understand this or not, it is nevertheless a fact that through the death of Christ Satan was crucified
Because the world system is connected to Satan, when he, the ruler of the world was judged, the world was judged as well
Regarding this, the Lord Jesus said, 'Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out'
We see that when Christ was crucified, His eternal death abolished, annulled, the different ordinances of human life and religion
The differences among the races and the differences of social rank have been abolished by the eternal death of Christ
In the words of Peter spoken on the day of Pentecost, Christ was 'delivered by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God'
In the sight of God, He as the Lamb of God was slain from the foundation of the world, that is, from the existence of God's fallen creatures
We need to be impressed with the fact that the death of Christ recorded in Mark 15:16-41 is an exceedingly great matter
Rather, we need to realize that the One who died according to the record in Mark was a God-man and that His death was not common or ordinary
Eventually, this new man will become the eternal kingdom of God as the full development of the gene of the kingdom
In his gospel messages in chapters two, three, four, and five of Acts, Peter speaks concerning the Lord's resurrection
In Peter's very first gospel message, preached on the day of Pentecost, he testified that the crucified Jesus was raised up by God
Regarding the Lord's resurrection, he says in verse 32, 'This Jesus God raised up, of which we all are witnesses'
Peter seems to be saying, 'We were present when the Lord Jesus was crucified, and we saw Him after His resurrection
Peter was telling the people that they had killed the Author of life, the One whom God had raised from the dead
There is no salvation in any other; for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved'
We see that the crucified Jesus, the One whom God raised up from the dead, is the cornerstone rejected by the Jewish leaders
According to the book of Acts, Peter also pointed out that Christ, the resurrected One, has been exalted and is now in the heavens
Christ has poured out Himself as the Spirit upon His believers, God's chosen ones, to make them the members of His Body
As we have seen, this new man is actually the kingdom of God, where God rules, reigns, and acts to fulfill His desire
Of course, in our experience we still face the matters of sins, sin, the old man, the old creation, Satan, the world, and the ordinances
After a woman gives birth to a child, she will have a hope for that child, a hope for his growth and development
Perhaps the mother of a certain child may hope that he will become a medical doctor or even the president of the country
Acts 13:33 indicates that Christ's resurrection was a birth to Him, for in resurrection He was begotten as God's Son
As we read the Gospel of Mark, we need to realize how much the death of the God-man includes and also how much His resurrection comprises
When the process of Christ's death and resurrection was taking place, we, represented by Peter and the other disciples, were involved
Peter had been brought into the death and resurrection of Christ, the One who had become his all-inclusive replacement
We have seen that regeneration issues in a living hope, in a hope for the full development of the divine life within us
Eventually, with many, this life will reach maturity in the millennium, which will be the manifestation of the kingdom of God
We have had at least some realization of the fact that we have been regenerated through Christ's resurrection unto a living hope
When we are beside ourselves in the Lord, perhaps not knowing where we are, that is an experience of being in resurrection
We know from experience that when we cry out to the Lord, calling on His name, we once again experience His resurrection
In 16:1-8 the resurrection of the Lord Jesus was discovered by three women-Mary the Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome
In verse 6 an angel said to them, 'Do not be amazed; you are seeking Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified
All things, whether on earth or in the heavens, were reconciled to God, and the gospel should be proclaimed to all creation under heaven
Based upon this, all the creation expects to be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God
When we are in such a Spirit, all these aspects of Christ's ascension are not merely doctrines to us-they are realities
We thank the Lord for giving us the clear vision that this age is for the producing of the new man through the preaching of the gospel
All things-the world situation, international affairs, the economy, industry, education, and even wars-are for this
These messages will be concerned with the life of the Slave-Savior as a life that is fully according to and for God's New Testament economy
In the Gospel of Mark we see a Person, the God-man, who lived a life that was fully according to and for God's New Testament economy
Although we may love the Gospel of John and the Gospel of Matthew, in these Gospels we do not have a complete biography of the Lord's life
In this Gospel we have a complete record of a life, the life of the Lord Jesus, that is according to and for God's New Testament economy
In this chart we can see how in the Gospel of Mark the record of the Lord's life progresses step by step until we come to the highlight
We are brought into the Lord's all-inclusive death and wonderful resurrection so that we may enjoy Him as our replacement
The new man is the reality of the kingdom of God which issues first in the church then in the millennium and ultimately in the New Jerusalem
These factors are elements of the life of the Slave-Savior, a life fully according to and for God's New Testament economy
John the Baptist was born a typical Old Testament priest, yet he lived in the wilderness in a way that was uncultured
His baptism was a testimony to the universe that He rejected Himself, that He put Himself aside in order to live by God
The Lord did this by forgiving sins, feasting with sinners, being their joy in righteousness and life, satisfying them, and liberating them
While the Lord Jesus was carrying out such a gospel service, He was also binding Satan and plundering his kingdom
Of remaining in the relationship of the natural life, He chose to be in the relationship of the spiritual life
As the One who lived fully according to and for God's New Testament economy, The Lord Jesus suffered the world's rejection and hatred
After exposing the condition of man's heart, the Lord Jesus presented Himself as the life supply to a seeking one
He now remains in His all-surpassing ascension to execute what He has accomplished through His death and resurrection
In previous messages we have pointed out emphatically that the Lord Jesus did not enter into His death, resurrection, and ascension alone
Under the heavenly vision we are directed toward God's destination, and our life is controlled according to God's economy
Because we have seen this vision, throughout the years heavenly light has been flooding into the Lord's recovery
Whenever we come to the Word of God, the light shines because we are in this directing, controlling, governing vision
The Gospel of Mark presents the Person of the God-man, the One who lived, acted, moved, and worked step by step according to God's economy
The author of the Epistle of James, on the contrary, was not fully according to and for God's New Testament economy
As we consider the Gospel of Mark we also are not able to find any fault defect or deficiency in the Lords living related to Gods economy
Let us examine Him according to the measure of the New Testament economy, of a standard that is much more strict
The life of the Lord Jesus recorded in Mark is a complete, whole, perfect, and entire pattern of God's New Testament economy
For this reason, if we would understand what is revealed in Matthew, Luke, or John, we need to consider the pattern presented in Mark
If we have this vision, we shall see that it is not sufficient simply to be righteous, holy, spiritual, and victorious
In order to be refreshed in our understanding, let us consider, in a simple, basic way, what God's New Testament economy is
As we have pointed out, if we compare the Epistle of James and the Gospel of Mark, we shall see that these books present two kinds of lives
In the Epistle of James we see something of the life of James, and in the Gospel of Mark we see the life of the Lord Jesus
Because the Epistle of James emphasizes practical Christian perfection, many Christians have a deep appreciation of this book
According to chapters fifteen and twenty-one of Acts and chapter two of Galatians, James was highly regarded by the saints
Perhaps you would say, 'How could the church in Jerusalem, a city of the Jews, not be Jewish in its appearance?
Before certain ones went to Antioch from James, Peter was behaving himself properly as a brother and a member of the Body of Christ
When the brothers came from James, Peter was frightened and took the lead to pretend, that is, to behave as a Jew once again
From the time of the apostles until today, there has been much debate concerning biblical teachings and theology
If we read carefully Galatians 2:11-21, we shall see that the atmosphere in Antioch changed after certain ones came from James
Paul's rebuke emphasizes the fact that we who believe in Christ should have only one kind of life, and this life is to live Christ
We should not measure the Epistle of James according to the natural concept, the ethical concept, or the religious concept
We know that God's economy is to work Himself into us as our life so that we may live Him as the members of the Body of Christ
When we use this to measure the Epistle of James we shall be able to see where this book stands in relation to the rest of the New Testament
An example of this is the word concerning the Father of lights begetting us so that we may be the firstfruits of His creatures
Other examples are what James says concerning the implanted word, the law of freedom, and the Spirit dwelling in us
These matters all belong to God's New Testament economy, but they are found in an Epistle that bears a strong Old Testament flavor and color
Without such a sight, we shall not realize that it is a biography of a life that is fully according to and for God's New Testament economy
In the foregoing message we pointed out an important difference between the Epistle of James and the Gospel of Mark
The life presented in the Gospel of Mark is the reality, substance, and pattern of God's New Testament economy
Throughout its history the church has been divided not mainly by evil things, but primarily by good things that are not God Himself
If all Christians would care only for God Himself and for having Him as life and living Him there would not be any divisions among believers
If we all have God as our holiness, righteousness, and everything to us, there will not be any divisions among us
The pattern for God's New Testament economy is found in the life of the Lord Jesus, as presented in the Gospel of Mark
In chapter twenty-one of Acts we see a situation in which Paul was distracted from God's New Testament economy
According to verse 20 they pointed out to Paul how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed and are all zealous for the law
Because the Chinese people at the time were very conservative, they were not willing to accept anything they regarded as modern
Certain ones would have been open to receive Brother Nee's ministry if he met their standard of perfection in this matter
If we see that perfection attracts people, we shall be able to understand the nature of James' influence in Jerusalem
In the Gospel of Mark we see that the Lord Jesus did not live a life merely of human morality or of keeping the law
In Mark we have the portrait of a life not of the law nor merely of morality, but of the One who lived God and expressed Him
He, therefore, lived His life by the divine essence that was within Him and by the divine power that was upon Him
His life, therefore, was absolutely related to God Himself and was fully according to God's New Testament economy
In this message we shall continue to see from the Gospel of Mark a life that is fully according to and for the New Testament economy of God
If we get into the depths of the Gospel of Mark, we shall see that this Gospel is more than a biography or a book of stories
In this message we need to pay particular attention to 1:1: 'The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God'
The Gospel of Mark is unique among the four Gospels in opening with the clear expression 'the beginning of the gospel'
The phrase 'the beginning of the gospel' indicates that this book is not merely a biography of a Nazarene named Jesus Christ
At least to a certain extent or in a certain sense, we may regard the entire book of Mark as the beginning of the gospel
The continuation of the gospel is seen on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the chosen and prepared disciples
By this we see that there were many good, positive things, even a number of things that had been ordained by God
All the laws, ordinances, rituals, forms, practices, regulations, and services in the Old Testament had been ordained by God
Now, in 1:1, among all these good, positive things, we read of the beginning of something else-the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ implies the termination of many things that had been in existence for thousands of years
There has been a difference of opinion among Bible expositors concerning the time of the beginning of the gospel
As we consider this matter we need to remember that the Gospel of Mark reveals Jesus Christ as the entire universal allinclusive replacement
He was transformed before them; and His garments became brilliant, exceedingly white, such as no fuller on earth could whiten them'
In a way, Peter's word was somewhat reasonable, for the Lord Jesus and two great persons from the Old Testament were present on the mountain
According to Jewish custom, God's people considered the Old Testament as having two major sections: the Law and the Prophets
Now when we read Mark 1:1 we need to have the understanding that the beginning of the gospel means the termination of the old things
If brother James were with us today, we should ask him if he realized that the things of the Old Testament should be terminated
As the leading elder in Jerusalem, he addressed his Epistle not to the church or the New Testament saints but to the twelve tribes
As far as human living in society is concerned, we all must care for morality, ethics, behavior, and character
They pointed out that both the Bible and Confucius teach the honoring of parents and the submitting of wives to their husbands
These missionaries also said that both the Bible and Confucius teach humility, honesty, integrity, faithfulness, and other such virtues
In a similar way, there is a great difference between human virtues and Christian virtues produced by the divine life and nature
Christian virtues are the product not of outward effort but of an inward nature the divine nature that we have received through regeneration
If we would live God and express Him, we need to see that it is necessary even for the natural human virtues to be terminated
In the foregoing message we considered the significance of the phrase 'the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ' in 1:1
Verse 4 says, 'John the baptizer came in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins'
Whenever a person repents and believes in the Lord we should terminate the old life and old self of that one by baptizing him by burying him
If the Lord Jesus did not have anything to do with the old creation, how could He be the Savior of the old creation?
As the One with the Father within Him as His essence and the Spirit upon Him as the power for His move and work, He began to minister
In His move, His work, the Lord Jesus was not a person merely of morality or ethics, and He was not a person of religion
After His baptism, with the Spirit upon Him, the Lord Jesus was a person absolutely of God inwardly and outwardly
Inwardly He had God the Father as His essence; outwardly He had the Spirit of God as His power to move, act, minister, and preach
Whatever He did, whatever He preached and taught, the way He behaved and ministered-everything was in the kingdom of God
When the Lord Jesus came out to minister, He did not teach ethics, the keeping of the law, or the priestly service of God
He served God by preaching the gospel, teaching the truth, casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing the leper
He worked everywhere and all the time because His work was His life, His life was His move, and His move was His work
Today we all should live a life of preaching, teaching, casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing the lepers
The matter we are emphasizing is the life itself, the life of God fully according to and for His New Testament economy
If you live a life of God, after a period of time certain of your colleagues may experience the forgiveness of sins
Before you came in contact with them, they were under condemnation and had no real joy, satisfaction, or freedom
As a result of your gospel preaching, not merely by words but by life, the truth shines into them and they have the forgiveness of sins
A life that is fully according to and for God's New Testament economy is very different from religion, which emphasizes human effort
All these are aspects not of a life of ethics, morality, religion, or culture, but of a life that is of God and according to God
The mystery we shall consider in this message is the mystery of the Lord Jesus as the Sower, the seed, and the kingdom
As we shall see, in the Gospel of Mark the Sower is a person, the seed is a person, and the kingdom is a person
In His answer He said to them, 'The kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, Look, here!
By the time of Mark 4, that Holy of Holies had been passed over by God, and the new Holy of Holies was the boat where the Lord Jesus was
If you have been terminated, you will see that in Mark 4 the disciples were with the Lord Jesus in the boat that was the Holy of Holies
In 4:1, after ministering in the three foregoing chapters, the Lord Jesus got into a boat and taught the people 'many things in parables'
The first parable was the parable of the sower , which opens with the words, 'Behold, the sower went out to sow'
The situation is the same regarding teaching the truth, casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing the leper
When He preached the gospel, taught the truth, cast out demons, healed the sick, and cleansed the leper, He was a Sower sowing the seed
Concerning this, 1:31 says, 'And coming to her, He raised her up, holding her hand; and the fever left her, and she served them'
When the Lord Jesus touched the leper and cleansed him, do you not believe that something from Him was sown into the one who was cleansed?
The cleansed leper and Peter's mother-in-law probably were not conscious of the fact that something had been sown into them by the Lord
After Peter's mother-in-law was healed, she served, and after the leper was cleansed, he moved in a different way
Verse 14 says that the Lord Jesus preached the gospel of God and verse 15 says that the Lord declared that the kingdom of God had drawn near
We have been emphasizing the fact that in the Gospel of Mark we see a life that lives according to God's New Testament economy
These ten items cover the thoughts, ideas, and concepts of all people, including Gentiles, Jews, and Christians
People everywhere have their minds occupied with culture, religion, ethics, morality, the improvement of character, and philosophy
According to the Gospel of Mark, the Lord Jesus did not teach culture, religion, ethics, morality, improvement of character, or philosophy
Because a child may strongly resist, the parents may have to hold him down and open his mouth in order to put the medicine into him
It may have been necessary for us to be put into a difficult situation before we opened to the Lord to receive Him as the divine seed
The Gospel of Mark shows the Lord Jesus living and working in such a way as to sow Himself as seed into people
If we say that Peter was saved when he was called in Mark 1, we may wonder why he did not show any signs of being a saved one
My point here is that the Lord Jesus as the Sower went through a lengthy process to sow Himself into Peter and the other disciples
Some may think that for the Lord to take three and a half years to accomplish the sowing of Himself into Peter was too long
Neither is the New Testament economy of God merely a matter of helping us to improve in being more scriptural spiritual holy and victorious
Is it merely a doctrine to you that God in His economy is sowing a wonderful Person, Jesus Christ the Son of God, into you?
From the Word of God and our experience we know that Jesus Christ is not only in the heavens but is also in us
Recently we have seen that the Gospel of Mark presents a life that is fully according to and for God's New Testament economy
We need to be impressed with the fact that in His economy God does not care for anything other than Jesus Christ
God's New Testament economy is to sow this Person into our being so that we may live a life that is fully according to God's economy
In a previous message we pointed out that in chapter eight of Mark we have a revelation of Christ, His death, and His resurrection
He brought forgiveness to people, and He also brought them into the enjoyment of Himself as righteousness outwardly and life inwardly
Although these are separate cases in the Gospel of Mark, spiritually speaking, they describe the condition of every human being
The four cases of healing in chapters one through three are all in the same category, the category of general healings
As our representative Peter was healed of his fever leprosy paralysis and withered condition however still he could not hear speak or see
In these four cases three particular organs are healed: the hearing organ, the speaking organ, and the seeing organ
The Lord laid His hands upon the man's eyes again, and 'he looked intently and was restored, and he saw all things clearly'
Jesus said to him, 'Go, your faith has healed you' , and immediately Bartimaeus recovered his sight and followed the Lord on the road
Spiritually speaking, our relationship with God depends upon the hearing organ, the speaking organ, and the seeing organ
If we cannot hear God's word, if we cannot talk to God, and if we cannot see God's vision, we cannot have any relationship with Him
She was Syrian by tongue, Phoenician by race , and- the Phoenicians being descendants of the Canaanites-a Canaanite woman
In chapter two of Acts, Peter is not only alive; he is strong in life and in the ability to hear, speak, and see
As the children were eating at the table, the pet dogs were waiting under the table for any crumbs that might fall
Rather, in this Gospel we see that the Lord Jesus was anointed by God to fulfill the commission to sow God into His people
According to the New Testament revelation, this is the first aspect of Christ's commission, and we all need to see it
We need to believe that Jesus is the Son of God because His Person as the Son of God is a matter of eternal life
In order for the Son of God to carry out His commission to impart Himself into us as life, He must be God's anointed One
It is by being the Christ that the Lord Jesus imparts Himself into us as the Son of God so that we may have eternal life
Some may wonder how we know that Peter and the other disciples later came to have such an understanding of the events recorded in Mark
After the Lord and the disciples came into Capernaum, He questioned them, 'What were you reasoning about on the road'?
The Lord had told them definitely that He was to be killed and then would rise after three days, but they did not understand a word
Immediately after He unveiled His death and resurrection to them the second time, they argued with one another regarding who was greater
Immediately after He spoke this clear word, James and John said to Him, 'Teacher, we desire that whatever we ask You, You will do for us'
Even though the disciples were so blind and lacking in understanding, the Lord Jesus would not swerve from His goal
Proof of our blindness consists in the fact that we may listen to message after message without seeing anything
The Gospels are biographies of this Person, and the remainder of the New Testament is the definition and explanation of this Person
We need to spend much time in reading the Epistles in order to see the definition of the life recorded in Mark
In Ephesians 2:6 Paul says that God 'raised us up together and seated us together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus'
The biography narrated in Mark is not only a biography of the individual Jesus but also a biography of the believers
From the time Peter was called by the Lord Jesus in 1:16 and 17, he was captured by Him and was always with Him
According to God's point of view, which is beyond the elements of space and time, we all were included in Christ's resurrection
If we had only the Gospel of Mark, it would not be possible for us to have such an understanding of Peter's relationship to the Lord
In the Epistles we see that Christ died on the cross as an all-inclusive One, as the One who included in Himself all whom God had chosen
Today we are His expansion, increase, and continuation, and we should continue to live the kind of life He lived
All Christians have been frustrated and damaged by the good that is related to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Anything apart from the life-giving Spirit is a frustration to the life that is fully according to and for God's New Testament economy
The life we live should not be a life of culture, religion, ethics, morality, philosophy, or improvement of character
In Galatians and Philippians we see that the religion founded according to God's Word was keeping the believers from living Christ
Galatians and Philippians deal with the frustration caused by Judaism, and Colossians deals with the frustration caused by philosophy
Consider, for example, the lengthy account of the conception and birth of John the Baptist and the conception and birth of the Lord Jesus
John's Gospel opens in a mysterious way: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
As we have seen, the word 'beginning' in 1:1 implies a new start, and this new start involves the termination of the old things
In a similar way, when the Lord Jesus stepped into the waters of baptism, He brought with Him all ten items of the old things
Of living according to these ten items, He lived a life that was fully according to and for God's New Testament economy
We need to be deeply impressed with the matter of a life fully according to and for God's New Testament economy
The development of the Lord as the seed of the kingdom is His Body, and His Body is His increase, His enlargement
Only the kind of life lived by the Lord Jesus is a life in which the Triune God is dispensed into God's chosen people
A living that is according to culture, religion, ethics, and morality is not the living that dispenses God into man
The seed sown by the Lord Jesus, a seed that was actually the Lord Jesus Himself, is the embodiment of the Triune God
As we read the Gospel of Mark, we need to see that the Lord Jesus was living a life of sowing the Triune God into His believers as the soil
The case of Peter's mother-in-law, who was sick with a fever, indicates that, spiritually speaking, we all have a fever
The person portrayed by these cases has been healed and is no longer abnormal in temperature and is no longer unclean paralyzed and withered
The Lord laid His hands upon his eyes, and the man 'looked intently and was restored, and he saw all things clearly'
Immediately after the healing of the blind man in Bethsaida, the Lord Jesus went with His disciples into the villages of Caesarea Philippi
The fact that they could make such a request proves that they were blind and in need of the Lord's specific healing
On the Mount of Transfiguration the Lord Jesus gave a demonstration to Peter, James, and John concerning who He was
He was transformed before them; and His garments became brilliant, exceedingly white, such as no fuller on earth could whiten them'
Mark 9:7 says, 'And a cloud came overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, This is My Son, the Beloved
According to our experience, we may say that we were put into Christ when we believed into Him and were baptized into Him
In chapter one of Mark the Christ into whom we were put by God in eternity past came to be baptized by John the Baptist
If we have the view presented in Paul's Epistles, we shall realize that we were baptized in the Jordan with the Lord Jesus
We need the fourteen Epistles of Paul to give the adequate definition of Christ's Person and of His death and resurrection
By now we all should have a clear view of the Lord Jesus as the One who lived a life of sowing the Triune God into His disciples
As the soil collected by Him, the disciples were in a condition portrayed by the different cases in the Gospel of Mark
In the first two chapters of Acts we see that Peter and the one hundred twenty had become the reproduction of the Lord Jesus
Just as the Lord Jesus lived absolutely according to and for Gods New Testament economy so the one hundred twenty in Acts lived the same way
In Acts 21 and in the book of James, however, we see a contrast to the life that is fully according to and for God's New Testament economy
Mainly with James we see a life that is according to the Old Testament, a life according to religion and ethics
It is helpful in our reading of the Gospel of Mark to have an understanding of the situation when the Lord Jesus was on earth
One aspect of this culture was the religion of the Jews, a strong, typical religion formed according to God's holy Word
With this as the background, the Lord Jesus came forth in His ministry to sow Himself as a seed into God's chosen people
Have you ever realized that the Lord Jesus came to the center of the inhabited earth to sow Himself as a seed into God's chosen people?
The phrase 'the gospel of God' does not simply mean that the gospel is of God in the sense of belonging to God
We should not think that besides the kingdom of God or in addition to the kingdom of God, there is something called the gospel
The problem among Christians is that, for the most part, they read the Bible according to their natural understanding
Paul knew that in this Epistle spiritual mysteries would be unveiled, and he knew that he had to use human language
He did not give a message in chapters one through three; neither did He give a message in chapters five through sixteen
The reason we emphasize the Lord's sowing is that the proper understanding of preaching the gospel has been spoiled
The gospel the Lord preached is the kingdom of God that has drawn near, and the kingdom of God that is near is the gospel
As He was about to begin His ministry of sowing, the first thing the Lord Jesus did was to have Himself baptized
Culture, religion, ethics, morality, philosophy, improvement of character-all these are weeds that are competing with the wheat
In this message we have seen that the things of culture and religion were terminated when the Lord Jesus was baptized
We have also seen that in His ministry He sowed Himself into God's people for the development of the kingdom of God
On the one hand the kingdom of God is for the fulfillment of Gods eternal purpose on the other hand the kingdom of God is for our enjoyment
Immediately after this we have the record of the Lord's calling four of His disciples: Simon, Andrew, James, and John
In the foregoing message we pointed out that the Lord preached the gospel by sowing Himself as the seed into people
In 1:16-20 we see four of those whom the Lord gathered to be the soil into which He sowed Himself as the seed of the kingdom
We have seen that in Mark the Lord Jesus gathered the soil and put it into His pocket in order to sow Himself into it
The Father had chosen them before the foundation of the world, and the Lord had come to do the will of God the Father
Diseases are healed in man's body through this basic life principle in which old things die out and new things are produced
If we understand this principle, we shall see how the Lord Jesus heals the soil into which He sows Himself as the seed of the kingdom
He heals the soil by bringing it to the cross and causing it to die out and then bringing it into resurrection
When we come to chapter one of Acts we see that Peter Andrew John and James with the remainder of the one hundred twenty were no longer sick
As a result of being healed through Christ's death and resurrection, the chosen people of God were recovered and became good soil
Through His death and resurrection the Lord Jesus not only healed the soil, but He also released God's life and imparted it into the soil
Through His death the divine life in Him was released, and through His resurrection this life was imparted to the soil
The fact that the disciples became good soil and began to grow Christ does not mean that the 'weeds' could not grow in them again
Many of the saints who have been under this ministry for years are still under the influence of their cultural and religious background
What is revealed in the New Testament regarding the kingdom of God is that the kingdom is a Person, not a material realm
He was transformed before them; and His garments became brilliant, exceedingly white, such as no fuller on earth could whiten them'
When we put these verses together, we see that the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus was the coming of the kingdom
We need to consider this understanding of the kingdom as the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus in the light of our experience
The transfiguration of a seed requires the growth of that seed into a mature plant and the blossoming of that plant
If the Lord who is in you has not yet been transfigured, others will not be able to see the kingdom of God in you
Since we have not yet experienced this kind of transfiguration, we need the Lord to grow in us until He blossoms
We need Him to grow in us until by transfiguration He blossoms into the expression of the kingdom of God in our experience
In the parable of the seed the Lord said, 'So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth'
Later, in 9:1, the Lord told His disciples that some standing there would not taste death until they saw the kingdom of God come in power
Immediately after speaking this word concerning the kingdom the Lord Jesus was transfigured on the mountaintop before Peter James and John
Now in chapter nine this seed is transfigured, and this transfiguration of the seed is the coming of the kingdom of God
We have the Lord Jesus living within us, but we may not have given Him the opportunity to be transfigured in us
On the day of the Lord's transfiguration on the mountaintop there was the coming, the appearing, of the kingdom
We all need to see that Gods eternal plan which is His New Testament economy is to dispense Himself as the Triune God into His chosen people
Through His death and resurrection, the Lord not only healed the soil, but also became the replacement for God's people
If a married brother has the thought of trying to be a good husband, he should drop that thought and simply live a life of God
He has not been destined to live a life of loving his wife; rather, he has been destined to live a life of God
We should not be occupied even with good things such as ethics and improvement of character or be frustrated by these things
The incident concerning the rich man in Mark 10 is an illustration of our need to be free from being occupied by anything except God Himself
When some read about the rich man in Mark 10, they may rejoice over the fact that they are poor and not at all like the rich man
We need to empty ourselves so that all of the space within us will be available for the growth of the Lord Jesus in us
We should not regard the kingdom as a material realm that we shall enter one day after certain terms have been fulfilled
That is a traditional concept of the kingdom of God, not the teaching concerning the kingdom in the New Testament
If you do not agree with this understanding today, eventually you will agree that it is according to the New Testament revelation
The reason the growth of Christ in us is our entrance into the kingdom is that this growing is the developing of the kingdom
We shall be in the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age, and we shall be in the reality of the kingdom today
If we see the vision of a life fully according to and for God's New Testament economy, our entire Christian life will be revolutionized
In 2 Peter 1:3-11 we have a further indication that the development of the kingdom within us is actually our entrance into the kingdom
In verses 5 through 11 we have the development through growth in life unto the rich entrance into the eternal kingdom
We would emphasize the fact that this entrance is supplied through the development of the divine life within us
In the Gospel of Mark we see the Lord Jesus as the One who lived a life according to God's New Testament economy
Having seen all this in the foregoing messages, let us now go on to see how the disciples are the continuation of the Lord Jesus
Forty days after His resurrection, the Lord commanded the disciples to remain in Jerusalem for the Holy Spirit to descend upon them
In John 20 we have the Spirit inwardly for life; in Acts 1 we have the Spirit outwardly for power, for baptism
In a similar way, the baptism in the Holy Spirit is a matter of the Spirit coming upon us outwardly so that we may have power
The Lord's word to the disciples concerning the Holy Spirit in chapter one of Acts was fulfilled in chapter two
In John 20 and Acts 2 we have two symbols of the Holy Spirit: the breath for life inwardly and the wind for power outwardly
At the age of thirty, when He came forth to minister, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him, and He was baptized in the Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit for the Lord's conception was essential, whereas the Holy Spirit for His ministry was economical
Because the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit essentially, the Spirit became the essence of His being
Since the Lord carried out God's economy by the economical Spirit, the disciples had to carry out God's economy by the economical Spirit
We have emphasized that in John 20:22 the disciples received the Holy Spirit essentially for their spiritual being and existence
After Christ's death and resurrection, the disciples received the essential Spirit as the source of their spiritual being
The disciples had the essential Spirit for their spiritual being, but they still needed the Holy Spirit to descend upon them economically
Some may say that they received the Holy Spirit essentially when they were regenerated and economically at a time after their regeneration
Each time a person believes in Him does the Lord come to that one to breathe on him and then baptize him in the Holy Spirit?
After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus came to His disciples and, regarding them as His Body, breathed the Holy Spirit into them essentially
He now has a share in the Lord's breathing of the Spirit essentially into the Body and in His baptizing the Body in the Spirit economically
Let us first consider some verses related to the economical Spirit and then verses related to the essential Spirit
Acts 1:5 says, 'For John indeed baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now'
To be filled with the Spirit of power is for God's economy, but to be filled with the Spirit of life is for our spiritual existence
In the foregoing message we pointed out that in the book of Acts we have both the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit
In Acts we see that the Spirit in two aspects, the essential aspect and the economical aspect, is actually the Lord Himself
In the book of Acts we see that after His resurrection and ascension Christ became the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit
In 1 Corinthians 15:45 Paul says, 'The first man, Adam, became a living soul; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'
Although 1 Corinthians 15:45 says that Christ, the last Adam, in resurrection became a life-giving Spirit, some regard this as heresy
In 2 Corinthians 3:17 Paul says, 'And the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom'
On the one hand, Paul says that the Lord is the Spirit; on the other hand, he speaks of the Spirit of the Lord
The expression 'the Lord Spirit' again proves that the Lord Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Lord Christ
In the Gospel of Mark we see Jesus, and in the book of Acts we have the Spirit of the Lord and the Spirit of Jesus
We may say that the life- giving Spirit is the blossoming of the Lord as the seed that passed through death and resurrection
The difference is that the seed is the carnation in seed form, whereas the blossom is the carnation in blossom form
The Spirit of Christ, therefore, is the totality, the aggregate, of the all-inclusive Christ with His all-inclusive death and resurrection
Because we have this Spirit as the blossom of Christ, we have the all-inclusive Christ and His all-inclusive termination and germination
In a sense, James and John prayed when they asked the Lord that He would grant them to sit at His right and left in His kingdom
Since we are in Romans 8, we should not tell the Lord in prayer how miserable we are or how pitiful our condition is
Paul is saying that his situation will turn out to salvation through the bountiful supply of the aggregate Spirit
Paul did not pray this way in the book of Philippians, nor did he pray like this when he and Silas were in prison in Acts 16
Paul counted all such things loss for the sake of the aggregate Spirit so that he might be found in Christ, not in anything else
We have seen that we need to praise the Lord that we have received this pneumatic Christ that we have received Him as the lifegiving Spirit
To ask such a question is to give ground for the 'weeds' of the ten items that are replacements for Christ to grow in us
Praise Him that we have received His breathing of the essential Spirit and His baptizing with the economical Spirit
We have also seen that in the book of Acts there are two aspects of the Spirit-the essential aspect and the economical aspect
The Spirit of God, who is now the Spirit of Jesus and even the Spirit of Jesus Christ, is both essential and economical
For our spiritual being we have the essential Spirit, and for our work to carry out God's economy we have the economical Spirit
Recently, through the Life-study of Mark, we saw that there is another way to divide the New Testament into sections
At the age of thirty, the Spirit descended upon the Lord Jesus economically, and He was anointed with the Spirit for His ministry
When at the age of thirty He came forth to minister, the Spirit of God descended upon Him not essentially but economically
As the Lord Jesus was ministering on earth, He lived by the essential Spirit and ministered by the economical Spirit
As the One who was the embodiment of the Triune God as God's tabernacle and God's temple, the Lord Jesus lived the life of God
According to the revelation in the four Gospels, the issue of the living of this wonderful One is the kingdom of God
In the Gospels we see that the Son came with the Father and by the Spirit to be the embodiment of the Triune God in Jesus Christ
As indicated by the chart, the second section of the New Testament includes the twenty-two books from Acts through Jude
To say that the church is the Body of Christ and the temple of God is to say that the church is the kingdom of God and the house of God
In the first section, we see the embodiment of the Triune God living the life of God to develop into the kingdom of God
In the first section we have the Son; in the second section, the Spirit; and in the third section, the seven Spirits
The fact that the seven Spirits are mentioned second indicates that the seven Spirits are from the eternal One and are also of the Redeemer
Since the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the Lamb, the seven Spirits surely are of the Lamb, the Redeemer
On the chart we point out that the seven Spirits out from the eternal One and of the Redeemer are the intensification of the Triune God
Also in these chapters the following word is repeated seven times: 'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches'
According to the book of Revelation, the overcoming church consummates in the golden lampstands and, ultimately, the New Jerusalem
The seven Spirits as the intensification of the Triune God in the overcoming church are the finalization of the New Testament economy
According to the record of the Gospel of Mark, the disciples followed the Lord Jesus in the way of being brought into Him
In the book of Acts we can see that the disciples participated in Christ and enjoyed Him through His all-inclusive death and resurrection
The twenty-one Epistles from Romans through Jude are needed to define what is presented in summary in the book of Acts
After the detailed definition in the Epistles, we have the consummation of God's New Testament economy in the book of Revelation
In the lampstand we see God the Father as the nature, God the Son as the form, and God the Spirit as the expression
The New Testament consummates with a full hope, with the seven Spirits transforming a seemingly hopeless church into a pure golden lampstand
Praise the Lord for the sevenfold intensified Spirit in the overcoming church, consummating in the golden lampstands!
Do you prefer to stay with the Spirit in the book of Acts, or do you prefer the seven Spirits in the book of Revelation?
Since we are in the book of Revelation, all the churches should realize that now is not a time of discouragement or disappointment
If we turn our eyes to the sevenfold intensification of the Triune God, we shall be filled with praise to the Lord
Revelation 4:5 says, 'And seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God'
We see that the Spirit is intensified to be the seven Spirits who are the seven eyes of the Lamb, the Redeemer
We see that at the very end of the book of Revelation, the bride, which is the church, becomes one with the Spirit
The New Jerusalem is a sign of the aggregate of God's chosen people both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament
The New Jerusalem is a living composition of God's chosen, redeemed, saved, regenerated, and transformed people
At the center of the New Jerusalem is the throne of God, and out from the throne flows the river of water of life
We may use the petrification of wood as an illustration of how the flow of the Triune God imparts the divine essence to us
In 1 Corinthians 12:13 Paul says that we were all baptized in the one Spirit and were all made to drink of this Spirit
In the New Jerusalem the Triune God will be our life to saturate us, satisfy us, and regulate, guide, and direct us
