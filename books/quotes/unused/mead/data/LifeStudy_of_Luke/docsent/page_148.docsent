   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LOAF AND CUP OF THE LORD S TABLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Luke 22:19 says, And having taken a loaf, when He had given thanks, He broke it, and gave it to them, saying, This is My body which is given for you; do this unto the remembrance of Me. The loaf in verse 19 is not the loaf of the Passover; it is the loaf of the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Furthermore, in this verse the Lord said, Do this unto the remembrance of Me. Thus, it was not a remembrance of what took place in Exodus 12.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Taking the bread of the Lord s table is done in remembrance of the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 20 says, And similarly the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is being poured out for you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once again, this is not the cup of the Passover; rather, this cup is the new covenant in the Lord s blood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God made a covenant with redeemed Israel in Exodus 24:3-8 Heb 9:18-21 , which became the old testament, as a base for Him to deal with His redeemed people in the dispensation of law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Man-Savior came to accomplish God s eternal redemption for God s chosen people by His death, according to God s will Heb 10:7, 9-10 , and with His blood instituted a new covenant, a better covenant Heb 8:6-13 , which became the new testament after His resurrection Heb 9:16-17 , as a base for God to be one with His redeemed and regenerated people in the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This new covenant replaced the old covenant and simultaneously changed God s old dispensation to His new dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Man-Savior wanted His disciples to know this and live a life based on it and according to it after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>REMEMBERING THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have emphasized the fact that the Man-Savior instituted His supper, the Lord s table, after He and the disciples ate the Passover feast.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He initiated His supper for His believers remembrance of Him to continue and replace the Passover feast, the Old Testament practice of the elect s remembrance of the Lord s salvation Exo 12:14; 13:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This new practice of the New Testament is to remember the Man-Savior by eating the bread, which signifies His body given for His believers 1 Cor 11:24 , and drinking the cup, which signifies His blood shed for their sins Matt 26:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The bread denotes life John 6:35 , the life of God, the eternal life, and the cup denotes blessing 1 Cor 10:16 , which is God Himself as their portion Psa 16:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As sinners, their portion should have been the cup of God s wrath Rev 14:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the Man-Savior drank that cup for them John 18:11 , and His salvation has become their portion, the cup of salvation Psa 116:13 that runs over Psa 23:5 , the content of which is God as their all-inclusive blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such bread and such a cup are the constituents of the Man-Savior s supper, which is a table 1 Cor 10:21 , a feast, set up by Him so that His believers may remember Him by enjoying Him as such a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus they testify of His rich and marvelous salvation to the entire universe and display His redeeming and life-imparting death 1 Cor 11:26 .</S>
