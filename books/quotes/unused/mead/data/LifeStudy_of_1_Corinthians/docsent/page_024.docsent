   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SIGNS AND WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 22 says, Since Jews indeed ask for signs and Greeks seek wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A sign is a miraculous token Matt 12:38-39 to substantiate what is preached.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Religion needs signs, and the Jews kept requiring them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Wisdom pertains to philosophy and was constantly sought by the Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 22 Paul refers to two kinds of people to religious Jews and philosophical Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The religious ones desire signs, miracles, and the philosophical ones pursue wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in preaching Christ crucified, Paul cared for neither wisdom nor signs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, the Jews mocked Him and said, You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Matt 27:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The chief priests, the scribes, and the elders said, He saved others; himself he cannot save!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is king of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe on him v. 42 . They challenged the Lord to prove that He was the Christ, the Son of God, by delivering Himself from the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the Lord remained silent; He did not do anything to save Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead of a miracle and wisdom, there were weakness and foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to man s wisdom, it would be utterly foolish to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In saying, I am of Paul, or I am of Cephas, the Corinthians were exercising their wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were following their philosophy, not following Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But Paul preached to them Christ crucified, an offense to miracle-seeking Jews and wisdom-pursuing Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But to those who are called, this Christ is God s wisdom and God s power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>PREACHING CHRIST CRUCIFIED</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is significant that Paul did not tell the Corinthians, We preach Christ resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The focus of the preaching in Acts is on the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the book of Acts, this preaching is a testimony that Jesus Christ, the One who was crucified, has been resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But in this Epistle Paul does not emphasize Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, he emphasizes the preaching of Christ crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No doubt, both the Jews and the Greeks would have preferred to hear of a resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For Jews, this would have been a great miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How miraculous for someone to rise out of the tomb and ascend into the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Greeks may have regarded a word about resurrection as very philosophical.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In their quest for wisdom they may have been interested to learn how a dead person could become alive again.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, Paul preached a crucified Christ, a Christ who did not do anything to save Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul followed this crucified Christ and preached Him to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, verse 23 declares, But we preach Christ crucified, to Jews an offense, and to the nations foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was offensive to Jews and foolishness to Greeks that Paul followed a crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In verse 24 Paul goes on to say, But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, God s power and God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who are called are the believers who were chosen by God in eternity Eph 1:4 and who believed in Christ in time Acts 13:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To these called ones, the crucified Christ preached by the apostles is God s power and God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Wisdom is for planning, for purposing; power is for carrying out, for accomplishing, what is planned and purposed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In God s economy Christ is both.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Praise the Lord that for us today the crucified Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In verse 25 Paul concludes, Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even God s foolishness is wiser than our wisdom, and His weakness stronger than our strength.</S>
