<h2 class="head2">Assistance from Hebrew Religion (Judaism)</h2>
<p>In a sense, the church came out of Judaism; at least, the first group of people in the church came out of Judaism. The Old Testament occupies a significant portion of the Bible read by the church. The Jews and the members of the church believe in and worship the same one God. From a historical viewpoint, the early members of the church received most of their knowledge of God from Judaism. From a spiritual viewpoint, the revelation they received came from the Old Testament, which was originally in the hands of the Jews. Thus, Judaism gave the church a great advantage.</p>
<p>A very small portion, perhaps only one percent, of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry on the earth was in the realm of the Gentiles and to the Gentiles; the remaining ninety-nine percent was in Judaism and for the Jews. The &ldquo;manger&rdquo; that produced the church was the Jewish temple in Jerusalem; the temple was the place in which the church was produced. In Acts 1 the one hundred and twenty were praying in the upper room (v. 13) when they received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit (2:2-4), but their meetings were held in the Jewish temple (v. 46). If Judaism had not persecuted the church, we would have to acknowledge that it helped the church enormously.</p>
<p>In the early days the apostles preached the gospel in Jewish synagogues (9:20; 13:5, 14; 14:1; 18:4; 19:8). Thus, they did not need to build meeting halls or prepare seating. Even after Paul passed through Asia and came to Macedonia in Europe, he went to a place of prayer beside the river on the Sabbath to preach the gospel (16:13). This was a convenience given to the church by Judaism. Furthermore, the Old Testament had been translated into Greek (the Septuagint version) so that even Greek-speaking Gentiles could read it. Paul did not need to print Bibles; he could simply enter a synagogue and read the Bible, and everyone could understand. Today we frequently encounter difficulties in new fields for the gospel; however, the early apostles had the convenience of Judaism as a bridge and medium for their preaching of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Assistance from Greek Culture</h2>
<p>Greek culture helped the church most by providing a unified language. When I first began to serve the Lord, I encountered the problem of not having a unified language. I went from Shantung Province to Shanghai and encountered a different dialect, which made it difficult to communicate in preaching the word and prayer. It was difficult to communicate even when going to the store. After the Sino-Japanese War, the situation changed; we could speak the Mandarin dialect wherever we went&mdash;even in Hong Kong. At least seventy percent of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia can speak Mandarin Chinese; there are a few elderly ones who cannot speak it, but at least they understand it. This aids our preaching of the gospel. Although we speak different Chinese dialects, at least the different dialects have the same written form and are from the same linguistic family. Despite these similarities, however, we still have problems in communication. Imagine how difficult it would have been in the age of the apostles if writing and speech were not in one unified language. It would have been even more difficult to spread the gospel.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord for His preparation work. Before the church was produced, Greek writing and speech had become prevalent in the region around the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, when the apostles were writing the New Testament, they gave up Hebrew and used Greek. Greek was the unifying language of the peoples surrounding the Mediterranean Sea; this was a great convenience to the church. Greek was the most appropriate language for the Holy Spirit to use in developing the truth; it was more appropriate for the New Testament to be written in Greek than in Hebrew. When the early apostles went out to preach the gospel, churches were easily raised up in many localities. This was by the power of the Holy Spirit, but the Greek language was undoubtedly a help in the endeavor.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 2, The Course of the Church &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
