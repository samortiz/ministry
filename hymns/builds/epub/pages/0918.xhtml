<div class='line'><b>1</b> Christians, make haste, your mission high fulfilling,</div>
<div class='line'>To tell to all the world that God is Light,</div>
<div class='line'>That He who made all nation is not willing</div>
<div class='line'>One soul should perish, lost in shades of night.</div>
</div>
<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;</div>
<div class='line'>Tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> Behold how many thousands still are lying,</div>
<div class='line'>Bound in the darksome prison-house of sin,</div>
<div class='line'>With none to tell them of the Savior's dying</div>
<div class='line'>Or of the life He died for them to win.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> 'Tis yours to save from peril of perdition</div>
<div class='line'>The soul for whom the Lord His life laid down;</div>
<div class='line'>Beware lest, slothful to fulfill your mission,</div>
<div class='line'>You lose one jewel that should deck His crown.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> Proclaim to every people, tongue, and nation</div>
<div class='line'>That God, in whom they move and live, is love;</div>
<div class='line'>Tell how He stooped to save His lost creation,</div>
<div class='line'>And died on earth that men He might approve.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>5</b> Give of your sons to bear the message glorious;</div>
<div class='line'>Give of your wealth to speed them on their way;</div>
<div class='line'>Pour out your soul for them in prayer victorious,</div>
<div class='line'>And all you spend our Savior will repay.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>6</b> He comes again; O brothers, ere you meet Him,</div>
<div class='line'>Make known to every heart His saving grace;</div>
<div class='line'>Let none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him,</div>
<div class='line'>Through your neglect unfit to see His face.</div>
