   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I would like to mention one thing in passing.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many places in the Bible symbolize the world: Ur of the Chaldees symbolizes the confusion of the world, Sodom and Gomorrah symbolize the pleasure of sin and the evil of the world, and Egypt symbolizes the fact that the world is under the authority of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These three places symbolize the world, but each symbol has its own unique emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lot was able to let go of Ur's chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, he was reluctant to give up something when he reached Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A Christian is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After believing in the Lord, he may be unwilling to abandon spiritual fame and position in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Formerly, he struggled and strove in the world; now he strives and struggles in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Originally, he was struggling for gain in an idolatrous profession.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now he is struggling for gain in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Genesis 13:8-9 says, "And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One reason Christians fall is that they cannot dwell together with other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The moment you realize that you cannot live with other Christians, you will find that you can no longer communicate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever you say that Christians are worse than your relatives, you will become afraid to see them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is evidence that something has gone wrong with your spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever you find that you cannot get along with other Christians, that is the time when you are being defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the blame was with Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Abraham was the head of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lot was a young man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lot gained his inheritance through his uncle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He should not have allowed his herdmen to strive with Abraham's herdmen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With Abraham there was no strife; with him, there was always the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lot should have said, "My cattle can starve to death, but I cannot leave my uncle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is only one family who believes in the Lord in the land of Canaan, how can I depart?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet Lot did not think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He thought that it was more important for his cattle to have grass to eat than for himself to be fed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He would rather have a breach in fellowship with his uncle than lose his cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He would rather renounce his spiritual achievement than allow his possessions to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He would rather drop Abraham than one of his cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Since today my uncle opened his mouth and asked me to choose, I should choose the best."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>So he made his choice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Genesis 13:10 says, "And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first thing that stepped in was material goods.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Young people are very bold when they first believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Lot left when his uncle left.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later after tasting the flavor of the world, it seemed that the matter of believing in the Lord could be set aside and that fellowship with other Christians need not be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He "lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He did not care whether or not Abraham's cattle had grass to feed on.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He cared only for his own cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brothers and sisters, I will not ask how many years you have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I only want to tell you that today God has set two ways before you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God puts the world before you, and He also spreads the land of Canaan before you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God wants to see how you will choose.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Lot beheld all the plain of Jordan unto Zoar.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was like the garden of the Lord and the land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the one hand, it was like paradise; on the other hand, it was like Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sodom and Gomorrah represent the sinful pleasure of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The worldly people seek pleasure in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Genesis 13:11 says, "Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the world there are blessings, glory, and pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, Lot chose all the plain of Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Perhaps he thought, "This is somewhat like paradise!"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A brother once sinned, and I asked him how he felt.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He said that there was a bit of heaven's pleasure in it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After he believed in the Lord, he found out that he could not do this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now that he committed a little sin, he found some pleasure in it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Lot's eyes, Sodom and Gomorrah were like paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am afraid that what the world shows us is a little like heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, Sodom and Gomorrah also look somewhat like Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A Christian's conscience enables him to know that there is a distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is like paradise, but it is also like Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is pleasure in it, but there is also pain.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In Egypt the Israelites were slaves to the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They were afflicted and scourged by the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They were not given straw, but they still had to produce bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, the Israelites wanted to leave Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you love the world, you may have some amount of pleasure and blessing, and you may feel that the world is like paradise, but your conscience will make you feel uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>On the one hand, many Christians feel happy when they sin.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>On the other hand, their conscience does not give them peace.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Oh, it is like paradise in one aspect, and yet it is similar to Egypt in another aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>On the one hand, there is the pleasure of paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>On the other hand, there is the affliction of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What is the preference of all the young brothers and sisters here today?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Is it the world?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Or is it pleasure?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God does not force you to take a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God wants you to make the choice yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Are you an Abraham choosing Canaan?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Or are you a Lot preferring the world?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Lot did not choose to live in the city; he only chose to be outside the city.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>All the plain of Jordan was a pleasure, but at the same time, it was a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Where are you living day after day?</S>
