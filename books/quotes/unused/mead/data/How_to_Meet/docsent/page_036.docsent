   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SINGING IN OUR SINGING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The answer is this: when we are singing to the Father, Jesus is singing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now is the time when Hebrews 2:12 is being fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we are singing a hymn to the Father, Jesus, the firstborn among many brethren, is singing within our singing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That is the way He sings praises to the Father in the midst of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He sings within our singing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But here is a problem: are you sure that whenever you sing in the church, Christ is singing within your singing?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When you say Amen, does Christ say Amen within you?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Are you assured that when you say Hallelujah, Christ also says Hallelujah within your Hallelujah?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you could not say yes, then I must tell you to shut your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Don t say Hallelujah any more unless you are assured that when you say Hallelujah, the Lord Jesus says Hallelujah within you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do you feel after reading this that I am binding your Hallelujahs?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yes, I do bind what has already been bound: I do loose what has already been loosed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I do not agree with the old way of Christianity that is something dead, that is something fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do not agree either with anything that is an abuse of our liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is so easy for us to go either to one extreme or to another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On one hand we need to be centripetal, that is, tending toward the center; on the other hand we need also to be centrifugal, that is, tending to move away from the center.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These two laws will keep us in the proper balance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On one hand, it is not right to take the old way of deadness; neither is it right to take a new way of looseness, abusing and misusing our liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am not trying to bind you; my intention is to release you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But you must realize that all the release, all the liberty, must be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I say Hallelujah, I must have the assurance that the Lord Jesus within me is saying Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the Lord Jesus is saying inwardly, No, I do not go along with your Hallelujah, then my Hallelujah is entirely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus today is one with all His members.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>HOW GOD ESTABLISHES PRAISE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hebrews 2 refers to two Psalms, Psalm 8 and Psalm 22.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have seen that Psalm 8 speaks concerning Christ: What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And the son of man, that Thou visitest him?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor...Thou hast put all things under his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We know that this man, this one of whom the psalmist is speaking, is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Psalm 8 tells us that Jesus was identified with man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was the Creator of all the angels, but He was made a little lower than the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was incarnated to be a man, and by His incarnation He was identified with man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Hebrew text for the word man in the question, What is man? is a word which denotes a fragile man, a weak man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man is so fragile and weak; yet Jesus identified Himself with such a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While He was on earth, practically speaking, He was not physically strong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was in a sense weak and fragile; He identified Himself with such a race.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Psalm 8 tells us that from the youngest ones, the least ones, the weakest of such a race, God could do one thing He could establish praise.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How could God establish praise out of the mouths of such weak ones?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Just by these four or five steps: 1 Christ s incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The entire universe had never seen such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God could establish praises out of the mouths of babes and sucklings firstly by Christ s incarnation, by His identification with man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>2 His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Of course, in Psalm 8 we do not have the crucifixion, just the incarnation with the glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man is made a little lower than the angels this is the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is crowned with glory and honor this is the glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But following Psalm 8, in Psalm 22 His crucifixion is covered.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>3 His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Psalm 22, after the crucifixion, we have the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord s declaring of the Father s name to His brethren was a sign of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>4 His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After His resurrection He was crowned with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>5 His enthronement.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All things have been put under His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He has been enthroned as the Lord of all, as the King of kings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By these five ways the incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, glorification, and enthronement God could establish praises out of the mouths of the weakest of this weak race.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By these five steps of Christ, God fulfills Psalm 8, verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You may ask, What has this to do with me?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The answer is too much!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we did not have these five major steps of Christ in this universe, none of us could utter a word of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All the mouths of men would be shut.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How could we praise God without Christ s incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and enthronement?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You may say, O God, You are my Creator!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But God would say, You are a sinner!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then what will you say?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You may say, O God, I thank You for Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But God would say, How could I have mercy upon you?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Without the work of Christ there is no way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Oh, how we need to see the way whereby God can establish praises out of the mouths of us who are the weakest, the least, and less than the least!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>By His incarnation, Christ was made one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are lower than the angels, and He is too; He was made the same as we.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>By His crucifixion, all our problems have been solved.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God can never say to you, You are a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If God says this to you, you must tell Him, O God, You are not just, You are not righteous, You are not fair in saying this, because my substitute Christ has died for me.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You see, there is no reason whatever for you not to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>By Christ s incarnation, Christ has become one with me.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>By His crucifixion, I am no more a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>By His resurrection, I become a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Tell me, who is greater, the President of the United States or you?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Suppose that the President is not a son of God is he greater, or you?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You are greater!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You have to shout, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I am greater, I am greater!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>What makes you so great?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>By His resurrection, you have been made a brother of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then, do you have any reason not to praise?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Do you see?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In this way God has established praises out of the mouths of the weakest.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>You may have many children and may, materially speaking, be rather poor, but are you not more glorious than the greatest millionaire?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In His glorification, we all have been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We are more glorious!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>You see, it is so easy for God to establish praises out of the mouths of so many weaker ones.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If you have ever seen the incarnation of Christ, the crucifixion, the resurrection, the glorification, and the enthronement, you will be beside yourself saying, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The most wonderful thing is that this incarnated One, this crucified One, this resurrected One, this glorified One, this enthroned One is altogether today the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>And He as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit indwells my spirit, and I am one spirit with Him 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>What is this!</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Oh, what is this!</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Hebrews 2 refers us to Psalm 8, which tells of Christ s incarnation, glorification and enthronement.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Hebrews 2 also refers us to Psalm 22, which speaks of His crucifixion and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>When we put these two Psalms together, we have these five marvelous, glorious steps of Christ: His incarnation, His crucifixion, His resurrection, His glorification, and His enthronement.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>By all these five steps, Christ has been made one with us, and we have been made one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Now Christ is not only in the church, but Christ is the church 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>And He says, I will sing praise unto Thee in the midst of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>In what way?</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>By being one with the church, by being one with all the members, and by them being made one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>When they sing, He sings in their singing.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>He sings by their singing; He sings within their singing.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Their singing is His singing.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>They are one with Him, and He is one with them.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>They are in Him, and He is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Hallelujah!</S>
