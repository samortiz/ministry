<h1 class="title">LIFE AND FRUIT-BEARING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 15:1-8, 16; 12:24, 28</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to see the matters of life and fruit-bearing in John 15. We need to be brought into a full realization that today we all are the branches of the divine, true vine (v. 5). In order to see the intention of the Lord&rsquo;s speaking in John 15, we have to realize that the section from John 12:12 through John 17 is one section on the multiplication of Christ. Many readers of the Bible have never seen this secret of understanding this section. The crucial and controlling verse in this section is John 12:24. The Lord Jesus likened Himself to a grain of wheat that falls into the earth and dies. This one grain then becomes many grains, which are the multiplication of that one grain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRUE VINE BEING A MATTER OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The subject of John 15 is still the multiplication of Christ. Christ is the vine tree, and this very Christ needs to be multiplied. This tree multiplies by the branches of the tree bearing fruit (vv. 1, 5). The vine tree is like the one grain of wheat and its fruit is like the many grains. For the one grain to be multiplied into many grains, there is the need of the dispensing of the very life of that one grain into many grains. In the same principle, for the vine tree to be multiplied, there is the need of the dispensing of the very life of the tree into the fruit. The true vine is a matter of life (John 15:1, 4, 6). The vine tree is the organism of the Triune God with the divine life for the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity. The true vine dispenses the very Triune God into all the fruit.</p>
<p>Christ is the embodiment of the processed Triune God (Col. 2:9), and the very organism of the Triune God. An organism, of course, is something organic and living. It is the opposite of a dead organization. Our human body is something living and something organic, so it is an organism. Because our body is an organism, it functions in many ways. Our body functions to contain us, express us, and take action for us. We could not move, act, or have any kind of activity without our body. In like manner, the organism of the Triune God, which is His very embodiment, Christ Himself, functions to contain the Triune God. The very Triune God is here in this organism, in this vine tree. Furthermore, this organism expresses the Triune God and is the means by which and through which the Triune God can act and move.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BRANCHES OF THE TRUE VINE<br />
BEING FOR FRUIT-BEARING</h2>
<p>John 15 presents a full picture of the organism of the Triune God. How good, how miraculous, how wonderful, and how excellent it is that we all are a part of this organism! Christ is here as this organism, and we are included in this organism. He is the tree, and we are the branches. As far as we, the branches, are concerned, the tree lives to be our support, our supply, and our everything. The tree in its entirety is not for itself but for the branches. Also, the tree does everything through the branches. The tree needs the branches. It cannot do anything apart from the branches. Today Christ as the very embodiment of the Triune God can do nothing without us. Without us Christ is unable to act, to work, or to have any kind of activity.</p>
<p>The Triune God is in the tree, and the tree is within the branches. Where is the Triune God today? The Triune God today is in Christ, and this very Christ is the vine tree. Where is Christ, the vine tree? He is within the branches. Without the branches, the tree cannot express itself or do anything. In John 15:5 the Lord says, &ldquo;Apart from Me you can do nothing.&rdquo; As the branches of Christ, we can say the same thing to Him. Without Him, we can do nothing, and without us, He can do nothing. We surely need Him, and He surely needs us. The branches need the tree, and the tree needs the branches for what purpose? It is not only for the purpose of our enjoying the wonderful, excellent, and marvelous divine life. Eventually, the purpose of this divine organism is fruit-bearing. Fruit-bearing is the multiplication and the enlargement of this divine tree, the divine organism of the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>We all have to be the fruitful branches of this vine tree. Fruit-bearing is the unique and particular characteristic of all the branches of the divine organism. All of us need a new start, a new turn, so we all have to consecrate ourselves anew. We all need a renewed consecration for the purpose of fruit-bearing. Suppose a branch of a vine tree only bears one piece of fruit. This branch will not look very nice because the branches of a vine tree should bear clusters of fruit. As branches of Christ, we have to bear clusters of fruit.</p>
<p>The branches of the true vine are for fruit-bearing (John 15:5), and the purpose of the Lord&rsquo;s choosing of the branches is for fruit-bearing (v. 16a). A vine tree has branches for the unique purpose of bearing fruit. A pine tree is good for building material and good as fuel for burning, but not a vine tree. A vine tree is good for only one purpose&mdash;the purpose of bearing fruit. We have been chosen as the branches of Christ for the unique purpose of bearing fruit. Many of us have to admit, however, that instead of bearing fruit, we have been barren for years. This is why I was compelled to study our situation. I realized that we had to find a way to bear fruit.</p>
<p>We need to abide in the vine to receive the life supply for fruit-bearing. The Lord chose us for fruit-bearing, and our abiding in Him is also for fruit-bearing. First we receive the life supply by abiding in Him. Then we will grow with this life supply to produce fruit. The branches of the vine bear fruit for the glorification of the Father&mdash;for the multiplication of the Father in the Son (John 15:8; 12:24, 28). In John 15:8 the Lord said, &ldquo;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit.&rdquo; Glorification means multiplication. A single grain of wheat by itself has no glory. But when it dies in the earth, grows up, and bears many grains, these many grains are the one grain&rsquo;s glory, the glorification of the one grain. This glorification is the multiplication and expression of the one grain.</p>
<p>At one time, Christ was the only grain. But He, as the one grain, passed through death and entered into resurrection. In resurrection, He was multiplied. The death and resurrection of the one grain issued in many grains. When Christ was resurrected, we all were resurrected in Him and with Him (Eph. 2:6; 1 Pet. 1:3). It was not only the individual Christ who was resurrected, but a corporate Christ with His many members. Before the grain is sown into the earth and dies, it is alone. But when this one grain grows up from the earth, it bears fruit and becomes many grains. The many grains are Christ&rsquo;s multiplication as His glorification. We believers are the many grains as Christ&rsquo;s multiplication and His glorification.</p>
<p>When the Lord was walking in Judea and working in Jerusalem, He was the only grain of wheat. But after His resurrection and through His propagation, we are here as His glorification, which is His multiplication. We are the multiplication of that unique grain. Christ is glorified in His multiplication, and we together with all the believers on this earth are His multiplication.</p>
<p>The glorification of the Father is the multiplication of the Father in the Son. For this purpose the Father prunes the branches. His pruning is for the fruit-bearing of the branches (John 15:2). When we are praying and making a thorough confession, that confession is the practical and actual pruning. The more we confess to God the Father, the more we will get pruned. Have we ever realized that our confession of sins is a pruning? God the Father prunes us by showing us all our defects, failures, and wrongdoings, that we may make a thorough confession to Him. Through this thorough confession, we are cleansed from our defects, imperfections, defeats, failures, wrongdoings, mistakes, and sinfulness.</p>
<p>Many Christians only realize that God prunes us by chastising us. I am not saying that this is wrong, but God does not prune us mainly by chastising us. Whenever we make a thorough confession, we have the sensation that we are so clean and cleared up from many negative things. The Father shines over us and exposes our defects and sinfulness under His divine light. Our confession of everything exposed through His divine light is our cooperation with the Father&rsquo;s pruning.</p>
<p>Suppose that you, as a branch of Christ, go out to visit people without having a thorough confession, without the pruning. Then it will be hard for you to bear much fruit. This is why we all need to make a thorough confession, which is our cooperation with the Father&rsquo;s pruning. We need to be pruned daily, time after time. Just as we wash our hands many times throughout the day, we need to be pruned many times. To be pruned is to be washed. From morning to evening, we need to make confessions again and again. Every confession is a washing, and every washing is a pruning. The word &ldquo;prunes&rdquo; in John 15:2 is literally translated &ldquo;cleanses.&rdquo; As branches, when we are pruned, we are washed and cleansed through our confession according to God&rsquo;s exposing. When we come to Him, we are exposed under His light because He is light (1 John 1:5). Our confession accomplishes or completes the Father&rsquo;s pruning. Then we become clean, new, and fresh, and it is so easy for us as a clean, new, and fresh branch to bear fruit.</p>
<p>The danger of not bearing fruit is to be cut off from the enjoyment of the vine (John 15:2a). The Lord says clearly that if we are branches not bearing fruit, we are in danger of being cut off from the vine tree. This does not mean that we will suffer eternal perdition. To be cut off from Christ here is to be cut off from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. As the branches abide in the vine tree, they enjoy its life supply. If a branch is cut off from the vine tree, it is cut off from enjoying the riches of the vine tree. When we are barren, not bearing fruit, we have the sensation that we are not enjoying Christ that much. There is hardly any enjoyment of Christ. This indicates that we have been cut off from the vine tree. I have received many letters telling me that visiting people for the gospel not only saved sinners but also revived the visiting ones. This means that visiting people for the gospel by knocking on their doors revives our enjoyment of the rich Christ. Many saints have testified that going out to visit people in this way revived them to contact Christ, enjoy Christ, and absorb all the riches out from Him. This is the recovery of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ for bearing fruit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_075.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_077.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 76</div><br></body></html>
