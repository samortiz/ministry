   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO HAVE CHRIST AS THE REPLACEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR ALL THE SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THAT WE MAY ENJOY HIM AS OUR ALL IN ALL</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s will is firstly to have a Body for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, how could this Body of Christ, the church, which is the enlargement and expression of God s embodiment, come into being?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The answer is very much related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second aspect of God s will is to have Christ as the replacement for all the sacrifices and offerings, that we may enjoy Him as our all in all Heb 10:5-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Old Testament saints were centered around the sacrifices and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sacrifices and the offerings meant everything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, Christ came to do God s will by replacing all the sacrifices and offerings in order that He could be everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Old Testament there are five main categories of offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hebrews 10:5 says, Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me. God prepared a body for Christ so that He could offer Himself to God to replace all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was God s will which Christ came to do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now the sacrifices and offerings are no longer needed because they have been replaced by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ today is all the offerings, and He is all the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hebrews 10:9 says, Then He said, Behold, I come to do Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He takes away the first that He may establish the second.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ took away and replaced all the Old Testament types, and He established Himself to be the second.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the second, Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ s replacing of all the Old Testament sacrifices and offerings, taking away the Old Testament types and establishing Himself as everything to us, was God s great will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of Christ s body once for all, to enjoy and partake of Him as our everything 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The book of Hebrews reveals five major aspects of Christ for our enjoyment and participation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First, we partake of Christ as our God in His humanity Heb 1 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ today is our God in His humanity as our portion for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is not only God but also a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second, we partake of Christ as our Apostle, typified by Moses and Joshua, leading us into the good land, the all inclusive Christ Heb 3:1 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Third, we partake of Christ as our High Priest, typified by Aaron, bringing us into the presence of God Heb 4:14 7:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Fourth, we also partake of Christ as the bequests of the new testament covenant Heb 8 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Testament has many contents.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every item of the contents is a bequest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we would know all the items of the New Testament, we must study the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fifth, this Christ is also our Forerunner to run the course of the race Heb 11 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He has finished the course.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He has cut and paved the way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today in America there are highways from the west coast to the east coast.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ has cut the highway that we might run the course, following Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He has paved the way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We now may follow His footsteps to run the same course.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is our God in His humanity, and He is our Apostle bringing God to us and our High Priest bringing us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is all the riches, the contents, the bequests, of the New Testament, and He is our Forerunner, the Accomplisher, who has run the course.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that He is everything to us according to God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now we have nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do not have the Old Testament sin offering, trespass offering, meal offering, burnt offering, or peace offering; we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ replaces everything, even ourselves and our good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is all in all to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We simply enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is the will of God today?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is simply for us to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To live a life according to God s heart and will is to have Christ as everything to us and to live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God s great will is for us to be a part of the Body, enjoying Christ as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>TO HAVE THE BELIEVERS IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>PRACTICE THE BODY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The third aspect of God s great will is to have the believers in Christ practice the Body life Rom 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this we must first present our bodies to God as a living sacrifice to do the will of God, that is, to practice the Body life v. 1 , not being conformed to this age but being transformed by the renewing of the mind that we may prove the will of God, which is that we practice the Body life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First we must offer our body, and then we must have our mind, which is part of our soul, renewed, dealt with thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then we must exercise our gifts in the Body life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>4-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to preach the gospel, have home meetings to nourish the new believers, have small group meetings to perfect the saints, and learn to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By doing this we exercise many gifts, and each one of us will become fully occupied in the exercise of our gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The saints who are practicing the Body life should live a life of the highest virtues, not of their human life or love, but of the divine life and love by being burning in their spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>9-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our body should be presented, our soul should be renewed, and our spirit should be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we are such persons, we will have the practice of the Body life and a life of the highest virtues by God s divine life and love.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One item of such a life is to feed our enemy and give him a drink v. 20 . This is the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must understand what God s will is.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God s will is to have a Body, and it is that we take Christ as everything and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The place to enjoy Christ is in His Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then we must also practice the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We cannot be separate from the believers, and we must never be individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some may say that they can enjoy Christ at home.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This may be so, but if you are not practicing the Body life with all the saints together as the corporate Body, you will surely miss something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You may enjoy Christ a little by yourself, but you cannot enjoy Christ in His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Try to enjoy Christ, not individualistically but corporately, and try to live a corporate life, a Body life, a church life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Always do things in the Body of Christ, in the practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>To merely live an individual Christian life is the way of poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you live a corporate life, however, you will enjoy Christ in His fullness, which eventually is the church, the very expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We all have to see that God wants a Body, and to be a part of the Body we have to take Christ as our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We do not need anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We do not need logic, philosophy, or ethics; we only need to take Christ as our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This Christ is our God, our Apostle, our High Priest, and all the riches of the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This Christ is the Accomplisher, the Finisher, of the way we are taking.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Therefore, He is everything to us, and we take Him as our everything, not to live an individualistic life, but to live a corporate life to have the practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In this church life, we will have a strong testimony, and many people will be influenced and attracted by us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They will come to join us in practicing the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Then the enlargement of Christ will be continually enlarged, from a hundred believers up to a thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is the practice of the church life, and this is the increase and continuation of the enlarged Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God s will is to have a Body as the enlargement and expression of the processed Triune God and to have Christ as the replacement for all the sacrifices and offerings that we may enjoy Him as our all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Body of Christ comes out of our enjoyment of Christ, and our enjoyment of Christ issues in the church life, which is a strong testimony, testifying that God has been processed to be everything to us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we enjoy Him, we will become His enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is the divine will.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We do not need to waste our time by concentrating on minor matters related to our personal life.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We should simply live in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In the church life, we should go to disciple the nations, to visit people to get them saved.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We should not concentrate on the minor things in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Instead, we should go to get people saved.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Following this, we need to go to have home meetings to nourish the young babes.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Then we must continue to go to bring all these nourished young Christians together to form a group that they may do the same thing as we do.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Then we can learn to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>From the verses that we pray-read in the morning, we can compose a prophecy for the Lord s Day morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We all need to enter into the practical church life, living a life according to God s heart and will.</S>
