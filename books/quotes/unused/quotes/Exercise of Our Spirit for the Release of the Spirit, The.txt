Romans 8:16 says that the Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit, and 1 Corinthians 6:17 tells us that we are one spirit with the Lord
In order for there to be a current of electricity in the house the electricity must constantly move circulate and flow throughout the house
The problem today is that much of the time we limit, frustrate, and hinder the moving, working, and acting of the Spirit
A marriage is a union of two persons as one, but if the wife never cooperates whenever her husband acts, the husband can do nothing
We must be clear that the problem regarding the filling or working of the Holy Spirit is not a problem with the Holy Spirit
When we pray for this matter, we must forget about our circumstances, our memories, and all the thoughts in our mind
The more we pray according to our innermost feeling, the more we will be in the spirit and the more the Spirit will fill us
The best way to exercise our legs and feet is to walk or run, and the best way to exercise our spirit is to pray
In order to exercise our spirit, we must forget all our thoughts and outward circumstances and take care of our inner sense
Perhaps we may have trouble with our spouse, or we may receive some bad news during the day that makes us unhappy
If we allow our emotions to be broken and learn to release our spirit, the Spirit in our spirit will automatically be released
They must be broken so that they would know how to exercise the spirit and that the Spirit within them would be released
There would be a current, a flow, that would refresh, strengthen, and renew others and that would bring life into the meeting
Rather, we must ask why they are not coming to the meetings and also consider what the condition of our meetings is
If the meetings are burning, living, and refreshing, people will be attracted, and the people who come will receive the help that they need
We should all exercise our spirit, and we should follow and cooperate with one another, just like the players on a team
If we all came in with a released spirit, denying our mind, emotion, and will, we would begin to pray regardless of what time it was
When we go to the Lord, we must forget about everything and simply go to Him to contact and deal with Him in a real way
When our spirit is released, the Holy Spirit within us will automatically be released, and there will be a current flowing in the meeting
Question: How is the filling of the Holy Spirit that you are speaking of different from what people experience in the Pentecostal movement?
They are concerned with manufacturing and creating a certain kind of atmosphere in their meetings, which is wrong
The Pentecostal meetings are too much to one extreme, and the fundamental meetings are too much to the other extreme
When we commit a sin, we immediately sense that we are wrong, but when we bring death into the meetings, we do not have the same sense
We do not agree with the Pentecostal way of maneuvering, manufacturing, and creating an atmosphere in a natural way
When we exercise our spirit and take care of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit will automatically guide us to be considerate of others
According to the fundamental way of meeting, when we come to the meeting, we must wait for a certain time until we can begin the meeting
You may feel that you should pray quietly or silently, or you may feel that you should pray audibly so that others can hear
In the early days of the apostles the Christians did not meet together in the Pentecostal way or the fundamental way but in a flexible way
There was no program, formality, or bondage, and nothing was enforced, such as performing emotional activities
The next time we go to a meeting, we should go with the sole purpose of exercising our spirit to worship and exhibit the Lord
We should even be familiar with many of the hymns so that there would be no need for someone to formally announce a hymn
We must have a fire burning in our meetings so that when people come, they will be burned and will burn others
Whenever we come together to meet, our meeting should be living, a meeting in which the Holy Spirit moves and is released
The unbelievers will be saved the believers will be edified nourished strengthened delivered and enlightened and the Spirit will be released
In this message we would like to see something regarding the flow of the Spirit and the exercise of our spirit in Psalm 45
The people around us, the angels, the demons, and all the created things in this universe should hear us overflowing with a good matter
If we are in the spirit, we will always have something composed concerning the Lord and will always be overflowing
If we walk, act, and do things not in the spirit but in the soul or the mind, we will not sing any songs to the Lord
You are fairer than the sons of men; / Grace is poured upon Your lips; / Therefore God has blessed You forever'
Whenever we think of the Lord and of His deeds and acts, we automatically sense the sweetness of His death and resurrection
Although this psalm is a psalm of praise of the King, the second part of the psalm speaks of the queen instead of the King
Hear, O daughter, and see; and incline your ear; / And forget your people and your father's house; / Thus the King will desire your beauty
She will be led to the King in embroidered clothing; / The virgins behind her, her companions, / Will be brought to You
If you read this psalm, you will notice that although it praises the King, it also speaks much about the queen, who is a type of the church
The hymn implied that the ivory palaces were the heavenly mansions from which the Lord Jesus came to this world of woe
In 1956 we spent much time during a training to study the books of poetry, and we realized something regarding this matter
God caused Christ to be put to sleep on the cross and caused His side to be opened, and what came out of Christ's side was blood and water
The queen being in the gold of Ophir indicates that the church, which is full of the praises of Christ, is in the divine nature of God
Verses 13 and 14 say, 'The King's daughter is all glorious within the royal abode; / Her garment is a woven work inwrought with gold
The church as a dwelling place for Christ in His resurrection is in the divine nature and is filled unto all the fullness of God
They had the inward filling of the Spirit and the outward praising of the Lord and singing to Him from the spirit
We have an abundance of many of these negative things and are short of the one positive thing-the praising in our spirit
Some may be able to give messages or write books on spiritual matters, but they cannot sing a hymn with their spirit
The meetings would have an impact and an effect on people because something would be constantly flowing and bubbling in the meetings
As Psalm 45 indicates, we must have these two matters-the overflowing and the singing with the music of the harpstrings
If we close off the chimney of the stove and close all the doors and windows, the draft will be choked off, and the fire will be quenched
The fact is that the Holy Spirit is burning within us all the time, but in our experience the Spirit may not always be burning
The reason why we Christians are so dead, dormant, weak, cold, and passive is because the fire is not burning within us
When we read the Bible, we should exercise our spirit to take in the Word instead of exercising our mind to understand it
Eventually, it will not matter whether we are reading or praying because our reading and our praying will be mingled together
Of reading the Word in a formal way, we should remove the covers, open the chimney, and let the air in by rejoicing while we read
In 2 Corinthians 5:13 Paul says, 'For whether we were beside ourselves, it was to God; or whether we are sober-minded, it is for you'
They are indifferent toward spiritual things, the things of the Lord, and come to the meetings in an indifferent way
On the other hand, there are the so-called spiritual believers who are often so spiritual that they close themselves
The longer we meet together, the more formal we tend to become, and the more formal we become, the more we quench the Spirit
When we are formal in the meetings, everyone is careful not to open himself, and no one dares to open his mouth
Sometimes in the meetings the saints only say amen when the more spiritual brothers speak and never when the younger ones share
Whenever people come to our meetings, they should have the sense that they have been liberated, set free, and released
By the Lords mercy grace and help let us determine to learn to open ourselves and to let the draft in so that the Spirit may burn within us
Even a small matter such as being a little careless or saying something slightly improper can quench the fire of the Spirit
If we are loose and careless in our speaking in our attitude and in doing things no matter how small they may seem we will quench the Spirit
If you are a sister in the kitchen washing the dishes, and you have a feeling to pray, then you should immediately pray
When we go to the Lord to pray, we should not consider and think about what to pray, because this also quenches the Spirit
The basic matter is that we must learn how to open ourselves by rejoicing, praying unceasingly, and giving thanks in everything
God is not only over us but also through us and in us in order to be expressed, manifested, glorified, and exhibited
Everyone who has considered God and believes that there is a God knows that this God is over the people on the earth
We need to read the Scriptures in the light of God's purpose, which is that God would express Himself through humanity
We may realize that as Christians we are the saints, the believers, and even the Lord's servants and His children
We must realize that God is over us, through us, and in us and that He is dwelling in us, abiding in us, and remaining in us
Some believe that the spirit and the soul are synonymous, and others say that the spirit is the same thing as the heart
If we are going to realize the spiritual things and understand the secret and mystery of God, we must realize that we have a spirit
It would be impossible for us to physically grow if we did not realize that we have a stomach and thus never exercised or used our stomach
In the same principle, there is an organ within us called the human spirit which God created for the purpose of receiving Him
In particular, we have specific organs which give us the five senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch
If there is an odor in the room, and your nose is not functioning because you have a cold, you will not sense the odor
The principle is that in order to substantiate a certain thing, you need the proper organ with which to substantiate it
God created us with ears so that we could substantiate sound, and He created us with eyes so that we could substantiate the visible things
On the one hand, Christ has ascended and been exalted to the heavens, but on the other hand, Christ the Lord as the Spirit is in our spirit
If we release our spirit, the very God who is in our spirit will automatically be released because He has committed Himself to our spirit
If the brother closes his hand and never opens it, the hand becomes a prison to the key, and the key cannot be released
In a similar way, God today is in our spirit, but most of the time our spirit remains closed while our mind and mouth are open
When we come together to meet, we may know how to exercise our mouth, but we do not know how to exercise our spirit
If given the opportunity to glorify, exalt, and express the Lord, we would pray, sing a hymn, and release our spirit
We may sing something short such as a chorus in a loud way, or we may sing something long such as a psalm in a quiet way
In terms of length, psalms are the longest, hymns are shorter, and spiritual songs, which are like the choruses of hymns, are the shortest
We should each have some choruses memorized so that we can sing them all the time in our spirit and with our spirit
We must learn to sing because the more we sing, the more we get out of our mind and forget about our circumstances
If we speak to one another by singing a psalm, hymn, or spiritual song, our spirits will be exercised and the Spirit will come out
When the people of Israel came together to worship God in the Old Testament, they sang as they were on their way to Zion
The right way for a Christian to take is to exercise the spirit, contact God, receive the Lord, and express Him
We must learn how to exercise our spirit so that we may continually grow and experience, enjoy, and partake of Christ
