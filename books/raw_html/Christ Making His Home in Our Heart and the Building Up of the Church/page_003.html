<h1 class="title">THE PURPOSE OF REGENERATION&mdash;<br />
MAN HAVING ETERNAL LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1-4; 3:1-16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF LIFE IN CREATION<br />
IN GENESIS 1 AND 2</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Lower Forms of Life Being Generated<br />
on the Third Day</h2>
<p>Genesis 1 speaks of life. It begins by saying, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&rdquo; (v. 1). This refers to God&rsquo;s original creation. After this creation was judged by God due to Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, God worked for six days to restore the heavens and the earth in order to have a further creation. On the first day of His work, &ldquo;God said, Let there be light; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness...And there was evening and there was morning, one day&rdquo; (vv. 3-5). On the first day God caused light to shine. At this point life had not yet been generated; there was only light shining into the darkness and separating the darkness from the light. On the second day God &ldquo;separated the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse...And there was evening and there was morning, a second day&rdquo; (vv. 7-8). On the second day God did a further work of separation. On the first day He separated light from darkness, and on the second day He separated the waters under the expanse from the waters above. On the first day light was used for separation, and on the second day the expanse was used for separation. However, life had not yet come forth.</p>
<p>On the third day &ldquo;God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas; and God saw that it was good. And God said, Let the earth sprout grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit according to their kind with their seed in them...And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a third day&rdquo; (vv. 9-13). On the third day the dry land was separated from the water. Hence, God&rsquo;s work of separation was in three steps: the separation of light from darkness, the separation of what was under the expanse from what was above it, and the separation of the dry land from the water. By means of these three steps of separation it was possible for life to be generated.</p>
<p>First there was the plant life with the sprouting of grass, herbs, and trees. Both herbs and trees bring forth seeds, which possess life. Since the life of most plants is contained in the seed, the story of life begins with the bringing forth of grass, herbs, and trees. We must remember that it was not until the third day, after the three steps of separation, that life came forth. The first life that came forth was the lowest form of life, the plant life. Although grass and trees have life, they have no consciousness. Thus, they are the lowest form of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Higher Forms of Life Being Generated<br />
on the Fourth through the Sixth Days</h2>
<p>Verse 16 says, &ldquo;God made the two great light-bearers, the greater light-bearer to rule the day and the lesser light-bearer to rule the night, and the stars.&rdquo; There were two great light-bearers in the sky&mdash;the sun for the day and the moon for the night. In addition, there were innumerable stars. This is the story of light. On the first day God called forth light, and on the fourth day of His work He brought forth stronger lights. On the first day there was light in the waste and emptiness, but there was not the solid shining of light. There was light in the first day, but the light was not solid. It was not until the fourth day that the light became solid and had a definite form. Not only were there great lights, great bodies; there were also small lights, small bodies. As a result, people can see the sun in the day and the moon and many stars at night. There is light during the day as well as at night; there is light no matter what time it is. This is what God accomplished on the fourth day. On this day light became more definite in form and more solid. This light was for the further generating of life. Without light, there is no life.</p>
<p>On the first day light separated darkness from light, and on the second and third days there were the separation of the water under the expanse from the water above and the separation of dry land from water. Then the plant life was generated on the third day. However, since the first-day light was not sufficiently strong, only a lower form of life was generated. In order to have higher forms of life, there was the need of solid light. Therefore, the solid light on the fourth day was for the generating of higher forms of life. On the fifth day &ldquo;God created the great sea creatures and every living animal that moves, with which the waters swarmed...and every winged bird according to its kind&rdquo; (v. 21). What was created on the fifth day was a higher form of life than that of the plant life. If you walk up to a bird standing on the ground, it will fly away. This proves that birds have consciousness. The same is true with the fish in the sea. When fish sense that people are approaching, they swim away. Some fish are even able to eat bait on a fishhook without being caught. These examples show that the life created on the fifth day is higher than the plant life.</p>
<p>God created many things in the universe. It is wonderful that according to the record of Genesis 1, God did not focus on the various items which He had created. Instead, His attention was entirely on light and life. If we read chapter 1 carefully, we will see that the record in this chapter does not stress God&rsquo;s mighty power or His wonderful works. Genesis 1 stresses the generating of life through the shining of light. This is the meaning of the record in this chapter.</p>
<p>On the first day light was brought in, and subsequently there were three steps of separation to generate the lowest forms of life. Then on the fourth day the strong light came in to generate higher forms of life. Not only so, God worked on the sixth day to bring forth still higher forms of life. There were two steps in the work of God on the sixth day. First, the living animals were created: &ldquo;cattle and creeping things and animals of the earth according to their kind&rdquo; (v. 24). <em>Cattle</em> refers to cows and sheep, and <em>animals of the earth</em> refer to other creatures, such as lions, tigers, and elephants. There are also various kinds of creeping things. The most prominent among them are probably snakes. These living creatures have a higher form of life than that of the fish in the sea and the birds in the air. Most of the fish in the sea and the birds in the air are oviparous, not viviparous. However, the animals that came forth on the sixth day, such as cows, sheep, lions, and tigers, are viviparous animals. These animals possess consciousness and feelings that are much higher than the consciousness and feelings of fish and birds. Hence, the creatures created by God on the sixth day have a much higher form of life.</p>
<p>In the second part of His work on the sixth day, God created man. Verse 26 says that God created man in His own image and according to His own likeness. From this verse we see that man has the highest form of life, because man&rsquo;s life is similar to God&rsquo;s life. The plant life is not similar to God&rsquo;s life nor is the animal life. Oviparous life is not similar to God&rsquo;s life and neither is the viviparous life. The last creature created by God was man. Man&rsquo;s life is similar to God&rsquo;s life because man was created in God&rsquo;s image and according to God&rsquo;s likeness; that is, man has God&rsquo;s image as well as God&rsquo;s likeness. Hence, man&rsquo;s life is the highest of all the created life. Man not only has feelings and consciousness, but he can express God and exercise God&rsquo;s dominion. Therefore, God gave all that He had created in the sea, on the land, and in the air to man for man to exercise authority over them. Man has the highest form of created life.</p>
