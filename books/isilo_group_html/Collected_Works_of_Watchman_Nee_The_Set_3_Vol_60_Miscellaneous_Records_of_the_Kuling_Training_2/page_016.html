In preaching the negative subjects, we only have to touch them briefly and give others a deep impression of these things. When we move on to the positive subjects, however, we can stay on them continually. We only need to touch sin, judgment, and the world briefly, but we can come back again and again to the positive subjects such as the love of God. Love is a matter of the heart. God is love, and God loves the world. His heart is one that loves sinners and desires their salvation. Many people, however, do not want to be saved. The Lord said to the Pharisees, "You are not willing to come to Me that you may have life" (John 5:40). God is not unwilling to give His life to man or to save man, but man is unwilling to accept what God gives! The Lord also said to Jerusalem, "How often I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!" (Matt. 23:37). The Lord was eager to protect and save them, but they would not want to come under His protection and saving. Today many people think that God's goal is to condemn man. They think that God does not want to save them even though they may want to be saved. This is man's thought; it is a great misunderstanding of God. Many people think that it is a difficult thing to be saved. They think that God is reluctant to save them. But God is love, and He seeks out men and desires that they be saved. The Lord Jesus said, "The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost" (Luke 19:10). We do not seek salvation, knock at the gate of heaven, and plead for God to open the gate for us. Rather, God seeks to save us, and He came to us Himself to save us. God does not hate us; rather, He loves us and wants us to be saved. A leper came to the Lord and entreated Him, saying, "If You are willing, You can cleanse me." The Lord stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed!" (Mark 1:40-41). God is willing! God is wanting! God is seeking! Are we willing? Do we want to be saved? God is willing, but are we willing?</p><p>This way of presenting the gospel will induce many to receive salvation. This is a broad way. Man is prone to accept the devil's thoughts. The devil says, "Even though you may want to be saved and go to heaven, God may not want you." Man always thinks that it is a hard thing to be saved, but we have to tell the sinners, "God is willing, but are you willing?" God desires all men be saved (1 Tim. 2:4). This is God's heart. God loves us so much that He desires that we all be saved. How much man has misunderstood God's heart! God is willing to save man. This is God's love. He intended to save us long ago. He sent His Son to us. By Him our sins can be forgiven, and we can draw near to God. We are not the ones who seek to be saved. God is the One who seeks to save us. Luke 15 shows us that it is not the prodigal son that wanted to be saved, but the father who had loved the prodigal son. While the prodigal son was still struggling afar off, trying to come up with the right reason to convince his father, the father was waiting day and night for his return. The son did not realize that his father was influenced only by love (vv. 17-20). Those who reason do not know God's love. Do not reason and do not worry whether or not God will accept you. Man tries to persuade God to have compassion on him. But God is love itself. We do not have to change God or appeal to Him in any way. God is love. Man thinks that God is severe, fearsome, and hardened, but God said, "The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth" (Exo. 34:6). Again He said, "Taste and see that Jehovah is good; / Blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him" (Psa. 34:8). Oh, that all men would come to know His love, taste His goodness, and trust in Him!</p><p>This is another line. We must have a line when we preach the gospel. If a man tries to be good at everything, he will end up being good at nothing. Of course, there are times of exception, and we can resort to other ways during these times, but we always should have a specific line that we can call our own.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Righteousness</h2><p>God's righteousness is related to the work the Lord Jesus accomplished on the cross. Love relates to God's heart, while righteousness relates to God's procedure, His way. Some gospel preachers do not emphasize God's love; rather, they emphasize the accomplished work of the Lord Jesus on the cross. This is the line of God's righteousness. God crucified the Lord Jesus on the cross for our sins. He no longer can save men according to His whims and likes. He has to save men according to the cross. He is bound by the cross. Before the cross, God could save men according to His desires and likes. The cross, however, removes God's freedom to choose. As long as man accepts the redemption of the cross, God must save. Since the redemption of the cross is an accomplished fact, God has to justify all those who come to Him through the cross. The Lord Jesus has died for me on the cross. Now I can come to God through His cross. Whether or not God is willing to save me, I will be saved. This is the righteousness of God.</p><p>First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." The Lord Jesus shed His precious blood for us. When we come to God through Him, God must save us. He must forgive us. He does not have a choice. If He loves us, we will be saved. If He does not love us, we still will be saved. God is love, but He is also righteousness. He saves us according to His righteousness. Hallelujah! The cross is our handle, our leverage. It is a handle given to us by God. This is the gospel of righteousness. God has accomplished His work, and no one can change it.</p><p>We also have the last part of Romans 4, which says that Christ was raised for our justification (v. 25). In other words, Christ could not have resurrected if we were not justified. We can also say that except for our justification, Christ would not have resurrected. In God's eyes Christ was allowed to be resurrected only after our case before Him was settled through the work of the cross. The fact that Christ has resurrected proves that our case is settled. This is the reason it says that Christ was raised for, or on the basis of, our justification. Looking at it another way, since Christ has resurrected, God will always justify us whenever we come to God through Him. This is another line, a very strong line. This line lays hold of God's righteousness.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 60: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (2) &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
