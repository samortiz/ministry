<div class='line'><b>1</b> He looked for a city and lived in a tent,</div>
<div class='line'>A pilgrim to glory right onward he went;</div>
<div class='line'>God's promise his solace, so royal his birth,</div>
<div class='line'>No wonder he sought not the glories of earth.</div>
</div>
<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>City! O city fair!</div>
<div class='line'>God's dwelling with man to eternity is there.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> He looked for a city, his God should prepare;</div>
<div class='line'>No mansion on earth, could he covet or share,</div>
<div class='line'>For had not God told him, that royal abode</div>
<div class='line'>Awaited His pilgrims on ending the road.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> He looked for a city; if sometimes he sighed</div>
<div class='line'>To be trudging the road, all earth's glory denied,</div>
<div class='line'>The thought of that city changed sighing to song,</div>
<div class='line'>For the road might be rough, but it could not be long.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> He looked for a city, his goal, Lord, we share</div>
<div class='line'>And know that bright city, which Thou dost prepare</div>
<div class='line'>Is ever our portion, since willing to be</div>
<div class='line'>Just pilgrims with Jesus, our roof a tent tree.</div>
