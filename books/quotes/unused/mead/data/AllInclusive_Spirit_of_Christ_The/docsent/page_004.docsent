   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>He Is All-inclusive</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This still is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We can never exhaust all that He is!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is the Creator, and man is the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Him, therefore, is the Creator and the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must also realize that in Him is the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And while on this earth for thirty-three and a half years, He experienced human living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, He not only has humanity, but also the experience of human living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After this, He was crucified and went into death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He suffered death, He conquered death, and He came out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So in Him is the element of the effectiveness of death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every one of us naturally fears death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Death is an awful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But for us the death of Christ is a great deliverance and release.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need this death not only in an objective way for our redemption, but also in a subjective way for our deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The death brought in by Adam is a real damage to us, but the death of Christ is a great deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The death of Christ, as a great deliverance to us, is a killing element, killing our selfish, natural life and so many negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are medicines today that contain many different elements.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In some doses of medicine there is a germ-killing element as well as nourishing elements.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On one hand they kill the germs, and on the other hand they nourish the body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Christ we not only have the effectiveness of His death that kills all negative things, but the resurrection life that nourishes us and the resurrection power that releases and empowers us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And with the resurrection, we have the glorification that transforms us and the ascension that uplifts us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now He is the transcendent One in the heavens, enthroned with authority and established as the Head and Lord of all Eph 1:20-22; Acts 2:32-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, with Him is also the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We cannot exhaust all that Christ is!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Him we have the Creator, the creature, the creation, the divine nature, the human nature with the human living, the effective death, the resurrection, the glorification, the ascension, the enthronement, the headship, the lordship, the authority and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All these are in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are all included in this one great Dose, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we will take Him as our life and experience Him day by day, we will sense many times the humanity and the human living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many times we will sense the killing element, putting the natural life to death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many times we will realize the resurrection power, the releasing, liberating and rising power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And sometimes we will realize the glorification, the enthronement, the authority, the headship, the lordship, and the kingdom, which is the reign of Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must bring this to the Lord and pray that He may reveal these things to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not need mere knowledge, but we do need a real revelation!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must see that the Christ in whom we believe is such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is the Triune God mingled with man and possessing so many experiences and attainments.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the elements which we have mentioned are with Him and in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is everything and He has everything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to know this all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we may know the way to experience Him as life and everything to us day by day.</S>
