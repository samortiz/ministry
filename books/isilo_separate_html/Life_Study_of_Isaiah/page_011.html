JEHOVAH'S CHASTISEMENT<br>ON HIS BELOVED CHILDREN ISRAEL</H2><P>After God exposes the actual situation of His people, He comes in to deal with them, to chastise them. His chastisement may be considered a governmental dealing.</P><P>Although God's people are different from the Gentiles and although in Isaiah God has a threefold love for His people, as a Father, a Mother, and a Husband, He still needs to deal with them. In His dealing God is often more serious than in His judgment. He may let the unbelievers go, but He will not let us go. He is very strict, very narrow, and very genuine in dealing with us because He has His divine government. He is not a God without regulating and controlling principles.</P><P>Part of the title of this message uses the words Jehovah's chastisement on His beloved children Israel. I use the expression beloved children to indicate that God's dealing with us is not with a negative motive. Rather, His dealing with us as His beloved children today is always with a very positive motive. Although He chastises us, He does not judge us or punish us. However, some saints may feel that God is punishing them and that they cannot bear this punishment. Nevertheless, I still say that, instead of punishing us, God chastises us in love. He is like a loving father who disciplines his children for their good. Once a child has grown to adulthood, he may realize that what he thought was punishment was actually his father's love.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
