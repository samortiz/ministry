<h2 class="head1">THE TWO COMINGS OF THE LORD</h2><p>In His first coming, the Lord became flesh and was crucified on the cross for man's sin, giving man the power to overcome sin and to draw near to God. Man receives the power of life, but this power is only half of the story, because he is only delivered from sin. The life that he has received is a life that delivers, but it does not deal with sin itself; sin itself has not been annihilated. Hence, we can say that the first coming of the Lord liberates us, that is, we are liberated from sin. But sin still exists on this earth. In one sense the salvation of the Lord is not yet complete. Suppose a man falls into the hands of robbers. Christ's first coming is likened to deliverance from the hands of such robbers; He delivered us from the power of sin. But the robbers are still there. In His second coming He will do away with the "robbers." Sin will be removed. The cross is a deliverance in our inward being. His second coming is a deliverance in our outward environment. The first coming of the Lord brought us salvation in life. The second coming of the Lord will bring us a complete salvation because He will wipe out sin altogether.</p><p>A Bible seller in Shanghai said, "Once a man is saved, he will not need to sin." But another person retorted, saying, "As long as a man remains on this earth, he will sin. This is like living in a coal mine; everyone in it is black with soot." The first brother answered, "But never forget that the sea water may be salty, but all the fishes in the sea are not; they are fresh." The first coming of the Lord made the "fish" no longer "salty." His second coming will make the "sea" no longer "salty." In His first coming, the Lord saved us individually one by one. In His second coming, He will save the world as well. In His first coming, He dealt with everything related to life. In His second coming, He will deal with the environment. Today all of us who are saved through His first coming have a new life. When He comes again, we will inherit a new environment to match our new life within. Although He gave us a new life in His first coming, our bodies are still mortal; they will still die. But when He comes again, our body will swallow up mortality. His first coming does not remove the weaknesses in our bodies; our bodies still pose limitations to God's work in us. In His second coming, our bodies will be fully redeemed. All weaknesses will be gone, and God's work will be fully accomplished in us.</p><p>Today a Christian overcomes many things inwardly, but he is not yet delivered from many environments around him. The outward environment is like Sodom. Although Lot was a righteous man, it was a suffering for him to live in Sodom. Today sin is our neighbor. The more we are delivered from sin, the more we feel the evil of sin around us. When the Lord comes again, we will be saved even in our environment. Our body will be saved, and death will not have any power over our body. Then there will be no more weakness and no more thorns. We are looking for the Lord's soon return. Those who are under some kind of oppression are even more eager for His return. The more we hate sin, the more we cry out for the Lord's return. How terrible is the environment around us! Not only are sin and death unresolved, even Satan is unresolved. God's word shows us that the whole world lies in the wicked one (1 John 5:19). His power is still operating in this world. In His first coming, the Lord gave us the power to overcome Satan. In His second coming, He will deal with the power of Satan Himself. He will even deal with the sin in our environment and the death in our body. We are full of joy and thanksgiving. Before that day comes, we have to wait for the Lord to finish that second half of His work.</p><p>Because of their ignorance of the Lord's work in His second coming, some people have formed wrong concepts about Christianity. They think that Christians are only interested in a gospel for individuals, that they are not interested in a gospel for society as a whole. Actually we believe in an individual gospel, and we also believe in a social gospel. The time for the social gospel will be when the Lord comes again. Today the Lord has not charged us to take care of the society around us. The world tries to change society with science. But we are changing society with life. We can do what the world cannot do. We are here to save the souls of those in society. When the Lord comes the second time, the world will not only be saved inwardly but will be saved outwardly as well. In His first coming the Lord saved individuals. In His second coming He will save the entire society. Today Christians are engaged in a spiritual work, while others are engaged in social work. We do not reform society; we only bring men to God and save them one by one.</p>
