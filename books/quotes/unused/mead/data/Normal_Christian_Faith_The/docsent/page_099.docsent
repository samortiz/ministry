   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OLD COVENANT A FAILURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to look at one passage carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hebrews 8:8-9 says, "For finding fault with them He says, 'Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah, not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.'"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How did God establish His covenant with the children of Israel?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He did so by taking them by the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was something outward.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The laws were written on stone tablets.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They were outward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The result was that the children of Israel did not continue in God's covenant, and God did not regard them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's commandments are one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our obeying is another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The result of that whole experiment was a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE NEW COVENANT WITHIN</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now let us look at the second covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hebrews 8:10 and 11 say, "For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me. And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now the law is put within man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is no longer inscribed on stones, nor is it recorded merely in the Bible; it is written upon our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the good of having the law put inside of us?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ezekiel 36:27 says, "And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please note the word "cause."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is a strong word in the Hebrew language.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The result of God's putting His Spirit within us is to cause us to be able to obey His ordinances and walk in His statutes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Under the old covenant, man had to struggle to obey God's commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now the Spirit of God is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He causes us to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hitherto God gave the commandments, and we supplied our own strength for their fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now the commanding One is God, but the supplying One becomes God also.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After resurrection, Christ came into us to become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The result is that we are enabled to fulfill God's commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ's sufficiency has become our ability.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because Christ is living for us, all the problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I AM CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I turn the question now to you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Have you given up hope in yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Are you still trying to improve yourself and reform to a better status?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have completely abandoned any hope in myself!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My goodness and wickedness alike are terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now everything is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the only way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do you believe that God has crucified you?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do you believe that your old man is nullified and that Christ is in you?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If so, you have to substantiate all these facts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then you will be able to say that henceforth it is Christ living in you.</S>
