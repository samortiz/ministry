<h2 class=head3>e. Enjoying the Glory of the Children of God with Its Freedom</h2><p>When the believers are glorified, they will enjoy the glory of the children of God with its freedom. Romans 8:21b speaks of “the freedom of the glory of the children of God.” All creation aspires to enter into this freedom. Even though the creation will not share the glory, the creation will enter into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.<p>Due to the fall of Adam, the entire creation is under bondage and corruption. Romans 8:19 through 21a say, “The anxious watching of the creation eagerly expects the revelation of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption.” The creation will be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For this, “the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now” (v. 22). The universe is groaning and travailing in birth, awaiting the revelation of the sons of God so that creation may be freed from corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. Although we are sons of God, we are still under a veil. One day this veil will be removed, and that will be our glorification. The sons of God will come out from under the veil and be revealed. Then the whole universe will behold the sons of God in glory and participate in the freedom of this glory. Therefore, we, the believers in Christ, shall be glorified, but the creation will only share in the freedom of that glory, not in the glory itself. In the future we shall enjoy the glory of the children of God with its freedom.<h2 class=head3>f. In the Glory of the Divine Sonship</h2><p>Finally, when the believers are glorified, they will be in the glory of the divine sonship. Hebrews 2:10 tells us that the Father with the Son is bringing us, the many sons, into glory. We are sons of God, but we are not yet in glory. As a caterpillar is transformed into a butterfly, we are being led into glory. One day we shall all be in glory as the many sons of God. Our glorification will be our full sonship. We shall be glorified in the divine life and the divine nature to bear the glory of the Triune God for His expression.<p>All the sons of God will be brought into this glory. Then as the glorified sons of God, we shall shine with the glory of God. This is the full salvation of all who believe in Christ. Everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus will eventually become a glorified son of God bearing the righteousness of God outwardly, being saturated with the holiness of God inwardly, and shining in the realm of His full glory as one of His sons. In this glory God will be expressed in a full way. This will be the ultimate issue of the dispensing of the processed Triune God.
