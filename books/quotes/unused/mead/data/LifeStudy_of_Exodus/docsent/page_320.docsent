   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Blue</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Exodus 26:1 mentions the colors blue, purple, and scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Blue signifies something heavenly in both nature and appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As revealed in the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus in His humanity and human living was altogether heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He lived not as an earthly man, but as a heavenly man, both in nature and in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, He could say that He came down from heaven and that He was the heavenly bread, the bread of life John 6:32, 35 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>E. Purple</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Purple is a kingly color.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It denotes that which is kingly both in position and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the Lord Jesus was a Nazarene, He conducted Himself as a king.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Gospel of Matthew portrays the Lord Jesus as One who acted and behaved like a king.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>F. Scarlet</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Scarlet is a dark red color.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This color signifies sin and also signifies the shedding of blood for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Isaiah 1:18 speaks of the people s sins being as scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that scarlet signifies sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But as illustrated in the Gospel of Luke, scarlet also signifies the shedding of blood for redemption for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, the scarlet in the first layer of the covering of the tabernacle signifies the shedding of the blood of Jesus for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>G. Cherubim of the Work of an Embroiderer</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 1 also speaks of cherubim, the work of a skilled workman.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The cherubim signify God s glory manifested in Jesus as shown in the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Cherubim denote God s glory manifested in the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fact that we are not told how many cherubim were embroidered on the linen curtains indicates that God s glory manifested in His creature is immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s immeasurable glory is also indicated by the fact that the dimensions of the cherubim on the propitiatory cover of the ark are not given.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not told the size of the cherubim on the ark, and neither are we told the number of the cherubim on the curtains.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The silence of the biblical record in both cases indicates that the manifestation of God s glory is beyond measure.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We know from the book of Ezekiel that the cherubim are living creatures in whom the glory of God is seen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He as a man was a creature manifesting the divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible reveals that Christ is both the Creator and a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to Colossians 1:15, Christ is the Firstborn of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a genuine man, the Lord Jesus had a body of blood, flesh, and bones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Are these not the elements of a created being?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, in His humanity Christ was a creature, but a creature upon whom the glory of God was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the significance of the cherubim embroidered on the linen curtains.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Gospel of Mark we see that the Lord Jesus was a slave-man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But upon this slave-man God s glory was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How wonderful that the four Gospels cover the aspects of Christ s humanity as typified by the colors blue, purple, and scarlet and by the cherubim!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The cherubim on the linen curtains were the work of a skilled workman, or of an embroiderer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The workman here denotes one skilled in the art of embroidery.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The work of an embroiderer signifies the constituting work of the Holy Spirit in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, it is the Holy Spirit who is the skilled workman, the embroiderer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today the Holy Spirit is doing the work of embroidery on us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He uses many needles, both large and small, to accomplish this work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>H. The Measurement</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 2 says that the curtains were twenty-eight cubits in length and four cubits in width.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The number twenty-eight is composed of four times seven, with four being the number of the creature and seven also being a number of perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, the length of each curtain also signifies the perfection of the Lord Jesus as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have pointed out that the number four signifies the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since there were ten curtains, each four cubits in width, we also have here the number forty.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Bible forty is the number of testing and trial.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This indicates that as a man the Lord Jesus was tested.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because His completion and perfection have been tested, He is a man approved by both God and man.</S>
