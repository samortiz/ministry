<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>30. By Rejoicing Always, Praying Unceasingly,<br>Giving Thanks to God in Everything,<br>Not Quenching the Spirit,<br>and Not Despising the Prophesyings</H2><P>Another practical way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is to rejoice always, pray unceasingly, give thanks to God in everything, not quench the Spirit, and not despise the prophesyings, that we may be wholly sanctified and saturated with the element of God's holy nature in our spirit, soul, and body (1 Thes. 5:16-20, 23).</P><P>Such a practical way to enjoy Christ includes not despising the prophesyings. Every Lord's Day morning we practice the prophesying. Some of the prophecies may not seem to be very high. However, we must be careful not to despise them. If we despise them, we will suffer the loss of enjoying Christ's dispensing. We must not despise any prophecy. To prophesy in 1 Thessalonians 5:20 refers not mainly to predicting but to speaking for the Lord. It is good for the new ones to speak a word for the Lord, even if their speaking is broken or very brief. It is very pleasant for them simply to say, "I love the Lord because He is good." If we despise such a prophecy, we will offend the Lord. Even such a short speaking is out of the Spirit's inspiration. Before the new ones were saved, they never said this, but now they can speak in this way with joy. We must also regard such speakings and not despise them.</P><P>The practice of rejoicing always, praying unceasingly, giving thanks to God in everything, not quenching the Spirit, and not despising the prophesyings results in our being wholly sanctified and saturated with the element of God's holy nature in our spirit, soul, and body. If we despise the prophesying of the new ones and criticize the prophesying meetings, we will miss the mark of sanctification and even suffer the loss of the dispensing for our constitution with the holy nature of God. However, if we say, "Praise the Lord! So many are speaking for the Lord," we will receive Christ as our supply.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>31. By Calling on the Lord out of a Pure Heart<br>for the Pursuing of His Virtues</H2><P>To call on the Lord out of a pure heart for the pursuing of His virtues (2 Tim. 2:22b) is also a way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ. We need to call continually, "O Lord Jesus!" out of a pure heart. This is for the pursuing of righteousness, faith, love, peace, and all the virtues of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>32. By the Renewing of the Spirit,<br>Whom God Pours Out upon Us Richly</H2><P>Another way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ is by the renewing of the Spirit, whom God pours out upon us richly (Titus 3:5-6). God's pouring out of His Spirit is not once for all; it is continuous. Every day and every hour God's pouring out of His Spirit continues. This outpoured Spirit renews us. We need to contact the Lord in order to keep receiving the outpouring of the Spirit, who renews us every moment and every day for our enjoyment of Christ.</P>
