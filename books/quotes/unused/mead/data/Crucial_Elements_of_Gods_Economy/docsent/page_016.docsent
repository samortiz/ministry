   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE GOD S ECONOMY AND GODLINESS Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:3-7; 3:15-16; 2:2; 4:7-8; 6:3, 11; 2 Tim 3:12 DROPPING ALL OUR CONCEPTS AND CARING ONLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all need to learn to have no concepts in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our only concept should be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to allow Christ to saturate our being, occupy our being, and replace all our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The young people may not say much in the meetings, but their talk outside the meetings shows that they are full of concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not long after I was saved as a young person, I came into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first lesson the Lord taught me in the church life was that we need to have no concepts and care only for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to learn to drop our concepts and care only for Christ in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In our daily life, our marriage life, our family life, our school life, and especially our church life, the solution to every problem is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In our dictionary there is only one word, Christ, with a footnote, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we care only for Christ and the church, we will be under the Lord s blessing and on the line of His economy every day, always enjoying life, peace, and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In our private talk, in our prayer, and in the meetings, we should speak of nothing but Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A DEFINITION OF GOD S ECONOMY AND OF GODLINESS God s Economy Being His Administration to Dispense the Triune God into His Chosen People</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this chapter we will consider two terms found in the two Epistles to Timothy: God s economy and godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We will first consider the term God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word economy is commonly used today as a financial term.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The biblical word economy refers to a dispensing administration, an administration that dispenses something into people 1 Tim 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In a kindergarten class at a certain time every day there is an administration to dispense a snack to every child; this is a dispensing administration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word economy is the anglicized form of the Greek word oikonomia, which denotes an administration or stewardship to dispense something.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In ancient times large, wealthy families had a steward to take care of the family affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The stewardship was an administration mainly for dispensing things to the members of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God has a great family.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All His chosen people are the members of His family, His children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second Timothy 2:20 says that God has a great house.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In His great house, His great family, there is a stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul was entrusted with this stewardship, as were all the other apostles 1 Cor 9:17; Eph 3:2; Col 1:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who minister the word to the children of God today also have a part in this stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, the stewardship is the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the New Testament there is only one ministry, and this ministry is the stewardship in God s house, that is, the divine administration to dispense something to God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is being dispensed is simply God Himself in His Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In God s economy, His household administration, the Triune God is being dispensed into His children.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In God s house there is a stewardship, an administration, to dispense the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit reaches us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way the Triune God is being dispensed into all His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the definition of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Godliness Being God s Manifestation in the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The word godliness is used nine times in these two Epistles 1 Tim 2:2; 3:16; 4:7-8; 6:3, 5-6, 11; 2 Tim 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Also, the word godly occurs twice 1 Tim 2:10; 2 Tim 3:12 , and the word ungodliness is used once 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, godliness is an important word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, very few Christians know that the proper definition of the term godliness is God manifested in the flesh, or the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This definition is based on 1 Timothy 3:16, which says, Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit, / Seen by angels, / Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 15 says that the church is the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 16 indicates that the church is God manifested in the flesh, or the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some may think that to say that the church is God manifested in the flesh is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Most Bible scholars do not realize that 1 Timothy 3:16 reveals that the mystery of godliness is God manifested in the church; they think that this verse refers only to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, because taken up in glory is the last phrase in verse 16, it must refer not only to Christ s ascension but also to the church s rapture, for Christ s ascension preceded His being preached among the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This proves that God s being manifested in the flesh refers not only to Christ but also to the church, His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the head is something, the body must be the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ, the Head, is the manifestation of God in the flesh; therefore, the church, His Body, also must be the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First Corinthians 14:24-25 says that when the church is meeting properly, if an unbeliever enters, he will say, Indeed God is among you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever the church comes together properly, God s presence is there God is manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 1 Timothy 3:16 the manifestation of God in the flesh is called the mystery of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Godliness is a mystery because it is real and living yet invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When unbelievers come into a church meeting, they may consider it to be quite mysterious, not understanding why a group of people are singing, shouting, and giving testimonies concerning their personal experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some relatives of the saints have asked them, Why do you go to that meeting place several times every week, always on time and always for several hours?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is there?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Is there some entertainment?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many unbelievers do not understand this mystery, but often when people come into a meeting, they realize that God is there.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church is God manifested in the flesh, the mystery of godliness.</S>
