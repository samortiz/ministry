   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>APPLYING THE ASCENDED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sometimes you say, Oh, I am quite depressed!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do you know what that means?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It means that you are under the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever you feel depressed in spirit or in heart, it means that you are under the threatening of death, you are under the power of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You must learn how to apply Christ, the ascended Christ, to your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You must contact Christ immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You must say, I do not agree to be depressed by any kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have the ascended Christ; I am in the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have to tell the Lord; you have to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When you contact Him, you will be resurrected, you will be ascended, for the Christ whom you contact is the Christ who has ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you contact Him, you will be on the high mountains, not in the valleys.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You will be in the high land, far above sea level.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The problem is that whenever you feel depressed, you forget Christ; you forget that you have such a Christ who is ascended far above all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You do not apply Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You do not come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You do not contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many times brothers have come to me with their minds filled with trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One time a brother in this condition came to me, and after talking with him for a while, I said, Brother, let us kneel down and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He replied, Brother Lee, I cannot pray; my mind is full of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am afraid that sometimes you are just like this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was exceedingly difficult to get him to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you are faced with such a brother, you really need strength.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes you will be influenced by him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since he cannot pray, you will be so depressed by him that you cannot pray either.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You will rise up and say, Brother, what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He has come to ask you what he should do, and then you turn to him with the same question.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without Christ, there is no way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have learned whenever I meet such a situation to exercise my spirit and exercise my faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I say, Lord, you are here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do not agree with this kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Bind the enemy!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Bind the strong man!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Release this brother!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Release his mind!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Make him pray!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need a fighting prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must fight.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever you pray such a prayer to contact the ascended Christ, you will release the spirit of others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You will bring them to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people have been released by such prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They can pray with tears, Lord, praise You, praise You!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am released!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brothers and sisters, how can you fight the battle within you?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I will tell you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The only way is by being in the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the heavens with this ascended Christ, you can fight against the enemy; the enemy will be under your feet.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When you are depressed by Satan, when you have been put under his feet, how can you fight against him?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You must realize that you are in the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You are seated in the heavens in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Listen to what we are told in Ezekiel 34:13-15:</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and bring them into their own land, and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the streams and in all the inhabited places of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I will feed them with good pasture, and their dwelling place will be upon the mountains of the heights of Israel; there they will lie down in a good dwelling place, and on rich pasture they will feed upon the mountains of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I Myself will shepherd My flock, and I will cause them to lie down, declares the Lord Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the high land, on the mountains of Israel, the Lord s people enjoyed the streams.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The streams represent the streams of the Holy Spirit, the living water of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the ascended Christ, you will sense the streams of living waters flowing within you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some times you feel dry in your heart and in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is simply because you are not applying the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>By exercising your faith and your spirit to apply the ascended Christ to your situation, you will immediately sense a living stream within you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are also told that upon the mountains the Lord s people have the good pasture, the fat pasture, upon which to feed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the Christ of life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The pasture represents the Christ who is so full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You will never be hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whenever you feel hungry in spirit, it means that you are not experiencing Christ as the ascended One.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you apply such a Christ to your situation, you will immediately feel satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You will have something to feed upon.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You will have the riches of the pasture of Christ as your supply.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Moreover, in this high land you have the place to lie down with the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is rest.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Are you restless?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Contact the ascended Christ and apply Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>On the mountains of Israel you will find rest.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You will have the living water, you will have the fat pasture, and you will have the good fold in which you may lie.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You will have a refreshing drink, you will have rich and sustaining food, and you will have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>And one thing more, the Lord Himself will be your Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All this will be experienced in the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If you exercise your faith to apply Christ to all your situations, you will enjoy all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You will experience the Lord, not just in knowledge or doctrine but in a very practical way in your daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Furthermore, we are told that on the high land of the mountains of Israel the Lord will accept His people as a sweet savor.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They will serve the Lord there, and the Lord will be with them.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They will offer their oblations to the Lord, and the Lord will accept them.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>On My holy mountain, on the mountain of the height of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah, there will the whole house of Israel, all of them, serve Me in the land; there will I accept them and there will I require your contributions and the firstfruits of your offerings with all your holy things.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As a sweet savor I will accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the countries among which you have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>And you will know that I am Jehovah, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the land concerning which I lifted up My hand to give to your fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>20:40-42</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This means that by experiencing Christ as the ascended one, we will be enabled to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Then we will be accepted by the Lord and have excellent fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It all depends upon our experience of the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>SERVING IN THE ASCENDED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Many times I have met people who have asked me the same question: Brother, do you feel that serving the Lord is easy or hard?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I always answer in this way: It depends upon whether you serve the Lord in yourself or in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If you serve the Lord in yourself, it is very difficult; if you serve the Lord in Christ, it is very easy.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In Christ, even the labor of your work is a bed of rest to you.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The more you labor in the Lord s work, the more you enjoy the Lord s rest.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I was told by Brother Nee, Whenever you feel that your work for the Lord is a burden, you must tell the Lord that you will put it down and lie upon it as your bed.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Can you follow?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>To serve the Lord in the ascended Christ is nothing but a kind of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The more you labor, the more you rest.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The ascended Christ makes all the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>To serve in Him is to rest indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In 1958 I went to Denmark and met a brother who is a full-time worker.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He learned much about serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>While I was there I was asked to give a series of messages in his conference.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Afterwards he came to me and asked, Brother Lee, do you worry?</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I said, Brother, why do you ask such a question?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>He replied, I realize that you bear a great burden.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>You have all the care of the Lord s work in the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>You have so many co-workers, and there are so many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>It is a great work, and there must be many problems associated with it!</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>I would like to know whether you worry about it or not.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>I said to him, Brother, look at my face.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Does it look like I worry?</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>He answered, That s just why I came to you.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>I thought you must have many burdens, troubles, and problems; you must be one who is worrying all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>But when I see your face, there is no sign of it.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>It seems that you don t worry at all.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Then I told him, Brother, praise the Lord, I never worry.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>It is simply because of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>I am in the Christ who has ascended to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>I don t know how to worry, but I do know how to praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Praise Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>I am in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Christ is my high land!</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>I am living in this land!</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>I am walking in this high land!</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>All my troubles, all my problems, all my hardships, and all my burdens are under my feet.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>They have become my seat.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>I can rest in all my hardships; I can rest in all my troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>The more troubles I have, the more I enjoy the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>This is the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>You also can have this experience and have it now.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Christ is in you, and you are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>But I am sorry to say that many times you forget that you have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>You simply forget Him; you do not apply Christ to your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Please do not think that I am some kind of special or peculiar person.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>I am very ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>I am as ordinary and as weak as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>But I have the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Whenever I meet with troubles, I say, Lord, I praise You, here is another opportunity for me to experience You.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Apply Christ to your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Then you will experience Christ as the ascended One, and you will know that you have ascended with Him too.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>In Christ you have ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Oh, brothers and sisters, what a Savior He is!</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>What a Christ He is to us!</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>What a salvation, what a deliverance!</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>He is the living Christ who has ascended to the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>We must realize Christ to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>We have to praise Him that He is the spacious Christ and He is the ascended Christ.</S>
