   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PREOCCUPYING ELEMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the earthly things which are necessary for human existence have become preoccupying elements.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, we must eat in order to exist, but eating has become a preoccupying element.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Likewise, marriage was ordained by God for the existence and multiplication of the human race, but marriage has become a preoccupying element.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Originally, clothing was allowed by God for human existence, but eventually clothing became another item utilized by Satan to occupy people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The same is true regarding housing and transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can become so occupied with these things that there is no ground in us for God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In our human life, there is no time for God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All of our human capacity is preoccupied with and occupied by the things of the world, so no capacity remains in us for God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The body has been corrupted by the sin of Satan and has become the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The soul has been corrupted by the mind, the thought, of Satan and has become the self.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The earthly things have been corrupted by Satan's systematic scheme and have become the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The world is now a satanic system.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Greek this system is called the kosmos.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In English this system is called the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all need to have a clear vision of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To us the things which we need for our existence may simply be earthly things or they may become a world, a system of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you are preoccupied with eating, eating becomes an item of the world to you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When you are preoccupied with marriage, marriage becomes an item of the world to you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When you become preoccupied with clothing, housing, and transportation, these also become items of the world to you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>NOT FRUSTRATED FROM THE WILL OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, we do not need to be preoccupied with the things we need for our existence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For instance, instead of being preoccupied with food, we may simply use food for us to live for God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We will then be able to say with Paul, "Foods are for the stomach, and the stomach for foods; but God will bring to nought both it and them" 1 Cor 6:13a .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not occupied by eating or preoccupied with eating.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The capacity of our human life is not for food it is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To us eating is not an item of the world but merely an item of the earthly things which are necessary for our existence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eating does not frustrate us from the will of God, and it does not hinder us from realizing God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The situation should be the same with marriage, clothing, housing, and transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Marriage is necessary for our existence on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need marriage, but we should not be occupied with marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our marriage should not frustrate us from God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If it does, marriage becomes to us an item of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Likewise, clothing, housing, and transportation are other necessary items of our earthly life, but if we are preoccupied with these things, they will become items of the world to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are here on earth for God, not for food, marriage, clothing, housing, and transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Any of these things that contradicts God's will or hinders God's purpose is an item of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>None of these things should frustrate us from God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If eating does not hinder us from realizing God's will, then for us eating is not an item of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Likewise, if marriage does not frustrate us from God's will, then for us marriage is not an item of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But once marriage frustrates us from the will of God, it becomes for us an item of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the members of our family hinder us from realizing God's will, then, according to the Lord's word in Luke 14:26, we should hate them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to pray that we would see the vision of the world and be delivered from every kind of preoccupation.</S>
