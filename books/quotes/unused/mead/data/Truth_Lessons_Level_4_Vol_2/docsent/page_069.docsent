   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to history, from the time that Cyrus the king of Persia issued the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until Christ was crucified on the cross was a period of seven weeks and sixty-two weeks, that is, four hundred eighty-three years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After this, there is a period of grace, the age of the church, that separates the sixty-nine weeks and the last week.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This also fulfilled the prophecy in Daniel 9:26: The people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the beginning of the last week, Antichrist will make a covenant with the many v. 27 , agreeing that the Jews can offer sacrifices to worship God in the restored and rebuilt temple.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, Antichrist s making a covenant with the many and the Jews recovering their worship in the temple are an indication that the last week of the seven years has begun.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although he initially agrees that the Jews can offer sacrifices to worship in the temple, he will change his attitude and begin to mistreat the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Daniel 9:27 says, In the middle of the week he Antichrist will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Antichrist will order the Jews to stop worshipping God and offering sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Matthew 24:15 the Lord Jesus spoke of seeing the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Antichrist will stop the Jews from worshipping God, exalt himself as God, and put his image in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is an abomination in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 21 says, At that time there will be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor shall by any means ever occur.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After coming to the earth, the dragon will stir up the beast from the sea.</S>
