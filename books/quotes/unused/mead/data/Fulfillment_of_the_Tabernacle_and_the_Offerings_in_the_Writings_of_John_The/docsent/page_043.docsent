   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE SERPENTINE PEOPLE BECOMING THE UNIVERSAL INCREASE OF THE UNLIMITED CHRIST BY THE IMMEASURABLE SPIRIT WITH THE ETERNAL LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6, 8, 14-16, 29-30, 31-36</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous messages we pointed out that the writings of John are concerned with the divine mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These mysteries include the mystery of the divine Person, the mystery of the divine life, and the mystery of the divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually anything that is divine is a mystery to the human mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>NEGLECTING THE MYSTERIES AND FORMING A RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we neglect the mysteries in the writings of John, we may take what is revealed in the Bible and use it to form a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the Bible, Christians teach that there is a God and that this God is triune the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They also teach that the human race has become fallen and sinful in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to God's righteous law, we all should be judged and perish.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christians teach from the Bible that God loves fallen mankind, that He sent His Son into the world as a man, and that this One died on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But since He is the Son of God, He could not be held by death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, He was resurrected, and He has ascended to the heavens, where as the Lord of all He is now sitting at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One day He will come back to set up His kingdom on earth and will reign on earth for a thousand years, a period of time known in Christian teaching as the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Anyone who believes the gospel will receive the forgiveness of sins and will have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This kind of Bible teaching has been spread throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, Christians are taught to worship God, to do everything for the glory of God, and to bring souls to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are also taught to gather together to worship God according to certain rituals, forms or ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In none of these teachings can we see the depths of the mysterious things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christians often talk about eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, eternal life is usually understood to signify some kind of everlasting blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To many Christians, the words "eternal life" do not convey the thought of a mysterious, divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is common for Christians to speak of everlasting life rather than eternal life, according to the King James Version.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the concept of many, the term everlasting life denotes a blessing that lasts forever.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such teachings do not touch the mysteries in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE DIVINE LIFE AND THE DIVINE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is revealed in the depths of the Bible is mysterious, such as the divine life and the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christians speak mainly of four matters related to Christ: Christ in eternity, Christ in the flesh dying to accomplish redemption, Christ in ascension at the right hand of God, and Christ in His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But they miss the crucial matter of the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The indwelling of Christ involves two mysteries: the mystery of the divine life and the mystery of the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Life and the Spirit are two of the most mysterious matters revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today the resurrected Christ is both the divine life and the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ in resurrection is the divine life, the life that in the Bible is called eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is also the divine Spirit, whom the Bible calls the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eternal life and the life-giving Spirit are very mysterious matters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No other mysteries in the Word can compare with these.</S>
