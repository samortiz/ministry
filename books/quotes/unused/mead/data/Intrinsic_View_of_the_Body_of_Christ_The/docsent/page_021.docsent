   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, thank You for Your mercy that we could still be here with You.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lord, You know that Your presence means everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We want to meet with You, stay with You, and dwell with You in Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Grant us Your rich presence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, we also need You to have mercy upon us to take away all of our veils.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not want to have anything veiling us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We want to have an unveiled face, beholding and reflecting You.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, give us mercy that we could see what You see and apprehend what You apprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, reveal Yourself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Reveal all the secrets hidden in Your Word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need this unveiling.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, have mercy upon us in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Oh, how much we need You in our speaking!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, speak in our speaking and be one spirit with us in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord Jesus, today is the darkest age.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Vindicate Your way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Vindicate Your recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Vindicate Your ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Vindicate Your own speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Vindicate Your living word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lord, defeat the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We accuse him before You.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We touch Your throne of authority and ask You to put Your enemy in the corner.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Shame him!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Glorify Yourself and bless everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Bless everyone who is here with You.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We pray in Your mighty name.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am very concerned for all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My concern is that we may read these messages and yet understand them by our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may agree with all of the fellowship here.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may say, "What Brother Lee says is right."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But it is right only according to our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to realize that tradition frustrates and damages us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The saints who have gone to Moscow for the spread of the Lord's recovery have seen that religious tradition still remains there.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some refused to be baptized after they believed in the Lord because they had been baptized when they were infants.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even though religion was cut off by Lenin more than seventy years ago, the Russian Orthodox tradition still remains among them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually, we all have traditions which veil us from the pure divine revelation in the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You understand a certain verse in the Bible in your way, and I may understand the same verse in my way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is because you have your tradition veiling you, and I have my tradition veiling me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, I have a burden to pray, "Lord, take away all the traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We like to see Your Word in a pure way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We like to apprehend what You have for us according to Your realization."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>BEING THE NEW MAN CREATED BY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>AND ENLIVENED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus far, we have seen from Ephesians 1 that the church is the issue of the divine impartation and the divine transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Ephesians 2 this issue is called the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church is the new man created by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Genesis 1 shows that the old creation with the old man was created by God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But the new creation was accomplished by Christ by His being crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>While Christ was being crucified on the cross, He was not merely dying there.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He was creating the Gentile believers and the Jewish believers in Himself into one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Adam we are the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are antique.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Adam we are all about six thousand years old.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God has no intention of keeping any antiques.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God does not love antiques, but God loves the newness and the freshness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As a result, God charged His anointed One, the very Christ, to bring all of the old creation to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Christ all of God's chosen people, who had become old, were brought to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Satan thought that he could get rid of Christ by putting Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But being put on the cross afforded Christ the opportunity and environment to create the new man which God wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He created the new man by putting the old man on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Paul said that our old man has been crucified with Christ Rom 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>While He was being crucified, our old man was also being crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our oldness was cleared up by Christ's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Furthermore, while He was clearing up the oldness, He Himself was there as the creating element.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This element is never old, but ever new.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He was putting this element into the new man He was creating.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He crucified the old man on the cross in Himself as the element.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We know according to the New Testament revelation that this new element could never be applied to us without His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>His crucifixion cleared up all the oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then in His resurrection His new element, the divine element, was applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>While Christ was busy creating the new man, God was also busy making us dead ones alive with the resurrected Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Christ's creating and God's enlivening were in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>While Christ was creating the two, Jews and Gentiles, into the new man, God was enlivening.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He was raising us up from the dead and uplifting us to the third heaven to be above all.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then He subjected all things under the feet of this newly created man.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Furthermore, this man is one with the Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He is Head over all things for the entire new man.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The new man includes Christ as the Head and the church as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The church today is not only the Body but also the entire new man.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Our physical body is not merely the part under our neck.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Our physical body includes our head also.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It includes everything from our hair down to our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The new man is Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>These two are one man.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Whatever the Head is and has is for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Body can never be separated from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Actually, a man's body is his entire physical being.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The new man includes Christ as the Head and the church as the Body.</S>
