<P>Negative things can arise among us because we do not see that the church is organic. If the church is organic, the church does not need to be controlled. Our physical body, strictly speaking, does not need any control. Our body needs to be nourished and cherished. Even an older brother like me needs to be cherished and comforted. This is why I asked at the beginning of this meeting if there was any fellowship and any comfort. This is not my word, but my quotation of Paul's word in Philippians. The apostle appealed to the Philippians for their encouragement and consolation. He begged them to make his joy full if they had any encouragement in Christ, any consolation of love, any fellowship of spirit, any tenderheartedness and compassions toward him (2:1-2). Today I need your encouragement, your consolation, your tenderheartedness, your compassion, and your fellowship to make my joy full.</P><P>The day before yesterday many saints went to the airport to greet me. I thought that the brothers arranged this, but I was told that they all went to the airport to meet me spontaneously. In the past year, especially, I have been under the attack of the enemy. When I came here to Cleveland and saw you all, I was consoled. I am not a weeping person, but if I were, I surely would have wept when I saw you. Your warm welcome at the airport was an encouragement, a consolation, and a fellowship of spirit to me. This was also your tenderheartedness and compassions toward me to make me joyful. All these things are included in being cherished. When you went to the airport to greet me, you cherished me. You "put me into your bosom."</P><P>All of us need the cherishing. Even the apostle Paul needed this kind of cherishing. I am glad to see so many leading ones gathered together for this fellowship. This is an encouragement to me. The Lord in His mercy and grace has put you into your present responsibility. I hope that we all would learn not to control. Instead, we should learn to nourish and cherish the saints.</P><P>In Peter's first Epistle, he spoke to his fellow elders. Peter was an elder in Jerusalem. He charged the elders to shepherd the flock of God (1 Pet. 5:1-2). The word shepherd nearly equals the two words nourish and cherish. A good shepherd always loves the flock, and the flock eventually loves this shepherd. They know each other intimately. To shepherd is not to control. In John 21 the Lord asked Peter, "Do you love Me?" Then He indicated that if Peter loved Him, he would feed His sheep and shepherd His sheep (vv. 15-17). The Lord Jesus spoke this to show how we should take care of the church. We should be those who are one with Him to feed, shepherd, nourish, and cherish the church. This is the organic way to care for the church.</P>
