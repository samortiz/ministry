IN ANY PROBLEM IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>During the eighteen years that I was with the co-workers under Brother Nee&rsquo;s leadership, I never caused any problem nor did I get involved with any problem. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I was a pure person. Brother Nee had two great crises during that time&mdash;one was due to his marriage and the other one was due to his pharmaceutical business. I was the main one to get the situation solved in both of these matters. The last time forced Brother Nee to be away from his ministry for six years. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I went to Shanghai and that brought in a situation which enabled Brother Nee to return to his ministry. A revival was brought in mainly through messages I gave on the tree of life. Nearly all those who did not feel happy with Brother Nee repented. No one proposed or advised this, but they all repented to Brother Nee.</p>
<p>My point is this&mdash;with the elders, the co-workers, and all the brothers, the basic need is to keep yourself from being involved in any problem in the church life. We all must learn to be wise not to create any trouble or to speak a light word concerning anyone in the recovery. We just say something positive.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING RESTRICTED IN ONE PUBLICATION</h2>
<p>One thing that has caused the Lord&rsquo;s recovery trouble is the fact that we have different publications. If we mean business for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must avoid any kind of involvement in problems. When we were on mainland China, only Brother Nee had a publication, and the Gospel Room belonged solely and uniquely to him. He asked me to help in the publication work. I did write some books, among which were a book on the genealogy of Christ, a translation of part of Pember&rsquo;s <em>Earth&rsquo;s Earliest Ages,</em> and some books on the kingdom of the heavens. I never published anything by myself. I always mailed my manuscript to the Gospel Room, which was under Brother Nee and his helper. It was up to their discernment whether my manuscript should be published or not. I liked to have my writings checked as to whether there might be some inaccuracy in the truth. It is not a small matter to write a book that expounds the kingdom of the heavens. I liked my material to pass through their checking. This helped and protected me. Brother Yu, the eye specialist, translated some of the mystical books, but he did not publish anything. We only had one publication. Everything was published through Brother Nee&rsquo;s Gospel Room because the publication is really the trumpeting. The sounding of our trumpet is not just in the verbal message but more in the publication.</p>
<p>I hate to see that some of the brothers would try to publish something by copying my points mixed with their &ldquo;spices&rdquo; and their &ldquo;color.&rdquo; Why do they need to put out some points from my writings in this way? Brother Nee taught us concerning the kingdom of the heavens. I received the basic knowledge from his teaching, but he never expounded on it very much; he simply gave a sketch. It was I who from 1936 began to expound upon the sketch given to me by Brother Nee. After I published my exposition, Brother Nee admired it and told me personally that it was very good.</p>
<p>I hope that some of you brothers would do much development and expounding of all the messages I give. Do not merely speak some points, adding your own &ldquo;color&rdquo; and &ldquo;spices.&rdquo; This changes the taste. It damages my messages. You must receive the ability to expound all these things. I am not narrow. I would like to see that all of you will be great servants used by God. How wonderful that would be. But I do not like to see that some would merely repeat what I have said, pretending that it is their work with their spices and color.</p>
<p>It bothers me that some brothers among us still put out publications. According to my truthful observation there is no new light or life supply there. They may contain some biblical doctrines, but any point of life or light has been adopted from the publications of Living Stream Ministry. There is nearly no item of life or light that has not been covered by our publications. Based upon this fact, what is the need for these brothers to put out their publications? Because all the publications are mine, it is hard for me to speak such a word. But I am forced to tell the truth. By putting out your own publication, you waste your time and money. You waste the money given by the saints, and you waste their time in reading what you publish. Where is the food, the life supply, and the real enlightenment in the other publications among us? Be assured that there is definitely at least one major revelation in every Living Stream Ministry publication.</p>
<p>I was burdened to publish the Life-study Messages to stress the matter of life because this matter has been neglected, missed, and even lost to the uttermost in today&rsquo;s Christianity. In most of the commentaries and expositions there is not much of life. Even the term Life-study is a new term. I have used this term for thirty-two years. In 1954 and 1955 I finished a Life-study on the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation in Taipei.</p>
<p>This does not mean that I am so capable or so knowledgeable. It all depends upon whether or not our sovereign Lord has given you this portion. Even though I wrote some books in mainland China, I never dared to publish anything by myself. I do not like to have another sounding. Our sounding must be one, so we must be restricted in one publication. My intention in calling a writers&rsquo; conference was to encourage you to write something, but not in the way that came out. This fellowship may preserve and protect us from doing things lawlessly.</p>
<p>If some localities would have gone the proper way of the recovery, using all the materials of the ministry, their number would have increased greatly. Some are wasting their time by writing and publishing their own material. This is not their portion. I would like to see that many brothers had this portion with the riches of truth. This would be marvelous and wonderful, but this is our problem today. I advise all of you to take care of this matter. You have to swallow up the dissension. Do not let dissension eat you up.</p>
<p>I hope this fellowship will render some help to all the churches. Take these principles, pray before the Lord, and consider the real situation in your locality. Then you can make some adjustment of the eldership.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 08: The Life-Pulse of the Lord's Present Move &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
