   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Section V General Messages CHAPTER NINETEEN GOD'S ECONOMY AND DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN RELATION TO THE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>PRACTICAL LIVING OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 1:10; 3:8-9, 11; 1 Tim 1:3-4; John 1:14a; 3:16; Phil 1:19; 1 Cor 12:7; Acts 13:52; Eph 1:23; 3:19; Heb 5:12-14; Col 2:19b; John 15:16; 21:15; 3:28-30</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the accomplishments and inventions in the past six thousand years of human history have brought about continual improvement and development among mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This has resulted in today's comfortable living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But according to my experience, the most precious thing on the earth today is not the advance of man's civilization, but the Bible which God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible is precious because it not only shows us clearly the mystery of the universe but also puts before us the unique treasure in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible speaks of the deep things of God, but in God's wisdom He uses simple and understandable words to unveil the mysteries hidden within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand, the Bible seems to be quite simple and understandable.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But on the other hand, the Bible is extremely mysterious and unfathomable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we must have a proper heart when we read it, not holding on to any opinion, and we must be diligent in searching and studying it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way, we will not only see the outward shell of the Bible but also apprehend and enter into the heart of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After I was saved, I began to love and study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After more than sixty-six years of studying the Bible, I have ultimately seen that the center of the Bible is God's economy and dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word economy is rarely used among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, in the Chinese translation of the Bible, the Greek word for economy is translated into arrangement Eph 1:10 or bylaws 1 Tim 1:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the original language, the word economy means household management.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is the arrangement, plan, or administration within a household.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, it is a household administration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This word is also translated into dispensation in English.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Dispensation means the arrangement or the way by which God deals with people in different ages.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In every age God has a certain way of dealing with man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, in the age of the law, God dealt with man according to the standard of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whoever kept the law would be a blessed person, but whoever disobeyed the law would be cursed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The condition by which God dealt with man in the Old Testament was the law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the New Testament, the condition by which God deals with man is faith, not the law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's economy, His arrangement and plan, is to dispense Himself into His chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God chose, predestinated, redeemed, saved, and regenerated us for the purpose of dispensing and working Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For the fulfillment of His economy, God created man, but He first had to create the earth to support man so that man could live.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, in order for the earth to exist, there must be the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The sun, the air, and the rain come from the heavens so that the living things on the earth may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the things on the earth are for man to exist and live on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God also formed a spirit in man that man might receive God and contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's creation of man with a spirit was so that he might contact God and receive God by his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After God created the heavens, the earth, and all the things on the earth in Genesis 1, He came to the last step of His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the sixth day, God created man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After His creation of man, God's creating work was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Genesis 1:26 says that God created man in His own image and according to His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What is God's image?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the revelation in the Bible, God is love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This love, light, holiness, and righteousness are just what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These are God's attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When God created man, He created him according to the image of these attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In God's creation of man, He made him with three parts: spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God is the Divine Trinity, and man is a human tripartition.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, man was created in God's image and according to God's likeness, having the attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness and the three parts of spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this way, man is very much like God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The creation of man is the first step in God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God created man for the purpose of working Himself completely and wholly into man to be man's life, so that man may be His living.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this way, God and man, man and God, are not only joined but also mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some Bible teachers say that the Christian life is an exchanged life Christ comes in and we go out.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is an erroneous teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Christian life should be a life mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We and Christ have the same life and the same living.</S>
