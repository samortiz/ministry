   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE SIXTY-FOUR THE LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SPREADING IN OUR INWARD PARTS THE BASIC CONCEPT OF THE DIVINE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we would thoroughly understand and apprehend the law of life, we must understand the basic concept of the divine revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The basic and central concept in the Bible is that God intends to work Himself into us in order to make us His living expression.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God desires to work Himself into His chosen people that they may be born of Him and have Him as their life and thus become His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is God s desire and intention.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The only way for God to have such a living expression is for Him to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although this basic concept is found throughout the Bible, it has nearly been lost by fundamental Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Fundamental Christianity mainly stresses redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But redemption is not the goal; it is a way, a procedure, to reach the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The goal is to have God wrought into our being that we might be born of Him and that He might become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is our Father and we are His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Being His sons, we all have Him in us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, this life will transform us and conform us to His very image, making us His living expression in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although this basic concept has nearly been lost, we thank God that now, in these last days, He has opened up to us this matter in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For more than forty years, we have been burdened to minister this basic concept to God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is for this reason that we have been falsely accused of teaching heresy, of preaching and teaching something that is not according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our opposers say this because their understanding of the Bible is lacking and inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A little knowledge is dangerous, for it makes people short-sighted and even kills them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We praise God that under His mercy we have seen the basic revelation in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not simply a matter of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No, it is something deeper and higher than this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God is now working Himself into us that we may have His life, that we may be one with Him, and that He may be one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE SON OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>COMING INTO US AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I say again that the way in which God accomplishes His intention is by coming into us, causing us to be born of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order that we might be born of Him, God comes into us in the Son, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God and God Himself, is God s image.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Son is the image, the expression, of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, when you see the Son, you see the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the moment we believed in Him, the Son of God came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This does not mean that He gave us something; it means that He Himself came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to discard the concept that when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, God gave us His life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This understanding is incorrect.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was not that we believed in the Lord Jesus and that God in heaven gave us something and put it into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No, it was that we believed in the Lord Jesus and that the Son of God, the very God Himself, came into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God did not give us His life; He came into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What a great difference!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When God comes into us, He comes in the Son and as the Son, not as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This involves the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is at this point that we are accused of teaching heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But we do not teach heresy we speak the truth according to the pure word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The very person who has come into our being is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But when He comes into us, He does not come as the Father but as the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Father is the source, and the Son is the expression of the source.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The expression and the source are one.</S>
