<h1 class="msg">LESSON SEVEN</h1><h1 class="msg">KNOWING THE TRUE GOD</h1><p>God is the foremost item revealed in the Bible because He is the beginning of all things. Everything in the universe originated from Him and began with Him. God is also the main content of the Bible from its first book to the last. He created us and regenerated us and has everything to do with our life and our being. Thus, we should know Him first.</p><h2 class="head1">I. ALL IDOLS BEING FALSE GODS</h2><p><b>1) “Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands. They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not: they have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not: they have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat…neither is there any breath in their mouths”</b> (Psa. 115:4-7; 135:15-17).</p><p>According to these verses, all idols are false and are not the true God.</p><p><b>2) “We know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one. For if even there are so-called gods…even as there are many gods and many lords, yet to us there is one God”</b> (1 Cor. 8:4-6).</p><p>These verses clearly state that since God is the true God, the one unique God, all the idols are nothing and the so-called gods are not God.</p><p><b>3) “Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity…of them that hate me”</b> (Exo. 20:5).</p><p>This verse also tells us that the one and only true God is a jealous God who hates all the idols and will punish the sin of idol worship.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE UNIQUE TRUE GOD</h2><p><b>1) “I am Jehovah, and there is none else, there is no God beside me”</b> (Isa. 45:5).</p><p><b>2) “Now to the King of the ages, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory unto the ages of the ages”</b> (1 Tim. 1:17).</p><p><b>3) “How you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God”</b> (1 Thes. 1:9).</p><p>These three verses clearly and emphatically reveal to us how God is the unique Jehovah, incorruptible, invisible, and existing unto eternity. Besides Him, there is not another true God.</p><h2 class="head1">III. ELOHIM—THE FAITHFUL MIGHTY ONE</h2><p><b>1) “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth”</b> (Gen. 1:1).</p><p>Here in Hebrew, the word for God is Elohim. This is the first divine title used in the Bible to reveal God, and it means the faithful mighty One. It shows that the true God, whom we worship according to the Bible, is not only mighty but also faithful. He is the mighty One; so He could create the heavens, the earth, all things, and mankind, calling what is not being as being. He is faithful; therefore, He is dependable, ever unchanging, and immovable. His works according to His faithfulness are as enduring as the sun and as established as the moon (Psa. 89:33-37).</p><h2 class="head1">IV. JEHOVAH—THE SELF-EXISTING AND EVER-EXISTING I AM</h2><p><b>1) “And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM [THE SELF-EXISTING AND EVER-EXISTING ONE]…Jehovah God…this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations”</b> (Exo. 3:14-15).</p><p>Here God told Moses in plain words that His name is Jehovah. The name Jehovah is the second main divine title used by the Bible in revealing God. It means the self-existing and ever-existing I Am, the I Am who was, who is, and who is to come. It indicates that He is the I Am, and besides Him nothing is. Only He is, and He is the self-existing and ever-existing I Am, who was, who is, and who is coming. Thus, everything in the entire universe is vain and is not; only He is, only He exists forever, and only He is reality. He is everything to the people whom He created and who belong to Him. Whatever they need, He is.</p>
