   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST TO THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we want to point out five items of Christ's being to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. The Head of the Body, the Church</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have already seen that, according to Colossians 1:18, Christ is the Head of the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>B. The Body of the Head</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is not only the Head of the Body but also the Body of the Head 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because He is the all-inclusive One, He is the Head and He is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>C. The Foundation of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is the foundation of the church 1 Cor 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the church's living foundation, He holds, supports, and dispenses Himself into every part of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>D. The Cornerstone</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>of the House of God, the Church</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is also the cornerstone of the house of God, the church Eph 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the cornerstone of God's building, He joins together the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>E. All the Members of the New Man</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to Colossians 3:10-11, in the new man Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that He is all the members of the new man and in all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may wonder how the church as the Body of Christ can be Christ and how Christ can be all the members of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our experience, this depends upon who lives.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we live alone by ourselves, we are not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we live Christ, letting Christ live in us, then we live in Him, and we are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have seen some wives who really lived their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They did things according to the index of their husbands' eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When they lived in such a way, they were their husbands because they lived their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the church lives Christ, the church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we all live Christ, we are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Christian life should be like this.</S>
