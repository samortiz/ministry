   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 By the Spirit of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The believers not only serve God in their spirit but also serve Him by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Philippians 3:3a Paul says, "We are the circumcision, who serve by the Spirit of God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Literally, the Greek word translated "serve" means to serve as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All New Testament believers are priests to God 1 Pet 2:9; Rev 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, our ministry to the Lord, in whatever aspect, is a priestly ministry, a priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As priests, we must serve God and worship Him in our spirit and by His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever we get into our spirit, we also get into the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Likewise, when we worship God by the Spirit of God, we also worship Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Philippians 3:3a indicates that the only acceptable service and worship we can render to God is not by the flesh but by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit is the means for the believers to serve and worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Judaic worship and service, on the contrary, involve the flesh and the various regulations related to it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Such regulations include the dietary laws, the keeping of the Sabbath, and circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The service and worship rendered to God by the Judaizers in the flesh cannot be acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As New Testament believers, we serve and worship God in our spirit by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are the circumcision, for we have been genuinely circumcised by Christ's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whereas the Judaizers serve by ordinances of law related to the flesh, we serve by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>4 In Spirit and Truth</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The believers serve and worship God in spirit and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"An hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality; for the Father seeks such to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality" John 4:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In typology the worship of God should be in the place chosen by God to set His habitation there Deut 12:5, 11, 13-14, 18 and with the offerings Lev 1 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The place chosen by God for His habitation typifies the human spirit, where God's habitation is today Eph 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The offerings typify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is the fulfillment and reality of all the offerings with which God's people in the Old Testament worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, the Lord's word in John 4:23 and 24 about worshipping God the Spirit in spirit and reality means that we should contact God the Spirit in our spirit, instead of in a specific place, and through Christ, instead of with the offerings, for now, because Christ the reality has come, all the shadows and types are over.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is Spirit, and worshipping God is to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Contacting Him is not a matter of place but a matter of the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In John 4:23 the Lord Jesus said, "An hour is coming, and now is."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that the age has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the past, according to the law of Moses, God ordained that His people worship Him at a specific place where He would establish His habitation with His name Deut 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's worshippers had to go to that unique place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That was a type.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now the age has been changed, and the type has been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Typically speaking, the place of worship should no longer be a place; rather, it must be the human spirit, where God will set up His habitation with His name.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A crucial matter we need to see is that genuine worship, the worship God the Father is seeking, is not in a certain place but in the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Old Testament Mount Zion, the place of God's habitation and the place of His name, was a type of the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the New Testament, God's habitation is not on any mountain, nor even in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's habitation is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually, our spirit is both God's habitation and the place of God's name.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we go elsewhere to worship God, this indicates that we have given up God's name.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is only one place where we can be preserved in God's name, and that place is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we come to our spirit, we keep God's name and we are preserved in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The genuine worship of the Father, the worship He desires, is the worship of Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The genuine worship of God the Father is also in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Old Testament the children of Israel were required to worship God on Mount Zion with the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The offerings typify Christ as reality.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ is the fulfillment and the reality of all the offerings with which God's people worshipped God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ is the genuine sin offering, trespass offering, burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today we worship God in our spirit with Christ as the reality of all the offerings.</S>
