   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD HAPPY WITH THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's good pleasure was expressed firstly in the creation of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Job 38:4, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I can find no hint in the Bible of a similar delight on the part of the angels and the morning stars when the heavens were created.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why was there this singing and shouting for joy when the foundations of the earth were laid?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To the scientists the earth is a small planet, not particularly outstanding in relation to the other heavenly bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To God, however, the earth is the most pleasant planet.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of course, it is also the one which gives Him the most trouble, but nonetheless His heart is for the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do you love the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I surely do not encourage you to love the world, for that belongs to Satan; but the earth is the Lord's and we should love it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A Misconception about Heaven</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is a common belief among Christians that the earth is a place of suffering, but that some day we shall go to a happy place called heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This concept came from Buddhism, which calls this happy place the western heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was Catholicism which introduced this pagan idea into Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God loves the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All His attention is focused on the earth, not on the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ruling on Earth</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's kingdom will be set up on earth, not on any other planet Matt 6:10; Rev 11:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The eternal universe will be called the new heaven and the new earth Rev 21:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's eternal kingdom will not be on the moon, nor on Mars.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The earth is where His pleasure lies, even unto eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>GOD HAPPY WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you read the first chapter of Genesis a few times, you will notice how often it says, "And God saw that it was good" e.g., vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>10, 12, 18, 21, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As He was restoring the creation those first five days, God found that it was good.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, on the sixth day, the day that man was created, "God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good" v. 31 . If the earth is pleasant to God, man is more pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God was so happy with the man He had created that He said "very good."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God does not say "very good" lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If He says only "good" on the day that I meet Him, I shall be satisfied!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For Him to say "very good" indicates He felt emotional.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There were plants and trees, fish and birds, beasts and cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As God saw man in the midst of the rest of His creation, His love toward man prompted Him to say "very good."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man is the delight of God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God loves the earth because it was prepared for this man in whom He delights.</S>
