<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Who is Christ?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>He is the Son of God and also God Himself.</li>
	<li>He came to be a man whose name is Jesus.</li>
	<li>He came as a man in order to be our Savior.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Why was Christ crucified?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>He was crucified in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s way of salvation.</li>
	<li>He was crucified to remove the sins of man.</li>
	<li>He was crucified in order to release His life.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ crucified
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is the Savior; the cross is the means of salvation. Therefore, Christ crucified is the Savior who accomplished the way of salvation.</li>
	<li>Although He was Christ crucified, today He is Christ resurrected! He is no longer on the cross. He is not only the Savior who accomplished the way of salvation, but He is living to impart His saving life into man.</li>
