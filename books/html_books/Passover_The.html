However, not many have seen a clear picture of Christ as the redeeming Lamb of God. The Passover portrayed in Exodus 12 is a clear, adequate, and even all-inclusive type of the redemption of Christ. Nowhere else in the Scriptures is the redemption of Christ presented in such a full way. There it is presented, not as a doctrine, but in relation to a practical need.<p>We all need to see a clear picture of Christ&#8217;s redemption. Although the New Testament reveals the various aspects of redemption, these aspects are not systematized in a doctrinal way. John 1:29 says that Christ is the Lamb of God, and in 1 Corinthians 5:7 Paul speaks of Christ as the Passover. Here and there in the New Testament we see aspects of Christ&#8217;s redemption. In Exodus 12, however, we have a complete picture. We need to consider this picture carefully; then to interpret it properly, we need to turn to other portions of the Word, especially to the New Testament.<p>The Passover is a type of Christ. In 1 Corinthians 5:7 Paul says that &#8220;Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.&#8221; Here Paul does not say that Christ is our lamb; he says that Christ is our Passover. But how could the Passover be sacrificed? The answer is that Christ is not only the Passover lamb, but also every aspect of the Passover. The lamb, the bread, and the bitter herbs are all related to Christ. In principle, therefore, Christ is not only the lamb of the Passover, but the very Passover itself.<p>The word Passover means that the judgment of God passes over us. In Exodus 12:13 the Lord says, &#8220;When I see the blood, I will pass over you.&#8221; Eventually, the Passover became a proper noun in English. The proper noun Passover has its source in the words &#8220;pass over&#8221; in 12:13.<p>But why is Christ called our Passover? According to Exodus 12, God passed over the children of Israel because the blood of the Passover lamb had been sprinkled on the lintel and the doorposts of their houses. The children of Israel had been commanded to eat the flesh of the lamb in their houses. This indicates that the house was to be their covering under which and in which they could eat the flesh of the Passover lamb. The house that covered them was to have blood sprinkled on the lintel and the doorposts. When God saw the blood, He passed over the children of Israel. Hence, this passing over was due to the sprinkled blood.<p>According to Paul, however, we see that the Passover is related not only to the blood, but to Christ Himself. Are we today under the blood, or are we in Christ? Strictly speaking, to say that we are under the blood is not scriptural. This phrase is not found in the New Testament. But the New Testament says repeatedly that we are in Christ. According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, it is of God that we are in Christ. Because we are in Christ, He Himself becomes our Passover. This means that before Christ can be our Passover, He must first be our covering. Our covering today is not the blood; it is Christ. In Exodus 12 the Passover was based on the blood. But today our Passover is based on Christ. This is the reason Paul could say that Christ is our Passover.<p>If you were asked to list the items of the Passover in Exodus 12, you would probably mention the lamb, the flesh, the blood! the unleavened bread, and the herbs. But probably you would not include the house. The house in Exodus 12 is also a type of Christ. At the end of Genesis 3, we see that God used skins to cover Adam and Eve (v. 21). In Genesis 4 Abel &#8220;brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof&#8221; and presented them to the Lord (v. 4). Through this offering, Abel was accepted by God. Later we read that Noah was charged to build an ark, which may be regarded as a floating house. This ark was a type of Christ into whom we have been placed by God. Noah and his family entered into the ark and in it they were saved from the flood. These instances indicate that the revelation in the Bible is progressive. In Genesis 3:21, we have the coats of skins; in Genesis 4:4, the offering of the firstlings of the flock; and in Genesis 6 and 7, the ark made by Noah.<p>In the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob we do not have a clear record of redemption. For this, we must go to the experience of the children of Israel recorded in Exodus 12. Here is the full development of God&#8217;s redemption which was first indicated in Genesis 3. In Genesis 3 we have the skins, in Genesis 4 we have the offering, and in Genesis 6 and 7 we have the ark. Now in Exodus 12 we have set before us the full development of God&#8217;s redemption. Here the ark becomes the house, a type of Christ, in which and by which the children of Israel were covered. This is the reason that no verse in the New Testament says that we are under the covering of the blood of Christ. However, a number of verses, especially in the Epistles, indicate that we are in Christ. According to Galatians 3, God has put us into Christ, and we are now in Christ. Because Christ is the house that covers us, He is our Passover. He is not only the lamb, the unleavened bread, and the herbs; He is also the house whose lintel and doorposts have been sprinkled with the redeeming blood.<h2 class=head1>THE TIME OF THE PASSOVER</h2><p>The time of the Passover is related to a certain month and a certain date. The Hebrew people had two calendars, a sacred calendar and a civil calendar. The civil calendar was common, whereas the sacred calendar was related to the experience of God&#8217;s salvation. We who believe in Christ also have two calendars, a civil calendar and a sacred calendar. Anyone who does not have a sacred age as well as a civil age is not a genuine believer in Christ and cannot share in Christ as the Passover. As God&#8217;s redeemed ones, we have had two births, two beginnings: a physical birth with a physical beginning and a spiritual birth with a spiritual beginning. I can testify that I have had a second beginning, the beginning in the divine life. On the day we believed in the Lord Jesus, our age according to the sacred calendar began. On that day we had a new birth and a new beginning.<h2 class=head2>The Month</h2><p>Exodus 12:2 speaks of the month of the Passover: &#8220;This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.&#8221; This verse indicates that the Passover was held during the first month of the sacred year. Originally, this month was the seventh month of the civil year. According to Genesis 8:4, Noah&#8217;s ark landed on the mountains of Ararat on the seventeenth day of the seventh month. Many Bible teachers believe that this seventh month was the first month of Exodus 12. The Passover was on the fourteenth day of this month. This means it was held three days before the day that marked the landing of the ark on the mountains of Ararat. This landing of the ark was a type of the resurrection of Christ. Christ was killed on the fourteenth day, and He was resurrected on the seventeenth day.<p>Exodus 13:4 says, &#8220;This day came ye out in the month Abib.&#8221; The word Abib means sprouting, budding, tender, and green, and it refers to green ears of wheat. After the Babylonian captivity, this month was called Nisan (Neh. 2:1; Esth. 3:7). Sprouting and budding signify the beginning of life&#8217;s energy. Our experience confirms this. On the day we first called on the name of the Lord, believed in Him, and were saved, life began to bud and sprout from within us. Anyone who has not experienced this is not a genuine believer. We all can testify that after we believed in the Lord Jesus, something began to bud and sprout from within us. Eventually, this sprouting produced tender green ears of grain, the issue of the inner life. This indicates that the divine life within us is productive. It is a budding, sprouting, producing life. This began on the day we were saved, and it is still going on today.<h2 class=head2>The Date</h2><p>According to 12:3, in the tenth day of the month the children of Israel were to take &#8220;to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers,&#8221; and prepare it for a period of four days. Then on the fourteenth day of the month, the actual date of the Passover, the lamb was killed (v. 6). The Lord Jesus was killed on the same day of the month (Luke 22:7-8, 14-15; John 18:28).<p>Fourteen days make up two weeks. In the Bible a week means a life, and the end of a week denotes the end of life. The Seventh Day Adventists observe the seventh day, the end of the week. However. we enjoy the eighth day, the first day of the week, the beginning of a new week, a new beginning in resurrection (John 20:1). The fact that the Passover was held on the fourteenth day of the month means that it was held at the end of two complete weeks. This indicates that the Passover ends the course of the old life. This means that Christ&#8217;s death terminates the entire history of our old life.<p>We have pointed out that the children of Israel took the lamb on the tenth day of the month. After a lamb had been selected, it was examined for four days to test it, to find out whether or not it had blemishes. If you read the Gospels carefully, you will see that the Lord Jesus also was tested for four days. Like the lamb in Exodus 12, He had to be without blemish. During those four days, the Lord Jesus was examined by the congregation of Israel, as represented by the priests, elders, scribes, Pharisees, and Sadducees. Praise the Lord that He passed the test and was found to be without blemish! Therefore, at the end of those days, when the Passover had come, He was put to death.<p>The Lord Jesus was arrested on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread. This day was also the day of the Passover. The feast of Passover takes place on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, which lasts a total of seven days. This means that when the Passover began, the feast of unleavened bread began also. However, the Passover lasted for one day, whereas the feast of unleavened bread continued for another six days. This is the reason that the feast of Passover could also be called the feast of unleavened bread. Hence, Luke 22:7 says, &#8220;Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.&#8221; The Lord Jesus was arrested during the night that preceded the day of the Passover feast. (The Jewish calendar counts from night to day rather than from day to night, just as Genesis 1 does.) Then Christ was crucified on the very day of the Passover. Therefore, His death was the exact fulfillment of the type. Furthermore, as we have pointed out, He was resurrected on the seventeenth day of the month, in fulfillment of the type of the ark resting on the mountains of Ararat on the seventeenth day of the same month.<h2 class=head1>THE LAMB OF THE PASSOVER</h2><h2 class=head2>For a House</h2><p>In 12:3 the children of Israel were commanded to &#8220;take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house.&#8221; The crucial point here is that the Passover lamb was not for every individual, but for every house. The unit of God&#8217;s salvation is not the individual; it is the house, the family. For example, in Joshua 2 and 6 Rahab was saved with all her father&#8217;s household. In Luke 19, the Lord Jesus said to Zaccheus the publican, &#8220;This day is salvation come to this house&#8221; (v. 9). According to Acts 11:14, the promise was made to Cornelius that he and all his house would be saved. Furthermore, when the jailor asked what he must do to be saved, Paul and Silas told him, &#8220;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house&#8221; (Acts 16:30-31). These cases indicate that the unit of God&#8217;s salvation is the house, not the individual.<p>Exodus 12:4 is a verse that is difficult to understand. &#8220;And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb&#8221; (Heb.). The households differed in size. If a man&#8217;s house was too small for the lamb, he and his neighbor were to come together to take one lamb according to the number of the souls. Verse 4 indicates that the lamb was both according to the number of the souls and according to every man&#8217;s eating. The lamb remained the same, but the houses differed in size. The lamb could not be too small for a house, but the house could be too small for the lamb.<p>It may seem that Moses&#8217; composition in verse 4 is awkward. Actually, he wrote in a very meaningful way. If we would understand this verse, we must pay attention to three things: that a household could be too small for the lamb and would need to come together with another household; that the lamb was taken according to the number of souls; and that the count for the lamb was made according to the eating of every man. If we put these three points together, we shall see that Christ is always sufficient. With Him there is no scarcity. The extent to which He can be enjoyed is both according to the number of people and according to our capacity to eat Him. If our capacity is large, Christ is adequate to supply us. If our capacity is limited, He can still meet our need. As the Passover lamb, Christ is all-sufficient. The very Christ typified by the Passover lamb has no scarcity. In every situation He can fully meet our need. It does not matter whether our family is large or small or whether it is joined together with another family. It does not matter how many souls there are or how large our appetite may be. Christ is sufficient to meet all our need.<h2 class=head2>Without Blemish</h2><p>Exodus 12:5 says, &#8220;Your lamb shall be without blemish.&#8221; To be without blemish is to be perfect. This signifies that Christ is perfect, without fault (John 8:46).<h2 class=head2>A Male of the First Year</h2><p>Exodus 12:5 goes on to say that the lamb had to be &#8220;a male of the first year,&#8221; taken either &#8220;out from the sheep, or from the goats.&#8221; What does it mean that the lamb was to be a male of the first year? To be of the first year is to be fresh and not to be used for any other purpose. In the eyes of God, when the Lord Jesus was put on the cross, He was of the first year. He was fresh, never having been used for another purpose.<p>By the time we were saved, we had all been used for some other purpose. Some of us had been used for several different purposes. We were not at all fresh. I was saved at the age of nineteen-and-a-half However, in the eyes of God, I was much older, for I had already been used for other purposes. The Lord Jesus, on the contrary, was fresh and not used for another purpose.<p>Exodus 12:5 indicates that the lamb could be either of the sheep or of the goats. According to Matthew 25, sheep signify those who are good, and goats those who are bad. When Christ was on the cross, was He good or bad? In a very real sense He was both. At the time of His crucifixion, He was both a sheep and a goat, depending from what angle His crucifixion is considered. In Himself Christ was altogether good. However, as our substitute, He was sinful. As Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5:21, He who knew no sin was made sin on our behalf.<h2 class=head2>Examined for Four Days</h2><p>Just as the Passover lamb was examined for four days (12:3, 6), so Christ was examined for the same period of time. After He was arrested, the Lord was subjected to six examinations, three at the hands of the priests who examined Him according to the law of God, and three under the Roman rulers, who tested Him according to Roman law. Eventually, Pilate had to declare that he could not find fault in Him. In fact, Pilate declared three times that he found no fault whatever in Him (John 18:38; 19:4, 6). Christ as the Passover lamb was faultless, without blemish.<h2 class=head2>Killed by the Whole Assembly</h2><p>Speaking of the Passover lamb, 12:6 says, &#8220;The whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.&#8221; Do you know who killed the Lord Jesus? He was killed by the congregation of God&#8217;s people. This means that we all had a part in killing Him.<p>Years ago, I read an article describing how the children of Israel slew the lamb during the Passover. According to this article, the lamb was put on a cross. The children of Israel took two wooden bars and formed a cross. They tied two legs of the lamb at the foot of the cross and fastened the other outstretched legs to the crossbar. Then they slew the lamb so that all its blood was shed, for they needed all of the blood to sprinkle on their door frames. We all know that the Roman Empire used the death penalty of the cross to crucify criminals, but the children of Israel used this method long before the time of the Roman Empire to slay the lamb at their Passover. The way the lamb was killed affords a picture of Christ&#8217;s crucifixion. Therefore, the type of the Passover foreshadowed both the date and the way Christ would be put to death for our redemption.<h2 class=head2>The Blood for Redemption</h2><p>Exodus 12:7 says, &#8220;And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses, wherein they shall eat it&#8221; (Heb.). The blood put on the lintel and on the doorposts was for redemption. This blood typifies the redeeming blood of Christ (Matt. 26:28; John 19:34; 1 Pet. 1:18-19). As the children of Israel applied the Passover lamb, they were in houses that had been sprinkled with the blood of the lamb. This indicates that redemption is based on union. The blood of Christ cannot redeem us unless we are in union with Christ. Only by being in Christ can we be redeemed with the blood of Christ. If we are outside of Christ, His blood cannot redeem us. But once we are in Christ as the house, we are redeemed by the blood that has been sprinkled upon the lintel and doorposts of the house. Because redemption is based on union, we must be in union with Christ, identified with Christ. Then, because we are one with Him, we can be redeemed by His blood.<p>The ark built by Noah also illustrates this matter of union. Noah and his family entered into the ark. In this way they were in union with the ark, identified with the ark. Through this union, this identification, they were saved and redeemed by the ark. In the same principle, in order to be redeemed by the blood of the Passover lamb, the children of Israel had to be in the house that had been sprinkled with the blood. Furthermore, any who would apply the redemption of Christ must be in union with Him.<h2 class=head2>Its Flesh to Be Eaten</h2><p>The flesh of the Passover lamb was to be eaten for life supply (12:8-10). The same is true of the Lord Jesus as the fulfillment of the type. Each of the Gospels speaks of the blood of Christ. The Gospel of John, however, goes on to say that the flesh of Christ is edible. In John 6:53 the Lord Jesus says that we must eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and in verse 55 He declares, &#8220;My flesh is true food.&#8221; Flesh here signifies the life of Christ. The life of Christ is edible; it is our life supply. This is mentioned in the Gospel of John because this Gospel, in contrast to the others, is focused on life. Therefore, this Gospel reveals that the blood of Christ redeems and that the life of Christ supplies. Hallelujah, we have the blood of the Lamb for redemption and the flesh of the Lamb for the supply of life!<h2 class=head2>Roasted with Fire</h2><p>In 12:8 the children of Israel were given the proper way to eat the flesh of the Passover lamb: roasted with fire. Fire here signifies God&#8217;s holy wrath exercised in judgment. When Christ was on the cross, the holy fire of God judged Him and consumed Him. Psalm 22:14 and 15 say, &#8220;My heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels. My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws.&#8221; Then He cried, &#8220;I thirst&#8221; (John 19:28), because He was being burned by the holy fire of God&#8217;s judgment.<h2 class=head2>Not Raw</h2><p>In 12:9 the children of Israel were charged not to eat of the lamb raw. Today those who do not believe in Christ&#8217;s redemption attempt to eat Him &#8220;raw.&#8221; This means that they regard Christ as a model or example of human living for them to imitate. In effect, to do this is to eat the Passover lamb raw.<h2 class=head2>Not Boiled with Water</h2><p>Furthermore, the children of Israel were not to eat the lamb boiled with water (12:9). To eat of Christ as if He were &#8220;boiled with water&#8221; is to regard His death on the cross, not as death for redemption, but as martyrdom. Many today do not believe that Christ died as the Redeemer. According to their concept, He was persecuted by man and died as a martyr, having sacrificed Himself for His teachings. To apply Christ&#8217;s death in this way is to eat the lamb boiled with water. To be boiled in water is to undergo suffering, but not the suffering of holy fire. Rather, this suffering is simply the suffering of persecution.<p>As fundamental Christians, we believe that on the cross Christ suffered for us under God&#8217;s judgment. He was burned and &#8220;roasted&#8221; by the holy fire of God&#8217;s wrath. As our Redeemer, He was judged for us. This is to take Christ roasted with fire. This is the proper way ordained by God. A second way, advocated by modernists, is to take Christ &#8220;raw.&#8221; This is to take Christ as an example and to imitate the way He behaved. The third way is to take Christ &#8220;boiled.&#8221; This is to regard Christ&#8217;s death on the cross as persecution and martyrdom, not as death for our redemption. How do you take Christ-roasted, raw, or boiled? If you believe that Christ died on the cross as a martyr because of man&#8217;s persecution, then you eat the Passover lamb by boiling it in water. However, if you believe that He died as our Redeemer, being roasted by the holy fire of God, then you eat Him as the Passover lamb roasted in fire.<h2 class=head2>With Its Head, Legs, and Inwards</h2><p>The children of Israel were to eat the lamb with its head, legs, and inwards (12:9, Heb.). The head signifies wisdom, the legs signify activity and move, and the inwards signify the various inward parts of Christ&#8217;s being. To eat the Passover lamb with the head, legs, and inwards is to take Christ as a whole, in His entirety. As we eat Him, we take His wisdom, activities, move, and inward parts.<h2 class=head2>With Unleavened Bread and Bitter Herbs</h2><p>According to 12:8, the children of Israel were to eat the flesh of the lamb with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. To eat with unleavened bread means to eliminate all sinful things. When we enjoy Christ as our Passover, we must purge away everything sinful. At the same time, we need to eat bitter herbs. This means that we need to regret and repent. to experience a hitter taste regarding sinful things. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, many of us received Him as our life supply and also gave up everything sinful. At the same time, we experienced regret and repentance. This indicates that we ate Christ with bitter herbs.<p>We should not take the lamb without the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs. Whenever you receive Christ as your supply, you receive a life without sin, without leaven, that gives you a bitter feeling when you sin, that repents when you make a mistake. This life is sensitive to sin, to any kind of wrongdoing, to anything of the self. To keep yourself unleavened, you have to repent.<h2 class=head2>With Nothing Left until Morning</h2><p>Exodus 12:10 says, &#8220;And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.&#8221; Nothing of the Passover lamb was to be left until morning. This indicates that we are to receive Christ in a full way, not partially. Do not allow anything of Christ to be left over. Rather, take Him in full.<h2 class=head2>Its Bones Not Broken</h2><p>Exodus 12:46 says that the children of Israel were not to break any of the bones of the Passover lamb. When Christ was crucified as our Passover lamb, His legs were not broken (John 19:33, 36). The fact that Christ&#8217;s legs were not broken signifies that in Christ, the Passover lamb, there is something unbreakable and indestructible. This unbreakable and indestructible element is His eternal life. The Roman soldiers and Jewish people could come together to put Christ on the cross, but they could not break His eternal life.<p>We can prove from the Scriptures that the bone signifies life. According to Genesis 2:21, the Lord took a bone, a rib, out of Adam and built it into a woman. The woman, Eve, was produced from a bone taken out of Adam. Hence, a bone signifies life that imparts life. The bone taken out of Adam imparted Adam&#8217;s life into Eve. In the same principle, Christ&#8217;s unbroken bone signifies His unbreakable and indestructible eternal life that imparts His life into us. In Christ as our Passover lamb there is such an unbreakable and indestructible life that can impart life into us.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>HOW TO APPLY THE PASSOVER</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Exo. 12:11-28, 46-51; 1 Cor. 5:7-8; 1:30</h1><p>The record of the Passover given in Exodus is very detailed. Nowhere else in the Scriptures do we find such a detailed account of Christ&#8217;s redemption The reason for all the details is that God wants us to know the redemption of Christ in such thorough way that we can never forget it. Twice the word memorial is used (12:14; 13:9). This indicates that it is God&#8217;s intention that we neither neglect the redemption of Christ nor forget it. Rather, we are to remember Christ&#8217;s redemption, not in a general way, but in a specific and detailed way.<p>One of the details in the account of the Passover concerns the eating of the flesh of the lamb. The flesh of the Passover lamb signifies Christ&#8217;s crucified and resurrected life that is our supply. In John 6:53 the Lord Jesus said that if we would have life, we must eat the flesh of the Son of Man. In verse 55 He went on to say, &#8220;My flesh is true food.&#8221; Through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, Christ&#8217;s flesh has become our food.<p>Another detail is related to the bones of the Passover lamb. The children of Israel were told in 12:46 that none of the bones of the lamb used in the Passover were to be broken. This is of great significance. When the Lord Jesus was crucified, His bones were not broken (John 19:33, 36). This indicates that within Christ there is something unbreakable and indestructible. Christ&#8217;s unbroken bones signify the life that imparts life. This is typified by Eve being produced from Adam&#8217;s rib. Just as Adam&#8217;s bone could impart life into Eve to make her Adam&#8217;s counterpart, so Christ&#8217;s indestructible life has imparted life into us to make us His counterpart. Adam&#8217;s rib typifies Christ&#8217;s life that imparts life. In Christ there is a life signified by the unbroken bones of the Passover lamb. This life is Christ&#8217;s eternal, divine life that imparts life into us.<p>We need to be deeply impressed with all the details of the Passover. As we consider these details, we realize that the account of the Passover is not simple or easy to understand.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO APPLY THE PASSOVER LAMB</h2><p>In this chapter we shall consider the way to apply the Passover lamb. The Passover lamb is wonderful, but if we do not know how to apply it, the lamb will have little meaning in our daily subjective experience. Therefore, our concern in this chapter is with the subjective experience of Christ as the Passover.<h2 class=head2>Eat with Loins Girded</h2><p>Exodus 12:11 says, &#8220;And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is Jehovah&#8217;s passover&#8221; (Heb.). As the children of Israel were eating the Passover lamb, they were like an army. Exodus 12:51 says that the Lord brought the children of Israel &#8220;out of the land of Egypt by their armies.&#8221; Not many Christians today realize that they should be an army. On the contrary, the prevailing concept seems to be that anyone who believes in the Lord Jesus should be placed in a palanquin and carried away to heaven. However, according to the picture in the book of Exodus, the redeemed ones applied the Passover in such a way that they could become God&#8217;s army.<p>According to 12:11, the children of Israel ate with their loins girded. Before we were saved, we were somewhat loose; our being had not been girded up. To be girded is part of the preparation to be a soldier in the army. By girding ourselves we make ourselves ready to fight.<p>The gospel preached by many Christians today is not complete. When you heard the gospel, were you told to repent, believe in the Lord Jesus, receive Him, and then gird yourself up? Few of us were told that we needed to gird ourselves. However, the matter of being girded is here in Exodus 12. This record is complete. Only when we have girded up our loins are we qualified to apply the Passover. If we are still loose. we cannot partake of the Passover in a proper way.<h2 class=head2>With Shoes on Their Feet</h2><p>The children of Israel were also told to have shoes on their feet. This indicates that they were to make themselves ready for a journey. In an army all soldiers need proper shoes. Before we were saved, our feet were not shod. If we desire to fight the battle for the Lord, we need the right kind of shoes on our feet. I am sorry that the preaching of the gospel in today&#8217;s Christianity rarely includes a word about the need to have shoes on our feet in order to apply the Passover lamb. I hope that the Holy Spirit will speak to many concerning this.<h2 class=head2>With a Staff in Hand</h2><p>Furthermore, in 12:11 the children of Israel were told to eat the Passover with their staff in hand. The staff was also to be used for the journey. In ancient times, when people went on a long journey they often took a staff. The girdle, the shoes, and the staff were all for the journey that the children of Israel were about to make. This journey was not to be a journey of peace, but a journey of war. In a sense they had to fight their way out of Egypt.<p>We thank the Lord that although we may not have heard about these things when the gospel was preached to us, many of us had some experience of them at the time we were saved. When we decided to take Christ as our Savior. inwardly we had the sense that we had been made ready for a long journey. This was my experience. It seemed to me that I had given up my former journey and was ready to start on a new journey, to have a new life with a new beginning. Did you not have such an experience when you believed in the Lord? Were you not made ready for a new journey, a new walk? Perhaps you did not have words for it, but the Holy Spirit did equip you in such a way and did lead you into a journey of fighting. You realized that a new life, a new journey, had just begun.<h2 class=head2>In Haste</h2><p>Finally, 12:11 says that God&#8217;s redeemed people were to eat the Passover in haste. Because they had to flee from the land of Egypt that night, they were required to eat the Passover lamb hastily. Soldiers are often required to eat their meals quickly. Those who have been in the army realize that soldiers are trained to eat in this way. Because a battle lies ahead of us, we must eat the Passover lamb in haste. Do not excuse yourself by saying that you were born with a slow disposition. Those who are slow may be the first to be attacked by the enemy from the rear. Those who eat fast are probably those who are at the front of the army.<h2 class=head2>Touch the Lintel and the Two Side Posts with the Blood</h2><p>Exodus 12:22 says, &#8220;And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and touch the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin&#8221; (Heb.). Notice that the blood was put on the entrance of the house, not on the roof. The function of the entrance is to allow the proper persons and things to come into the house. Anyone or anything that is not proper is shut out by the entrance. The fact that the blood of the Passover lamb was put on the lintel and the two side posts of the door implies that the blood opens the way for us to get into Christ, who is typified by the house. The redeemed ones come into the house, not through the roof or through a window, but through the door that has been sprinkled with the redeeming blood. Hallelujah, our entry into Christ has been guaranteed by His redeeming blood! Coming into Christ through the door sprinkled with the blood, we receive a warm welcome.<p>Furthermore, the blood on the door protected the redeemed ones from God&#8217;s judgment. As 12:13 says, the blood was to be &#8220;a token upon the houses&#8221; where the children of Israel were. Verse 23 goes on to say, &#8220;For Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you&#8221; (Heb.). The same blood opened the way for the redeemed ones to get into the house and closed the gates to the destroyer, thereby guarding God&#8217;s redeemed ones from judgment. Praise the Lord that we have a gate that has been sprinkled with the redeeming blood! This gate opens to us God&#8217;s grace with all that He is to us and all that He has for us. Furthermore, this gate shuts out every negative thing. Hallelujah, we are in the house whose gate has been sprinkled with the blood!<p>In the foregoing chapter we pointed out that both the lamb and the house typify Christ. This means that the lamb is the house and the house is the lamb. The lamb is the means of redemption, and the house is the means of preservation. Whoever is redeemed by the lamb is preserved and kept by the house. This indicates that whatever Christ redeems, He keeps. As the redeeming One, He is the lamb, and as the keeping One, He is the house. Eventually, the blood of the lamb was on the door, and the meat of the lamb was in the house The lamb, the house, and those who enjoyed the Passover thus became one. This is a picture of the identification of the redeemed ones with Christ.<h2 class=head2>With Hyssop</h2><p>A bunch of hyssop was used to put the blood of the lamb on the lintel and the doorposts. First Kings 4:33 says that, in his wisdom, Solomon &#8220;spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall.&#8221; Hyssop was among the smallest of the plants. According to the revelation in the New Testament, the thing that is the smallest in quantity is our faith (Matt. 17:20). Hence, hyssop signifies faith. God does not require that our faith be like a cedar tree, for none of us could meet such a requirement. God requires that we have just a little faith. Even if our faith is very small, we still can apply the Passover lamb. If a sinner prays, &#8220;Lord Jesus, thank You for dying for me,&#8221; he will be saved. Even such a small amount of faith will save him. Actually, one can be saved just by saying, &#8220;Lord, thank You.&#8221; This is faith that is like hyssop that springs out of the wall. It is by such little faith that the blood of Christ is applied.<p>According to 12:22, the blood of the Passover lamb was in a basin, not a large vessel. Many can testify that in their experience of conversion the redeeming blood of Christ was made available to them in a way that was small and easy to apply. It was not necessary to have great faith. Even a very small amount of faith was sufficient for them to be saved. This is the significance of using a bunch of hyssop to apply the blood of the Passover lamb. Both the basin and the hyssop were small and could be handled easily by anyone. How easy it is to apply Christ!<p>Any unsaved person who is reading this chapter does not need to wait for something great to happen. As he is reading, he can say, &#8220;Lord, I thank You.&#8221; Even by the exercise of such a small amount of hyssop, the blood will be applied to him, and the entire Passover will be his. The blood of the Passover lamb is applied not by great faith, but by a small amount of faith. Praise the Lord that even a little faith is sufficient! By applying the blood in faith, we have an entrance into Christ, and we are immediately ushered into Him as the house, where the whole Passover becomes ours.<h2 class=head2>Remain in the House</h2><p>The children of Israel were required to stay in the house whose door had been touched with the blood; they were not to go out of it until the morning (12:22). To understand the significance of this we need to see that the basic concept in the Bible with respect to redemption is identification or union. Without identification there can be no substitution, which is necessary for redemption. On the cross Christ died as our substitute. However, His being our substitute requires us to be identified with Him.<p>In the Old Testament, the ark of Noah as a type illustrates this matter of identification. In order to be saved from the waters of judgment, Noah and his family had to be in the ark. To be in the ark was to be identified with the ark, to be one with the ark. The destiny of the ark was automatically the destiny of everyone in the ark. Whatever happened to the ark became the experience of the people who were one with the ark. After the door of the ark was closed, others may have held onto the ark in desperation. But they were not one with the ark or identified with it. The only way to be one with Christ is to enter into Him. In the words of 1 Corinthians 1:30, it is of God that we are in Christ Jesus. God has put us into Christ. As the eight persons were in the ark of Noah, so we, the redeemed ones, are in Christ Jesus.<p>Our entrance into Christ is through the door to which the blood has been applied. When we use hyssop to put the blood on the door, we are able to enter into Christ. After getting into Christ, we need to remain in Him. In John 15 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Abide in Me.&#8221; To abide in Christ is to remain in Him, that is, to maintain our identification, our union, with Him.<p>The effect of some of the teachings in Christianity is to cause believers to be separate from Christ and to lose their identification with Him. Any teaching that causes us to lose our union with Christ can avail nothing. Anything apart from Christ is human effort or strife. There is no need for us to struggle or strive. We simply need to enter into the house through the blood-sprinkled gate. Once we are in the house, we are one with the house and identified with it.<p>All who believe in Christ were in the house at the time of their conversion. But shortly thereafter, as far as their practical daily experience is concerned, many came out of the house. In their experience, not many Christians stay in the house after their conversion. This means that when they believed in Christ and were saved, they entered into the house. But then they began to do many things apart from the house and outside of the house. This means that they did things outside of Christ. This has been the experience of many of us. We entered into Christ when we were saved. But in our effort to please God by ourselves, we came out of Christ. We did not remain in Him.<p>After we came to the church, we were brought back into the house through the ministry of the Word. Those who came into the church life still may not be in Christ in a practical way. This is a source of trouble in the church Everyone in the church should be in Christ. However, there may arise an abnormal condition wherein many who are in the church life are not abiding in Christ. Before coming into the church life you may have struggled in your own energy to please the Lord. Now that you have come into the church, which is part of the house, you need also to come back into the house. This means that you need to come back to Christ and remain in Him.<p>We were all saved in Christ But, like the Galatians, we may try to go on apart from Christ. Thus, we must be brought back to Christ. There is no need for us to do so many things. We should simply maintain our identification with Christ, with a constant realization that we are nothing and that He is everything. We need to see that we are in Him and that He is in us. As long as we abide in Him, He will abide in us. As the Lord Himself said in John 15, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you.&#8221;<p>Some may have heard this teaching before they came into the church life. The crucial matter, however, is not whether or not you know the teaching about abiding in Christ; it is whether or not you are actually abiding in Him. Where are you at this very moment? Are you in Christ, or are you apart from Christ? The Lord Jesus said that apart from Him we can do nothing (John 15:5). To remain in the house is to abide in Christ and to be identified with Him. In other words, it is to remain in oneness with the Lord.<p>The greatest problem among believers today is that in their experience, they are outside of Christ, apart from the oneness with Christ. Moses charged the children of Israel to eat the lamb in the house and then to stay in the house. If they had come out of the house, they would have lost everything. In the house they had the full enjoyment of the Passover. Only in the house could the Passover become their experience.<p>We need to be clear concerning what the house is and where the house is today. We have emphasized the fact that the house is Christ. But where is the house? The house is where there is the sprinkling of the blood. The unique sign of the house is not what we are, have, or do. It is the sprinkled blood of Christ. Where redemption is, there Christ is also. Apart from redemption, we have no standing. Our unique standing is the redeeming blood of Christ.<p>If you read the book of Galatians, you will see that the Galatians had been distracted from the standing of redemption. They had come out of the house and were thus deprived of the benefit, the profit, of being in Christ. If the children of Israel had not remained in the house, they would have been deprived of the benefit, profit, enjoyment, and experience of the Passover. To participate in the Passover there was the need to remain in the house. Once we are saved, we need to remain in the very place where we have been redeemed, in the place where the blood has been sprinkled. Here in this place we have the house.<p>The redeeming blood keeps us in Christ. Whenever we try in our own energy to do something for God, we violate the principle of redemption. The principle of redemption is that there is no need for us to do anything other than to exercise our hyssop, our faith, to apply the blood. Whenever our hyssop applies the blood to the gate, the way is open for us to be in Christ. Let us remain in the place of redemption, in the house with the blood-sprinkled entrance. We should not practice those things which cause us to come out of the house. Rather, we should stay in the house where we participate in the Passover.<p>The longer we remain in the house, the more light we receive; and the more light we receive, the more we see that everything we need is in the house. If we stay in the house, we will be filled, qualified, equipped, and formed into an army. Our only need is to remain in Christ as the house.<p>When I was young, I heard a number of messages on the Passover. All these messages emphasized the one point that when God sees the blood, He passes over us. A well-known gospel song even uses the words from Exodus 12:13, &#8220;When I see the blood, I will pass over you.&#8221; But in all these messages I heard on the Passover, not a word was spoken about remaining in the house. Only twice are we told that when God sees the blood, He will pass over us. But time after time Moses spoke of the house.<p>If you are enlightened by the Lord, you may realize that even now, in your experience, you are outside of the house, outside of Christ. The only way to get into the house is through the redeeming blood sprinkled on the gate. It is impossible to separate the redeeming blood from the house, for the blood and the house are one. Whenever we maintain the standing of the redeeming blood, we are in Christ. However, when we endeavor in our natural energy to please God, we leave the standing of the redeeming blood and are outside of Christ.<p>Do you know what the children of Israel were doing inside the house? They were eating the flesh of the Passover lamb. Exodus 12:14 indicates that they were feasting. This verse says, &#8220;And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to Jehovah throughout your generations&#8221; (Heb.). What does it mean to have a feast to the Lord? It means that we remain in the house and enjoy a full participation in the lamb. In this way we feast on the lamb. But the Lord enjoys this feast more than we do. To have a feast unto Him means that we feast for Him and with Him. We eat, but He enjoys. We feast, and He is happy. The more we feast, the more enjoyment He has and the happier He is. However, the more we endeavor to do things, the more displeased He becomes, for our endeavors do not give Him any enjoyment.<p>What a poor situation there is in today&#8217;s Christianity! Most Christians are outside of the house trying to do things for the Lord; they are not in the house feasting unto the Lord. Praise Him that we in the local churches are in the house feasting unto the Lord!<p>This principle of staying in the house by keeping the standing of redemption must govern our whole Christian life. All day long we, the redeemed ones, should remain in the house. When some hear this, they may point out that the children of Israel left the house in order to make their exodus out of Egypt. However, the time they spent in the house signifies the full course of redemption.<p>As we remain in the house feasting on the Passover lamb, we are equipped. Actually, the feasting is the equipping. When the children of Israel were filled with the Passover lamb, they were ready to march out of Egypt. Hence, they were equipped by being filled with the lamb. This is the reason we say that remaining in the house involves the full course of redemption.<p>Do not think that the blood sprinkled on the lintel and the door posts is sufficient for everything. It is sufficient to usher us into the house and to keep us from the judgment of God, but it is not sufficient to equip us. It cannot enable us to make the journey. For this, we need to roast the lamb, eat its flesh in the house hastily, and be filled with the lamb. Every part of the Passover lamb must be eaten, including the head, the legs, and the inward parts. Nothing should be left over. Perhaps the children of Israel had to encourage one another to eat certain parts of the lamb. Some may not have cared for the inward parts or the head, but nevertheless they had to eat the whole lamb in order to be fully equipped for the battle.<p>As we feast on Christ as the Passover lamb, God is happy and full of enjoyment. Then He can say, &#8220;Satan, look at My people. They are being equipped by feasting on the Passover lamb. Because they are being equipped in this way, they will be able to defeat you.&#8221;<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Exo. 12:11-28, 43-51; 13:2-7; 1 Cor. 5:7-8; 15:45a, 47b</h1><p>The redemption of Christ is mysterious, beyond our understanding. I believe that this is the reason the Passover in the Old Testament portrays all the elements, factors, and aspects of the redemption of Christ revealed in the New Testament. If we had the plain words of the New Testament without the picture in the Old Testament, it would be difficult for us to see all the details of the wonderful and mysterious redemption of Christ. How we thank the Lord for the portrait of redemption presented in the book of Exodus!<p>In the foregoing chapters, we have covered a number of details regarding the Passover. We have seen that Christ is not only the Passover lamb, but also the unleavened bread, the bitter herbs, and the house. The blood of the lamb was put on the lintel and the doorposts of the houses; and all the lamb, including the head, legs, and inwards, was eaten. As the children of Israel ate the lamb, it was necessary for them to have their loins girded, to have their feet shod, and to have a staff in their hands. Furthermore, they had to eat the lamb in haste. The lamb was not to be eaten either raw or boiled; it had to be roasted in fire. Moreover, hyssop, signifying faith, was used to put the blood of the Passover lamb on the lintel and on the doorposts. All these details had to be observed by the children of Israel as they were sharing in the Passover. In this chapter we shall go on to consider some further details concerning the way to apply the Passover lamb.<h2 class=head1>THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD</h2><p>The Passover feast lasted just one day. It was held on the fourteenth day of the first month, the month Abib. Continuing from the feast of the Passover, there was another feast, the feast of unleavened bread, which lasted seven days. In the Bible seven days indicate a complete course of time, a whole period of time. Hence these seven days signify the course of our life on earth. In the eyes of God, the full course of our life is just seven days.<p>The feast of unleavened bread began and ended with days of feasting. Both on the first day and on the last day, no work was permitted. The children of Israel were only allowed to eat.<p>The details we shall cover in this chapter are especially crucial. What we have covered thus far is related to the feast of the Passover, which lasted for one day. But what we shall cover in this chapter is related to a feast that lasted for seven days, period of time that signifies the course of human life.<h2 class=head2>Leaven</h2><p>Concerning the Passover, the emphasis in the Bible is mainly on the eating of the Passover, not on the keeping of the Passover. For example, Luke 22 speaks of the Lord eating the Passover with His disciples (vv. 11,15). There, the Passover is a feast for us to eat. Exodus 12 speaks of eating the flesh, unleavened bread, and bitter herbs The significance of eating rests in the fact that we live by what we eat. In human life nothing is more important than eating.<p>The children of Israel were not to eat leavened bread for a period of seven days Exodus 12:15 says, &#8220;Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses.&#8221; According to 12:19, no leaven was to be found in the houses, and according to 13:7, no leaven was to be seen with the children of Israel. During the days of the feast of unleavened bread, the children of Israel were not to eat leavened bread, leaven was not to be found in their houses, and leavened bread was not to be seen with them.<p>Eating unleavened bread indicates that God&#8217;s people should not live in sin, that is, should not live a sinful life. In the Bible leaven signifies what is sinful, evil, corrupt, and unclean in the eyes of God. In 1 Corinthians 5:8 Paul speaks of &#8220;the leaven of malice and wickedness.&#8221;<p>The function of leaven is to make something easier to eat. Suppose bread is made without yeast or any other type of leaven. This kind of bread would be heavy and hard to chew. But if leaven is put into bread dough, the bread will be soft and easy to eat. The function of sin is similar to the function of yeast; it softens things that are hard and makes them easier for us to take in. The principle of leaven, therefore, is to add an element that causes something hard to become soft. For example, joking may be a kind of leaven that makes a difficult situation easier to take.<h2 class=head2>Continuing the Feast of Passover</h2><p>The children of Israel were to observe the feast of unleavened bread as a continuation of the feast of Passover (12:15-20; 13:6-7). Exodus 12:18 says, &#8220;In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.&#8221; We have pointed out that when the children of Israel ate the Passover lamb, they were also required to eat unleavened bread. We have seen that the feast of the Passover lasted one day, whereas the feast of unleavened bread continued for seven days. Therefore, the feast of unleavened bread was a continuation of the feast of Passover.<p>The flesh of the Passover lamb signifies the sinless life of Christ. We received Christ not only in His death and resurrection, but also in His sinlessness, for His life is not only a crucified and resurrected life, but also a sinless life. Therefore, we must eat the flesh of the lamb and also the unleavened bread. This means that from the time we received Christ and were saved and had a new beginning in life, we began to live a life without leaven, a life without sin.<p>Exodus 13:7 says that no leaven was to be seen with the children of Israel. In our Christian life no leaven should be seen. It is impossible for us to have no leaven at all, but it is possible for the leaven not to be seen. Although it is not possible for us to be without sin, we must deal with any sin that is manifested, with any sin that is seen. This means that we are responsible to deal with the sin of which we are conscious. Whenever we discover something sinful in our lives, we must eliminate it. This, however, does not mean that we shall have no sin. There may be much sin in our lives or in our environment, but we may not be conscious of it. However, as soon as we become conscious of it, we must deal with it. We must forsake the sin of which we are conscious. We should not tolerate any manifestation of sin.<p>In 12:19 the children of Israel were given a strong word: &#8220;Whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.&#8221; To be cut off from the congregation of Israel was to be cut off from the fellowship of God&#8217;s chosen people. This serious word corresponds to Paul&#8217;s word in 1 Corinthians 5:13: &#8220;Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.&#8221; To put away such a one is to cut him off from the fellowship of the church.<p>If we tolerate sin once it has been exposed, our fellowship will be cut off. This indicates that as Christians we should live a sinless life, not tolerating any sin that has been exposed. To deal with manifested sin is to observe the feast of unleavened bread.<p>Exodus 12:14 says, &#8220;This day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to Jehovah throughout your generations: ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever&#8221; (Heb.). This verse indicates that the Passover was to be kept as a feast. The same was true regarding the feast of unleavened bread (12:17). A feast involves both eating and enjoyment. Whenever we eat without having enjoyment as the purpose of our eating, that eating is common. But when we eat for enjoyment, our eating becomes a feast. For example, we may daily eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner without any special enjoyment. But sometimes we come together to hold a feast. At such times, our eating is for the purpose of enjoyment. The eating of the Passover was called the feast of Passover because it was an eating for enjoyment.<p>When we were saved, we enjoyed the feast of Passover. But this feast should immediately be continued by the feast of unleavened bread. This indicates that a Christian&#8217;s enjoyment should not cease. However, in the experience of many Christians, the feast of Passover is not followed by the feast of unleavened bread. At the time of their conversion, they were joyful But this enjoyment did not last, because they did not observe the feast of unleavened bread. This means that they did not deal with their sinful living. Rather, they allowed the leaven that was exposed to remain. They did not deal with sin that had been exposed. For this reason, many Christians do not observe the feast of unleavened bread.<p>After we receive the Lord and are saved, we should continue our enjoyment by dealing with sin. This should last not just for one day, but for seven days. This means that it should last throughout the course of our life. Our whole life after we are saved should be a feast of unleavened bread.<p>This was Paul&#8217;s concept in 1 Corinthians 5. In verse 7 Paul says, &#8220;Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.&#8221; Then in verse 8 he goes on to tell us to &#8220;keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.&#8221; Day by day we need to keep the feast of unleavened bread. We should keep this feast throughout the course of our Christian life until we see the Lord.<p>As soon as we refuse to deal with any sin that has been exposed, we no longer keep the feast of unleavened bread. This means that we lose the enjoyment of this feast. Tolerating sin causes loss of enjoyment. On the contrary, the more we deal with sin that has been manifested or exposed, the more enjoyment we have. This is to keep the feast of unleavened bread.<p>I appreciate the way Paul allegorized the Passover and the feast of unleavened bread. He says that Christ our Passover has been sacrificed, that we should purge out the old leaven, and that we should keep the feast of unleavened bread. We keep this feast by dealing with sin and by living a sinless life. Whenever something sinful is exposed, we immediately deal with it. In this way no leaven shall be seen in our houses. Christ is the unleavened bread. The more we eat Him, the more we shall become unleavened. The only way to eliminate sin is to eat Christ&#8217;s crucified, resurrected, and sinless life.<h2 class=head2>Not Working, but Eating</h2><p>Exodus 12:16 says, &#8220;And in the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.&#8221; This verse says that on the first and last days of the feast of unleavened bread no manner of work was to be done. This signifies that in the enjoyment of God&#8217;s salvation, there is no place for our work. We must learn to stop our doing We must cease from every kind of work. Do not resolve to be a loving husband, a submissive wife, or a child who honors his parents. All this is human work. The only thing we are permitted to do is eat. This indicates that as we partake of God&#8217;s salvation, there is room only for enjoyment, not for working. Do not try to do anything-just eat and enjoy.<p>The situation of today&#8217;s Christianity is just the opposite. Instead of eating, there is working. Sermon upon sermon is given charging people to engage in certain kinds of work. This contradicts the principle of God&#8217;s salvation. God&#8217;s salvation does not allow us to do any work.<p>Due to our serpentine nature, immediately after we were saved or revived, we made up our mind to do certain things. Some resolved not to lose their temper; others decided to be humble. But the Lord makes no allowance for this kind of work. In God&#8217;s salvation we are only allowed to eat.<p>In contrast to the writings of the religions of man, the Bible charges God&#8217;s people concerning the first and last days of the feast to do nothing except eat. If the children of Israel worked on these days, they would have broken the principle of God&#8217;s salvation. Salvation is for our enjoyment; it does not require our work or our doing. Nevertheless, even many zealous Christians are cut off from spiritual fellowship simply because they are engaged in so much work. To add human labor to God&#8217;s salvation is to insult God and to cut ourselves off from fellowship.<p>We find it difficult to stop working and to keep eating. Instead of eating without working, our habit is to work without eating. Some may complain of too much spiritual eating. They may even say that they are bored with such eating. Talk like this circulated among us some time ago. This kind of word comes from the Devil, the enemy of God. As soon as a word is spoken against eating the Lord, it is followed by a suggestion that we work or engage in a certain activity. What a devilish contradiction of the principle of God&#8217;s salvation! I repeat, God&#8217;s salvation requires that we stop our working and do nothing except eat.<p>It is even possible for prayer to become a work that God forbids. Some of the saints may decide to spend more time in prayer. In such a case, their prayer may become a work that breaks the principle of God&#8217;s salvation. To one who resolves to pray in this way, I would say, &#8220;Do not allow prayer to become a work. Instead of praying in a natural way, you must eat the unleavened bread.&#8221;<p>When I was young, I engaged in much work for the Lord. I read books about how to be holy, how to pray, and how to overcome sin. These books encouraged me to work and to do certain things. Then one day I saw the light that God does not want us to work-He wants us to eat. If we would feast unto Him, we must stop our doing.<p>Suppose a brother invites you to his home for a feast. After you arrive, however, you spend a great deal of time working for him You mow the lawn, trim the trees, and wash the windows. But all your work is offensive to this brother. What he desires is that you sit down at the table and feast with him. The more you feast, the happier he will be.<p>We all must learn to drop our natural doing. However, this is not easy for us to do. As we drop our doing, we need to maintain our eating. But if we do not eat, we should not stop working. Most Christians work without eating, but we must learn to eat without doing. Let us drop our doing, but continue with our eating.<h2 class=head2>Not to Be Eaten by Strangers or Hired Servants</h2><p>Exodus 12:43 says, &#8220;This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof.&#8221; Verse 45 goes on to say, &#8220;A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof. These verses indicate that strangers and hired servants were not permitted to eat the Passover. In the Old Testament, strangers represent two categories of people: the unbelievers and the natural man. We may readily agree that the unbelievers are strangers, but we may not agree that our natural man is also a stranger who is not allowed to partake of the Passover. Actually, our natural man is no different from an unbeliever, for our natural life is always quick to go along with the way of an unbeliever Hence, the natural man and the unbelievers are of the same family.<p>Notice that in Exodus 12 the natural man is the stranger linked to the hired servants. A hired servant is one who serves for wages, for compensation. The natural man always works for God in order to receive compensation. This is commonplace in today&#8217;s Christianity. For the most part, Christianity has become a religion in which strangers are hired to work for wages. Although a hired servant may receive wages, with him there is no grace, faith, or enjoyment. If we try to enjoy the Passover according to the principle of a hired servant, we shall find that we have no position to partake of the Passover.<p>Those who work as hired servants have the attitude that they labor and God pays them their wages. But in Romans Paul indicates that we are not to work for our salvation. Romans 4:4-5 says, &#8220;Now to the one who works, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt. But to the one who works not, but believes on Him Who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness.&#8221; Speaking of the selection of grace, Paul declares in Romans 11:6, &#8220;But if by grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.&#8221;<p>In the words of Galatians 4:7, we who believe in Christ are no longer servants; we are sons. Children simply enjoy the family life. They do not labor as hired servants in order to share in this enjoyment. Our enjoyment of God&#8217;s salvation is according to the principle of free grace, not according to the principle of a hired servant who works for recompense. As far as salvation is concerned, our labor means nothing. God allows us to enjoy the Passover not as wages, but only as a free gift of grace.<p>It is clear that the natural man cannot enjoy Christ as the Passover. If a person is still in the natural man, he has not come to the month Abib, which means sprouting or budding. This means that he has not experienced a new beginning in Christ. With such a one there is no sprouting of the divine life through regeneration. To have a new beginning is to no longer be a stranger, to no longer be a natural man. On the contrary, it is to be regenerated and to become a new creation in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17).<p>Do not partake of the Passover as a natural man or as a hired servant, and do not have the attitude that you work for God and that He pays you. We do not receive God&#8217;s salvation because of our labor. If we remain in the natural man or regard ourselves as hired servants who work for recompense, we have no right to partake of the Passover.<h2 class=head2>The Purchased and Circumcised Servants Qualified to Eat</h2><p>Although strangers and hired servants could not partake of the Passover, the purchased and circumcised servants were qualified to eat of it (12:44, 48). To be purchased is to be redeemed. We are not hired servants, but we have been purchased by the Lord to be His slaves. We were lost, but the Lord paid the price to buy us back. This means that we have been redeemed, purchased, bought back. Thus, we are no longer strangers-we are redeemed ones. We are no longer the natural man-we are purchased ones.<p>Christ&#8217;s redemption does not include the natural life. Rather His redemption deals with the natural man by putting him on the cross. Christ redeems only those who have been dealt with by His cross. Such a dealing is signified by circumcision.<p>Do you regard yourself as a hired one or as a purchased one? Few like to think of themselves as those who have been purchased. A purchased one is actually a slave. This is the reason that in ourselves we all prefer to be hired ones. If we are hired by a certain person to work for him, we are willing to work as long as we are happy with our employer. But if we are not happy, we can resign and work for someone else. But a purchased one, a slave has no right to resign.<p>Once again we see that the way of the natural man contradicts God&#8217;s principle. In God&#8217;s redemption we are not hired ones; we are purchased ones. Anyone who thinks of himself as a hired one has no share in God&#8217;s redemption. If we want to enjoy God&#8217;s redemption, we must take our standing as those who have been purchased by Him.<p>It is easy to say in a doctrinal way that we are purchased ones. But in our actual daily practice we may live as if we were hired ones. The Apostle Paul knew that he was a slave of Christ Jesus (Rom. 1:1). He did not regard himself as one who had been hired to work for the Lord. In contrast to many pastors or ministers, Paul knew he had no right to resign from serving the Lord.<p>To be a hired one is, spiritually speaking, to work in our natural life for the purpose of receiving recompense. But according to the spiritual principle, to be a purchased one is to serve the Lord in redemption. A purchased one is a person who has been lost, who has been bought back, and who has been dealt with by the cross. This is the kind of person who has been redeemed by God. Such a one is qualified to partake of the Passover.<p>Exodus 12:44 says, &#8220;But every man&#8217;s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.&#8221; Verse 48 also speaks of circumcision: &#8220;And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof&#8221; (Heb.). All the redeemed ones must be circumcised. Spiritually speaking, to be circumcised is to have the natural life dealt with by the cross. Apart from this kind of circumcision, there is no redemption. For this reason, the redeemed ones are related to circumcision. Those who have been redeemed have been dealt with by the cross. In Paul&#8217;s words, they are the true circumcision (Phil. 3:3). The strangers are the hired ones, whereas the purchased ones are the circumcised ones. Those who are circumcised do not exercise the natural life to work for God. God does not want us to work for Him; He wants us to be circumcised. The work according to our natural life can only produce Ishmael. Our strength to produce Ishmael must be cut off through circumcision.<p>If we would receive God&#8217;s salvation in a proper way, we need to be purchased and circumcised. At the time of conversion, a sinner should repent, confess, and believe in the Lord Jesus. Simultaneously, he should begin to hate his natural life and to realize that this life needs to be buried. This is the reason that as soon as someone believes in the Lord Jesus, he should be baptized. To be baptized is to realize that the natural life is good for nothing except burial. When a new believer has this realization, he is conscious of the fact that he has been purchased and circumcised. However, many of today&#8217;s Christians have received God&#8217;s salvation blindly, not realizing that they have been purchased and circumcised.<p>All these details related to the Passover show the proper and adequate way to apply the Passover. If these details were not necessary, the Bible would not include them. Although these details are also in the New Testament, it is rather difficult for us to find them. However, they are vividly portrayed in the picture of the Passover in the book of Exodus. Thank the Lord that we are the purchased and circumcised ones and that we eat the Passover according to God&#8217;s principles.<h2 class=head2>God&#8217;s Army</h2><p>Exodus 12:51 concludes, &#8220;And it came to pass the self-same day, that Jehovah did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies&#8221; (Heb.). This verse indicates that God&#8217;s complete redemption produces an army. After applying the Passover according to all the principles given by God, we need to continue our enjoyment of the Passover by making an exodus from Egypt to become God&#8217;s army to fight for His interests on earth. We need to continue our enjoyment of salvation by getting out of the world and becoming part of the army of the Lord. This is the meaning of the term exodus. What a complete picture of God&#8217;s salvation is given in the book of Exodus! When we apply Christ as our Passover today, we need all the principles given in the account of the Passover in Exodus.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S JUDGMENT UPON ALL THE FIRSTBORN</h2><p>Exodus 12:12 says, &#8220;I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast.&#8221; Some may wonder why God killed only the firstborn. When I was young, I was troubled by this. I wondered if it meant that the firstborn were evil and that the others were good. At the time, I was not familiar with spiritual principles. Later I learned that the firstborn includes everyone in Adam. Adam, the first man, was actually the firstborn (1 Cor. 15:45a). Since Adam was the first man, the firstborn includes all those in Adam. The second born, on the contrary, are all those who are in Christ, for Christ is the second man (1 Cor. 15:47b). In a very real sense, we who believe in Christ are the second-born ones. Nevertheless, within us we still have the element of the firstborn. Although we are under the blood of Christ, the blood does not redeem anything of the firstborn. For this reason we must condemn everything within us that is related to the firstborn, that is, to Adam. This means that, once again, we must condemn the natural life.<p>The terms firstborn and stranger actually describe the same thing. They are synonymous terms that describe the old man and the natural life. We may say that the old man is the firstborn and that our natural man with the natural life is the stranger. But these two are actually one. When we apply Christ as the Passover, we must condemn both the old man and the natural man. We must reject both the firstborn and the stranger. In God&#8217;s Passover feast, there is no place for the old man or the natural life.<p>We need to take this not in a mere doctrinal way, but in the way of practice and experience. If we apply this in an experiential and practical way, we shall realize that we still have a certain amount of the old man and the natural life within us. This keeps us from applying the Passover in a complete and adequate way. We still hold on to the old man and the natural life. This means that the firstborn and the stranger are still within us. Therefore, we cannot apply the Passover in a full way, because God does not allow the old man or the natural life to participate in His Passover. This is the principle with respect to God&#8217;s judgment of all the firstborn.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S JUDGMENT UPON ALL THE GODS OF EGYPT</h2><p>In 12:12 the Lord also said, &#8220;And against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment.&#8221; This word is very significant. Without this part of 12:12, we would not realize that on the night of the Passover, Satan and all the demons were also judged The firstborn were the constituents of Egypt, whereas the gods were components of the kingdom of Satan. During the Passover, both were judged.<p>We can make a list of items that are excluded from participation in the Passover. There could be no leaven, no work, no strangers, no hired servants, no firstborn, and no Egyptian gods. This means that there is to be no place for sin, human doing, the natural life, the old man, the world, or Satan. These items are not only portrayed in the picture of the Passover in Exodus, but they also are clearly revealed in the New Testament. When we keep the Passover according to the detailed principles ordained by God, then we apply the Passover in a proper way. Praise the Lord for this full picture of the Passover, God&#8217;s complete redemption!<p>In addition to this list of negative things, we can make a list of positive things that are included in the Passover: the lamb, the house, the unleavened bread, the bitter herbs, the hyssop, the girdle, the shoes, and the staff. All these are components of the Passover. The issue of these positive things is God&#8217;s army. We who enjoy Christ as the Passover eventually become an army fighting for the kingdom of God on earth. As we have pointed out, the Passover ultimately produces an army to fight for God&#8217;s interest.</body></html>
