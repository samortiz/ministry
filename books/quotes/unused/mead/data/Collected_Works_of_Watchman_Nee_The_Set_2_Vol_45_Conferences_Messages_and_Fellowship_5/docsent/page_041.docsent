   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-EIGHT SERVING GOD IN HOLINESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND RIGHTEOUSNESS Date: December 13, 1940</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Unrecorded</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading: Luke 1:75 THE STARTING POINT OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A Christian should have many memorable dates written in his Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he does not have many dates written in it, he will be like a calendar without dates.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The history of God's creation is recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the same way the history of your new creation should be recorded there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every Christian at least should have a date of salvation, a date of baptism, a date when he received the laying on of hands, and a date when he consecrated himself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A Christian at least should have two beginnings salvation and consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every Christian should have a date when he was saved and when he consecrated himself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a man does not have a date of consecration, he is like someone without a date of salvation in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A train needs two tracks before it can run.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the same way a Christian must not only be saved but must be consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who are saved but not consecrated are not running a proper race.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone in the world should be saved, and every saved person should be consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After one goes through these two experiences, he has a proper beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A Christian who has never consecrated himself is not advancing at all; he has not taken the first step on his spiritual journey.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only after a person has passed through these two experiences can he begin his spiritual journey.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>SERVING GOD IN HOLINESS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A saved and consecrated person serves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Concerning our service to God, Luke 1:74-75 says, "Serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Holiness has to do with ourselves, whereas righteousness has to do with others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Holiness is for God, and it is a gift, whereas righteousness is acquired, and it is an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Holiness is a nature, and righteousness is a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Holiness is a life, and righteousness is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus said, "I am the way...and the life" John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our life is holy, whereas our way is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Life is in us, whereas the way is to be extended to others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After we have the life of holiness within, we still need a righteous living without.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>An outward, righteous living must be matched by an inward, holy life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A Christian can be very righteous, but unless he is also holy, his righteousness will not last.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Holiness and righteousness refer to two aspects inward and outward which are indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to serve God in holiness and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Tonight we will cover the matter of righteousness first.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Righteousness refers to the way we deal with people and things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>DEALING WITH UNRIGHTEOUSNESSES</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>An unsaved person lives an unrighteous life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He does not feel it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In fact, he may feel that he is quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But once a person believes in the Lord, he receives God's holy life into him, and he begins to deal with unrighteousness and to live a righteous life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He will allow righteousness to become a habitual, organic, and spontaneous thing in him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are we righteous in the way we deal with people and things in our daily life?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Have we collected something that we should not have collected?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Have we paid what we should have paid?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Have we taken something that we should not have taken?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must be right and righteous in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All righteous behavior is the result of the operation of the holy life and nature within.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let me relate an old story to you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Three years after I was saved, I began to practice being righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, I still did not know much about righteousness itself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One day I read an article in a magazine about a convention.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the convention one preacher was sitting away from the stage.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When it was his turn to speak, he walked past someone and stepped on that person's raincoat.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He did not apologize.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When I read this, it occurred to me that this was wrong and unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The preacher did not have the right to step on the raincoat; it was unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After I received this light, I was enlightened as to how I should deal with unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There are many unrighteous things around us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Unrighteousness can be found in the way we deal with our money, attitude, time, responsibility, material possessions, and many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The pursuit of righteousness is an excellent exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The light of the Holy Spirit is like the ray of the sun, and we are like the glass in a window.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If the glass is covered with dust, it will not be transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The problem is not with the shining of the sun but with the transparency of the glass.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the same way the problem is not with the light of the Spirit but with the shining within us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our pursuit of righteousness is like cleaning the window; it makes us transparent and keeps us in the shining of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this way spiritually we become sensitive enough to live a righteous living.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There was an old lady in Shanghai who had been a Christian for thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, her living was a mess; she was still living unrighteously.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>One day I felt compelled to ask, "Have you ever apologized to anyone in your whole life?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>She answered in Shanghainese: "Thank heaven!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>No."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>She did not receive any shining; she was as insensitive as she had always been.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you blow smoke into a man's eyes or pour water into his nose, he will react because he is a living person and because he is sensitive to these things.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But if he is dead, he will not feel anything.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we act unrighteously, the greatest rebuke comes from within us.</S>
