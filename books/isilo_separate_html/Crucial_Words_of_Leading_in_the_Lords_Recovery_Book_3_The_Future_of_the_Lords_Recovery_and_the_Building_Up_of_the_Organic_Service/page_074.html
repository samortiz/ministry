OF THE ORGANIC BODY</h2>
<p>Christianity today is deformed and organizational. It forms committees to prepare budgets and raise funds to hire workers. If they cannot hire people who are trained, they send young people to seminaries for training and then assign work to them. We cannot take this way. We are the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover the Body of Christ; it is to recover an organism, not an organization. We have many co-workers and churches, and young people are being raised up to serve the Lord full time. We have the resources, but we should not take the way of organization, that is, the way of a corporation. We should take the organic way, the way of the Body. If we take the way of a corporation, we will become a denomination. This crucial matter must be clearly presented to the brothers and sisters. We must not go backward; we have only one way&mdash;the way of the organic Body. We must advance boldly.</p>
<p>Being organic depends mainly on the elders. The elders must forget that they are elders in their actions, intentions, and concepts. The elders are not bureaucrats holding official posts. The elders exist because there is the need for arrangement in the church services to avoid confusion. The elders should not replace the prophets or the teachers. The eldership does not involve rank; it involves only responsibility. Therefore, we should not turn the function of an elder into a mere title. An elder is a steward who takes care of the affairs of the church. For example, the elders make arrangements for different kinds of meetings, including schedules and how to lead the saints in the meetings. The Bible clearly says that the elders should not lord it over others but should be patterns of the flock (1 Pet. 5:3). The elders should forget position and status. They should not call themselves elders. They should only be patterns of the flock. In this way we will not repeat the mistakes of Christianity, nor will we take the way of organization. Rather, we will let the Holy Spirit have the ground in us to raise up our organic function.</p>
<p>In addition, the young full-timers should learn the proper way to coordinate in the church. Their submission should involve an organic operation that is much more than their human submission to parents or teachers. This is possible because the Triune God is in us. He is our life and our Lord. He is living. He can be our moment-by-moment, inward leading. We should exercise to live in the Lord. Then instead of being in a religious organization, we will be living members of the living Body of Christ. In this way our actions will be organic functions. Otherwise, we will be merely organizational. We should all be living members of an organism. All our walk and actions should issue from organic functions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD<br />
AND CARRYING OUT<br />
THE ORGANIC FUNCTION OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 7:12 Paul said, &ldquo;To the rest I say, I, not the Lord.&rdquo; Paul boldly declared that his words in verse 12 were not the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. Is his declaration organic or organizational? According to organizational thinking, the Corinthian believers could have told Paul not to speak until Christ, the Head, spoke. Since our knowledge concerning service may not be thorough, we may have concepts that we think are spiritual but are actually organizational. For example, we may say that it is organizational to do something that the Lord has not told us to do. We often say that we should not take any action until we have prayed and fellowshipped thoroughly. However, it seems that in 1 Corinthians 7 Paul had not prayed thoroughly, because it was he, not the Lord, who was speaking. Here, we have to change our concept. Paul was not as spiritual as we are, nor did he pretend to be spiritual. He clearly indicated that it was he, not the Lord, who was speaking. Then in verse 25, concerning virgins, he said, &ldquo;I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who has been shown mercy by the Lord to be faithful.&rdquo; Our opinions are destructive, yet Paul gave his opinion without the Lord&rsquo;s commandment. If I said, &ldquo;Brothers, I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion,&rdquo; I am afraid that everyone would disagree with me.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 7:40 Paul said, &ldquo;According to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&rdquo; This is marvelous. It does not seem logical that Paul could have the Spirit of God without the Lord speaking. However, the significance of Paul&rsquo;s word is that we should not be organizational, nor should we say, &ldquo;I am doing this because the Lord said so.&rdquo; Paul spoke, but not the Lord. Paul did not have the Lord&rsquo;s commandment, but he gave his opinion. Paul could do this because he had the Spirit of God. As a person who was one spirit with the Lord, his walk was in spirit. Since he walked in spirit, he disregarded organizational position and religious concepts. He was joined to the Lord as one, and his speaking and acting were organic functions of the Body. Paul did not have any position, nor did he act according to religious teachings. Rather, he was joined to the Lord as one spirit and therefore had an organic function in the Body.</p>
<p>We need to have a deeper knowledge concerning spiritual matters. Christianity teaches people merely to keep a position and obey orders; hence, it is organizational. When I speak, my whole body moves. No member of my body has the concept or thought of keeping a position or obeying commands. The move of my body is organic. After this fellowship, we should be clear that our service is not a matter of keeping a position or obeying commands. Our service is a matter of having the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Lord; this is to be like Paul, who said, &ldquo;I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&rdquo; If we are one spirit with the Lord, instead of keeping a position or merely obeying commands, we will exercise our organic function. If we are clear concerning this, we will be greatly blessed and not have any problems. At the same time, we will know our position in the Body. We will know to whom we should listen; that is, we will listen to the organic function of the Body, and our living will be in the Body.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_073.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_075.html">Next</a> </body></html>
