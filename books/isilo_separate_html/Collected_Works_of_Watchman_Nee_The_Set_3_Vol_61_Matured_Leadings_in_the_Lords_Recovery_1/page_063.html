A few sisters have handed over some small jewelry. They should follow Peter's instruction and get permission from their parents before selling them. They should not be unrighteous in claiming their parents' goods as their own. At the same time, we have to realize that these things bring absolutely no profit to a Christian. We cannot bring these things to heaven. Once they have their parents' permission, they can sell them.</p><p>A young brother handed over more than two hundred books. I advise him not to buy any more books. It seems as if he has indulged himself in this habit. If he does not deal with his love for books, he will hand over what he has now, but he will buy more later.</p><p>In principle, you should pick out items that you are particularly fond of and dispose of them. This may hurt a little, but it will do tremendous good. In asking you to dispose of these things, you are being tested. You will see how much this hurts, and how deep it cuts. The more pain you feel, the more reluctant you will be to give them up, but this will build up your Christian character. In three or five years, you will have the constitution of the Holy Spirit, not just His life. The constitution of the Holy Spirit wroughts Christ into our whole being. Thus, we become one with Christ. Christ as our life is the basis of the Spirit's constitution; it enables Christ to live within us on our behalf. The constitution of the Holy Spirit is the maturity of this process; it enables Christ's disposition to become our disposition. This constitution work is like embroidery; it embroiders Christ into us. There may be pain, but Christ will be constituted into our being.</p><p>In regard to the other items, I will say a word on behalf of the church. The church is happy to return these things to you for your own use, but your feeling toward them should be different. When you look at them, you should realize that they are given to you by the church. Do not use them carelessly. A Christian must learn poverty while living on this earth. He has to learn to own nothing, to have nothing that he can call his own. We are heavenly citizens. On earth we are merely strangers and sojourners (Heb. 11:13). We should not settle down in this place.</p><p>We will ask the older brothers and sisters to make proper arrangements for your schooling. I hope that the church will have a detailed arrangement of the items that have been handed over.</p><h2 class="head1">A FELLOWSHIP WITH THE WORKING SAINTS</h2><h2 class="head2">Not Being Involved in Pure Commerce</h2><p>Every Bible student has to agree that, according to the Bible, God has no intention for a Christian to engage in commerce. I believe all of you are clear that the first case of commerce was with the prince of Tyre. Ezekiel 28:16 says, "By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned." The word merchandise refers to a kind of free commerce. This is the first mention of commerce in the Bible. The last mention of commerce is with Babylon in Revelation 18. The prince of Tyre was the beginning of profiteering through trade. He was also the beginning of transgression. The prince of Tyre is a type of Satan. When we come to the great Babylon, we find the peak of development in commerce. Babylon's origin is Babel. The most severe judgment from God will be brought against Babylon because it will be the consummation of aggrandizement by trade and the epitome of sin. Revelation 13 speaks of the mark of the beast. Without the mark no one can trade (vv. 16-17). Hence, if pure commerce disappears, the mark of the beast will become useless. The more highly developed commerce becomes, the more useful the mark of the beast will be.</p><p>One of the fifty-two lessons that we released in Kuling for new believers deals with the proper occupation God has ordained for a Christian. It is an occupation in which one works with his own hands, producing and manufacturing by his own labor. It should not be a kind of pure trading. If the church does not engage in some mode of production, a Christian will not be able to find anything to do in the church, in which case he will have to go to outsiders for work. Because some brothers cannot find the right occupation in the church, they are forced to engage in pure commerce in the secular business world. Sometimes they are forced to lie and cheat. Soon their hearts become corrupted. In the future we have to do our best to help the brothers make the right choice; we have to show them the clear way. Perhaps some brothers should start some businesses and hire some brothers to work for them.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> </body></html>
