   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING AN UPLIFTED HUMANITY IN THE ONE WHO EMPOWERS ME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the end of Philippians, Paul was full of wisdom and mentioned six virtues: "Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is righteous, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is well-spoken of" 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These six items are the proper humanity of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But all of these virtues can be achieved only through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, Paul went on to say, "In everything and in all things I have learned the secret I can do all things in Him who empowers me" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The secret here is the experience of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are conformed to the cross by the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We live out salvation by the God who operates within, and we live out the likeness of His death, that is, we magnify Christ, by the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to see that this kind of experience of Christ is totally different from the cultivation of the bright virtue taught by the Chinese Confucianist.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No matter how much the Confucianists improve themselves, they have no resurrection power within, which is the Spirit with the bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They can only develop the conscience that is within them by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, this is quite limited.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For us, we are obeying the God who operates within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our conscience and inner sensation is the Spirit with the bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we experience the Spirit day by day, we live out a life with an uplifted humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul used the highest and topmost expressions within this short Epistle to the Philippians: the bountiful supply of the Spirit, the God who operates, the power of resurrection, and the Christ who empowers us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are used to show the Philippians how to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A servant of the Lord must be familiar with these truths.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the same time, we have to see that this is the humanity we who serve the Lord should have.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our humanity is the expression of the work of the Triune God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As far as the Spirit is concerned, He is the bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As far as the Father is concerned, He is the operating God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As far as the Son is concerned, He is the One who empowers me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the end, the Triune God becomes my power within in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am being conformed to His death through this power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This operating God, bountifully supplying Spirit, and empowering Christ work in me continually.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the end, the Triune God becomes in me the resurrected One, supplying me daily with the resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I live by this power, I will surely love the conformation to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the end, salvation is lived out, and Christ is magnified in me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I will have the highest humanity, and whatever is true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of will be found in me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although the book of Philippians is a short book, I hope that you would fellowship about it in depth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only should you learn these truths, you have to get into the light revealed in these truths, so that from your youth, you would build up a proper humanity and would even be able to possess the highest humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on March 21, 1989</S>
