   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A MAZE OR A VISION?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the past some dear saints have argued with me about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some said that they were not the church and that we were not the church either.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Others said that if we were the church, then they were the church also.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Arguments and debates do not bring us anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more you argue, the more you will find yourself in a maze.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can we tell who is the church and where the church is?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is a basic principle, which is to ask whether we are in a maze or in the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If this is the church, then upon entering into it, you will find yourself in the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, if it is not the church, then upon entering into it, you will find yourself in a maze.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no need for argument.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After you come in, simply ask whether you are in a maze or a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Are you in the vision under a clear sky with a definite direction, or are you still in a maze?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the governing principle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord's recovery is to bring us out of the maze back to the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now that we are in the Lord's recovery, I would like to ask you what you see.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you say that you see Christ and the church, I would reply that this is too general.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It takes time to tell people all that we see in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we are in the vision, everything is clear, and nothing is hidden or veiled.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have been in this country since 1962.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes people have asked me why my messages are never exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They want to know where I get so many things to speak on.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the speaking comes from the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because the vision is inexhaustible, I cannot stop giving messages.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible is an open book to me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are in a vision under a clear sky with the heavenly directory in front of us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, we know where we are going.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A GENERAL VIEW</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The best way to present the vision to others is first to give them a general view, then the details.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, we may say that we see Christ, the church, and the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we would point out that among us there are no issues, choices, or preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may go on to speak of the human spirit and the indwelling of the human spirit by the Holy Spirit, an indwelling that causes these two spirits to work together.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We see these two spirits walking, living, fellowshipping, and even talking together.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After this, we may point out that we live in the mingled spirit and that the mingled spirit controls and directs us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, the mingled spirit sanctifies us, transforms us, and maintains the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are not in human society, in a maze, in a legality, or in any issue.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Being in the Lord's recovery, we have been brought back to the Lord's vision.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The greatest difference between Christianity and the Lord's recovery is this matter of vision.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are in the Lord's recovery, then we are in the vision, but whenever we are out of the vision, we are out of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whether or not we are in the Lord's recovery depends upon whether or not we are in the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are in the Lord's recovery, everything is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have the vision, we shall have a general view.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We shall not see just a few particular things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, after I had surgery on my right eye, the retina became detached, although I did not realize it at first.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One day as I looked out the window, I saw only half of a car.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when my wife looked out the window, she saw the whole car and said that there must be something wrong with my eye.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although I was still able to see, when I looked at things, it appeared as though everything had been cut in half.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Immediately I was taken to the ophthalmologist who told me that the retina had begun to be detached and that it required emergency surgery.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes our spiritual vision is like this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot see the whole situation but only a small part, perhaps just ten percent.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When this happens, we need to go to the "eye doctor" in order to have our full vision restored.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To repeat, we need to have a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we are in the recovery, we shall be in the vision.</S>
