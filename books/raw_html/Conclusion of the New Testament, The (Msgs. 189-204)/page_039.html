<h2 class=head4>b. The Serving Ones</h2><p>Acts 6:3-6 speaks of seven serving ones in the church in Jerusalem. Acts 6:3 says, “Now brothers, select seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we shall appoint over this need.” “Full of the Spirit” is one’s condition after being filled with the Spirit inwardly and essentially. This refers to life, not to work. The word “wisdom” here also indicates that in this verse to be full of the Spirit is for life.<p>The word of the apostles in 6:2-4 pleased the multitude and “they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch, whom they set before the apostles; and having prayed, they laid their hands on them.” Since these seven were chosen to serve tables, they may be considered deacons, just as those whom Paul and his co-workers appointed later in the churches (Rom. 16:1; Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:8).<p>It is significant that in the appointment of the seven serving ones no leader was appointed. This indicates that no rank or position was regarded. All the serving ones are the servants to the saints. This is a good pattern for us to learn and follow that we may avoid leadership in rank and position in any form.<h2 class=head4>c. The Believers</h2><p>Two verses that speak of the believers who composed the church in Jerusalem are Acts 2:44 and 5:14. Acts 2:44 says, “All those who believed were together and had all things common,” and 5:14 says, “Believers were all the more being added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and of women.” The designation “believers” denotes those who have believed in Christ as the Son of God according to God’s New Testament economy. This designation, of course, indicates the matter of believing. Anyone who does not have faith in Christ, who does not believe in Christ, is certainly not a believer.<p>The believers are also those who have received Christ as their generating life for them to become the children of God. Believing in Christ equals receiving Him (John 1:12-13). When we believe in Christ, we receive Him. We receive Him by believing in Him.<p>Furthermore, the believers are those who have believed into Christ as the Son of God to have an organic union with Him. John 3:36 says, “He who believes in the Son has eternal life.” Literally translated, the phrase “believes in” should be “believes into.” When we believe in the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, we believe into Him. By believing in Him, we enter into Him to be one with Him organically, to partake of Him, and to participate in all that He has accomplished for us. By believing into Him we are identified with Him in all that He is and in all that He has passed through, accomplished, attained, and obtained. The church is composed of such believers.
