	 <h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTIONING OF ALL THE MEMBERS<br />
CAUSING THE GRADUAL GROWTH OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>We should all consider before the Lord what the church should do. Every member should rise up to function. Even our little finger has a function in our body. The only way for the Lord to advance among us is through the functioning of every member. According to Ephesians 4:16 and Colossians 2:19, the Body grows when the joints function to supply, the sinews join and knit, and the rest of the members operate according to their measure. Hence, the brothers and sisters should not despise their function. We should not say that we are a new believer, our gift is small, we do not understand the truth, or we do not have a function. If we do not function, we harm ourselves, and we hinder the growth of the Body of Christ. Every member in the Body of Christ must rise up to function in order for the Body to grow gradually.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DOOR-KNOCKING BEING TO GAIN PEOPLE<br />
AND HOME MEETINGS BEING TO KEEP THEM</h2>
<p>Approximately two thousand of the new ones, who were baptized and were in home meetings over the past eight months, attended the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting in all the halls of the church in Taipei. The full-time trainees made weekly visits to more than six thousand new ones and brought these two thousand new ones to the meeting. In other words, over the past eight months, twenty thousand people were led to salvation, and of these twenty thousand, more than six thousand meet with us regularly. Out of the six thousand new ones, two thousand met with us on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. This proves that the new way of door-knocking and having home meetings is practical.</p>
<p>Two thousand new ones have not attended the meetings of the church in Taipei for the past twenty years. This proves that we can gain people by knocking on doors. The testimonies of the new ones show the working of the Holy Spirit. A few new ones testified that when the brothers and sisters knocked on their door, they were considering how to contact the Lord and come to the church. This was the Holy Spirit working in the same way that He worked when Peter went to the house of Cornelius.</p>
<p>One of the new ones testified that when the brothers and sisters knocked on his door, he was preparing to commit suicide. A person who was planning suicide was saved and baptized. If we did not knock on doors that day, he would have killed himself. Such testimonies prove that the Holy Spirit is working on many people. In the old way we published advertisements in newspapers, sent out invitations, held love feasts, and rented cars to take people to the meeting; however, not many people attended the meeting. Sometimes the people who came did not receive the Lord. However, we have discovered that when we door-knock, people cannot hide from us. Door-knocking is prevailing.</p>
<p>When we knock on a door, the people in that home may not be friendly, but after we speak a few words with them and then read <em>The Mystery of Human Life,</em> they are happy, and their attitude changes. They will eventually be saved and baptized if we pray for them. This can be accomplished only through door-knocking. Furthermore, soon after being baptized, some people bring their entire family and their colleagues from work to be baptized. A newly baptized believer is like a branch that runs over the wall and continues to grow. If we are faithful to knock on doors, the day will come when our brothers and sisters in the Lord will be all over Taipei.</p>
<p>We should not think that we can go door-knocking according to our own method. If we knock on doors according to our own method, no one will be saved. Therefore, we must be trained. We also need to labor on the home meetings. When we establish a home meeting, we should have proper feelings, not natural affection. Natural affection is of the flesh, but proper feelings are of the Spirit. When we meet with the new ones in their homes, some of them will prepare a meal for us, and others will give us gifts to show their appreciation. We must be careful not to do anything that will issue in natural affection of the flesh and not the proper feelings of the Spirit.</p>
<p>In the old way we invited people to the big meetings, but they did not like to come. Hence, even if we baptized one hundred people, only five would remain. However, today we deliver the meetings to people in their homes. The more meetings we deliver to people, the more they taste the flavor of the meetings. Then one day they will come to the meeting hall.</p>
<p>We knock on doors to baptize and gain people, and we have home meetings to nourish and keep them. By these two steps people are gained and kept. From our experience in the church life over the past sixty years, we know that no method is more effective than these two ways. There is presently a desperate need for people to labor on the home meetings, because we have discovered that it is relatively easy to knock on doors and lead people to salvation, but it is not so easy to feed people in the home meetings. Every parent knows that it is easy to give birth to children, but it is difficult to raise them. The full-time trainees have given birth to a large number of children for the church in Taipei. We must consider how to care for these new ones so that they grow up to be healthy.</p>
<p>Last Lord&rsquo;s Day the full-time trainees brought some of the new ones whom they are caring for to the meeting halls, and everyone rejoiced. Even though we highly commended the full-time trainees, we must speak a faithful word, because the meetings were not up to the standard. The full-time trainees gained many new ones through door-knocking and the home meetings, but when they brought the new ones to the meetings, it was as if they were displaying their babies for the brothers and sisters to see. We forgot to pray, and no one paid attention to the content of the meeting. We admired the babies so much that we forgot to feed the babies.</p>
<p>We must take care of the new believers whom we have gained. We should not merely visit them frequently. We must supply them with God&rsquo;s word. We can use <em>Life Lessons</em> to supply them. Thus, the key to the home meetings lies in knowing how to use <em>Life Lessons.</em> We should not think that it is easy for people to understand the text. We must be trained in order to know how to use these lessons in the home meetings.</p>
