<p>Prayer: Lord, under Your precious blood, we worship You as those whom You have redeemed, saved, and visited. Lord, we are not merely gathering in Your name; even more, we are gathering with Your Spirit. Visit us again and come to each one of us. We need Your special visitation. We also need Your Spirit to deliver us daily from death that we may be freed from the old creation, the flesh, the world, and Satan. We believe that Your victorious blood cleanses us and also removes every shadow of the authority of darkness from this meeting place. Lord, refresh, uplift, and enliven our spirit so that You can move freely among us. Give us light, utterance, and a timely word to meet Your need. As the all-inclusive Lord, You are immeasurable, and You are able to meet the need of everyone here. Cleanse our ears with Your precious blood, and anoint us with Your anointing so that our heart may be opened to draw near to Your Word and to enter into the depth of the mystery in Your Word. Lord, have mercy on us and shame Your enemy. We bind him in Your victorious name. We declare once again that Jesus is victorious, and Satan is defeated! Lord, establish Your kingdom and Your sovereign authority among us. We exalt Your name and give You the glory. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED WITH THE RICHES OF GOD<br />
UNTO ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD</h2>
<p>According to the title of this chapter, &ldquo;The Redemption of the Believers Being for the Fullness of God,&rdquo; we are redeemed for the fullness of God. <em>The fullness of God</em> is a particular and profound phrase. Throughout the centuries Bible readers have argued and debated concerning this phrase. Some versions of the Bible translate Ephesians 3:19 as, &ldquo;That you may be filled <em>with</em> all the fullness of God.&rdquo; This translation, however, is not according to the original text, nor is it according to the truth. The meaning of the original text is &ldquo;that you may be filled <em>unto</em> all the fullness of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to be filled with the riches of God. The riches of God are the attributes of God, and God&rsquo;s attributes are what God is. God has many attributes. For example, God is life, love, light, righteousness, mercy, grace, forbearance, kindness, authority, and power. These attributes of God are the riches of what God is. Many Christians say that they are filled with God. This is a very general statement. The New Testament clearly shows that to be filled with God is to be filled with the riches of what God is. Hence, when we are filled with God, we are filled with His life, love, light, grace, forgiveness, forbearance, power, and other riches. In other words, we are filled with all the attributes of God. This is the way we become the fullness of God. The ultimate meaning of fullness is expression. We first have God&rsquo;s riches, and then we become God&rsquo;s fullness. God&rsquo;s fullness is the overflow of His riches from within us. When God&rsquo;s riches overflow from within us, we become His fullness; we become the expression of God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fullness of God &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
