   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God Dealing with</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Moses' Fleshly Wisdom and Power</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all know the story of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was eloquent, wise, competent, and knowledgeable.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He thought that he could come forward to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He saw the enemy oppressing his brothers, and he slew the enemy with his fleshly power.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The next day he saw two Israelites fighting, and he exhorted them to be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He might have thought that this would be a very easy thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Little did he realize that they would not receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, they brought up the incident of his slaying an Egyptian the day before.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a result, Moses fled to the land of Midian.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Moses knew only his wisdom and power.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He had not yet recognized his foolishness and weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God wanted him to realize that there were things that he could not do by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He wanted to help God save the people of Israel, but God did not need man to help Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Anyone who tries to help Him with his fleshly wisdom and power will never please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are many people that God will not use, not because they lack wisdom and power, but because they have too much wisdom and too much power.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He cannot use them; He has to put them aside and cool them down.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He cannot use them now; He has to wait until their strange fires are no longer burning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moses was a man who tried to help God with human wisdom and power.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God put a halt to him and did not use him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The reason for this is that soulish and emotional wisdom can easily stir up fleshly power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These have no place at all in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Moses stayed in the wilderness for forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was not only tried by God but was also trained by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He began to realize that all that he possessed was vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only after he had reached this point could he be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same way, God is now putting us in the wilderness to try us and to train us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He has put us aside, but we still do not understand His will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Repeatedly He has dealt with us, but we still do not submit to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Repeatedly He puts us in our place and strips us of a smooth environment in order that we will surrender under His mighty hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He wants to see if we are willing to walk according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our own opinion has to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a gate we must pass through.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Israelites' rejection of Moses was of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Pharaoh's seeking to slay him was of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His escape to the lonely wilderness was of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He communicated with God during those many years in the wilderness under God's training, and in the end, he realized his own uselessness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After that he no longer wanted to use his own power to save the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He no longer thought of himself as a great and competent man or as an extraordinary person in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He knew that he could not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was where God wanted him to be.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moses Acknowledging His Own Powerlessness</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Later at Mount Horeb, God sent Moses to save the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If Moses had heard this word in the first forty years, he would have gone very gladly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There would not have been the need for God to send him; he would have volunteered to go himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He only knew what he could do; he did not know what he could not do.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now Moses was different.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He knew who he was.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He also knew that his wisdom and power could not accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, he said to the Lord, "Who am I,...that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Exo 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was now quite different from before.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before, he thought that no one other than him could do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now, he said, "Who am I?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He was no longer self-confident or self-assured.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He considered himself to be nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Brothers, God will lead us to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is a spiritual withdrawal, a holy withdrawal, and a blessed withdrawal.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If God has not caused us to realize from our heart that we are nothing, we still cannot be used by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Moses said, "Who am I,...that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Exo 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He considered himself so small and realized his own incompetence.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we have never considered ourselves in this way, we cannot do God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Moses now saw that this work was too great and that he was too small.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He had learned the lesson and dared not exercise his fleshly wisdom and power anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He acknowledged his weakness, that he could do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He did not even dare to evaluate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He could only ask God, "Who am I?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He left it to God to evaluate him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He had to be led by God to this point before God could use him.</S>
