   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this lesson we will continue to see the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son in the grace of the Triune God to be the portion of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>11.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order that He may be our portion for our experience and enjoyment, Christ is also the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Corinthians 15:45 says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The last Adam was the Lord Jesus in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the cross, as the Lamb of God, He took away our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This made it possible for us to receive His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then He was raised from the dead and became the life-giving Spirit to impart life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Redeemer, He as the life-giving Spirit came into us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The life-giving Spirit is the reality and the life pulse of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If Christ had merely been resurrected with a body and had not become the life-giving Spirit, His resurrection would simply be a fact and could not impart life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, Christ's resurrection is absolutely a matter related to the life-giving Spirit, for in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, who imparts life into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, the life-giving Spirit is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Triune God has passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now in resurrection He is the life-giving Spirit with the life essence to enter into all those who believe and receive Him to make them the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This life-giving Spirit is the totality of all that Christ is as the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ as the all-inclusive One has now become the life-giving Spirit, the totality of all that He is for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
