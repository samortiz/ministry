<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. ASKING FOR JEHOVAH'S DELIVERANCE<br>AND PRESERVATION</H2><P>In his final prayers David asked Jehovah for His deliverance and preservation (140:1-5; 141:9; 143:6, 9, 11; 144:7, 11). Quite often David suffered hardship and distress and needed God's saving and protection. Hence, he prayed that Jehovah would deliver him and preserve him. To be preserved by God is to be covered by Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. WITH THE FOLLOWING PRECIOUS POINTS:</H2><P>These prayers of David contain a number of precious points, which we will now briefly consider.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Saying That Jehovah Is His God<br>and the Strength of His Salvation</H2><P>In 140:6 and 7 David said to Jehovah, "You are my God; /... O Jehovah Lord, strength of my salvation." This word is simple, but the taste is sweet.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Asking That His Prayer<br>Be Set before Jehovah as Incense</H2><P>In 141:2 David prayed, "Let my prayer be set before You as incense,/The lifting up of my hands as the evening offering." This word has a sense not only of sweetness but also of nearness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Praying That Jehovah<br>Would Set a Watch before His Mouth</H2><P>"Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth;/Keep the door of my lips" (141:3). This prayer indicates that David could not of himself limit his talking and needed God to help him by guarding his lips. This prayer is another indication that David was close to the Lord. I believe that God answered David's prayer.</P><P>Ever since my youth I have appreciated the word in 141:3. Often when we come to the Lord we are too quick in our speaking. Can you stay with the Lord for five minutes without speaking? You may find it difficult to be quiet when you are with the Lord. We make mistakes in our prayer because we are too fast in our talking. Therefore, like David, we need God to set a watch before our mouth and to keep the door of our lips.</P>
