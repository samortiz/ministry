   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR JEHOVAH THE SAVIOR Scripture Reading: Isa 40:3-31; John 3:34a; 7:17; 1 John 2:17a; 1 Pet 1:23-25; Matt 9:36; John 10:2-4, 11, 14; Eph 6:10; Phil 4:13, 12; 2 Tim 4:7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous message we pointed out that the book of Isaiah may be divided into two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first section is composed of the first thirty-nine chapters, and the second section is composed of the final twenty-seven chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Chapter forty, the first chapter in the second section, shows us Christ as Jehovah the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Chapters forty-one through sixty-six reveal Christ as the Servant of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the Servant of Jehovah, He is typified by three persons Cyrus, Isaiah, and Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the book of Isaiah, Cyrus is presented in a very good and positive sense.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God said that He chose Cyrus, loved Cyrus, and appointed Cyrus to carry out His commission.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Isaiah, Cyrus typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Isaiah, the prophet of Jehovah, also typifies Christ as the Servant of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Israel as the corporate servant of Jehovah also typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is the totality of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this message we want to see the revelation of the all-inclusive Christ in Isaiah 40, where Christ is revealed as Jehovah the Savior, as the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The book of Isaiah is not easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chapter forty may be considered as the most difficult chapter in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Isaiah wrote this chapter in a marvelous way with a definite prophecy concerning John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Chapters forty through sixty-six, altogether twenty-seven chapters, may be considered as one word from Jehovah to His chastised, chosen people, Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This word is a word of comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the first thirty-five chapters, Isaiah did not have a good feeling about Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He rebuked, condemned, and exposed Israel to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jeremiah is even stronger than Isaiah in this respect.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He points out repeatedly how evil Israel is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first thirty-five chapters of Isaiah are full of his rebuking of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Chapters thirty-six through thirty-nine are an interval concerning one person Hezekiah.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After this short history of four chapters, Isaiah's tone altogether changes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no more rebuking or condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead there is Jehovah's word of comfort to Israel, and the beginning of the word of Jehovah is the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Isaiah says in 40:9, "Here is your God!"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as God is here, the glad tidings are here.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The New Testament shows that God came to man as Jesus, the incarnated One.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God Himself was incarnated John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That was His coming to man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Genesis 18 records how God came to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He came with two angels to visit Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He and these angels all were in the form of men when they came to Abraham, but Jesus came in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He came in the way of incarnation, the way of entering into man and becoming a man to directly participate in man's humanity, partaking of man's blood and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For His coming there was the need of a forerunner to usher in the incarnated God to His people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This forerunner was John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The New Testament opens with John's ushering, recommendation, and introduction of the incarnated God.</S>
