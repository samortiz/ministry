<h1 class="series">YOUNG PEOPLE&rsquo;S WORK</h1>
<h1 class="msg">LESSON SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE VISION AND IMPORTANCE<br />
OF THE NEXT GENERATION<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 18:16-17; Acts 26:13-19; Num. 14:29-31</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>We must see the preciousness of the second generation and their value in God&rsquo;s hands&mdash;Luke 18:16-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If we truly want to do the young people&rsquo;s work, and do it in a weighty manner, we must let God open our eyes to see the preciousness of the young people and their importance in His hands; if we see this, we will appreciate this work, and spontaneously we will have a heart within us for it:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Everyone who serves the Lord must be a person with vision&mdash;Prov. 29:18; Acts 26:13-19.</li>
		<li>The governing vision of the Bible is the Triune God working Himself into His chosen and redeemed people in order to saturate their entire being with the Divine Trinity for the producing and building up of the Body of Christ consummating in the New Jerusalem&mdash;Eph. 4:4-6; Rev. 21:2, 9-10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Every time God wants to make a dispensational move, an age-turning move, He must obtain His dispensational instrument; we must be those who have dispensational value to God in the last days to turn the age&mdash;12:5-11; 1:20; Dan. 12:3; 9:23; 10:11, 19.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s work in turning the age is always done through men; before a new age is ushered in, there are always men in the previous age who are used by God particularly to turn the age; in every age-turning work, God purposely uses young people:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Because men used by God in one age often become fallen and fail to reach His goal, God is forced to turn the age, to have a new start so that He can do what He wants to do in a new age.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s most important dispensational move is to end this age and bring in the age of the kingdom; to do this He must have His dispensational instrument; this is what God wants to do today.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The future of the Lord&rsquo;s move and the spreading of the recovery is altogether dependent on the next generation; the Lord needs children and young people for the future of His recovery:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We can say that virtually everyone used by God to begin a new thing, or chosen by God to turn the age, was a young man; if we see this, we will treasure the young people before God.</li>
	<li>With the exception of Joshua and Caleb, those who were qualified and ready to take possession of the good land were younger ones, the second generation&mdash;Deut. 1:35-36; 11:2-7; Num. 14:29-31:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The second generation did not pass through as much as the first generation did, but they received the benefit of what the first generation experienced.</li>
		<li>What the older ones experienced was very effective in building up the younger ones; therefore, God could prepare from the second generation more than six hundred thousand men with a rich inheritance and strong background who were qualified to be formed into an army to fight for God&rsquo;s kingdom.</li>
		<li>The principle is the same with us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today; what the older ones have experienced is being passed on to the younger ones and will be very effective in building them up and preparing them to fight with God and for God.</li>
		<li>If a brother is left to himself, he may have to stumble for ten years before he can come up with something; but now through the Body he may acquire the same thing in one evening; if such a brother will take the judgment of the Body, he will save a lot of time; the use of authority in the church is for the purpose of cutting down mistakes and shortening the journeys.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>There must be a group of young people who are saved to receive proper spiritual help today, so they can gain the experience and be used by the Lord in the future; if there are no young people gained by the Lord today, after our departure there will be no one to succeed us and there will be a gap.</li>
	<li>If you see this, your heart will be burdened to love the young people regardless of whether they are good or bad; may the brothers and sisters as the Lord&rsquo;s lovers all love the young people for the future of the church and for the Lord&rsquo;s work.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is spreading, and will spread at a good pace; there will be churches in all the major cities and in all the leading countries on earth; if during the coming years many young people are perfected, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will spread at a rapid speed:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must pursue and grow in our spiritual life, earnestly maintaining a living fellowship with the Lord, fully consecrating ourselves to Him and having proper dealings with Him; to be the Lord&rsquo;s overcomers, we must love the Lord and grasp the opportunity to love Him&mdash;Matt. 26:6-13.</li>
	<li>The next generation must be equipped in the truth; they need to read and get the word into them and get themselves into the word so that they may be mingled with the word&mdash;Col. 3:16; Psa. 119:11.</li>
	<li>The next generation needs to build up a good character; they need to exercise themselves to build up a character that is useful to the Lord&mdash;Phil. 4:8, 13.</li>
	<li>The next generation needs to receive a higher education; all the young people must get a college degree, study more diligently than the secular students, get the highest grades, and go on for advanced degrees:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>There is a need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today for those with the highest education; the young people must endeavor to gain the best education.</li>
		<li>If the young people expend their energy in this way, by the time they are thirty they will be able to begin their ministry like the Lord Jesus did; if many take this way, we shall have no shortage.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
