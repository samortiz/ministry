   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE FIFTH TRUMPET THE FIRST WOE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REVELATION 9:1-12</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The great tribulation may begin from the fifth trumpet because the fifth trumpet is the trumpet of woe and is close to the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. Revelation 9:1</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"And the fifth angel trumpeted, and I saw a star out of heaven fallen to the earth, and to him was given the key of the pit of the abyss."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This star cannot be interpreted literally like the star in 8:10 because the star here was given the key of the pit of the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Who is this star?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"A star out of heaven fallen to the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This corresponds with the casting down in 12:9.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Bible, stars refer to messengers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Job 38:7 says, "When the morning stars sang together, / and all the sons of God shouted for joy."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This clearly tells us that stars signify the angels in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since this star has fallen, it must not be a good star.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is he who transfigures himself into an angel of light for the purpose of deceiving others 2 Cor 11:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the three and a half years spoken of in Revelation begin at the same time and end at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Revelation 11:2-3, 12:6-14, and 13:5 all happen at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This star must fall before the start of the forty-two months before the great tribulation because it falls at the fifth trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The seventh trumpet is also sounded before the start of the forty-two months.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. Revelation 9:2</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"And he opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word "abyss" means "the depth."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The abyss means the deepest pit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is this abyss?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is the dwelling place of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Luke 8:28 and 31 tell us that it is the place where the devil suffers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because the devil is here, suffering is here.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the devil comes to the world, this world becomes the devil's world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The falling of the star here corresponds with Luke 10:18, which was the verdict of the casting down of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here in Revelation 9:1 we have the execution of the casting down of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While Satan is restricted, the pit of the abyss remains closed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The smoke indicates that there is fire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is difficult to say how the abyss is opened.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Deuteronomy 29:23 says, "And that all its land is sulphur and salt, a burning waste; that it is not sown, nor does it sprout, nor does any vegetation come up in it; that it is like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim, which Jehovah overthrew in His anger and burning wrath."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The condition here is similar to the prophecy in Revelation 9:2.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Concerning the "smoke," one can refer to Revelation 18:8-9, 18 and 19:3.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Revelation 8:12 the heaven lost one third of its light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here in 9:2 it has become completely darkened.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the former case, it was caused by the diminishing of the light bearers themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here it is caused by the darkening of the smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>C. Revelation 9:3</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"And out of the smoke came forth locusts to the earth, and to them power was given, as the scorpions of the earth have power."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"Locusts."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This kind of locust is not the ordinary kind of locust because:</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>1 According to Revelation 9:4, these locusts do not eat the trees and the shrubs like ordinary locusts do.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Moreover, ordinary locusts do not harm men, but these do.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>2 They have power like the scorpions 9:3 , and their torment is like that caused by the scorpions v. 5 . From verses 7 through 10 we can tell that their appearance is very peculiar and not like the ordinary locusts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>3 Exodus 10:14 says that there will never again be locusts like the ones that are there.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>4 Proverbs 30:27 says that the locusts have no king, but the locusts here have a king.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>5 They come out of the pit of the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The abyss is not an ordinary dwelling, but the dwelling place of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These locusts are probably a kind of special creature.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can see this from the following:</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>1 Revelation 9:3, 7, and 10 say that they have power like the scorpions and that they are like horses with tails like scorpions, and stings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Revelation 9:19 says that "the power of the horses are in their mouth and in their tails."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Luke 10:17 through 19 says that the Lord has given the believers authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord's cross has pronounced Satan cast down.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Revelation 9:1 is the execution of the casting down of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>2 They are possessed by the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is why they are so special.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The earth was originally created for man, while the abyss is reserved for the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The word "deep" in Genesis 1:2 is translated by the Septuagint as "the immeasurable depth," which is the same as the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is where the demons live.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the second day, when God divided the waters which were under the air from the waters which were above the air Gen 1:7-8 , some demons drifted to the air.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, the air also became the dwelling place of the demons Eph 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The sea may be the entrance to the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Revelation 20:13 says that the sea will give up its dead.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is one thing for death and Hades to give up the dead, and it is another thing for the sea to give up its dead.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The dead in the latter case are the ones who died before Genesis 1:2.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Romans 10:7 tells us that the Lord Jesus once went into the abyss.</S>
