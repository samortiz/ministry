<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Fellowshipping and Coordinating Together</H2><P>If you see the Body of Christ, you will see the matter of fellowship. The life that we received from the Lord makes us pliable and enables us to coordinate together. In this coordination, there is no friction, and there is no murmuring. To have such things in the Body would make us no different from the political organizations in the world.</P><P>In the Bible, many times the Lord did not speak to men directly. On the one hand, the New Testament does say that a man can know God from within. On the other hand, however, we have to see that after the Lord met Saul, He did not speak to him again directly. Instead, He asked Ananias to go to speak to Saul (Acts 9:6). On the one hand, the life that is seen in the New Testament is a very personal one. On the other hand, the Epistle of John also says that "you also may have fellowship with us" (1 John 1:3). This fellowship is mutual. On the one hand, we come to God individually by the blood and through the veil. On the other hand, we work together, walk together, coordinate together, and serve together. Here, there are those who serve and there are those who are served. From the records concerning Paul, Luke, Timothy, and others, we see that among them there was coordination. Whatever Paul suggested, the others would agree and would carry it out right away. Timothy was a good brother. He could have written a letter to Paul, saying, "Brother Paul, I have believed in the Lord for many years. I can pray, and I can seek after the Lord. Please give me some liberty!" But Timothy did not do this. On the one hand, every person comes to God independently and is individually responsible to God. On the other hand, no one can be independent, and no one can be free. If you are not coordinated with others, you do not have to tell others; within you, you know it yourself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Delivered from the Self</H2><P>A man's mouth may be very clever, but his mouth does not necessarily represent his person. Sometimes, a person may say yes with his mouth, yet disagree within. Some brothers and sisters only bring their mouths to the meetings; they themselves are not in the meetings. One sister once came to me to discuss the question of submission in the family. Her mouth was saying that she wanted me to handle the matter. But I knew clearly within me that her mouth and her ears had come, but her being had not come. Once a person has given up his personal opinions, though he may not readily consent with his mouth, within him he will acknowledge that this is the right thing to do.</P><P>We have to learn to be persons who are delivered from our selves. If fifty radios are receiving the same signal from a station, and my radio has a different signal from the same station, my radio is definitely not functioning properly. Although we live under the New Testament, and although we have the Lord within us, we are at the same time living in the Body. As such there is the need for us to be joined to the other members. In the coordination of the Body, we have to learn to care for the feeling of the other members of the Body. Only then can we have good coordination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not Being Individualistic</H2><P>The body is the most beautiful thing there is on earth. Yet the body can also become the most ugly thing on earth. A man looks very fine if he stands here with all his members attached. But if all I see is isolated members detached one from the other, this would be the most ugly sight. If I come into this house and I see two feet at the door, a pair of ears in the room, and a pair of arms at the stairs, how horrible a sight this would be. I will surely run away at once. In the same way, if a person acts independently and is not joined to the Body, he will become a most ugly member. It is one thing for a person to acknowledge that he is a member. It is another thing for this person to be coordinated as a member. Independent actions in the Body are the most ugly thing there is.</P>
