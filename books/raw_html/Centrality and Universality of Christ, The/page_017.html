<P>Now I believe we are clear that Christ is the Spirit, and this Spirit, who is Christ Himself, is in our spirit. The best way, and in fact the only proper way, for us to contact such a Christ is to exercise our spirit to pray. We need to learn to pray by exercising our spirit. I know that whenever we go to the Lord, we go with many problems in our mind. We are bothered by the problems, troubles, difficulties, tests, trials, sorrows, pains, and others' unfair dealings with us. The most bothering matter is the unfair dealings. A certain brother has dealt with me in an unfair way that I cannot forget for eternity. It is very hard for me to pray with him because his unfair dealing impressed me deeply and affected me to such an extent that I can never forget it. It bothers me all the time. This is why I say that when you go to the Lord you have to cut off the thoughts in your mind. Forget about everything. Forget about all your troubles, sorrows, pains, testings, trials, etc. Just go to the Lord in the spirit and by the spirit. When you pray, do not try to remember so many things. Some people try to consider too many things when they go to the Lord to pray. Some people asked me, "Brother Lee, if you speak in this way, then what about our prayer list?" If you go to the Lord in a living way, you will know what to do with your prayer list.</P><P>Now we know that we need to contact the Lord by exercising our spirit. And in order to exercise our spirit we need to forget about many things. If we are occupied with many things, that will only help us to exercise our mind and hinder us from exercising our spirit. From now on, whenever we go to the Lord, let us forget everything in our mind, in our memory.</P><P>A husband may ask, "My children are sick, and my wife is not well; should I not remember these things before the Lord? Should I forget about these things?" Or a wife may say, "My husband is out of a job; should I not pray for this?" I would tell you that if you could forget about these things, you will be very much blessed. Your wife and your children will be quickly healed, and your husband will get a better job. You are too much concerned in your mentality, in your understanding, and in your realization. You are too much occupied by other things, not by Christ. Let us learn to realize that today Christ as the Spirit is in our spirit. The only way, the proper way, for us to contact Him is to pray to Him by exercising our spirit. When you pray in this way, eventually you will realize that it is not only you praying by yourself but also Him praying within you. You will realize that while you pray, He prays. He prays with you, and He prays in you. He becomes your prayer.</P><P>Andrew Murray once said that the best prayer is the Christ within praying to the Christ above. This means that the Christ within, that is, the indwelling Christ, prays to the ascended Christ. The same meaning is expressed in the last two lines of stanzas 8 and 9 of Hymns, #762 by A. B. Simpson. Stanza 8 says, "Teach us! Pray in us, till our prayer shall be/Christ in us praying to the Christ above!" Stanza 9 says, "Teach us! Pray in us, till our prayer shall be/God in us answering to the God above!" The real prayer is something in the spirit. While you are praying in your spirit, Christ as the Spirit indwelling you prays with you. He prays in your prayer, and you are praying in His prayer. You are mingled with Him.</P>
