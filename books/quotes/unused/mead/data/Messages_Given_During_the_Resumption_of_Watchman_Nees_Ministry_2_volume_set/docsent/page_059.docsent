   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT GOSPEL, REVIVAL, AND LIFE TALKS 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:Morning, January 16, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Prayer: May the Lord cause all of us to realize that spiritual matters are not loose or vague.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>May the Lord's word not only be spoken through man, but may every one of the words spoken be filled with light, and may they shine within man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE WORK GOD IS AFTER TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our need today is to do only the work that God wants us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This work includes three things: first is the preaching of the gospel, second is to lead the new believers, in particular, the young people, to love the Lord, and the third is to usher the saints into God's life and into the riches of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These three things need to be developed in a balanced way, and neither of the three should be given less emphasis than the others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A. The Preaching of the Gospel 1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Doing Our Best to Preach</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Concerning the preaching of the gospel, we have to do it frequently, do it well, do it in a widespread way, and do it in a weighty manner.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a church does not increase in number, it is because it has slackened in the matter of the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the whole population in China does not produce any children in fifty years, we will not need foreigners to come in with the cannons and the gunboats to conquer us; we can give up our whole country that way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same way, if no new ones are added into the church in thirty years, the church can close its doors.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord's command is that we go to the whole world to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many people want to imitate Madame Guyon, but they all end up being barren.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Wherever there are "Madame Guyons," there must be the accompanying preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If some are saved and they begin to love the Lord, we have to encourage them, and especially the young ones among them, to rise up to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every church should saturate the city where it is with the gospel and should distribute gospel tracts to every household, every street, and every lane.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It should send out gospel teams to spread the gospel in the open air and to put up gospel posters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the schools, homes, and institutions should be filled with gospel posters, and we should all beget many spiritual children.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It seems to me that Swatow has not come up with any spiritually distinguished ones yet.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The brothers and sisters have all become set in their ways.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some have been cared for by others for ten years already, but they are still the same today as before.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today we should realize that the young ones have great potential.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to encourage the young ones to rise up to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more they beget, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even if some new ones appear to be false ones, it is still all right.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is like a factory manufacturing goods; some products are of the top grade, whereas others are of a poorer grade.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the number of saved ones increases, some among them would surely not be that much up-to-standard.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is always better for a family to beget children than to be barren.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I myself had ten children.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Three of them died, and seven are still left.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course, in preaching the gospel and in begetting spiritual children, it is better that none die.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But whatever a person does, if a church continues to have only a few dozen people meeting year after year for decades and there are no spiritual children produced, no matter how good its teachings are, it is not a normal church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Secret Being to Be Thick-skinned</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The secret to preaching the gospel is to be thick-skinned.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In preaching the gospel, all we have to do is to go.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no need to worry about whether or not we are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a sister would pass out tracts on the street, and while she is doing that, if she would kneel down on the sidewalk to pray, surely some will repent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A gospel preacher must be one who is full of emotion, who can cry, laugh, and jump.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Dr. John Sung was a good example.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Lot's daughters committed incest with their father and produced Moab and Ammon.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Of course, this is a shameful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But we have to realize that even the flesh of the Lord Jesus has Moabite blood in it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, in preaching the gospel we do not have to analyze too much.</S>
