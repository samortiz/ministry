<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVIII. JEHOVAH DELIVERING SAUL<br>INTO THE HAND OF DAVID,<br>BUT DAVID NOT KILLING HIM BECAUSE OF HIS FEAR<br>OF GOD IN THAT SAUL WAS GOD'S ANOINTED</H2><P>According to chapter twenty-six Jehovah delivered Saul into the hand of David, but David would not kill him because of his fear of God in that Saul was God's anointed. This indicates that before David became king, he set up a good order and pattern showing us how in God's kingdom we should honor God's ordination and respect and regard God's authority. Therefore, when David became king, everything was headed up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. David Hiding Himself on the Hill of Hachilah</H2><P>David hid himself on the hill of Hachilah, and Saul was informed of this (v. 1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Saul Seeking David Again</H2><P>Saul sought David again (vv. 2-4). He went out with three thousand choice men of Israel to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. David sent spies and thereby learned for certain that Saul had come.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jehovah Delivering Saul<br>into the Hand of David,<br>but David Not Killing Him</H2><P>In verses 5 through 16 we see that whereas Jehovah delivered Saul into the hand of David, David would not kill him. Saul was "sleeping within the entrenchment, and his spear was stuck in the ground by his head. And Abner and the people lay around him" (v. 7). Abishai said to David, "God has delivered your enemy into your hand today" (v. 8a). He then encouraged David to have Saul killed by striking him with the spear to the ground. But David would not destroy Saul because of his fear of God in that Saul was God's anointed (vv. 9-11). David said to Abishai, "Jehovah forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against Jehovah's anointed" (v. 11a). Although David was weak in losing his temper with Nabal and in taking Abigail his wife, in dealing with Saul David was an outstanding success.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. David's Appeal to Saul</H2><P>Verses 17 through 20 are concerned with David's appeal to Saul. When Saul recognized David's voice, David asked him, "Why does my lord pursue after his servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my hand?" (v. 18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Begging Saul Not to Drive Him Out so that<br>He Could Not Share in Jehovah's Inheritance</H2><P>David begged Saul not to drive him out so that he could not share in Jehovah's inheritance, the good land, but go to serve other gods (vv. 19b-20a). David considered that to remain in the good land was the greatest blessing. To be driven out of the good land and to go to another land to serve other gods was a curse. By this we can see that this book is on the enjoyment of the good land, that is, the enjoyment of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Likening Himself to a Single Flea<br>and a Partridge in the Mountains</H2><P>In his appeal to Saul, David likened himself to a single flea and a partridge in the mountains (v. 20b).</P>
