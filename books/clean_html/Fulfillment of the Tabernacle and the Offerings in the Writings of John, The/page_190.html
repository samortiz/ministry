<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(17)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 12:23-28; 13:31-32; 15:8; 17:1-5, 22</h1><p>We may understand the Gospel of John in a natural way. Of course, it is easy to see that this book is on life, eternal life, that is, the life of God. However, we may not have penetrated into the depths of this book.<h2 class=head1>THE FUNCTION OF THE DIVINE LIFE</h2><p>I have been seeking to understand the Gospel of John for more than fifty years. It was in 1950 that this book began to be opened to me in a new way. Although I was very familiar with the Gospel of John, the depths of this book were not opened to me until after I left mainland China. Only then did I begin to enter into its depths. However, I did not see the whole right away; rather, I began to see one part at a time. First, the Lord showed me that in the first eleven chapters of this Gospel, John, the writer, uses nine cases to illustrate the function of the divine life.<p>The Gospel of John is not composed according to historical facts arranged in historical sequence. Instead, in writing this book John put together a number of different cases in order to give us a clear view of the divine revelation. John indicates this when he says, “Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name” (20:30-31). As a whole, the Gospel of John gives us a full and complete picture of the divine working. Therefore, in contrast to the Gospel of Luke, which gives us a history, the Gospel of John gives us a view, a revelation, of the divine working.<h2 class=head1>A REVELATION OF GOD’S DESIRE TO DISPENSE HIMSELF INTO MAN</h2><p>Some Bible teachers say that the Gospel of John was composed according to doctrine. However, I do not believe that this is accurate. In his Gospel John is not teaching doctrine; he is showing us a revelation. The revelation presented in the Gospel of John is that the Triune God—God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit—is dispensing Himself into His chosen, redeemed, and regenerated people in order to make Himself absolutely one with them. It is by His life with the divine nature that God is making Himself one with His redeemed people. This means that the Triune God wants to enter into His people to be their life and even their nature so that they may have the same life and nature as He.<p>Because this Gospel reveals that God desires to enter into His people to be their life and nature, this Gospel speaks of regeneration, the new birth: “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God” (3:3). In the same chapter the Lord goes on to say, “Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.…that which is born of the Spirit is spirit” (vv. 5-6). This is also the reason that the Gospel of John tells us that we become children of God by believing in Christ the Son: “But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name” (1:12). Hence, whoever believes in the Son of God is born of God. Because we have been born of God, we have His life and nature.<p>We may use human life and animal life as illustrations of this fact. A child always has the same life and nature as his father. This is also true of animals. A dog, for example, will have the same life and nature as the dog that begot him. In other words, he will be of the same kind. Because we all are children of Adam, we are of Adam’s kind; that is, we have the life and nature of Adam. Actually, all the children of Adam are of one family. In a similar way, we who believe in the Son of God have been born of God. Now we are God’s children with the divine life and the divine nature. Therefore, we all are of one kind, one family.<p>In order to make Himself one with created mankind, God desires to impart Himself into the man created by Him for His purpose. This is the divine revelation presented in the Gospel of John.
