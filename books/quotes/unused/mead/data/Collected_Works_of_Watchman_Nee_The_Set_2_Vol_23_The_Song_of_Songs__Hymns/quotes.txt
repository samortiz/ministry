[1]  THE SONG OF SONGS Preface Introduction The Initial Pursuit and Satisfaction Section One The Call for Deliverance from the Self Section Two The Call for Ascension Section Three The Call of the Cross After Resurrection Section Four The Work of God Section Five The Groaning of the Flesh Section Six
[2]  Volume 23 in The Collected Works has two distinct sections.
[3]  The first section contains The Song of Songs, which was originally published in 1945 in Chungking, China.
[4]  A few were written by him, and one was written by Ruth Lee...The contents were classified as follows: words of praise, joy of salvation, springs of the valley of Baca, union with Christ, growth in grace, seeking in the spiritual pathway, consolation of the pilgrims, prayer meeting, consecration, spiritual warfare, the Holy Spirit, the work, the praise of the sucklings, and the trumpet of the gospel" p.
[5]  Thank God that on earth today there is no lack of men who are attracted by the Lord to seek after Him.
[6]  This book, The Song of Songs, is specially prepared for them.
[7]  Spiritual fellowship in the secret place is such a holy thing that it should be sealed.
[8]  But God has chosen to reveal it to us in the Song of Songs so that we can comprehend the pathway of love and be encouraged to go on.
[9]  This exposition was released by our brother in the Lord to a few co-workers many years ago.
[10]  Chapter one, verse 1 says, "The Song of songs, which is Solomon's."
[11]  Hence, the Lord takes the position of a king in this book.
[12]  In this book, our relationship with the Lord is not like the relationship between Jonathan and David.
[13]  Others love Him not only because of His cross, but also because of His resurrection.
[14]  The cross speaks of the Lord's reign through His victory, whereas resurrection speaks of the Lord Himself.
[15]  Hence, we must not only have a love like that of Jonathan toward David, but a love like that of the Shulamite toward Solomon.
[16]  It is not about those who do not belong to the Lord, but about those who belong to the Lord.
[17]  For example, the word my beloved in the original language denotes a male love, whereas the word my love in the original language denotes a female love.
[18]  The Initial Pursuit and Satisfaction 1:2 2:7 Yearning 1:2-3 Pursuit 1:4 Fellowship 1:4 The Revelation in the Inner Chambers 1:5-7 The King's Speaking 1:8-11 The Maiden's Speaking 1:12-14 The King's Praise 1:15 The Maiden's Response 1:16 2:1 The King's Reply 2:2 The Maiden's Praise and Enjoyment 2:3-6 The King's Charge 2:7 Section Two:
[19]  The Call for Deliverance from the Self 2:8 3:5 The Call for Deliverance from the Self 2:8-15 Failure and Recovery 2:16 3:5 Section Three:
[20]  The Work of God 7:1-13 The Equipping of the Worker 7:1-9a Working Together with the Lord 7:9b-13 Section Six:
[21]  This section is the key to the whole book.
[22]  Verse 4 says, "Draw me, we will run after thee."
[23]  Although we have the desire and the willingness to pursue after Him, we cannot help but feel a lack of strength for the pursuit.
[24]  This strength for the pursuit is not a mighty power from the Spirit that is given to us once for all.
[25]  If the Lord has truly drawn us, it is very easy for us to pursue after Him.
[26]  The power to run after the Lord comes from the drawing of the Lord.
[27]  When we were sinners, we needed God's drawing before we could come to the Lord.
[28]  The word "King" indicates that before we know the Lord as our Beloved, we must first know Him as our King.
[29]  Verse 6 says, "Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept."
[30]  After she has received God's enlightening and is dealt with by Him, she realizes the vanity of her former work she has only done what man entrusted to her, but not what God ordained for her.
[31]  This maiden sees three things in the chambers: 1 She sees the blackness in Adam and the fairness in the Son of His love; 2 she sees the vanity of outward work through God's dealing; and 3 she also sees the spiritual need.
[32]  Hence, the Lord answers her according to her seeking, and He praises her and makes a promise to her.
[33]  Verse 8 says, "If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents."
[34]  "If thou know not" the tone of this sentence seems to indicate that the King is rebuking her and that she should have already known about such a thing.
[35]  This reminds her not to forget her duty toward the kids in her daily life, as a result of her pursuit for food and rest, and not to lock up the gates of the kids.
[36]  On the other hand, in her daily life she must still care for those believers who are younger than she is, and she must fulfill her duty this way.
[37]  The adornment on the neck signifies the maiden's natural gentleness.
[38]  Although the revelation of the chambers has resulted in a spiritual pursuit on her part, her natural swiftness, that is, her natural strength and gentleness, is still at work.
[39]  These riches can be divided into two categories: 1 the flour and the meal, which signify the Lord Jesus' life and the Lord Himself, and 2 the meats, which refer to His work and His death.
[40]  Verse 15 says, "Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes."
[41]  This praise is for the purpose of encouraging her.
[42]  The first "thou art fair" encourages her, whereas the second "thou art fair" praises her eyes as being doves' eyes.
[43]  Verse 3 says, "As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons.
[44]  I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste."
[45]  Now she takes her turn to compare the King to the sinners.
[46]  "The sons" refer to all the things that capture one's heart, everything that is desired Gen 3:6 , everything that can serve as the master of one's heart, and everyone to whom the believer's heart would turn.
[47]  But now she declares her testimony; these are the words out of her mouth, what she says publicly to all men.
[48]  Verse 7 says, "I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please."
[49]  Both the Darby translation and the margin of the American Standard Version use the word "gazelles," whereas the King James Version and the text of the American Standard Version uses the word "roes."
[50]  During all this time, she has only seen the Lord's worth to her; she has not seen the position she should take before the Lord.
[51]  In other words, she has enjoyed the fruit of the Lord's travail, but she has not allowed the Lord to enjoy the fruit of His travail.
[52]  2:8 3:5 I. THE CALL FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SELF 2:8-15
[53]  The maiden has her shortcomings, and in this section we see what she should have gained, but has not gained.
[54]  Yet she has not followed the voice of her beloved, and there is no actual obedience.
[55]  The only place where the Lord is associated with a hart is in the heading to Psalm 22, where there is the expression "the hind of the dawn" RSV or "the hind of the morning" ASV, margin .
[56]  In this section, the Lord manifests His resurrection power, and He is speaking to the maiden in a living way.
[57]  Since she already has an intimate relationship with the Lord, it is easy for her to recognize His voice.
[58]  As a result, she does not say "my wall," but "our wall," meaning that the wall belongs to both her and to the Lord.
[59]  Then she would have fellowship with the Lord and rest in Him and live happily within the wall.
[60]  She would be able to find the Lord within her heart all the time, and she could ignore circumstances, persons, the brothers and sisters, daily duties, and many trials.
[61]  Verse 10 says, "My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away."
[62]  The Lord speaks very clearly here; He wants the maiden to rise up and come away.
[63]  This does not mean that inward experiences are wrong.
[64]  But if she continued in this way, she would not be able to contact the outside; the minute she contacted the outside, she would seem to lose her peace.
[65]  Madame Guyon said, "Once His presence was a question of time and place, but now it is no longer a question of time and place.
[66]  When we can trust that the Lord's presence is within us wherever we are, we will not be deceived by our inward feelings."
[67]  Since the Lord is calling her to come away with Him, He speaks of His past experiences and the present facts.
[68]  It seems as if the Lord has clearly brought her out of all the testings, coldness, dryness, and apparent deadness.
[69]  With His undeniable presence, the Lord has driven winter away without her even being conscious of it.
[70]  The Lord tells us that many past trials are behind us as a result of His presence.
[71]  The passing of the winter rain indicates two things: 1 the present crosses, that is, the trials, are over, and 2 the Lord's cross is over, that is, the work of His cross is accomplished, and we should not dwell constantly on His death.
[72]  The Lord shows her all the things that are in resurrection, so that she will no longer pay attention to the dead, cold, dry, and wilted winter.
[73]  Verse 14 says, "O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely."
[74]  A very important truth is revealed here we should live out the life of the cross in our experience.
[75]  We should pass through the cross so that the Lord's cross will become our cross.
[76]  But in order for the cross of Christ to be all that others see and hear from us, there is a need for us to first know the resurrection of Christ.
[77]  The Lord says that everything with the seeker is good, but that it is superficial.
[78]  This is not the time for the maiden to desire the King or appreciate him, but the time for the King to appreciate the maiden, to look upon her, and to desire her.
[79]  Now the Lord begins to ask for the fruit of the travail of His soul for the satisfaction of His own heart.
[80]  He is hinting that she should live for Him, and He is calling her to the clefts of the rock and the secret places of the stairs so that He can look at her there.
[81]  The Lord calls her to arise, to come out of herself, her feelings, and her introspection.
[82]  This is not the time for her to be in the house of wine; this is the time for her to live for the Lord.
[83]  From this point on, everyone who goes on to seek the Lord should live the life of the cross on earth through the power of resurrection for the Lord's enjoyment; they should not be for anything else.
[84]  The Lord can say that the maiden's voice is sweet and her countenance is comely because she is fully in union with the cross.
[85]  Verse 15 says, "Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes."
[86]  If this word is spoken by the beloved, it is a continuation of 2:13, which says, "The vines with the tender grape give a good smell."
[87]  She is already clear that her beloved is hers, and she also knows that she belongs to her beloved, but these are not the things that she is after now.
[88]  A person who has freshly consecrated herself does not know what she should be to the Lord, yet she remembers how her beloved is to her.
[89]  She knows that she has not been fully joined to the Lord, and she knows the importance of the calling of the cross, the demand of ascension, and the expression of resurrection.
[90]  Putting it in still another way, she has not yet learned the lesson, and she cannot follow the Lord everywhere and under any circumstances with just faith.
[91]  But she receives a great revelation: she is not together with the Lord in every place.
[92]  Formerly, she secured the Lord's presence within herself and in her own feelings; that was the only place she could find His presence.
[93]  She thought that this experience of His presence was the highest and the only one, and that there was no other kind of presence.
[94]  But she has not learned to be with the Lord in her daily duties, her family, and the world in a mountain-leaping, hill-skipping way.
[95]  She did not know that there could be such an experience, but after this revelation she knows.
[96]  In the past she only had a certain kind of presence, the presence that could be found within herself; she had not acquired any other kind of presence.
[97]  She knew that she could not go to the place where the Lord was.
[98]  But she did not know the loss of not going with the Lord.
[99]  She did not realize that there would be a loss by not going with the Lord.
[100]  She did not ask the Lord to give her the strength to bring her out of the mountains of Bether the hindrance of separation .
[101]  But she finds to her surprise that the inner feelings of His presence leave when the Lord retreats outwardly.
[102]  The Lord has not left her, but in her feelings He has indeed left her.
[103]  The Lord's way of training her is to take away her inner feelings of His presence when she cannot carry this presence to the environment in the world.
[104]  Many Christians do not understand why they lose their feelings of the intimate presence of the Lord after they have enjoyed it for a while, and they do not understand why they cannot recover such feelings.
[105]  She thinks that she can embrace the Lord between her breasts all night long, just like she did before.
[106]  She would rather not go to the world, and she would rather let the Lord take care of His own work and interest.
[107]  She would allow her union with the Lord to slip and become incomplete, and she would allow Him to act apart from her.
[108]  The Lord takes away her cherished feelings so that she will lose her feelings of His presence though not in fact .
[109]  The purpose of the Lord is to utilize her desire for fellowship in her feeling to attract her so that she would gain what she should gain.
[110]  Because she has lost the feeling of His presence, she thinks that she has lost the Lord.
[111]  The Lord calls the maiden out of the bed that she rests in, and He makes it clear to her that His presence is no longer there.
[112]  But after the Lord has taken her a step further, she realizes that a rest that depends on time and place is not complete.
[113]  When the Lord purposely goes away and takes away man's feeling of His presence, it is difficult to recover it through man's ways of seeking.
[114]  By now the maiden has learned at least one lesson: the Lord is not in the place of the bed.
[115]  If she cannot find Him within, she has to look for Him without.
[116]  If it is true that prayer is not for prayer, that Bible reading is not for Bible reading, and that a quiet time is not for a quiet time but for His presence, then to a certain point, prayer, Bible reading, and quiet time have to be relinquished before we can find His presence.
[117]  The maiden begins to leave her bed and to communicate with God's other children.
[118]  She no longer has coverings, and she does not care for her "face" any longer.
[119]  Although she has not met the Lord along the paths she travels, these journeys are indispensable for her.
[120]  Every seeking heart must deal directly with the Lord and be dealt with directly by the Lord.
[121]  Verse 4 says, "It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me."
[122]  The fact that she is able to find the Lord again is not a sign that she has been perfected.
[123]  Although she is still far from perfection, her desperation for the Lord causes Him to gladly reveal Himself to her.
[124]  Although she realizes that she needs to come out before she can be with the Lord, her heart's desire is still for His presence in her feelings.
[125]  Although there are still many lessons to learn and many things to know, the Lord is willing to be seen by the maiden, to be held by her, and to be taken away by her.
[126]  Although there is a mixture of the self, the Lord is willing to humble Himself and allow her to enjoy His presence once more.
[127]  In the last section the Lord was brought "into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me," and He remained there for a long time.
[128]  Although the maiden's grasping is not altogether good, it is a place where the Lord can stay.
[129]  Here she sees her own vanity and that everything comes out of God's love and grace.
[130]  Since the maiden is able to remain quiet for a while and stay with the Lord in her mother's house and in "the chamber of her that conceived me," she must have passed her test and learned the lessons she was supposed to learn in the second section.
[131]  Because of His love, God gives her the grace and the power to learn what He requires of her.
[132]  We have to realize that with a seeker of the Lord, there is more than one experience of the second section.
[133]  We can always find His plans in His love, and we can always find the help in His grace.
[134]  Therefore, we do not have to compare similar experiences; we just need to realize that she is under God's love and grace.
[135]  It is interesting to note that the Lord first lived and then died; whereas we first receive His death and then live His earthly life.
[136]  Verses 7 and 8 say, "Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel.
[137]  They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night."
[138]  The father of the Lord Jesus is God, and His fleshly mother is human.
[139]  B. The Beauty of the New Creation 4:1-5
[140]  Verses 1 through 5 say, "Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.
[141]  Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.
[142]  Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.
[143]  Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armory, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.
[144]  Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies."
[145]  The King can safely say this to her because she has all these experiences behind her.
[146]  Since she has passed through the experience of 3:6 and since she has a complete union with the King, she no longer retains the praises for her own use.
[147]  These praises show the outward expressions that a person has after he is completely joined to the Lord and after he understands the cross and resurrection.
[148]  This is not a matter of food itself, but a matter of receiving food.
[149]  God has shown us in the Bible that He has given us different kinds of food.
[150]  In pursuing after the Lord, in receiving His grace, and in our study of the Bible, we must not exercise fleshly zeal.
[151]  Among all our holy sentiments, the most important ones are our faith and love.
[152]  In these two things we sense His intimacy, and through these He draws near to us.
[153]  Faith and love are the unique and combined way by which we are joined to the Lord.
[154]  To "feed among the lilies" is to be in the place where the Lord feeds others S.S. 2:16 . In order for faith and love to grow, they must remain in the place of the Lord's feeding.
[155]  Before a person has experienced anything deep in the Lord, and before he is thoroughly dealt with by the Lord, he likes to speak to others about his own spiritual experience, his own spiritual condition, his progress, and what he has acquired.
[156]  At the same time, he likes to talk about his fellowship with the Lord, the Lord's love, His promises, and His answer to prayers.
[157]  She realizes that she has not reached perfection and that her day has not yet broken; she feels that she is still living in the shadows.
[158]  Every experienced believer realizes that, although a mature and perfected believer can be without a shadow before the Lord and fully bask in the Lord's morning light, it is still possible that he may have shadows in himself and that the morning has not dawned.
[159]  Although the maiden has received praise from the Lord, she cannot help but feel that her spiritual dawn has not arrived yet.
[160]  Although the Lord praises her, and although the Holy Spirit recognizes her total union with the Lord, she still feels her own weakness, corruption, wickedness, and uselessness.
[161]  If the perfuming of the myrrh and the frankincense will bring us into a fuller union with the Lord and will make us more beautiful in the Lord's eyes, we will from this time on go to the mountain of myrrh and dwell in the hill of frankincense.
[162]  Verses 4:1-5 show the outward appearance of the maiden, whereas verses 7 through 15 show the maiden's inward relationship with the King.
[163]  After the maiden has seen the cross and resurrection in a deeper and fuller way, the King says to her, "Thou art all fair...there is no spot in thee."
[164]  Formerly, the King only said that she was fair; now he says that she is all fair.
[165]  Verse 8 says, "Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards."
[166]  In the second section, the King asked two things of her: 1 that she would rise up, and 2 that she would go with Him.
[167]  After she was dealt with by the Lord, she rose up.
[168]  But she has not yet learned to follow the Lord in His move and work.
[169]  Once the Lord makes a demand, He will never lower His standard.
[170]  Sometimes we can delay His timing, and sometimes His time may not be yet, but He never changes His calling.
[171]  When we have passed through His dealings, and when His time comes, He will again say, "Come with me."
[172]  Verse 9 says, "Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck."
[173]  This is the first time the King calls her his spouse.
[174]  By this time, her mind is completely one with the King.
[175]  This is why the King considers her to be a person to whom he can commit himself.
[176]  At this point her love reaches a degree that is above the ordinary and becomes pure to the point that a marriage relationship is sealed.
[177]  By this time everything that is manifested in her is of the new creation, and she can satisfy the King's heart.
[178]  The King can love her unreservedly because the Holy Spirit has worked on her to the extent that she has become altogether lovely.
[179]  Not only have the maiden's eyes revealed her desire for Him, but the chain on her neck has shown Him her answer as well.
[180]  She has encouraged Him by her submission to the teaching of the Holy Spirit and by the moral edification which the Holy Spirit has wrought in her.
[181]  She has caused Him to love her and to know that He can lead her on.
[182]  Verse 10 says, "How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!"
[183]  When the Lord sees that the believers no longer set their mind on earthly things, but on the heavenly things in their experience, He will say, "How fair is thy love...how much better is thy love than wine!"
[184]  Because the Lord loves us so deeply, He can appreciate our love and His heart can be satisfied with our love.
[185]  Verse 11 says, "Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon."
[186]  "Smell" in this verse is different from the word "fragrance" in the previous verse.
[187]  No human or natural smell can be compared to the fragrance that emanates from the maiden.
[188]  This naturally makes her lips drop as the honeycomb.
[189]  In this verse we can notice not only her lips slowly dropping sweet honey, but the things that are stored within her.
[190]  Since she is with the Lord in heaven, she inevitably brings forth a subconscious smell that is higher and loftier than that which is from the world.
[191]  A LIFE OF LOVE 4:16 5:1 A. The Spouse's Answer 4:16
[192]  In the preceding section, we saw the beauty of the new creation vv.
[193]  1-5 , the deeper determination of the maiden v. 6 , and her relationship with Christ in ascension vv.
[194]  It describes the King's satisfaction with the maiden as well as His satisfaction in their mutual relationship.
[195]  The maiden realizes that the King considers her a garden, and she is aware of the many fruits and graces that she has received from the Holy Spirit.
[196]  "Since my Lord has planted me as His garden and has given me the grace to produce the fruits, I should allow Him to come into the garden to enjoy the fruits produced."
[197]  Verse 5:1 says, "I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved."
[198]  Although this garden belongs to the Lord, this verse shows us that He does not come into His garden all the time.
[199]  Song of Songs 5:2 says, "I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night."
[200]  The cross has not only dealt with all her sins, but has dealt with all her flesh.
[201]  Even when she does something, she does not feel that she is doing it herself; she feels that she is a bystander.
[202]  The resurrection life of the Lord is in her, and the resurrected Lord Himself is dwelling and living within her through the Holy Spirit.
[203]  Whenever the Lord speaks, the maiden immediately hears, and she immediately identifies the voice of her beloved.
[204]  The Lord now calls His believers to go through an experience of the cross that they have never before experienced, or that they have only experienced in a shallow way.
[205]  This means that He calls every believer to open up their heart to Him once again and to receive once again the Lord who is filled with the drops of the night.
[206]  However, He does not say "my spouse," because He is waiting for her to answer Him before He can be assured of her status as a spouse, one who is in complete union with Him.
[207]  Now the Lord leads her into the deepest aspect of a life of suffering together with Him and in conformation to His death.
[208]  Verse 3 says, "I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on?
[209]  I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?"
[210]  Although they have suffered a little for the cross and met some persecution and shame, they have always felt that the cross was their glory, their life, and their power.
[211]  It never occurred to them that the cross would become their shame, that they would not only lose worldly fame, but also their spiritual renown, that others would consider that God has rejected them, and that God would put them through trials and strip them of comfort and sympathy from those whom they know, who would think that they were smitten by God.
[212]  If God allows her to be misunderstood, stripped of her good name, shamed, and considered by others as being in an argument with God, how can she glorify Him any longer?
[213]  But she does not realize that her concerns revolve around how she can glorify God.
[214]  The cross must work so deeply on her until she is content with the portion that God has allotted for her and until she lets God take care of His own glory.
[215]  The maiden's past experience of the cross made her a channel of life; those who wanted to follow the Lord had to go to her.
[216]  But if she answers this new call and allows the cross to bring her to the place of shame, will she not lose her position and opportunities in the work?
[217]  All that she sees is the preservation of her own cleanliness; she does not see that the defilement one receives in opening the door to the Lord is not really defilement at all.
[218]  When we are spiritually at ease and our conscience does not condemn us concerning any error, and when we find ourselves having many spiritual experiences that issue from the Lord's death and resurrection, we are reluctant to pursue after the goal Christ has set for us.
[219]  Verse 4 says, "My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.
[220]  I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock."
[221]  For the bowels to be moved means that her deepest feelings are touched.
[222]  Her will has fully been subjected to the Lord.
[223]  If her heart were indeed hardened, the Lord would not have pursued her.
[224]  Putting the hand through the hole of the door means that the Lord is doing all that He can to reveal a part of Himself.
[225]  Through the revelation of His hand, the Lord hopes that she will begin to think about Him.
[226]  Verse 6 says, "I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer."
[227]  She recalls how she was beside herself when the Lord first called, and how her soul was raptured away to Him.
[228]  Verse 8 says, "I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love."
[229]  When the maiden cannot find help from spiritual men, she seeks help among those who are less advanced than she is.
[230]  When she feels that she has offended the Lord and has lost His countenance, in her desperation she tries to find help even from the daughters of Jerusalem.
[231]  Her words amount to an admission of her failure and that, if possible, they should pray for her.
[232]  Her sense of failure is so deep that she feels that even babes in the Lord can render her some help.
[233]  She is not ignorant of their immaturity, and she realizes that their fellowship with the Lord is not perfect.
[234]  This love sickness does not arise from an overindulgence in love, but from a hunger for love.
[235]  Although the daughters of Jerusalem do not have deep experiences in the Lord, and although they are not filled with the life of the new creation, they can see that the maiden is the fairest among women.
[236]  Mr. Darby said, "It is, I judge, a fine moral perfectness of thought that the bride never speaks of the Bridegroom's perfections to Himself as if she were to approve Him; she speaks of Him fully as expressive of her own feelings and to others, but not to Him.
[237]  Verse 11 says, "His head is as the most fine gold; his locks are bushy, and black as a raven."
[238]  "For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily" Col 2:9 .
[239]  Nothing that is of God is absent from Him.
[240]  His lips drop myrrh; every word of grace that comes out of His mouth is based on His death.
[241]  This means that the thoughts in His mind, the works of His hands, and the stability of His feet are all of God.
[242]  Since she has seen the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face, she is reflecting His glory like a mirror and is being transformed to the Lord's image, from glory to glory.
[243]  Verse 6:1 says, "Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee."
[244]  After hearing her testimony, it is natural that the daughters of Jerusalem would want to pursue after Him.
[245]  The Christ she knows is very different from the Christ that others have preached according to their own ideas.
[246]  It is no wonder that there is power and attraction, and no wonder that they still consider her as the fairest among women and join her in seeking after Him.
[247]  The repeated question which they pose, "Whither is thy beloved turned aside?", implies that a barrier exists between the maiden and her Beloved and that this is the reason He has turned aside.
[248]  Since she knew of His loveliness in the past, and since they are ready to seek Him, she should be able to tell them where He is now.
[249]  But after she presents her own testimony and after her attempt to help others, she suddenly receives light and the location of her beloved becomes clear.
[250]  The Lord is near her, even in her mouth and in her heart.
[251]  Although He seemed to have turned away when she delayed in her obedience, actually He only retreated from her feelings; He is only showing her the pain of the withdrawal of His countenance.
[252]  As to the feeling of His lost presence, she should hold onto God's word with a calm mind, and she should believe that He is still within His garden and prepared to reveal Himself at the proper time once again.
[253]  She does not stop testifying faithfully for the Lord just because she thinks that she is not faithful.
[254]  Although she feels that she has lost the fellowship herself, she hopes that others would know His preciousness and fellowship with Him.
[255]  Although she speaks of her past revelation, does not the Lord quietly hearken when the saints speak one to another concerning Him?
[256]  This means that the Lord is eating His excellent fruits in His garden, and He is also enjoying the beauty of His believers.
[257]  When she sees this, she realizes that although everything has changed, the covenant between her and the Lord has not changed.
[258]  A LIFE WITHIN THE VEIL 6:4-13 A. The Beloved's Praise 6:4-9
[259]  After the maiden arrives at this stage, we see the Lord's satisfaction in her.
[260]  This book speaks of a progressive union; the purpose of the union is fellowship, while the meaning of fellowship is identification.
[261]  Hence, the maiden sees in the King what she has experienced in the King.
[262]  The King sees the manifestation of His life in the maiden.
[263]  The King's praise is a proclamation of the riches the believers have received through their union with the Lord.
[264]  Verse 4 says, "Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners."
[265]  A life within the veil is not just a life before the Lord, but a life before the enemy, because the heaven in which the saints dwell is the very heaven which the enemy assails.
[266]  Just as He turned down the Syrophoenician woman Mark 7:25-29 , delayed two days before going up to Judea John 11:5-7 , told Moses, "Let me alone" Exo 32:10 , and allowed Jacob to hold on to Him Gen 32:26 , He is inviting the maiden's expression of love with a word of seeming rejection.
[267]  Although the maiden failed through her delay and feels that she has sinned through falling into darkness, the Lord treats her just the same as before.
[268]  Verse 9 says, "My dove, my undefiled, is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her.
[269]  The meaning of the only child is that there is an absolute union with the Lord, and that everything is the Lord's. She has reached a complete union with the Lord.
[270]  Verse 10 says, "Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?"
[271]  Here the Holy Spirit speaks through the mouth of a third party again and brings out the maiden's glory through exclamatory questions.
[272]  The Holy Spirit likes to stimulate the thoughts of the believers with questions; He arouses their attention once again to consider God's work and understand what is pleasing to God.
[273]  Her shadows have fled away; there is no further barrier between her and the Lord.
[274]  The moon signifies the grace within her, while the sun signifies what she is in the Lord.
[275]  Not only does she have a future that is full of hope, and a life that is absolutely heavenly, but she is a victor who constantly triumphs in her victory.
[276]  7:1-13 I. THE EQUIPPING OF THE WORKER 7:1-9a A. Recapitulation 7:1-5
[277]  Song of Songs 7:1 says, "How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman."
[278]  Now the Holy Spirit answers the question posed in the previous section through the mouth of a third party.
[279]  If liquor refers to the blood of the Lord Jesus, the heap of wheat must refer to His flesh.
[280]  Mixed wine refers to the life that the Holy Spirit gives to us through the blood of the Lord Jesus.
[281]  This means that the believers are empowered by the Lord and strong enough to control Him and force Him to answer their prayers.
[282]  Only after she has been fully delivered from herself, her consecration and power of obedience have been fully put under the Lord, and she is filled with the thought of the Lord's glory to the extent that her hair becomes purple, would God dare entrust her with the power that enables her to imprison the King.
[283]  Actually, the King is not imprisoned by her, because she holds the King in the galleries for the purpose of accomplishing His own will and for the fulfillment of His own promise.
[284]  Verse 6 says, "How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!"
[285]  Since the Holy Spirit's word fully matches the Lord's will, the Lord is able to continue with the conversation, as if the previous words were actually spoken by Him.
[286]  When He hears the Holy Spirit speaking in verse 5, He cannot help but insert His word and speak directly to the maiden, who is the subject of the discussion.
[287]  Saying that she is likened to a palm tree is saying that she has the stature of the fullness of Christ Eph 4:13 .
[288]  Since the union between the maiden and the Lord is so absolute, her movement becomes very dependable, and she can now speak the words in the following verse.
[289]  Verse 11 says, "Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages."
[290]  Now she is no longer acting alone, and the Lord is no longer acting alone.
[291]  Since she is liberated from herself, she is also delivered from all narrowness and pettiness.
[292]  Her focus is no longer on her meeting, her work, her church, or her group.
[293]  She does not have a so-called work of her own, and she does not have a so-called region of her work.
[294]  A person who works together with the Lord should not only have a world view, but should have the nature of a sojourner and bear the mark of a sojourner.
[295]  But by this time, her experience has reached the stage of perfection, and she is able to relate the Lord's work to the Lord Himself and able to relate even the world to the Lord.
[296]  Now she can express her loves to the Lord at the place of His work.
[297]  She has no condemnation after she works, and she is no longer afraid of losing something of the Lord through her work.
[298]  She realizes that there is only one Lord Jesus and only one new creation, but not everyone bears the same kind of fruit.
[299]  We work together with the Lord in His work, but all the glory goes to the Lord.
[300]  The deeper a believer is in union with the Lord and the more he comes up to the standard of the maiden, the more he will be aware of his outward man and the shell of his flesh.
[301]  It is true that the inward man is renewed day by day, but the outer man is also decaying day by day.
[302]  When our union with the Lord has become very nearly perfect, we sense the difference between our inward state and our outward body.
[303]  Song of Songs 8:1 says, "O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised."
[304]  The maiden is saying to the Lord, in effect, "I wish I could become more intimately related to You than I am today.
[305]  I wish that You were my brother in the flesh, and that my relationship with You before God could be manifested immediately before men.
[306]  When this happens, I will not be despised when I confess You before men and when I acknowledge my love before others.
[307]  Since I am still in the world, I still feel weakness in me, and I cannot treat You as my heart wishes to treat You.
[308]  She continues to say, "On that day, His left hand will be under my head, and He will lift up my face to behold Him.
[309]  There she began her absolute union with the Lord in His death, His life, and all His grace.
[310]  The Holy Spirit once again asks a question through the mouth of a third party.
[311]  "Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness?"
[312]  It seems as if He sees a maiden coming up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved; the closer she gets, the clearer her identity becomes.
[313]  Here we see that the rapture that delivers us from the wilderness does not happen suddenly, but is a result of a step-by-step walk with the Lord.
[314]  The rapture is the last step of our walk with the Lord.
[315]  By leaning upon our Beloved, we constantly leave the world behind and come up again and again until the Lord comes to take us away.
[316]  The Lord answers and says that she is none other than the once-filthy sinner, who was seen by grace, called by grace, and saved by grace.
[317]  Thank God that when she first opened her eyes to behold the world, the first thing she saw was the affectionate Christ.
[318]  A person may be the most lovable one, the most adorable one, or the most precious one, but when Sheol comes to claim a sinner, it will not care if such a one is lovable or adorable.
[319]  "Since I have consecrated myself to You as a chaste virgin, if You see anything in me that stirs up Your jealousy, You will surely deal with it at all cost until You completely prevail.
[320]  Verse 7 says, "Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned."
[321]  His love and the fire of His love will not be quenched by trials.
[322]  We can only offer ourselves to Him so that we will become the object of His love.
[323]  She speaks of her little sister, who has life, but whose faith and love have not grown to the point where she can develop an affection for the Lord.
[324]  The maiden brings up those whom she has always cared for and who are younger than she is; she brings them up before the Lord to discuss them with Him.
[325]  Verse 9 says, "If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar."
[326]  If there is anything that is of God, which causes her to build a separation between herself and that which is not of God, like a wall, then "we will build upon her a palace of silver."
[327]  She can say that she is a wall, and she can say that her two breasts are towers, but in the Lord's eyes, she considers herself as one who has obtained peace.
[328]  Verse 11 says, "Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver."
[329]  Before the believers are raptured, the Holy Spirit wants them to pay attention to one thing the reward of the work.
[330]  Solomon has his vineyards; they are his fields, and he leases them out to the keepers.
[331]  The Lord's work is not ours; our position is forever that of a steward.
[332]  When He comes, what He entrusted to us will return to Him.
[333]  This shows us that the Lord, like Solomon, is the lord of everything; He is also our Lord.
[334]  The Lord will also give us the fruit of what we keep, tend, and raise for Him today; that will be our reward.
[335]  Although she stands on a higher ground, and although she has a love relationship with the Lord and is different from others who serve Him out of a sense of duty, nevertheless, she does not give less than what the Lord's duty requires.
[336]  When the Lord rewards His workers, she will be included among those keeping the fruits; she will receive the two hundred pieces of silver.
[337]  According to righteousness, she should only receive the fruits and not the silver S.S. 8:11 . However, all those who serve the Lord in love will find that when they do not take the Lord's work as a commercial enterprise, the Lord will not reward them on a commercial basis.
[338]  He is not only dwelling in the heart of one who follows Him absolutely, but He is dwelling in the hearts of all those whom He delights in. The maiden addresses Him according to this relationship.
[339]  Standing on the power of the Son of God,
[340]  The strength of His arm and the balm of His love.
[341]  50 6.4.6.4.6.6.6.4.
[342]  Not I, but Christ be seen, be known and heard;
[343]  My Lord, Thou hast become my life and peace.
[344]  To the foe my word is always, "No,"
[345]  We shall not die, but raptured see the Lord!
[346]  83 8.6.8.6.6.6.7.5. with chorus.
[347]  90 8.8.8.8.4.4.8.8.
[348]  Deep down into the depths of this Thy Name,
[349]  My God, I sink and dwell in calm delight;
[350]  148 6.6.9.6.6.9. with chorus.
[351]  God is my hope and God is my joy;
[352]  Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face;
[353]  Here would I grasp with firmer hand Thy grace,
[354]  Oh, what a Savior that He died for me!
[355]  172 6.4.6.4.6.6.6.4.
[356]  And in Thy presence sound a note of praise
[357]  Thy love, our God and Father, now is seen,
