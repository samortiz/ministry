   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO LIVE OUT THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As the new creation, we should not live in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we live in the old creation, we are not in resurrection but in our natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once we live in the Triune God, in Christ, and in the consummated Spirit, we are in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a life that lives out the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today, in general, people have the term "the Body of Christ," yet very few know what the Body of Christ refers to.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Brethren teaching says that the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is literally according to Ephesians 1:23: "Which the church is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But what is the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Brethren did not have a clear explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Based on his knowledge of the Bible and his own experience, Brother Watchman Nee spoke a word which probably had never been spoken by anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He said, "The Spirit is the reality of resurrection."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we live in this resurrection, what we live out is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Body of Christ is the issue of the God-man life lived out by all those who believe in and belong to the Lord as the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only such a God-man living is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In our daily life we should speak and do things in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are not in resurrection, we are not the Body of Christ; rather, we are natural.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may live and walk in a proper manner, but if we do not live out the reality of Christ, we are not in the Spirit or in the reality of resurrection; hence, we are without the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This touches something very high.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we have not seen this, we have not seen the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Where is the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some say that the Body of Christ is universal and appears in different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This explanation is still a doctrine, even a good doctrine, but it has not yet touched the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Where is the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Body of Christ is in resurrection, and this resurrection is first, the Triune God; second, the pneumatic Christ; and third, the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Body of Christ is in the Triune God, in the pneumatic Christ, in the all-inclusive Spirit, and in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, when we live out a situation of resurrection, that is the manifestation of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Using this as the yardstick for measuring, can you find the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You need to be careful in your daily life to see whether you speak and act in resurrection or in your natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you are not in resurrection, whatever you say is not in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you say something that is not nice, it is not in resurrection; if you say something nice, neither is it in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then what shall you do?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You know what to do only by being on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you are going to talk about something, are you on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you are on the cross, you are in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>LIVING IN RESURRECTION TO BRING FORTH A GENUINE REVIVAL</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we live in resurrection, this will become an unprecedented revival among all the Christ-pursuing God-men today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It will be a genuine revival brought forth from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It will also be an unprecedented revival, a revival that has never occurred in the two-thousand-year history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I believe that before the Lord comes back, there will be such a final revival.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is this revival?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is the corporate living of the overcomers; it is also the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This revival does not necessarily refer to the preaching of the gospel with enthusiasm to bring people to salvation; this revival is the corporate living of the overcomers in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A REVIVAL AS THE MEANS FOR THE LORD TO CLOSE THIS AGE</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This revival will be the means for the Lord to close this age and bring in His kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This age is really coming to a close.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Look at the development in the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The nation of Israel has been restored, and Jerusalem has been returned to the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, this age should be ended.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But it seems that the Lord still has no way to close this age.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The reason that the Lord still has not closed this age is that He is still waiting for the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is waiting for a group of overcomers to live in His Body in resurrection to be the means for Him to usher in His kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Luke 18:8 the Lord said, "When the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that when the Son of Man comes, He will be looking for the overcomers on the earth, a group of people living in faith, but can He find them?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you answer, "He can," then this age can be closed for the Lord to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, no one today can say this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I often ask myself solemnly and even ask the Lord with weeping, "O Lord, am I Your overcomer today?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I dare not say that I am not, but I am afraid that I am not, because I still do certain things in my natural man and not in resurrection, and I still do certain things not by faith but by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Recently, we said that to have faith is to believe that God is and I am not.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hebrews 11:6 says, "He who comes forward to God must believe that He is."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today the people in the world, even Christians, and even the leading co-workers among us, mostly act and behave by believing that they themselves are.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You can seldom see a brother who shows, in his attitude and expression, that he does not believe that he is but believes that only God is.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A person who does not believe that he is but believes that only God is, is the Lord's overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>With this as a measuring yardstick, I tell the Lord, "Lord, in the last part of the journey of my human life, may I receive Your mercy and grace to be one of Your overcomers."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Without such a group of overcomers, how can the Lord close this age?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord has spent six thousand years to work on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the Adamic age the Lord did not find this group of overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then generation after generation through the age of the law, He was not able to find these overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Likewise, in the church age He cannot find this group of overcomers in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is only in His recovery that He can find a small number of overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In Revelation 14 we see that even though many have been saved, the overcomers number only 144,000.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>May the Lord have mercy on us to make us the overcomers in the present age for Him to close this age and bring in His kingdom age.</S>
