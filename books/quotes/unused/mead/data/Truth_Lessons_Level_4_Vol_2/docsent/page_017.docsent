   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The nations being destroyed and Jacob having dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>TEXT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After their exodus from Egypt, the children of Israel were formed into an army to fight for God on their journey.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This fighting army journeyed so that God would gain the ground on earth to build up His kingdom and His house.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before entering the good land, the children of Israel defeated the kings of Arad, of the Amorites, and of Bashan on the east of the Jordan, destroying their cities and taking over their land Num 21:1-3, 21-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the children of Israel defeated these three kings, they were ready to cross the Jordan and enter into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Being unable to defeat the children of Israel politically or militarily, the enemy changed his mode of fighting against them and decided to take the religious way to defeat God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, Balak, the king of Moab, joined with Midian and sent elders to induce Balaam to come and curse the children of Israel for them chs.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>22 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God deterred Balaam, but Balaam insisted on going.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then God allowed him to go but charged him to speak only what the Angel of Jehovah would speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Balaam had the desire and intention in his heart to curse Israel so that he might please Balak and receive money.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the One who was watching and ruling, however, Jehovah put a word in Balaam s mouth, and Balaam had no choice but to speak God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, Balaam did not speak curses; instead, he spoke four parables concerning Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Balaam s parables there are many prophecies concerning the house of Israel, the nations, and the Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this lesson we will consider these marvelous prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I. THE FIRST PARABLE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Balaam s first parable is in Numbers 22:41 through 23:12.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the Bamoth-baal, and he saw from there the edge of the people v. 41 . Bamoth-baal means the high places of Baal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Old Testament the high places were places where people worshipped idols.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Baal was the name of an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, Bamoth-baal was the place where people worshipped the idol of Baal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Balaam said to Balak, Build me seven altars here, and have seven bulls and seven rams ready for me here.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And Balak did just as Balaam had spoken 23:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While Balak and all the rulers of Moab stood beside Balaam s burnt offering vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>3, 6 , Jehovah put a word in Balaam s mouth, and Balaam prophesied in a parable vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>4-5, 7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Balaam s words were inspired by God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The human mind is not able to compose such a parable.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us now consider certain aspects of Balaam s first parable.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A. The Children of Israel Being a People</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Who Live Alone and Do Not Reckon Themselves among the Nations</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Balak said to Balaam, Come, curse Jacob for me; / And come, denounce Israel! v. 7 . However, this was impossible because Balaam said, How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? / And how can I denounce whom Jehovah has not denounced? / For from the top of the rocks I see him, / And from the hills I behold him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>/ Here is a people who live alone / And do not reckon themselves among the nations vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This word about the children of Israel s living alone and not reckoning themselves among the nations indicates that they were a holy, sanctified people, a people set apart from the nations unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In God s eyes Israel lives alone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to God s view, even today Israel is still not reckoned among the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have God s view, we will see that Israel is a particular, separate people, a holy nation.</S>
