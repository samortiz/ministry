<h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>On July 10 Sister Yu and I went to Yi-Liang for a few days. Brother Chang Tsing-yuen was with us. There is only a Pentecostal Church there. We preached the gospel for two days. After returning from Yi-Liang to K'un-ming, we left on July 19 and arrived safely in Shi-Ping on the twentieth. The sisters' meeting began on the twenty-sixth, involving two meetings a day. Sister Yu is responsible for them. There are about twenty sisters here, with over ten who are able to stand for the Lord. Beginning August 5, we will have a few days of gospel meetings. May the Lord gain more people for Himself.</p><p>Sister in the Lord,<br />Rachel Lee, August 3</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>We left Shi-Ping for Lin-An and stayed for half a month; there were ten big evangelistic meetings. Brothers Lin and Chen and Sister Rachel were responsible for the meetings on the first few days. During the last few days, Brother Lin had to return to Shi-Ping, and Brother Chen, Sister Rachel, and myself were responsible for the meetings. We had one gospel meeting every day. During the ten days, many indicated that they wanted to receive the Lord. Brother Chen spoke every morning at the Health Department on the victory of Christ and every evening on the requirement for entering the kingdom.</p><p>Shu-jen, August 24</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>We stayed in Lin-An for two weeks, and the Lord blessed the work. On August 24 Brother Chen and I came to Kai-Yuan from Mong-Tze. There is only one Pentecostal Church here. We have conducted eight meetings so far, including something for believers and something for unbelievers. The meetings are good. Many have become clear about their salvation, and many have risen up to seek after the Lord.</p><p>Rachel, August 29</p><h2 class="head2">Brother Pan Huo-ling Sleeps in the Lord</h2><p>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>You have heard that Brother Pan Huo-ling from our locality had been sick for a long time. We thank all the brothers and sisters in all the localities for praying for him. On the morning of July 28, our brother was called by the Lord and departed from this world! We will arrange for the funeral and cemetery. We should thank and praise the Lord for Brother Pan because he has now been delivered from the sea of sorrow and is in Paradise. But we are grieved at the fact that the church in Kien-Ou has lost the help of a strong arm! In our sorrow we are concerned that the brothers and sisters would not be aware of this news, and thus we are sending this announcement.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Chang Ting-shiang, Chang Gao-lai, and Chang Tsai-kwang<br />on behalf of the brothers in Wenchow</p><p>(Brother Pan Huo-ling was a good brother and a good worker lauded by all the co-workers in Ping-Yang and Wenchow region. His leaving the world to be with the Lord is surely an excellent state for himself but is undoubtedly heartbreaking news among the co-workers! I remember last year when Brother Watchman Nee was in K'un-ming, how the passing away of a certain brother triggered him to recall the fading away of many zealous, faithful, honorable, and loving co-workers during the past eight to nine years, and how grief and sorrow swelled up from within him. I have the same feeling today! Yet God cannot be wrong. On that day we will know His good will. May the brothers in Wenchow be comforted in the Lord&mdash;Ruth Lee in Chungking.)</p>
