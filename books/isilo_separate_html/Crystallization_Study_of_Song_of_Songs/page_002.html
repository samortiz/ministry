Such a living is expressed in the following stages of the seeker's experience:</p><p>1) Attracted by Christ&rsquo;s love, charmed by His name, and captivated by His person to pursue Him and be led into the church life.</p><p>2) Called to remain in the cross that she may be freed from her introspective self for the fulfilling of her Beloved's purpose concerning her in the divine life.</p><p>3) Called to live in ascension and even within the veil to experience the stronger cross that she may be one with God in her spirit even before rapture.</p><p>4) Conformed, ultimately, to be the wonderful Shulammite, who, as the duplication of Solomon, is the greatest and ultimate figure of the New Jerusalem as the counterpart of Christ.</p><p>We have interpreted nearly every sign in Song of Songs in the Life-study of this book (see <i>Life-study of Song of Songs</i>). Now we have the burden to help all of us, through God's mercy, apply what we have seen. In our application we will cover only the first six chapters of Song of Songs. I believe that after we pick up the way to apply this interpreted book, we will be able to see for ourselves the &ldquo;crystals&rdquo; in the last two chapters.</p><h2 class="head1">MAN BEING CREATED<br />WITH A SEEKING HEART FOR GOD</h2><p>The first &ldquo;crystal&rdquo; in this book is to pursue Christ for satisfaction. God created us for the accomplishment of His eternal economy in His own image with the intention that we could become Him in life and nature but not in the Godhead. For this purpose He created us with a spirit to receive Him. Many people do not realize that God also created us with a seeking heart for Himself so that He could be our satisfaction.</p><p>Man fell away from God, and sin through Satan came in to frustrate man from receiving God for his satisfaction. Yet the desire for God, the seeking for God, still remains in man's heart. History tells us that over the past six thousand years many wise, great, philosophical, and thoughtful men have given the same testimony that nothing can fully satisfy man. Regardless of what they could get from the world, what they could attain, or what they could obtain, nothing can satisfy them because within them there is a seeking heart for God (Eccl. 3:11). This is why the wise King Solomon, after his many human experiences, concluded, &ldquo;Vanity of vanities; all is vanity&rdquo; (1:2). Everything under the sun is vanity of vanities if one does not have God. God created purposely within man a desire for Himself. The monks in Buddhism and the nuns in Catholicism have this desire, but they do not have the proper understanding of how to seek God. God has given man a heart that is seeking after Him for satisfaction.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
