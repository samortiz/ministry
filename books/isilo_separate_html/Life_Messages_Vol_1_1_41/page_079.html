Have you received Christ? If so, how did you receive Him? You opened to Him, repented and confessed your sins, and asked Him to come in. He came into your spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), not into your heart, though you may have sung that well-known chorus, &#8220;Into My Heart.&#8221; From your spirit, the center of your being, Christ is spreading into the surrounding parts-mind, emotion, will, and conscience-which make up your heart.<p>For this cause Paul prayed &#8220;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith&#8221; (Eph. 3:17). Christ is like a guest invited into your home. When He first comes, He stays in the living room (your spirit). After some time you may invite Him into the bedroom, the inner chamber (your heart), and ask Him to make Himself at home. Have you invited the Lord Jesus into the inner chamber of your heart yet? When Christ has spread into all the inward parts around our spirit, He will then have made His home in our hearts. We shall consider how to walk in Him after answering some questions.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p><I>I feel as if I am living two lives, one at work and the other outside of my job. From the moment I walk into the office I am so busy that I seem to miss the Lord every day. How can I lay hold of Him in the midst of all that I have to do?</I><p>It is the Devil&#8217;s subtlety to take some fact of our living to deceive us. His way is to tell a lie by speaking the truth. What he says is apparently true, but his intention is to lie to us. First, you should declare to him and to the whole universe that you will walk by one life, not by two.<p>Second, every day the first thing you should do is to take five, ten, or fifteen minutes to worship the Lord and to contact Him. Tell Him, &#8220;Lord, here is another day for me to live You. Be with me; sustain and strengthen me. Hold me in Your hand. Even though I neglect You every day, You never forget me. I have no trust in my faithfulness; I put my trust solely in You.&#8221; Even during the day, whenever you have time, pray the same way: &#8220;Lord, be with me. I cannot make it to live You out on my own, but You can live Yourself out of me.&#8221;<p>Don&#8217;t wonder how things will work out. We as Christians have too many considerations, stemming from our background and environment. Deny these considerations; they are just frustrations and distractions. Don&#8217;t believe them. We believe only in the living God. Our trust is in Him. We don&#8217;t make preparations and schedules as to what we should do to overcome some situation. We have no expectations and no plan, only the living Lord.<p>All day, starting from first thing in the morning, contact Him, asking Him to sustain you. Just see what happens. Don&#8217;t worry about tomorrow. Don&#8217;t be preoccupied in the meeting, thinking how wonderful the message is but what will you do when you get to the office tomorrow. Just live today. Don&#8217;t borrow tomorrow; you don&#8217;t have it! Every day is today; tomorrow never comes. The Devil would have us worry about tomorrow. As you hear a message, just rejoice and praise the Lord. He is so simple, so real, and so living. If you ask, What about the next hour? I say there is no next hour. Every hour to us is the present one.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_078.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_080.html">Next</a> </body></html>
