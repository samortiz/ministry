   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Living Faith</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The sixth way to preach the gospel is to lead people to a living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is a living faith?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is when man's heart turns to God and touches Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the meaning of a living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's Word says, "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation Rom 10:8, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Believing in the heart is touching the Lord with the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is all that is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some people think that a man has to be clear about the gospel before he can be saved; they try to present the gospel as fully as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But in actuality, as soon as a man touches the Lord and says with his mouth, "Lord," he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On his way to Damascus, the Lord only said to Paul, "Why are you persecuting Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul only opened his mouth, saying, "Lord," and he was saved Acts 9:3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He became clear about gospel truths later.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The thief who was crucified with the Lord mocked Him first.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Later, he had a turn within.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He touched the Lord and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was not clear about the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As long as some people turn their heart to the Lord and call on Him with their mouth, they are saved even though they are not clear about the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The seed of the gospel is the word of God 1 Pet 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once a man touches God's word, he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes we do not have to present the word of the gospel too clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As long as we can lead men to the Lord, they will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is another way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This way does not emphasize the speaking of the word, but the act of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once a man prays, he becomes clear.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way does not involve being clear about the gospel first, but praying first.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The key to this way is to bring men to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is all that is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once a man is saved, he can be taught the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before he is saved, we should not worry whether or not he is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Just bring him to God, and he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>EVERYONE CONCENTRATING ON HIS OWN SPECIALTY,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>AND THE WHOLE BODY COORDINATING TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>FOR THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Generally speaking, the Bible gives us these six lines, and gospel preachers in the past generally have taken these six lines.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to learn to preach the gospel well, we have to pick one of these six lines.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today the preaching of the gospel is not the work of evangelists alone; the whole church has to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every brother and sister in the church has to do the work of an evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to pursue deeper spiritual experiences, but at the same time, everyone has to do the work of the evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No one can use spiritual pursuit as an excuse for not preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the contrary, the deeper a man pursues after spiritual life, the better he should be at preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the complete work that has been entrusted to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everyone has to preach the gospel, and everyone has to have his own line of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must all present ourselves to God and ask Him to show us a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This way will bring in the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After He has shown us the way, we have to dig deep into it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Each one of us has to be perfected in one of these ways.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to pray to God and seek after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to give our thoughts and our time to it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to build up our own topics and material for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not imitate others; we should pay attention to our own specialty.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should do everything to develop our specialty.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If everyone develops his own specialty, the preaching of the church will be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We will only succeed if we tackle the matter from every different angle.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Those who can save souls are wise.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If one line will not work in one place and the needs are not met, we have to change to a different line.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If one person is not enough to meet the need, we can ask other brothers to come and help us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should never be proud in the matter of preaching the gospel; we must learn to coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this way more sinners will be saved.</S>
