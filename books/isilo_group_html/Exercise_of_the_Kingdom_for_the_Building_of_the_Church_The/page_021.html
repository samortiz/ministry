PLEASURE AND SATISFACTION</h2>
<p>We need to be those who care for the Lord&rsquo;s pleasure and satisfaction, and we all must believe the Lord&rsquo;s word. By believing in His word, we were saved. He not only tells us that if we believe in Him, our sins will be forgiven, we shall be cleansed, and we shall have eternal life. His word also tells us that it is not worthwhile to gain the whole world and lose our soul. We should be wise, not foolish. Do not be shortsighted, saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for tomorrow. I care only for today.&rdquo; We must be enlightened by the Lord&rsquo;s word. In the coming age the gaining of the soul will mean a great deal. Even if we had the whole world, we could not buy this. In order to gain the soul in the coming age, it is worthwhile to lose our soulish joy in this age. As long as we have what is necessary for our existence&mdash; food, clothing, lodging, and transportation&mdash;we should be content. It is sufficient that we can exist and live on earth for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, loving Him, contacting Him, receiving Him, digesting Him, and living Him out to be His expression. We should be happy with this and not pursue other things. We should be able to say that we do not care for food, clothing, cars, and houses. We live in Him and trust in Him to take care of our needs. But we do not care for today&rsquo;s enjoyment, entertainment, and amusement. Rather, we care for His pleasure and satisfaction. For the Lord&rsquo;s sake, we are willing to drop so many amusements and pleasures. We care to have only what is necessary to exist for His expression. This is what it means to lose the soul for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. If we do this, He will say to us at His coming back, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful servant. Enter into the joy of your Lord.&rdquo; This is the gaining, the saving, of the soul. If we lose our soul for His sake today, He will reward us with the saving of our soul in the future. But if we save our soul today, we shall lose it in the coming age and suffer some type of punishment. Whether we shall save our soul or lose it in the future depends upon whether we save it or lose it today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATIONS</h2>
<p>As the children of God and saints in the Lord, we should love one another. Suppose you have a large savings account in the bank and another brother is very poor and needs help. According to the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty, this brother&rsquo;s need is brought to your attention. The Lord may burden you to give this brother a large amount of money, but you may be unwilling to do so, not wanting to lose the pleasure of having a certain amount in your bank account. Instead of giving your brother the money the Lord tells you to give, you may reason with the Lord about it, trying to lower the amount. If you do this, you will be saving your soul. Such a thing once happened in China. The Lord burdened one brother to give a certain amount of money to another. But the enemy tempted him to lower the amount. When the brother was enlightened to see the tactics of the enemy, he said, &ldquo;Satan, if you speak to me about this again, I&rsquo;ll give everything away. I am happy to have nothing in my savings account.&rdquo; To lose our pleasure at having a large savings account is to lose our soul.</p>
<p>We may also either save or lose our soul in buying a suit. To buy a new suit may be an enjoyment to your soul. Will you save your soul by buying an expensive suit, or will you lose it by buying one that is adequate but much less expensive? If you are willing to buy the less expensive suit, you will be able to save some money for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. Even in this small matter you will be losing your soul.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOSING THE SOUL AND TRANSFORMATION</h2>
<p>When we lose our soul and its enjoyment, we are undergoing the process of transformation. Suppose a brother does not care for the Lord in buying a suit. He cares only to satisfy his soulish enjoyment. Such a person cannot be transformed in his disposition, will, or emotion. However, if he cares for the Lord and buys a suit under the leading of the Holy Spirit, his soul will be transformed. The losing of the soul today actually transforms the soul. But the saving of our soul today frustrates the transformation. If we lose our soul in all things related to our daily living, we shall be gradually transformed. Then when the Lord comes back, He will say, &ldquo;Well done, good servant; come into My joy.&rdquo; At that time your soul will be fully transformed. You will be prepared, perfected, and qualified to enter into the Lord&rsquo;s enjoyment because over the years your soul has been transformed through your willingness to lose the soul. But if you are not willing to lose your soul in this age, your soul will not be transformed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPLANTED WORD AND A RICH ENTRANCE</h2>
<p>James 1:21 says, &ldquo;Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and abounding of wickedness, and receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls&rdquo; (Gk.). If we are willing to lose our soul, the word will be implanted into our being. The word we have heard in the Bible or in messages will be implanted within us and work for the transformation of our soul. As a result, we shall be rewarded with the saving of our soul when the Lord Jesus comes back. As we lose our soul in all sorts of situations, the word will be implanted into our being to transform our soul. This will make us ready when the Lord Jesus comes back. We shall be transformed and qualified to be the Lord&rsquo;s partners in His reign in the coming kingdom. This is the saving of the soul.</p>
<p>Second Peter 1:11 says, &ldquo;For so an entrance shall be supplied unto you richly into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Gk.). We all need a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of the Lord. We can have such an entrance by losing our souls today. The more we lose the enjoyment of the soul, the richer an entrance we shall have.</p>
<p>We have seen that although we have been saved in our spirit, we still need the salvation of our soul. Now is the time for us to lose our soul that we may gain it at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. We need to lose everything that makes our soul happy. By losing our soul, our entire being will be daily and gradually transformed. Then we shall have the position to be rewarded with the saving of the soul in the future. Outwardly we shall save our soul at the Lord&rsquo;s coming, and inwardly we shall be qualified to participate in the Lord&rsquo;s enjoyment in the coming age.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of the Kingdom for the Building of the Church &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
