   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Pray-reading the Word of God with Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, we need to use our spirit to pray-read the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To comprehend the Word literally we first need to read the black and white letters with our eyes as well as with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second, we need to pray-read, converting all that we see and all that we comprehend into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we pray, we use our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At first, we may use our mind to pray, but after three to five sentences our spirit will rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a definite fact.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, never forget that the essence of the Word of God is God's breathing out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When you read it, you should breathe it in. On God's side, it is a matter of His breathing out; on our side, it is a matter of our breathing in. The spiritual breath comes out of Him and enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That which comes out of Him and enters into us is the spiritual breath.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Word of God is spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our mind cannot touch the Spirit; only our spirit can touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we do not touch the Spirit, we do not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only by touching the Spirit can we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ultimately, this life is Christ, and it is also God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the previous message we pointed out the essence of God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This message teaches us how to practice to touch this essence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At first, we do not need to explain what we read, nor do we need to understand it; we only need to pray-read the Word literally.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we pray-read, our spirit touches the Spirit of the Bible, and thus we receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many of you can testify to this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, a newly saved person may read the first chapter of the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He may not read the footnotes, and he may not read the Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He may simply begin to pray-read from verse one: "Oh, Abraham; Oh, the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>O Lord, You are the son of Abraham, the son of David.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jesus Christ Oh, Jesus; Oh, Christ; Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Abraham begot Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Isaac begot Jacob " If he prays like this for five or six minutes, his whole inner being will be very bright and clear, even though he may not understand anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is neither imagination nor superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can prove this with the fact of our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even if you pray-read Genesis 3:1-2, "Now the serpent was more subtile than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said ," your spirit will be nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is truly marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eating, Drinking, and Breathing the Spirit and the Life in the Word of God</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The matter of pray-reading to eat, drink, and breathe the Spirit and the life in the Word of God is seen in the word of the Bible; hence, pray-reading is not superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we pray-read, the word in letters becomes spirit and life, that is, the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To pray-read is to receive "the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition" Eph 6:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever we receive the Word of God by pray-reading, the result is that we eat, drink, and breathe in the Spirit and the life in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even an Old Testament saint, Jeremiah, also said, "Thy words were found, and I did eat them" Jer 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Word of God is edible; hence, it is our food.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we must "long for the guileless milk of the word" 1 Pet 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Hebrews 5:12 we are told that the Word of God is of two kinds: milk for those who are babes, and solid food for those who are mature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In addition, God's Word is also God's breathing out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we breathe in God's Word, breathing in what God has breathed out, we receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is clear, then, that to pray-read is to eat, to drink, and to breathe, and the more consistently we practice it, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we eat a little, drink a little, and breathe a little, as time goes on we will be purified.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, we will go beyond the letter, the historical events, and the people and things, and we will obtain the revelation of life.</S>
