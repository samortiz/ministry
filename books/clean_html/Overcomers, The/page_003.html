<p>This book concerning the overcomers is a continuation of our fellowship in the book entitled The Satanic Chaos in the Old Creation and the Divine Economy for the New Creation. The burden for the messages in this book can be expressed in the following four sets of statements concerning the overcomers from the book of Revelation:<p>Set 1:<p>To him who overcomes, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God—Rev. 2:7.<p>To him who overcomes, I will give of the hidden manna— Rev. 2:17.<p>Set 2:<p>To him who overcomes, I will give a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written—Rev. 2:17.<p>He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God—Rev. 3:12.<p>Set 3:<p>To him who hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me—Rev. 3:20.<p>He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne—Rev. 3:21.<p>Set 4:<p>He who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations—Rev. 2:26.<p>And he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces—Rev. 2:27.<p><p>The entire Scripture composed of sixty-six books concludes with two things: the overcomers and the New Jerusalem. These are the two main items revealed in the book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible. Revelation 1—20 gives us a complete record of the overcomers, and the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21—22 will be the issue, the coming out, the consummation, of the overcomers. The New Jerusalem will be manifested in two stages. The first stage will be in the millennium, the one-thousand-year kingdom. That will be the precursor of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity, the second stage of the New Jerusalem in the eternal age.<p>We may ask, “What is the New Jerusalem?” If we read Revelation thoroughly under the heavenly light, we can see that the New Jerusalem is the totality of the overcomers. The overcomers will be the New Jerusalem in the coming age, the age of the millennium, as the precursor to the New Jerusalem in eternity future. Only a relatively small part of the believers will be the overcomers. The majority of the believers—genuine, regenerated, blood-washed believers—will have been defeated. At the Lord’s coming, He will take away only the overcomers, leaving the rest of the believers in another category because they will not have the maturity in His divine life. In the millennium the overcoming believers will be with Christ in the bright glory of the kingdom, whereas the defeated believers will suffer discipline in outer darkness (Matt. 8:12; 22:13; 25:30). This is so that they can be perfected for their maturity.<p>For any crop to become matured, that crop needs to go through a certain process. The process through which the immature believers will have to pass will not be pleasant but will be a period of discipline and punishment for one thousand years. Even though that will not be a pleasant process, it will complete God’s eternal economy. All of these dear ones will be matured and perfected. After the thousand years, the Lord will clear up the entire universe through His judgment at the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). Then there will be the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem in eternity will be greatly enlarged to include all the believers. By then all the believers will be overcomers (Rev. 21:7). The late ones will be later overcomers, whereas the overcomers in this age will be the earlier overcomers.
