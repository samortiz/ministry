<p class="bold">WEEK 9 — DAY 6</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 13:24-25, 28-30</h2><p class="bold">24 &nbsp;Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field.</p> <p class="bold">25 &nbsp;But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away.</p><p>28 &nbsp;And he said to them, An enemy has done this. And the slaves said to him, Do you want us then to go and collect them?</p> <p>29 &nbsp;But he said, No, lest while collecting the tares, you uproot the wheat along with them.</p><p class="bold">30 &nbsp;Let them both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them up, but the wheat gather into my barn.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>In this, the second parable [13:24-30, 36-43], the Lord began to say, “The kingdom of the heavens is (or, has become) like...,” because the kingdom of the heavens began to be established when this parable began to be fulfilled, that is, on the day of Pentecost, when the church was built (16:18-19). It was from that time, after the church had been founded, that the tares, the false believers, were sown among the true believers, the wheat, forming the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>[In] verse 25…the men were the slaves (v. 27), referring to the Lord’s slaves, mainly the apostles. It was when the Lord’s slaves were sleeping and were not watching that the Lord’s enemy, the devil, came and sowed false believers among the true.</p><p>A tare is a kind of darnel, a weed resembling wheat. Its seeds are poisonous and can cause sleepiness, nausea, convulsions, and even death. The sprout and leaves of tares look the same as those of wheat. It is impossible to distinguish wheat from tares until the fruit is produced. The fruit of the wheat is golden yellow, but that of the tares is black.</p><p>When the King’s slaves wanted to collect the tares (v. 28), He said, “No, lest while collecting the tares, you uproot the wheat along with them.” Both the tares and the wheat grow in the field, and the field is the world (v. 38). The false believers and the true live in the world. To collect the tares from the field means to take away the false believers from the world. The Lord did not want His slaves to do this, because while taking away the false believers from the world, they might also take the true ones away. The Catholic Church did this very much and by so doing killed many true believers.</p><p>Many Christian teachers have wrongly interpreted the field, saying that it is the church. According to this interpretation, in the church there are both false ones and real ones. But the Lord says clearly in verse 38 that the field is the world. The wheat and the tares are allowed to grow together in the world, not in the church. According to the Epistles, not even sinful ones are allowed to remain in the church.…If even the real but sinful ones must be cast out [1 Cor. 5], then how much more the false ones? The church is not to tolerate the false believers, but both the false and the true are allowed to grow together in the world.</p><p>In Galatians 2:4 and 2 Corinthians 11:26 Paul mentioned false brothers, saying that he was damaged by the false brothers. This indicates that in Paul’s time the tares were present. Of course, a great many more tares have come in since Constantine made Christianity the state religion.</p><p>In this parable the Lord points out the serious matter of the judgment upon the tares [vv. 30, 40-42]. This will be a special judgment, for the tares will be bound into bundles and cast into the furnace of fire, which is the lake of fire.…The judgment upon the tares will be so serious because they have been confusing, frustrating, and damaging God’s economy. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 450-453, 456)</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 449-456; Hymns: #945 (vv. 1-4, 11)</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
