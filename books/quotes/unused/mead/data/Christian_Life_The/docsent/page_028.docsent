   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>X. INDWELLING THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The all-inclusive Spirit is indwelling the believers Rom 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit not only dwells within us but also indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To indwell is to make home, or reside cf.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eph 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today the Spirit is within us, and He is functioning to indwell us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All of the functions of the all-inclusive Spirit are very mysterious and abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In each believer all these functions are acting day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The world does not see this, but we believers can realize the functions of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is because these functions are actions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit is moving within us every day, even every moment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>LEADING THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indwelling Spirit is the leading Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He leads the believers Rom 8:14; Gal 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 8:14 says that as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are the sons of God because we have a particular Guide, who leads us always in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whatever the Spirit tells us in His leading of us is true.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to listen to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>XII.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>WITNESSING</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit also functions in witnessing, or testifying.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First, He witnesses concerning Christ John 15:26; 1 John 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While the gospel preaching is going on, the Spirit is always working within the listeners in the way of witnessing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why many unbelievers wonder why certain preachers are so convincing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, it is not they who are convincing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While they are speaking, another One, a witnessing person, the witnessing Spirit, is working in the listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, the witnessing Spirit within the listeners speaks more than the speaker who is witnessing concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Otherwise, how could people such as the conservative Chinese ever believe in Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Logically speaking, this is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But whenever a witness of Christ is speaking about Christ, another Witness, the Spirit, works to witness concerning Christ within the listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Also, the Spirit witnesses with the spirit of the believers that they are children of God Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How do we know we are children of God?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We know because there is an inner witnessing, and that witnessing is the witnessing Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The two spirits work together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some who become fallen or defeated in their Christian life may go to a sinful place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But when they go, there is a checking within them which says, "Should a child of God be here?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The witnessing Spirit with our spirit is witnessing all the time, but many Christians are not used to listening to this inward witness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we go shopping, there is always an inward checking, an inward witnessing, telling us that certain things are not what children of God should buy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In everything we do, we have the witnessing Spirit functioning within us.</S>
