We believe in a literal interpretation of all the major truths of the Bible.</P><P>Goal:In this little monthly publication, our desire is to supply spiritual milk to the young believers and solid food to the older ones. We especially stress the salvation of the cross. But we are even more concerned with the spiritual condition of the believers. We ask God to strengthen us that we could preach all of God's will. As to the errors of modernism, we will strive to warn God's children of its danger.</P><P>Standard:The Bible is our only standard. We are not afraid to preach the pure Word of the Bible, even if men oppose; but if it is not the Word of the Bible, we could never agree even if everyone approved of it.</P><P>Affiliation:We do not belong to any church. This paper is published with the help of the Lord's strength. Recently, being an indigenous church has become a fashionable subject. We believe that God's will is for us to return to the condition and method of the first century apostles. Therefore, concerning the question of the church, we preach with the New Testament as our goal, and we are not under the influence of any denominations.</P><P>Specialty:The odd issues of this publication (i.e., Issue Nos. 1, 3, 5, etc.) will be magazines, while the even issues will be Bible expositions. Many people do not understand the book of Revelation. Therefore, beginning with Issue Nos. 2, 4, 6, etc., we will devote ourselves exclusively to the study of Revelation. We will expound this book verse by verse. We believe that the readers will welcome this study. (There will be six magazine issues and six exposition issues each year.)</P><P>Price:Twelve issues per year for seventy cents. Overseas subscription is one dollar, or U.S. sixty cents, or two shillings, six pence. For eighteen issues (one and a half years), the price is one dollar. If you order ten copies, one will be free. Therefore, believers who are financially poor can solicit nine subscribers for this magazine and send in their subscription fee; they will then receive a copy free. Please use postal orders in sending in your payment.</P><P>Address:Bible Truth Depot, Pagoda Anchorage, Fukien.</P><P>Request:If we do not have your support, we will surely fail. Therefore, please withstand the enemy in your spirit on behalf of this paper. At the same time, please do your best to promote the circulation of this paper. Many people are willing to subscribe to the paper, but they think it too bothersome to do so. If you are willing to collect the subscription fee from them and send it to us, it will help us greatly. We hope that you will subscribe and introduce the paper to others today. May God bless all of you!</P><P></P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 2</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EDITOR AND THE READERS</H2><P>Since the first publication of The Christian, we have been so thankful for your unhesitating subscription, which increases the usefulness of this paper. There are more brothers and sisters who have helped this magazine by promoting it and collecting money for it. We do not have the time to thank you one by one, but we would like to thank you in a general way here. I know that you are doing this for the Lord's sake; however, since this magazine has received your benefit, we would nevertheless like to thank you. We hope that you would not forget this little work in your prayers. Pray to God for us that the editor would be healthy physically, that sinners would receive salvation through reading this paper, and that saints would be perfected through reading it as well. I still hope that you would not forget that the responsibility of increasing the usefulness of The Christian lies with you. You can write to believers within and outside your province, telling them of the publication of this magazine and asking them to subscribe to it and to introduce it to others. After the publication of the first issue, some friends wrote to tell us that the type is too small. We are aware that there are many unsatisfactory places in the first issue, but we have improved them in this issue. Now we have set the type less densely and have divided the page into two columns. I believe even those with weak eyesight can read it without much difficulty now.</P><P>This magazine has just started, and for various reasons we have to increase the price. Hence, beginning from next year, all new subscribers will be charged according to the new price, but those who have subscribed during this year will be charged the old price. We thank the Lord that many brothers and sisters who have subscribed during this year are willing to have the price adjusted to that of next year.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, since you have bought this magazine, I hope that you will not leave it on your shelf. What benefit is there, if a person only buys a magazine without reading it?</P><P>For the convenience of the readers, we have tried to put all the long articles into one issue. For some that are too long, however, we have to publish them in several issues. We hope that the readers will not give them up because of their length.</P><P>All the sections published in this issue are necessary knowledge for the study of Revelation. We hope that the readers will read it carefully.</P><P>We will continue with our format in the next issue. If you have any questions related to the Bible or spiritual life that you want us to answer, please send them to us within a few days of your receiving this magazine. Otherwise, we will not be able to answer them on time.</P><P>To those readers who have not paid their subscription yet, would you send in your money to the Gospel Book Room as soon as possible? This will help us greatly. All those who are subscribing to the paper should mark on their envelope the word "subscription," and all those who are writing to correspond with us should clearly mark the envelope also. I would love to correspond with God's children very much. However, if you want me to reply to you personally, please enclose a return envelope with stamps included. Overseas readers are free to do whatever they want to do.</P><P>Watchman, Foochow<br>November 26, 1925</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_101.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_103.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 07: The Christian (5) &nbsp; pg 102</div><br></body></html>
