   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Due to their lack of knowledge, some Christians have done strange things in order to experience the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some have taught that to receive the Spirit we should jump, cry, quake, or even shake chairs as practiced by a group of Christians in Taiwan .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no need to do such things to receive the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We simply need to exercise our spirit and call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may also share in this enjoyment by pray-reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Again I say, no matter what you are doing, call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you call without ceasing, you will not quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I can testify from my own experience that if I do not call on the Lord, I cannot live.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if I call on Him, everything is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Often when you greet a person and ask him how he is, he will answer, Oh, I m fine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, for the most part, people are not fine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only those who call on the Lord Jesus without ceasing can truly say that they are fine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Often we are troubled by little things in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The car may not start, or a shoelace may break.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such things can be aggravating and make us angry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you are angry over a car that will not start or over a broken shoelace, can you honestly say that you are fine?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I repeat, only those who call on the name of the Lord Jesus truly are fine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no need always to call on the Lord purposely or deliberately.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may call on Him subconsciously, unconsciously, and unintentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is true breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Breathing is unintentional.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let us practice to build up a habit of calling on the Lord s name until we call unconsciously and unintentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>APPLYING THE LORD AND ENJOYING HIM</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should be those who do not care for systematic theology, but care for the proper and rich enjoyment of our living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is God, the Word, the Lamb, the tree, and the life-giving Spirit as our breath, so present and available.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has redeemed us through His blood, and now, as the Spirit, He dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We abide in Him, and He abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As branches of the vine, we are one in life with the vine and experience the inward flowing of the life of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How marvelous is the salvation we enjoy today!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The very Triune God has passed through a process to become our breath.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, we breathe Him in.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we receive Him by calling on His name, we apply Him to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we have a deep sense that we are enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I cannot deny the fact that whenever I call on the Lord Jesus, I have a sweet sense within.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Oh, He waters, refreshes, nourishes, strengthens, and enlightens me!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is so enjoyable that sometimes I am beside myself with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The processed God is so great, yet He is so enjoyable and obtainable.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I encourage you to call on the Lord, saying, Lord Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As you enjoy the Lord in this way, you may weep out of a sense of His sweetness, loveliness, and preciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we call on Him, He touches us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the true experience of living Christ by breathing the holy breath.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May we all exercise ourselves more and more to receive and enjoy the holy breath.</S>
