   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BROUGHT BACK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verses 11 and 12 Paul tells us to remember our situation before we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He reminds us that we were Gentiles in the flesh, the ones called uncircumcision by those who are called circumcision in the flesh made by hand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He also reminds us that we were apart from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We were without hope and without God in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 13 opens with the words, But now in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These words denote a change of source.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Formerly we were outside of Christ; now we are in Christ and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Christ Jesus we who once were far off have become near in the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why does Paul mention the blood of Christ with respect to our being made near to one another?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This reminds us that before we became near, we were among the fallen people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We needed to be redeemed, to be brought back by the precious blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was because of the fall that the human race was divided and scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because we were fallen, we needed to be redeemed, to be brought back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Redemption has been accomplished through the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this verse the blood signifies redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the redeemed ones, we are now the brought-back ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we were fallen, we were divided and scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But having been redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, we have spontaneously become near not only to God but also to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>OUR PEACE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verse 14 Paul goes on to say, For He Himself is our peace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word our refers to the different peoples, to the Jewish and Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The peace spoken of here is not that between God and man, but that between one man and another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Having accomplished full redemption for us, Christ Himself is our peace, our harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After God called a chosen race out of fallen mankind, there was a separation between Israel and the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through Christ s redemption, this separation has been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, in the redeeming Christ we all are one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For this reason Paul says that Christ has made both one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word both denotes the Jewish and Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CREATING ONE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the remainder of verse 14 and in verse 15 Paul declares that Christ has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, making peace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Christ was crucified, all the ordinances were nailed to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He broke down the middle wall of partition by abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His goal in doing so was to create the Jews and the Gentiles in Himself into one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By Christ s abolishing the ordinances and creating the Jewish and Gentile believers into one new man, peace was made between all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once again we see that the peace in this portion of the Word is the peace among those who believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 16 Paul speaks of the Jews and the Gentiles reconciled to God in one Body through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then in verse 17 he tells us that Christ preached the gospel of peace to those who were far off, that is, to the Gentiles, and to those who were near, that is, to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The result is that through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father v. 18 . All the concepts contained in these verses are not to be found in our natural understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this reason, we need to be enlightened by the Lord to apprehend them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>FELLOW-CITIZENS AND MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In verse 19 Paul continues, So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow-citizens of the saints and members of the household of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The phrase fellow-citizens of the saints indicates the kingdom of God, and the phrase members of the household of God indicates the house, the family, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the one hand, we are citizens of the kingdom; on the other hand, we are members of the household.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The household is a matter of life and enjoyment, whereas the kingdom is a matter of right and responsibility.</S>
