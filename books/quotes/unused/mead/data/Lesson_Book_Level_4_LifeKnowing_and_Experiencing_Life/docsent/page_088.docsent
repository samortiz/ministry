   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. BEING A PRAYING PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must also be praying persons.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should pray unceasingly all the day long.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that we have to call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to call, "O Lord.''</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do not think that such a short calling means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It means a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While we are in school or doing house chores at home, we can call, "O Lord Jesus.''</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such a short calling means a lot to our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By calling on the name of the Lord, we can pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For us to live a normal Christian life we must be praying persons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>WALKING BY AND ACCORDING TO OUR MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We also must learn to walk by and according to our spirit mingled with the Spirit Gal 5:16; Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Praise the Lord that we have a spirit and that our spirit is mingled with the divine Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What a provision!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our God has created us with a spirit and has even regenerated our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Immediately after regenerating us, He stays with us as the Spirit to be one with us and even to mingle Himself with us as one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now we have such a mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After having a good start in the morning, we should continue to walk, to live, to do everything by this mingled spirit and with this mingled spirit all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must learn to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many young people cannot avoid having problems with their siblings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Very few can avoid these problems because they are so close, and they know each other so well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They feel that they do not need to be careful, so there are always chances for them to get into the self or the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These chances are snares and traps to get you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many times, Satan would send your sibling to tempt you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He or she may say a hard word to you or give you a long face.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But at that time we have to learn how to walk, how to behave, how to have our being and living by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not talk to your sibling by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Talk to your sibling with the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the way that you can always be ready to speak Christ everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>LIVING CHRIST FOR HIS MAGNIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must live Christ for His magnification by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and this bountiful supply is right within us Phil 1:19-21; Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord has given us a wonderful provision.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, we have His Word in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Second, we have the Holy Spirit, who is the bountiful Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, living in us, in our spirit, which has been regenerated and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have such a provision, and we can live Christ by this divine provision.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are such persons, we will surely have something to speak when we come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What kind of Christian do you want to be?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you want to be a cold, dumb, dormant, dying, lukewarm, defeated, and backsliding one?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Or do you want to be a Christian who loves the Lord and who is living, refreshing, and active.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Why is Christianity not powerful?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is because most of the Christians in the denominations have been stripped of their riches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They have been annulled and even choked to death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why they need a religious service in which one person speaks to them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But in the Lord's recovery it should be different.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord desires to recover a meeting with all the members speaking to function.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But this depends upon our Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must enjoy the Lord in the Word early in the morning to have a new start of each day.</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must walk and have our being by and according to the mingled spirit, and we must live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we are such persons day after day and throughout each day, we will be ready to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Something of Christ will always be bubbling out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Spirit will become a flow out from our innermost being to flow out all the riches of Christ by the Spirit John 7:37-39 .</S>
