   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, composed of the overcoming saints, will actually be the New Jerusalem during the millennium Rev 2:7; 3:12.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Genesis 47 we have a picture of the millennium: Under Joseph, Egypt prefigured the millennium with all the people on the same level; no longer were there distinctions between high and low and between rich and poor: The whole land of Egypt became a land of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the people became enjoyers on the same level because everyone and everything was under Joseph; this is a picture of the millennium, where everything will be under the Lord s hand vv.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is typified by Joseph, and the kingdom is foreshadowed by the house of Israel Gen 45:8; 47:11, 27: Joseph s life under the heavenly vision was the life of the kingdom of the heavens described in Matthew 5 7.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We, the kingdom people, are being trained to be Josephs, to be kings, to manifest the reigning aspect of the mature life 2 Pet 1:5-11.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because Joseph denied himself and lived under God s restriction, the kingdom could be brought in through him Matt 16:24-28.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is described in Matthew 16:28 17:5 is a miniature of the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium: The center of this miniature is the glorified Jesus, and with Him are Moses and Elijah, representing the Old Testament overcomers, and Peter, James, and John, representing the New Testament overcomers 17:1-3.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the mountain with the Lord Jesus, Peter, James, and John had a foretaste of the coming manifestation of the kingdom 16:28 17:3.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For the Lord Jesus to be transfigured meant that His humanity was saturated and permeated with His divinity; this transfiguration, which was His glorification, was equal to His coming in His kingdom v. 2: The transfiguration, the shining, of the Lord Jesus was His coming in His kingdom; where His transfiguration is, there is the coming of the kingdom Mark 9:1-4; Luke 9:27-31.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The transfiguration of the Lord Jesus was the realization of what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The kingdom is the shining of the reality of the Lord Jesus; to be under His shining is to be in the kingdom Rev 22:4-5.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father Matt 13:43a: At the time of the manifestation of the kingdom, our humanity will be glorified by the glorious divinity within us Col 1:27.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ has been sown into our heart as a seed; this seed will grow and develop until it is manifested in glory Mark 4:26-29; Col 3:3-4.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In one sense, the Lord will come back from heaven, but in another sense, He will come out of us; when He fully lives Himself out of us, that will be the time of His coming Matt 16:27a; 2 Thes 1:10; Col 1:27; 3:4.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the time of the full manifestation of the kingdom, we will fully enter into glory Rom 8:18, 21; Heb 2:10; Phil 3:21.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the millennium the overcoming believers will be with Christ in the bright glory of the kingdom, whereas the defeated Christians will suffer discipline in the outer darkness Matt 13:43a; 8:12: The outer darkness is the darkness outside the bright glory in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens 22:13.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be cast out into outer darkness is to be dealt with dispensationally, to be disqualified from participating in the enjoyment of the kingdom during the millennium, for not having lived by Christ an overcoming life.</S>
