   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Moses Acknowledging Himself</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Have No Eloquence</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now God encouraged him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the resurrection that I mentioned yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moses' former courage, wisdom, and power had all died.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now all his courage, wisdom, and power were received from God's hand anew.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The forty years were like Aaron's rod which lay before Jehovah in the tabernacle overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once the night is over, everything that has died is resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In God's work everything must pass through death and resurrection before it can be used.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we see a young man with knowledge, courage, and competence, we say, "If this man were saved, he would be very useful in God's hand."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But his knowledge, courage, and competence are things that are useless in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God does not need wisdom any more than He needs foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The wise should bring their wisdom through death, and the foolish should also bring their foolishness through death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God can only use those things that are in the realm of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every natural thing must pass through death before one can receive something new and resurrected from God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a great principle in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without resurrection there can be no work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moses had to go through forty years before he realized that all the wisdom and power that he previously had was useless.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He had died, and now God wanted to bless him with the courage and wisdom that comes from resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Exodus 3:12 God promised to be with Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 13, Moses again asked, "When I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is His name? what shall I say unto them?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moses dared not consider himself knowledgeable or able to tell anyone anything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He had been dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He had no presumptions, no ideas, and he dared not act recklessly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was why he inquired of Jehovah in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He had learned the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"For I have not spoken from Myself; but the Father who sent Me, He Himself has given Me commandment, what to say and what to speak...The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father has said to Me, so I speak" John 12:49-50 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He now knew that even what he spoke had to be according to God's commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many times our words are not restricted by God!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is especially true with eloquent people, who think that they are capable of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But those who have been dealt with by God know how to be taught during their speaking; they will no longer be self-confident.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later God told Moses His name.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But even though Moses had God's name, he still dared not go.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was afraid that the children of Israel would not believe his word Exo 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Formerly he dared to go out by himself to slay the Egyptian.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When he saw the Israelites striving together, he dared to exhort them boldly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yet now when Jehovah commanded him to go, he was timid and afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His fleshly boldness was entirely gone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The kind of courage which came from himself was no longer there.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He did not trust in himself anymore; he became humble.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His humility was almost to the point of withdrawal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Genuine humility and the lack of self-confidence are the expression of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now he had learned.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He knew that he could not do anything by himself among the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because of this, Jehovah encouraged him a third time, and gave him the miracles of turning the rod into a serpent, turning water into blood, and making his hand leprous.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God did this in order to cause the people to believe Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But Moses asked the fourth time, "O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue" 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These words were completely contrary to the words in Acts 7:22 which say that Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in words and works.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moses' excuse was that he could not speak and was not eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, Jehovah caused Aaron to be his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to realize that the Bible does not record later that Aaron came out to speak to the people for Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Bible always records that Moses himself spoke to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because through many years, Moses had learned and realized that God would not use any fleshly eloquence, power, or wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Unless the Spirit moves to give a person eloquence and wisdom, all of his power is useless in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Spiritual power is absolutely necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Brothers, do we all know how to be dealt with by God to the extent that our fleshly eloquence is put aside?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We would rather not use the cunning words, the clever expressions, and the clear illustrations to help others understand better the cross of the Lord and His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Have we been dealt with by the cross to the extent that we die to our own speaking?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our words will indeed expose how we actually are; they will show the kind of persons we are.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God needs us to see that even if we have excellence of speech, it does not bear fruit and is not of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we do not allow God to gain the victory in our speaking, God's work will suffer greater damage.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Moses had two kinds of excuses here.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The first was that he was not eloquent and was slow of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The second was that even after he talked with God that day, he still could not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He had completely denied himself before God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He reckoned that nothing of himself could stand before God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He had already learned a deep lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In those forty years, he left behind everything that was natural and of the self.</S>
