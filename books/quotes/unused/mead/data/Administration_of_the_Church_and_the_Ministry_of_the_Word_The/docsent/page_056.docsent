   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO ADJUST THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Furthermore, we should lead the saints to take part in the activities in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This requires a certain amount of study.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, when should we select a hymn?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When and how should the announcements be given?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When should everyone stand to sing, and when should they kneel down to sing?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These matters require careful consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes our kneeling down to sing can uplift a meeting, or our standing to sing can revive the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a mysterious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not be legal regarding standing or sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes the way a person stands in the meeting can become monotonous, but if we criticize him, he might not be willing to stand in the meeting for another six months.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not be rigid.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes our body needs to sit, stand, walk, or lie down.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, there should be some who can appropriately lead and adjust the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, those who adjust are not replacing the brothers and sisters; rather, they are helping them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Holy Spirit often moves through people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If there is no one to adjust the meeting, it may be difficult for the spirit of the brothers and sisters to be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the spirit is adjusted, the spirit can be enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, we should learn to follow the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to learn how to adjust and uplift the prayer meeting and the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This applies to the fellowship meeting and other meetings as well.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are responsible to supply brothers and sisters with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In other words, there should always be someone who follows the Holy Spirit to adjust the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There should also be a short ministering of the word to render help to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After attending such a meeting, the saints will be willing to come again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as they desire to gain the Lord and are able to receive the spiritual supply in the meetings, they will want to come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I hope that the brothers and sisters will pay attention to this matter.</S>
