<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BREATHING OF THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST<br>IN HIS RESURRECTION INTO THE DISCIPLES,<br>DISPENSING THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT<br>AS THE CONSUMMATION OF THE PROCESSED<br>TRIUNE GOD FOR THE DIVINE DISPENSING</H2><P>In the incarnation God became a man, but in His resurrection, Christ as the last Adam, a man in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). The breathing of the pneumatic Christ in His resurrection into the disciples dispensed the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God for the divine dispensing (John 20:22). Christ is rich and has many aspects. He was incarnated to be a man, and He was given to us. Then He died on the cross for us to solve the problem of sin, becoming our Redeemer. Then He resurrected and ascended to heaven to be our Savior. Moreover, He also became a life-giving Spirit to dwell in us. On the cross He was our Redeemer, in the heavens He is our Savior, and within us He is the life-giving Spirit to be our life.</P><P>On the evening of the day of His resurrection, He came back to His disciples in a secret and marvelous way. He came into the room where they were, breathed into them, and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (John 20:19-22). John 20 only tells us how Jesus came to the disciples. It does not tell us how He left again. It is difficult to discover where Jesus went after the evening of His resurrection. The Gospels of Mark and Luke tell us that after His resurrection Jesus ascended to the heavens, but there is no such record in the Gospel of John. After Jesus was resurrected, He simply came back to His disciples and breathed Himself into them as the holy breath. From that time Jesus never left them. He was, still is, and will be forever in all His disciples.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST<br>FOR THE BELIEVERS' BREATHING,<br>THE LIVING WATER GIVEN<br>BY CHRIST IN RESURRECTION,<br>AND THE RESURRECTED CHRIST<br>EATEN BY THE BELIEVERS AND INDWELLING THEM</H2><P>The Gospel of John has two lines concerning the divine dispensing. First, the wonderful Christ was God. Then He was incarnated and was given to us as the Son. Following this He died, resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit to breathe Himself into His disciples. This is the first line. However, the Gospel of John has another line, showing us how Jesus is dispensed into us. In regeneration, Christ came into us and we were born again. However, after a child is born, he needs to breathe, drink, and eat. The pneumatic Christ is for the believer's breathing, dispensing the divine essence into them. The living water is given by Christ in resurrection, dispensing the divine riches into the believers (4:14). The resurrected Christ is eaten by the believers and indwells them, dispensing the divine elements into them for their satisfaction (6:56-58a). In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus said that He is the bread of life (vv. 35, 48), the bread out of heaven (v. 32), the bread of God (v. 33), and the living bread (v. 51) that we may eat Him.</P>
