   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN STABLE ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Stability is another character trait that must be found in the life of every Christian worker.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Stability in character can be understood as stability in one's emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people are solid and unshakable before the Lord, but others are loose and shaky.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They have no conviction in anything, and they turn with every turn in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people are unreliable by nature, not because they want to be unreliable, but because their character is unreliable.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As soon as something touches them, they change.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are not stable in their character.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God requires a stable character of His servants, one that is solid, reliable, and unshakable.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Bible we find a man who was easily shaken, who is known to us as Simon Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us read some verses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Matthew 16:13-16 says, "Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And they said, Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He said to them, But you, who do you say that I am?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First John 5:1 says, "Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God," and verse 13 says, "I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Peter said "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God," he must have at least touched the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He had to have touched God's life in order to have known this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Read again Matthew 16:17: "And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brothers and sisters, being with the Lord Jesus, following Him, and being beside Him do not guarantee one a knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One only knows Him through the revelation of the Father who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our present attention is drawn to verse 18, which says, "And I also say to you that you are Peter Petros , and upon this rock petra I will build My church."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must see that the church is something unshakable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The foundation of the church is unshakable, and the church itself is unshakable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This being the case, all the servants of the Lord should be unshakable as well.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord said, "Upon this rock I will build My church."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church is built upon this rock.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should pay attention to this rock.</S>
