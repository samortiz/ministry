<h2 class="head2">Standing on the Ground of Locality (Pingyang)</h2><p>Through your labor, we have received six copies of The Open Door. They informed us of the situation of the work everywhere. We really thank the Lord unceasingly. Please delete the words Gaosha and Dong Keng from our mailing address. When we began subscribing to the paper, we had not yet left the denominations. We were meeting with the Gaosha China Inland Mission and the Dong Keng Independent Church. At that time we did not want to use the words China Inland Mission and Independent Church, so we only wrote Christian Meeting Hall. Please forgive us for this. In 1949 we began meeting on the local ground in Mabu. (Mabu is one or two miles from Gaosha and Dong Keng.)</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Yang Hua-yu<br />October 7, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">Seeking Fellowship</h2><p>We have been meeting in the Lord's name for three years in Tingtou which is south of Foochow. We began to break bread to remember the Lord in March of this year. We are on the lower Min River, and we feel a lack of fellowship and supply. We hope the brothers in the Lord in other localities would provide us with the spiritual supply and pray for us.</p><p>Your brothers in the Lord,<br />Chen Fen-yu and Huang Jia-zou<br />September 26, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord Gave Grace (Zhengzhou)</h2><p>Thank God that He has given grace in Zhengzhou. Recently three brothers and sisters have seen the way to serve because of their humble and poor heart! We meet in Brother Lee Ren-pu's home. The Lord has begun working here, and our numbers are increasing gradually.</p><p>We are all immature, weak, and pitiful. We are little brothers who are unable to stand firmly. We need the prayers of all the churches. We also ask you to share with us the grace you have received from the Lord.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Lee Xi-chen and Lee Ren-pu<br />November 13, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">We Began Meeting in the Homes (Wenzhuang)</h2><p>We all live in villages. In 1941 there were meetings in Yangjiahe in this county. We remembered the Lord with the brothers there. In 1948 the brothers left for other places, so there have been no meetings to date. We are one or two miles from the city, and there are more than ten brothers and sisters here. We began meeting in the homes on November 16.</p><p>Wen Xu-jiu, Wen Yin-chiu, Chao Ching-wen<br />December 22, 1950</p>
