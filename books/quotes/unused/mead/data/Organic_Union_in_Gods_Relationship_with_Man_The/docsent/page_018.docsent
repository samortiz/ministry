   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Saving Us by Entering into Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Consummate the Divine Incarnation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Such a One is now ready to save us by entering into us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We had fallen into death and even into hell and the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He did not save us by reaching down and snatching us up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He saved us by entering into us as the all-inclusive Spirit, as the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a result, we became so buoyant that we rose up to become a part of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is Christ's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today He is not only in us, but He is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He fills all in all Eph 1:23b .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is not only all-inclusive; He is also all-extensive.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although He fills all in all, He takes us particularly as His dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now He is even making His home in our hearts 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By doing so, He is building a home for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is everywhere, but particularly He is in us, taking us as His principal dwelling, making us His home.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we see this, we will be buoyant and will soar in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have no other place to go but to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is our Savior; He is our Redeemer; He is our life; He is our everything; and He is our eternal home.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today we are remaining in Him, abiding in Him, and living in Him to have our life in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why we are full of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Up to this point the very Triune God still has not completed His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since His passing through crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, and after His pouring out of Himself, His incarnation has proceeded for another two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In these past twenty centuries He has been transfusing and also infusing Himself into millions of His believers, including you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He has transfused Himself into us, and He is now infusing us every day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because of His transfusing and infusing, the more I speak, the more I have to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I cannot finish my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Under His transfusing and infusing, we are all here becoming the very consummation of the divine incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE INTRINSIC VIEW OF GOD'S SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we need to consider what God's salvation is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many Christians have been taught that we were sinners, and our destiny was to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because God loved us, He sent His Son to die for our sins and to be resurrected to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we believe in Him, our sins will be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we will be saved by God and will have peace and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After being saved, we need to behave ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, we will go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To many Christians, this is God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although such a view may be biblical, it is according to the Bible in a superficial way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To understand the Bible in this way is like skating on ice.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In studying the Bible, we need to cut a hole in the ice and dive to the bottom of the ocean to see what is there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is there that we will see the depths, the very intrinsic significance, of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The salvation of God is not a simple or a shallow matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's salvation is the Triune God becoming a man, living a human life for thirty-three and a half years, dying an all-inclusive, all-terminating, all-redeeming, and all-releasing death, and accomplishing an all-producing resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In such a condition and with such a situation, He ascended to the heavens to be made officially by God the Lord, the Christ, the Ruler of all the kings, and the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then He poured out Himself so that mankind could receive Him by calling on Him Acts 2:17-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many did receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Immediately He, as the all-inclusive, compound Spirit, the consummation of the Triune God, entered into everyone who received Him.</S>
