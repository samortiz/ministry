   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE NEW JERUSALEM BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CITY WITH FOUNDATIONS, WHOSE ARCHITECT AND BUILDER IS GOD AND FOR WHICH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS SUCH AS ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB EAGERLY WAITED</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we want to consider what the New Jerusalem is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The New Jerusalem is the city with foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God and for which the Old Testament saints such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob eagerly waited.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hebrews 11:10 tells us this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was the reason Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob lived in tents.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They did not desire to live in a city in their age because they eagerly waited for the city to come, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Hebrews 12:22 we are told that we, the New Testament believers, are coming forward to that heavenly city, the heavenly Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This shows us that there is something called the heavenly Jerusalem which is already in existence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some teach that today there is no New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible does not tell us that the New Jerusalem will come but that it will come down Rev 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was there already, but it will come down and be removed from heaven to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Architect is God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God designed it and built it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Of course, we know that God does not build it directly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He builds it first through Christ as the Head indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then Christ gave many gifts to His Body to perfect every member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then every member of the Body functions to do the direct building work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is God's building work in totality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Old Testament saints like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were waiting for this built-up city.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE JERUSALEM ABOVE, THE MOTHER</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Galatians 4:26 says that the Jerusalem above is the mother of the New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Jerusalem beneath on this earth is a sign of the one above, and the one above is our mother.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are the children of the Jerusalem above.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, before we came into existence, she was there as our mother.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before we were born, our mother existed already.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE HEAVENLY JERUSALEM,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE CITY OF THE LIVING GOD, TO WHICH</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE NEW TESTAMENT BELIEVERS COME FORWARD</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we have already mentioned, the New Testament believers come forward to something which is already in existence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They come forward to the heavenly Jerusalem, the city of the living God Heb 12:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This strongly proves that the New Jerusalem is now existing in the universe.</S>
