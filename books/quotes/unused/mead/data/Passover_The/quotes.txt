[1]  CONTENTS The Passover A Type of Christ How to Apply the Passover The Feast of Unleavened Bread
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE PASSOVER A TYPE OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Exo 12:1-10, 13, 23, 46b; 13:4; Luke 22:7-8, 14-15; John 19:33, 36; 1 Cor 5:7 A TYPE OF CHRIST
[3]  All Christians know that Christ is the Lamb of God who accomplished redemption for us John 1:29 .
[4]  However, not many have seen a clear picture of Christ as the redeeming Lamb of God.
[5]  John 1:29 says that Christ is the Lamb of God, and in 1 Corinthians 5:7 Paul speaks of Christ as the Passover.
[6]  Here Paul does not say that Christ is our lamb; he says that Christ is our Passover.
[7]  Anyone who does not have a sacred age as well as a civil age is not a genuine believer in Christ and cannot share in Christ as the Passover.
[8]  In 12:3 the children of Israel were commanded to "take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house."
[9]  The crucial point here is that the Passover lamb was not for every individual, but for every house.
[10]  If we would understand this verse, we must pay attention to three things: that a household could be too small for the lamb and would need to come together with another household; that the lamb was taken according to the number of souls; and that the count for the lamb was made according to the eating of every man.
[11]  Just as the Passover lamb was examined for four days 12:3, 6 , so Christ was examined for the same period of time.
[12]  After He was arrested, the Lord was subjected to six examinations, three at the hands of the priests who examined Him according to the law of God, and three under the Roman rulers, who tested Him according to Roman law.
[13]  In 12:8 the children of Israel were given the proper way to eat the flesh of the Passover lamb: roasted with fire.
[14]  When Christ was on the cross, the holy fire of God judged Him and consumed Him.
[15]  CHAPTER TWO HOW TO APPLY THE PASSOVER Scripture Reading: Exo 12:11-28, 46-51; 1 Cor 5:7-8; 1:30
[16]  Nowhere else in the Scriptures do we find such a detailed account of Christ's redemption The reason for all the details is that God wants us to know the redemption of Christ in such thorough way that we can never forget it.
[17]  This indicates that it is God's intention that we neither neglect the redemption of Christ nor forget it.
[18]  The fact that the blood of the Passover lamb was put on the lintel and the two side posts of the door implies that the blood opens the way for us to get into Christ, who is typified by the house.
[19]  A bunch of hyssop was used to put the blood of the lamb on the lintel and the doorposts.
[20]  All who believe in Christ were in the house at the time of their conversion.
[21]  This means that when they believed in Christ and were saved, they entered into the house.
[22]  The redemption of Christ is mysterious, beyond our understanding.
[23]  I believe that this is the reason the Passover in the Old Testament portrays all the elements, factors, and aspects of the redemption of Christ revealed in the New Testament.
[24]  If we had the plain words of the New Testament without the picture in the Old Testament, it would be difficult for us to see all the details of the wonderful and mysterious redemption of Christ.
[25]  We have seen that Christ is not only the Passover lamb, but also the unleavened bread, the bitter herbs, and the house.
[26]  The children of Israel were to observe the feast of unleavened bread as a continuation of the feast of Passover 12:15-20; 13:6-7 .
[27]  Exodus 12:18 says, "In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even."
[28]  We have pointed out that when the children of Israel ate the Passover lamb, they were also required to eat unleavened bread.
[29]  We received Christ not only in His death and resurrection, but also in His sinlessness, for His life is not only a crucified and resurrected life, but also a sinless life.
[30]  This means that from the time we received Christ and were saved and had a new beginning in life, we began to live a life without leaven, a life without sin.
[31]  Exodus 12:16 says, "And in the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you."
[32]  This verse says that on the first and last days of the feast of unleavened bread no manner of work was to be done.
[33]  Not to Be Eaten by Strangers or Hired Servants
[34]  Exodus 12:43 says, "This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof."
[35]  Although strangers and hired servants could not partake of the Passover, the purchased and circumcised servants were qualified to eat of it 12:44, 48 .
[36]  Exodus 12:51 concludes, "And it came to pass the self-same day, that Jehovah did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies" Heb .
