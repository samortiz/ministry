 <h2 class="head1">GOD COMING TO EARTH THROUGH MAN, AND<br />
MAN BEING JOINED TO GOD THROUGH THE LORD</h2>
<p>Verse 3 continues, &ldquo;So that where I am you also may be.&rdquo; What does <em>where</em> refer to? The Lord was not referring to heaven but to the Father. He would be in the Father, and we would also be in the Father. The word <em>where</em> does not refer to a place. It refers to being in the Lord and in God. The Lord&rsquo;s going through His death and resurrection was not to be in heaven but to be in the Father. When the Lord was resurrected, He entered into the Father, and He also brought His disciples into the Father. This is the meaning of <em>so that where I am you also may be.</em></p>
<p>In verse 4 the Lord continued, &ldquo;Where I am going you know the way.&rdquo; The disciples were not the only ones who did not know where the Lord was going. Many of us also do not know. However, the erroneous teaching of Catholicism says that the Lord went to heaven to prepare mansions for us. This concept is not in the Bible. We, therefore, should not have the thought of going to a heavenly mansion. In verse 5 Thomas said to the Lord, &ldquo;We do not know where You are going; how can we know the way?&rdquo; This verse shows that according to Thomas&rsquo;s understanding, the Lord was speaking of going to a place. The Lord&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;I am the way,&rdquo; shows that He was not referring to a place. The Lord said, &ldquo;I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me&rdquo; (v. 6). Because a literal translation of <em>no one comes to the Father</em> is not standard Chinese, the Chinese Union Bible translates the second half of this verse as: &ldquo;No one comes to the place where the Father is except through Me.&rdquo; As a result, people consider that <em>the place where the Father is</em> refers to heaven or a heavenly mansion.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>to the Father</em> in verse 6 refers to believing into God, into the Father. This verse does not refer to our going to heaven through the Lord Jesus, but rather to our being joined to God and contacting Him. No one can touch God or enter into God except through the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus is the way, the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Him. Hence, it is altogether not a matter of going to heaven. According to the teaching of the Brethren, this chapter speaks of going to heaven; however, this chapter speaks of believing into God, not of going to heaven. There is a picture of a heavenly mansion with a ladder that refers to Christ. The picture also has the inscription: &ldquo;No one comes to the Father except through the Lord.&rdquo; This implies that to go to the Father is to go to the heavenly mansion. This understanding is absolutely wrong. John 14:6 means that no one can enter into the Father except through Christ; no one can contact God except through Christ. Therefore, <em>where I am going</em> means that through His death and resurrection, the Lord was entering into the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO BE IN GOD BEING TO BE IN THE HEAVENLIES</h2>
<p>Our human thought always conflicts with the thought of God. Our mind always considers going to a place&mdash;heaven or hell&mdash;but God&rsquo;s thought is a person, not a place. We think about heaven and earth; God thinks about God and man. The focus of the Bible is the Lord Jesus&rsquo; entering into man, not His coming to the earth. The Lord Jesus&rsquo; becoming flesh and entering into man is His coming to the earth. Similarly, man enters into God; he does not go to heaven. If the Lord Jesus did not enter into man, He could not come to the earth. In order for the Lord Jesus to come to the earth, He had to enter into man. In other words, when the Lord Jesus entered into man, He came to the earth. Similarly, man goes to heaven by entering into God; when man enters into God, he is in heaven.</p>
<p>Our human concept is related to a place, whereas God&rsquo;s concept is related to a person. As long as God can enter into man, He can come to the earth; as long as man can enter into God, man can enter into heaven. The earth is related to man, and heaven is related to God. If the God of heaven came to the earth without entering into man, it would not be considered His coming to the earth. He had to enter into man for His coming to earth to be complete. Likewise, without entering into God, man cannot go to heaven. In order for man to go to heaven, he must enter into God. When man enters into God, he is in heaven. If we can grasp this thought, we will be able to understand the Bible.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:6 says, &ldquo;Seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; We can be seated together with Christ in the heavenlies because we are in Him. If we are not in Christ, we are on the earth, not in the heavenlies. However, because we are in Christ, we can sit with Him in the heavenlies. We may feel as if we are on the earth, but since we are in Him, we are in the heavenlies. We cannot be in heaven by being in ourselves; rather, we are in heaven by being in Christ. We need a change in our concept.</p>
