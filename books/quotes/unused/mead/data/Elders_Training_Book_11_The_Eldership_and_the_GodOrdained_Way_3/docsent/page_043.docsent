   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Learning How to Bring People</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Have a Personal Contact</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>with the Lord by Their Spirit Directly</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we must learn how to bring people to have a personal contact with the Lord by their spirit directly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the central, crucial point of our contact with people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must learn this skill and practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In doing anything, we firstly need a practical, particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then we need to exercise the proper skill.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must do things, not in a natural way but in an instructed, trained way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without the proper way and the skill to carry it out, we cannot do anything effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to learn the way and the skill.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Gospel of John, there are two illustrations of the Lord's skill in bringing people to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first is the case of Nicodemus in John 3.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nicodemus took the initiative to come to the Lord, and the Lord said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" John 3:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus pointed Nicodemus to the two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The second case is that of the Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Samaritan woman did not take the initiative to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, the Lord Jesus approached her, asking her to give Him a drink.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That led their talk to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jesus said, "God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality" John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus eventually showed the immoral woman the need to exercise her spirit to contact God as the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord used His skill to bring both Nicodemus and the Samaritan woman to contact God by their spirit, but He applied His skill in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By these two cases we can see that regardless of the way we talk to people, we must have the skill to bring them to contact God as the Spirit by their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One cannot be regenerated without contacting the Spirit directly by his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may know how to teach or instruct people, but we have not learned the way to enliven them in our contact with them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must be like electricians who know how to make the proper connections to bring the electricity directly to a person in need.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is crucial that we firstly change our way from bringing people to good speakers or meetings to contacting them personally.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should contact new ones and find new sources for gospel candidates.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should always have two or three under our care.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is also crucial that we learn to contact people again and again, waiting for a chance to enliven them, to "connect" them to the "electricity."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To have a personal contact with the Lord by one's spirit is to be enlivened by the life-giving Spirit in his or her spirit Eph 2:5 , to be regenerated in his or her spirit by the Spirit John 3:3, 5-6 , to receive the divine life, that is, the eternal life, into his or her spirit, and to learn to live by this life John 3:15; Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not bring people into Christianity or merely teach them doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to have the skill to use the top Bible verses to enliven people and help them to contact the Lord directly, either by a desperate prayer or a desperate confession of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we have this skill, we will realize how to touch the conscience of those like the Samaritan woman to make them desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We will know how to point out that even in their confession of sins, they must exercise their spirit to contact God as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will also know how to give them a verse such as John 3:15 and have a desperate talk with them about believing in the Lord Jesus and being connected to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is Spirit, and the Lord is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to learn how to help people to contact the Spirit by their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need a change in our way for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Otherwise, it will be difficult to have a strong church life.</S>
