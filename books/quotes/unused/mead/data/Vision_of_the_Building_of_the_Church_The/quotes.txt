[1]  The Vision of the Building of the Church CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE VISION IN THE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS
[3]  OF THE SCRIPTURES Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26-28; 2:7-12, 16, 18-24; Rev 21:2-3, 9-14, 18-19, 21-24; 22:1-5; 4:2-3
[4]  We worship God that we could have this conference to concentrate our attention on this one topic the building of the church.
[5]  If we carefully read the Word from the beginning to the end in the light of God, we will see that the building of the church is a great revelation shown throughout the Scriptures.
[6]  Therefore, I earnestly look to the Lord in His presence that He would bring us all up to a high mountain, a high place, and release every one of us from ourselves, bringing us out of our own experiences, learning, and past attainments and lifting us up to a new realm, an elevated sphere, that we have never reached before so that we would have a transcendent view of the glorious vision of God.
[7]  We have said that the entire Bible is required to prove and reveal this vision.
[8]  If we carefully read through the Scriptures from beginning to end and consider them in a good way before God, calming our spirit to look to God, then we will clearly see that the first two chapters of the Bible Gen 1 2 form one section and that the last two chapters Rev 21 22 also form one section.
[9]  Now we want to see how the first and last sections of the Bible correspond to one another.
[10]  Man Collectively Being the Image and Representative of God
[11]  First, God created man according to His image and gave man the authority to rule over the creatures that were in the air, on the earth, and in the water.
[12]  If you carefully read the Bible, you would see that Christ is the image of God.
[13]  Second, God formed man with the clay of the ground.
[14]  Fifth, wherever the river flows and waters, it produces pure gold, bdellium, and precious stone.
[15]  When we receive the Lord as the bread of life and as the living water, His life enters into us to flow and to water us, with the result that we have pure gold within.
[16]  When the Lord comes into us, He comes into us as our life to satisfy our hunger, to quench our thirst, and to flow in us, but at the same time He also brings the nature and substance of God into us.
[17]  Besides the matter of transformation, there is also the matter of building in Genesis 2.
[18]  CHAPTER TWO THE SCENE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM Scripture Reading: Rev 21:2-3, 9-14, 18-19, 21-24; 22:1-5; 4:3
[19]  We have clearly said that the first two chapters of the Bible describe a picture and that the last two chapters also describe a picture.
[20]  At the same time, this mystical man, having been joined to Christ and having Christ as the Head, has the authority that God committed to Christ and can therefore represent God on the earth to deal with the power of darkness and subdue all the forces that rebel against God.
[21]  In the fourth step, shown at the end of Genesis 2, the gold, pearl, and precious stones that were produced are collected and built together into a glorious counterpart.
[22]  After God enters into man and becomes his life, He moves and flows in man, causing man to have the element of gold, to be transformed into pearl and precious stone, and eventually to be built together into a corporate man as God s counterpart, having God s image to express God and having God s authority to represent God.
[23]  We must especially notice that the city of the New Jerusalem is not a matter of a place, because this city is actually the bride, the wife of the Lamb.
[24]  First, we have to see that in Genesis 2 the tree of life was outside the corporate great man.
[25]  If we have the insight, we will see that the Adam who stood in front of the tree of life on that day represented not only himself alone but also all of his descendants throughout the ages.
[26]  If there is quarreling, opinions, gossip, criticism, judging, and attacking in a local church, then you know that that church has lost the nature of building, since she has lost the throne of God and the authority of God.
[27]  In other words, God s intention as revealed in the Scriptures is to build a dwelling place for Himself and a Body for His Son, Christ.
[28]  In 1 Corinthians 3 the apostle Paul told the Corinthian believers that they were God s temple v. 16 and God s building v. 9b and that the apostles were God s fellow workers for God s building v. 9a . Moreover, he said, As a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it.
[29]  But let each man take heed how he builds upon it v. 10 . Are we building with wood, grass, and stubble or with gold, silver, and precious stones? In Ephesians 2 Paul says, So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, being built...into a holy temple in the Lord...into a dwelling place of God in spirit vv.
[30]  I often heard people talking about how Adam had sinned by eating the fruit that had been forbidden by God, but I never heard that the tree of life denotes God Himself and that God wants man to eat Him to receive Him as life.
[31]  Thank the Lord that over ten years after I was saved, I heard from a servant of God that the purpose of God is that He wants to enter into man to be man s life and that this is why after creating man He put man in front of the tree of life.
[32]  Let us now look at the story of God s building of the tabernacle in the Old Testament.
[33]  In the Old Testament we see that God chose some of the forefathers such as Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[34]  Then Jacob made a business deal with the Lord, saying, If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and garments to put on, so that I return to my father s house in peace, then Jehovah will be my God, and this stone, which I have set up as a pillar, will be God s house Gen 28:10-22 .
[35]  Now let us go back and look at some matters on the negative side.
[36]  Most readers of the Bible know that after God s purpose and the way to fulfill it were revealed in the first two chapters of Genesis, the serpent, who was the incarnation of Satan, appeared in chapter three.
[37]  If we have the light concerning building, we will see that the reason Satan wanted to ruin man and put man to death was that he wanted to frustrate God s building.
[38]  Now let us look at the building of the tabernacle.
[39]  After the children of Israel held the Passover, applied the blood of the lamb, ate the flesh of the lamb, left Egypt, crossed the Red Sea, were instructed by God at the foot of Mount Sinai, and received the pattern on the mountain, they rose up to build the tabernacle to be the dwelling place of God.
[40]  We have already briefly looked at the meaning of the altar.
[41]  If we want to be built by God into His dwelling place, then all we are, all we have, and all we can do must be judged before God.
[42]  Thank God that this judgment has already been accomplished on the cross of the Lord.
[43]  After we are redeemed by the Lord and consecrate ourselves to Him, the Holy Spirit as light continually shines on us, causing us to sense that we were wrong or defiled in certain matters or that we have sinned against God or are unable to present ourselves before God in other matters.
[44]  Let us look at the silver rods and the silver hooks of the pillars.
[45]  The meaning of the silver rods and the silver hooks being on the pillars which rested upon the bronze sockets is that whatever passes through God s judgment receives God s redemption.
[46]  Concerning the items within the tabernacle, we have to start from the Ark. The Ark is sometimes called the Ark of the Testimony, because hidden within it were the tablets of the covenant that God made with the children of Israel.
[47]  The law that was written on the tablets was on the one hand a covenant and on the other hand a testimony, the testimony of God.
[48]  We need to see that the Ten Commandments are not only the laws of God and the demands of God but also the explanation and revelation of God.
[49]  At this point, we need to realize that Christ is also our golden incense altar.
[50]  In Christ we can offer fragrant prayers to God and be acceptable to God.
[51]  Whenever we enjoy Him and are satisfied and enlightened within by enjoying Him as the bread of life and the light of life, then immediately we feel that we are in the presence of God and that between us and God there is a fragrant odor.
[52]  The boards were ten cubits in length and one and a half cubits in width.
[53]  In many instances, the basic numbers of God s building were the numbers three and five or multiples of these numbers.
[54]  Not only so, underneath each board were two tenons that were inserted into two sockets of silver.
[55]  Our concept is that it would be more convenient to have one tenon set against one socket, but God s thought is not like this.
[56]  At the same time, you must realize that the coordination and oneness of the church, the church s being built, and the church s being one are altogether in the pure gold, that is, in God.
[57]  I look to God to grant every brother and sister to see that we have to be built together with others so that God can have a dwelling place and that the way to be built is to know that each of us is only one and a half cubits, that each of us needs two tenons, and that each of us needs to be overlaid with gold and united through and in gold.
[58]  CHAPTER FIVE THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE Scripture Reading: 2 Chron 1:4-7, 13, 15; 3:4-5, 15; 1 Chron 22:4; 28:6; 29:1-9; 1 Kings 6:1-3, 7, 9, 21-22, 30-34; 2 Chron 3:1, 6-7; 5:2-7 THE TABERNACLE BEING
[59]  God placed the Ten Commandments inside the Ark. The Ark typifies Christ, and the Ten Commandments are the embodiment of God.
[60]  This is the fulfillment of the word at the end of Ephesians 3, which says, To God be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus v. 21 . Therefore, in the first step God had Christ as His vessel so that He could put Himself into Christ.
[61]  THE ISSUE OF THE BUILDING OF THE TABERNACLE God s Glory Being Manifested
[62]  Immediately after the tabernacle of God was completed and raised up, two things happened.
[63]  The first thing that happened was that the glory of God filled the tabernacle Exo 40:34-38 .
[64]  That was perhaps the first time in history that God s glory was physically manifested.
[65]  Beginning with Abraham s life of pitching tents and building altars, the Bible reveals that God s desire is for His people to build a place on the earth for them to worship Him.
[66]  We have to see that Christ is altogether a matter of mingling as symbolized by the Ark. The tabernacle and the temple were the enlargement of the Ark and were in the same principle, that is, the principle of the mingling of divinity with humanity.
[67]  Finally, we also must see that not only was the temple larger, more stable, and more weighty than the tabernacle, but the furniture in the temple was also made anew, and their dimensions were increased.
[68]  CHAPTER SIX FOUR SITUATIONS OF THE TABERNACLE Scripture Reading: 1 Chron 28:11-19; 22:5-10; 2 Kings 25:8-10; Ezra 1:1-7; Hag 1:2-11
[69]  After reading these messages, we should be able to clearly see that the problem in the universe today is not with Christ but with the church.
[70]  I would like to ask you all again whether or not it is all right to have only the Ark. It is not all right! David was a man after God s heart.
[71]  In Psalm 132 David swore and vowed to God, saying, I shall not go into the tent of my house; / I shall not go up onto the couch of my bed; / I shall not give sleep to my eyes, / Slumber to my eyelids; / Until I find a place for Jehovah, / A tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob vv.
[72]  Therefore, God told him that a son would be born to him and that his son would be a man of rest, and it was he who would build a house for God.
[73]  However, when God revealed the pattern of the temple to David, David not only saw the dimensions of the various furnishings, but he was also given their weights, such as the weights of the golden lampstands, the golden showbread tables, and the golden incense altar.
[74]  Please remember that the temple was built in peace.
[75]  BUILDING IN THE NEW TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: John 1:14; 2:19-22; Matt 16:15-19; Acts 9:31; Eph 2:20-22; Rev 1:20; 21:14 THE CENTER OF THE NEW TESTAMENT ALSO BEING THE TABERNACLE AND THE TEMPLE
[76]  In this message we want to continue to see the vision concerning the building of the church in the New Testament.
[77]  Both Paul and Peter tell us clearly in their Epistles that the church is the temple of God and the house built by God.
[78]  However, is it enough merely to have the Ark?
[79]  Therefore, after the Gospels is the book of Acts, which shows us that after this God-man resurrected from among the dead, He was transfigured into the Holy Spirit and entered into everyone who believed into Him.
[80]  In terms of typology, the four Gospels speak about the Ark, and Acts speaks about the tabernacle.
[81]  A thoughtful person would surely ask, Now that we have the Ark and also the tabernacle, that is, Christ and the church, what kind of people are the components of the church?
[82]  Chapter eight shows us that this man needs to live in the Holy Spirit and to walk according to the spirit that he may have life and peace, be pleasing to God, and eventually be conformed to the glorious image of God s Son.
[83]  Furthermore, in relation to the love of Christ, the church is the counterpart of Christ, in relation to God s warfare, the church is a warrior, and in relation to the nature of the church itself, the church is the new man.
[84]  Following Ephesians, Philippians shows us the practical living of those who are being built together in the church.
[85]  Because these ones know the resurrected Christ and His resurrection power, they live in His resurrection life, and by His resurrection power they fellowship in His sufferings and die with Him, being conformed to His death.
[86]  Following this, the book of Colossians tells us that when this kind of practical living is manifested in the church, then Christ immediately has the preeminence in everything in the believers in the church, and He fully manifests the authority and the riches of the Head.
[87]  The book of Hebrews shows us how to solve the problem of the Jewish religion.
[88]  Since Christ has already nullified Judaism, those who are in the church of Christ must not remain in the Jewish religion.
[89]  If you put together all the light in the Bible concerning the building of the church, you will clearly see that Christ was God who became flesh, passed through death, resurrection, and ascension, and in the Holy Spirit came into us, His believers, and regenerated us so that the Ark, which was made of wood overlaid with gold, the mingling of divinity and humanity, might be enlarged to be the tabernacle, the church.
[90]  May we as living stones be built together in the Spirit to become God s dwelling place in spirit, and may we be Christ s lampstands in this dark age in locality after locality so that the light of God in Christ as the lamp may shine forth from each locality until the appearance of the New Jerusalem.
[91]  OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 16:15-18; Eph 2:19-22; 3:17-21; 1 Pet 2:4-5; 1 Cor 3:9-12; Rom 12:3-6; Eph 4:11-12, 15-16; 1 Cor 14:4-5, 12
[92]  The picture at the beginning reveals the building materials that God wants to have, and the picture at the end reveals how God builds these precious materials into a tabernacle to be His dwelling place in the universe.
[93]  Every person who has been saved, who loves the Lord, who pursues after Him, and who has seen God s vision will have the clear realization that to properly be a Christian he must be built together with his fellow Christians.
[94]  Now that we have been saved, we need to take a further step to be built into the church.
[95]  To be built does not mean that we merely pursue the Lord, love the Lord, and are spiritual but that we also commit ourselves into the hand of the Lord, allowing Him to do the work of trimming and dealing in us so that we may become material fit for God s dwelling place.
[96]  At the Lord s table and on other occasions I have often heard the brothers and sisters thanking and praising God with the words of Ephesians 2:19, saying, O God, formerly we were strangers and sojourners, but we thank and praise You that now we are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God.
[97]  All of God s children need to see how much this matter of the building of the church is neglected among the children of God.
[98]  Although our spiritual condition is still immature and does not amount to much before God and men, when I see the work of God among His children in these days, I cannot but lift up my spirit and worship God.
[99]  We must continually see that God s desire is that we would be those who are being built.
[100]  THE BUILDING BEING THE YARDSTICK AND THE TEST FOR ALL SPIRITUAL MATTERS
[101]  Finally, I would like to seriously remind God s children that the building is the yardstick and the test for all spiritual matters.
[102]  We must use the building as a yardstick to test whether the spiritual condition of the brothers and sisters is proper or not.
[103]  God s eternal intention is to build for Himself a glorious dwelling place, a glorious church, among His saved ones through the life of His Son.
[104]  Therefore, all the work that God is doing upon us who have been saved is for us to be built together to become a spiritual house in which He can live.
[105]  In the Bible whether in the Old Testament concerning the tabernacle and the temple or the New Testament concerning the building of the church God first reveals His heart s desire to His people, showing them a spiritual vision that they might know that He wants to do something exceedingly glorious in the universe.
[106]  On the day of Pentecost when the Spirit of God descended and when the church was first begun on the earth, the condition of the church was truly glorious, like the condition of the temple at its beginning after the people of Israel had built it.
[107]  If we read church history, we will see that the goal of God s work on the earth is to recover His church.
[108]  If you have been paying attention to the matter of the church, particularly during the last thirty to forty years, you have seen that what God has been doing among His children is recovering in a strong way the matter of the church, not only in its spiritual aspect but also in its practical aspect.
[109]  CHAPTER TEN AUTHORITY, ORDER, AND BUILDING Scripture Reading: Rev 21:23; 1:20; Matt 18:15-20; Rom 12:3-11; Eph 4:11-13, 15-16
[110]  Thank the Lord that in His abundant grace He has led us to the last message of this series.
[111]  I felt within that I should lead us all to come before God to make a specific indication of our response, that is, to formally and solemnly commit ourselves into the Lord s hand in the church.
[112]  The cities and localities on the earth are full of darkness, but God as the light is in Christ, Christ as the lamp is in the church, and the church has become the lampstand shining forth the light, which is God in Christ.
[113]  We have pointed out many times that the great lampstand, the New Jerusalem, is the issue of God s work throughout the ages.
[114]  If none of us paid attention to the matter of the church, then what would we do after we were saved?
[115]  GOD S SUPPLY AND BLESSING BEING IN THE CHURCH
[116]  Even a person like me who speaks for God is dependent upon the supply of the saints.
[117]  We need to continue learning to be built together in the church in our locality by rejecting our own choices and tastes.
[118]  The Authority of Order Also Being in the Church
[119]  In the church there are not only elders who are God s deputy authorities, but there are also many older brothers and sisters who are authorities over us.
[120]  Suppose that the elders in a church decide to study the book of Romans together in the meetings, but a few of the brothers and sisters speak out against it and suggest studying Ephesians instead.
