Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah<br>Being Beauty and Glory<br>and as the Fruit of the Earth<br>Being Excellence and Splendor to Israel</H2><P>In the day of restoration, the God-man, Christ, as the divine Shoot of Jehovah, will be beauty and glory to Israel, and as the human seed of the earth will be excellence and splendor to them (4:2). In the coming restoration, the all-inclusive Christ will be the children of Israel's beauty and glory in His divinity and their excellence and splendor in His humanity that expresses the beauty and glory of His divinity. Then what the children of Israel will manifest and express will be the all-inclusive Christ Himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Mountain<br>of the House of Jehovah<br>Being Established on the Top of the Mountains<br>and Being Lifted Up among the Hills</H2><P>Isaiah 2:2 reveals that the mountain (signifying the kingdom of Israel) of the house of Jehovah will be established on the top of the mountains (signifying the kingdoms of the nations) and will be lifted up among the hills (signifying the kingdoms of the nations); and all the nations (the Gentiles) will stream to the mountain&#151;the kingdom of Israel. This indicates that the nation of Israel will be foremost among the nations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. From Zion Going Forth Instruction,<br>and the Word of Jehovah from Jerusalem</H2><P>Many peoples will come and say, "Come and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah,/To the house of the God of Jacob,/That He may instruct us in His ways,/And that we may walk in His paths./For from Zion will go forth instruction, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem" (2:3). This indicates that all the earth will be under the teaching of Israel.</P><P>According to Zechariah 8:20-23, among Israel there will be the priesthood. This means that during the millennium, the thousand-year kingdom, restored Israel will be priests. Actually, in the millennium the priesthood will have both an earthly part and a heavenly part. Those of the restored nation of Israel will be the priests in the earthly part, and the overcoming believers in Christ will be the priests in the heavenly part. By this priesthood all the peoples will be taught and instructed.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> </body></html>
