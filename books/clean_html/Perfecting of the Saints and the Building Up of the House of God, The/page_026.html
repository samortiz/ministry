<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE SITUATION IN SOUTH AMERICA</h2>
<p>I initially planned to visit South America, but because of time constraints I was not able to go there. Even though I did not go to South America, I received information concerning the situation there. The saints in South America want some saints to migrate there. If any of the workers have a burden, there is a need.</p>
<p>There is a need for some workers to go to Brazil and live in S&#227;o Paolo to propagate the Lord&rsquo;s work. A report in <em>Church News</em> says that one of the brothers there has a meeting in his home, and about thirty or forty Christians from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Manila have attended this meeting. They do not have a meeting that is only for the overseas Chinese. A worker or a strong brother who moves there and begins a meeting will meet the need. The gospel can then gradually spread from the overseas Chinese saints to the Brazilians.</p>
<p>In Brazil there is freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of press. Even though many countries in South America are Catholic, they cooperate with Protestant countries who send missionaries to them. The strongest Protestant meeting in Brazil has a large gathering and is led by Westerners, not Brazilians. Therefore, Brazil is a large field for the Lord&rsquo;s work. Some of the Chinese there are from Taiwan and Hong Kong. If we labor among them, we can spread the work even to the Japanese people. There are seven to eight hundred thousand Japanese immigrants there, and their number is increasing by thirty to forty thousand every year. The Japanese people in Brazil are also a good field.</p>
<p>We stayed in America until the end of July and left there on July 31.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISIT TO EUROPE</h2>
<p>We arrived in London on August 1 and immediately held a conference. After the conference we went to Denmark for another conference.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Special Work by the Holy Spirit in Denmark</h2>
<p>Every summer there is a conference in Denmark with an attendance of seven hundred to a thousand believers. This year the attendance was higher. Most of the believers who attended are from state churches. However, a number of them are under the leading of a Western brother and have had a solid spiritual background. They do not hold the concept of a state church.</p>
<p>About forty believers who were in the congregation are more enlightened. They came from Norway, Sweden, and other countries. Because the believers were from many countries, the messages were translated into Danish on the podium and then translated into English and German in the audience. There were three meetings a day in the conference: in the morning, afternoon, and evening. However, due to the work of the Holy Spirit, all the saints focused on the meetings in the afternoon. The meetings in the morning and evening were mainly miscellaneous fellowships. The meetings in the afternoon emphasized God in Christ as life for the building of His house, His temple, and the Body of Christ. These messages stressed life and the building up of the church. These two points had an impact on the saints and stirred them up.</p>
<p>During the conference all the fellowship was on how to enjoy Christ as life and how to build up the church in every place, and most of the questions were concerning the church. This was the work of the Holy Spirit. The saints wanted to know what they should do after the conference and where they should meet. Instead of saying what they should do, I advised them to pray and follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading, just as Abraham left Ur of the Chaldeans and went to the place that the Lord called him to.</p>
<p>After the conference the leading brothers requested that we stay for two more days to fellowship with several leading brothers and sisters. That time of fellowship was a crucial turning point, and we saw a special work of the Holy Spirit. There were no debates. All the fellowship was about the practical way to go on. The Holy Spirit was working in many of the saints before the conference; therefore, after we arrived, they spoke about only the practice. We shared our experience with them, and they treasured every point. The saints had never heard what we fellowshipped and fully accepted what we said. After that, we returned to Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark.</p>
<p>In Copenhagen the leading brothers requested that we spend one evening to fellowship with some brothers who desire to pursue the Lord and another evening to fellowship with the young saints. There were close to two hundred young saints who truly pursue the Lord. The brothers requested that I speak to the young saints concerning how to coordinate in service. The young saints do not have their own meeting, but they want to begin a meeting, and they also want to learn to coordinate in service. My fellowship with them covered many aspects of how to coordinate and serve together.</p>
<p>Shortly after we left, the saints in Copenhagen began to meet in twenty-one homes. I heard that they have a good situation. Many of them love the Lord and are good material with much potential. Most of the saints are middle-aged. There are not many older saints.</p>
<p>We stayed in Denmark for about ten days and saw that there is much work to do there. Their situation exceeded our expectation. This proves that the Holy Spirit began His work long before we arrived. This does not apply only to Denmark. The Lord&rsquo;s work can be seen in all of Scandinavia, including Norway and Sweden. We met many promising brothers who requested that we send them <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> so that they can translate it into their language. If time permits, we will visit them again, because there is much work to do there.</p>
<p>Two brothers from Norway came to meet us, and we had good fellowship with them. The impression I have from the trip to Denmark is that all the places in Scandinavia need to be led to know Christ as life so that God&rsquo;s house can be built up in every locality. The Scandinavian countries have state churches that are formal and dead. Hence, many people become &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; once they believe into Christ. There is a need for them to know life so that God&rsquo;s house can be established in every locality.</p>
<p>After our fellowship in Denmark, we returned to London and stayed there for ten days. We had good fellowship in London also. The brothers and sisters felt that the messages met their need. There is much that can come out of the situation there.</p>
