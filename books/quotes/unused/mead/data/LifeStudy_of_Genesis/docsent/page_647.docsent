   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Although I may have no intention of putting you in a dungeon and although you may have no intention of putting me in a dungeon, what actually happens is that we put one another into a dungeon.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When you were married, did you intend to put your wife into a dungeon?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Surely you had no such intention.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But this is just what you have done.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Unintentionally and unconsciously, we put others into a dungeon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My children have done this to me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes they tell me how much they love me, but within myself I say, "Your love puts me into a dungeon."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, we need to say, "Hallelujah for the dungeon!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although I have been here for ten years, I need to stay another two years."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Again I say, do not drop out of the dungeon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Stay there and stay there gloriously, with praises to the Lord, not with the gnashing of teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Madame Guyon was one who could praise the Lord in her dungeon.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>She even wrote a poem in which she likened herself to a bird in a cage.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here is the first stanza:</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A little bird I am,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Shut from the fields of air,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And in my cage I sit and sing</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To Him who placed me there;</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Well pleased a prisoner to be,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because, my God, it pleaseth Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Madame Guyon grew to love her cage, which was her dungeon.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If Joseph had not stayed in the dungeon for twelve years, he would not have been qualified to rule over the land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this, he had to be thirty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those twelve years in the dungeon accomplished a great deal for him, not through objective education, but through subjective suffering and discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Be patient; eventually you will be qualified to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But in order to be qualified, you need to stay in the dungeon for another period of time.</S>
