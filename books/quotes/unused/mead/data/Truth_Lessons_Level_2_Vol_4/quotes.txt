[2]  That we may live by Him by eating Him as the bread of life.
[3]  Christ lives in us that we may live with Him, enabling us to walk in Him.
[4]  In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, "It is Christ who lives in me," and in Philippians 1:21 he said, "To me, to live is Christ."
[5]  This indicates that Christ lives in us in order that we may live Him.
[6]  When we experience and enjoy Christ as the Son in the grace of the Triune God, we not only enjoy Him as our portion but also experience His living in us.
[7]  Christ lives in us that we may have one life and one living with Him.
[8]  That We May Count All Things as Loss and Refuse in order to Gain Christ
[9]  Christ's living in us also causes us to be conformed to His death.
[10]  When we experience and enjoy Christ's living in us, we are enabled to boast and exult not in our outward behavior, actions, or doings but in the Christ who lives in us.
[11]  Christ's living in us also enables us to be found in Him, who has become the realm in which we live and our unique expression.
[12]  LESSON THIRTY-NINE THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST AS THE SON IN THE GRACE OF THE TRIUNE GOD 10 OUTLINE Living in us: That we may be able to do all things in Him who empowers us.
[13]  That we may have Him making His home in our hearts.
[14]  That we may be rooted and grounded in love.
[15]  Ephesians 3:17a speaks of Christ's making His home in our hearts.
[16]  That We May Be Filled unto All the Fullness of God
[17]  When Christ makes His home in our hearts so that we, being rooted and grounded in love, are able to apprehend with all the saints the dimensions of Christ and to know by experience His knowledge-surpassing love, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God, which is the church, the corporate expression of God for the fulfillment of His heart's desire.
[18]  Working in us, on us, and for us: Freeing us by His law of life from the law of sin and of death.
[19]  The love of God is the source, since God is the origin; the grace of the Lord is the course of the love of God, since the Lord is the expression of God; and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the impartation of the grace of the Lord with the love of God, since the Spirit is the transmission of the Lord with God, for our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, with Their divine virtues.
[20]  This clearly shows us that when the Holy Spirit comes, Christ comes; that when the Holy Spirit is in us, Christ is in us; and that the Spirit who indwells us is the Christ who died and was resurrected and who comes to abide in us.
[21]  Not only so, the Spirit is the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , who is Christ Himself as life imparted into us, the tripartite men; the Spirit of grace Heb 10:29 , the Triune God in the Son becoming the Spirit for our enjoyment; the Spirit of reality John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 4:6 as the reality of God, the Father, the Son, the Lord, sonship, life, grace, and every divine thing; the Comforter John 14:16 , the Spirit of reality, as our Advocate taking care of our case; and the Spirit of power Luke 24:49; Acts 1:8 poured upon us for our ministry and move that we may carry out the Lord's commission.
[22]  In the initial stage of God's full salvation, the stage of regeneration, we experienced the sanctification of the Spirit and thus repented unto God.
[23]  Moreover, when we repented and believed in the Lord, the Spirit brought God's life into us, causing us to be regenerated and enabling us to experience the Spirit's renewing work in us.
[24]  In the progressing stage, as we further experience and enjoy the Spirit as the reality of Christ, the Spirit works in us, on us, and for us in many ways.
[25]  By His working in us, the Spirit continuously dispenses life to our mortal bodies.
[26]  This verse reveals that as the life-giving Spirit dwells in us, that is, makes His home in us, He dispenses life not only into our spirits but even into our mortal bodies.
[27]  Leading us to live a life as sons of God.
[28]  Romans 8:14 says, "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God."
[29]  The Spirit also works in us to transform us.
[30]  Second Corinthians 3:18 says, "We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."
[31]  The Spirit works in us to supply us with His bountiful supply.
[32]  In this bountiful supply are the rich items such as the Lord's divinity, His humanity, His human living, His death and its effectiveness, and His resurrection and its power.
[33]  The bountiful supply of the Spirit is upon the Body of Christ.
[34]  The Spirit not only indwells us but also fills us inwardly.
[35]  Searching All Things and Revealing to Us Christ as the Depths of God
[36]  First Corinthians 2:10 says, "But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God."
[37]  God in His wisdom that is, in Christ has ordained and prepared for us many deep and hidden things, such as justification, sanctification, and glorification.
[38]  The Spirit as the means by which we know that God abides in us and we in Him is the element and sphere of the mutual abiding of us and God that we may be assured that we and God are one, that we abide in each other, indwelling each other mutually.
[39]  The Spirit in us also fills us essentially to dispense the Divine Trinity into us for our existence and living.
[40]  When we are persecuted, the Spirit within us also teaches us how to answer our persecutors.
[41]  Romans 15:13 says, "Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit."
[42]  The Spirit not only brings us joy but also empowers us that we may abound in hope.
[43]  The Spirit in us is for us to live and walk by Him.
[44]  Longing within Us to Envy for God against Worldliness
[45]  Romans 8:26b says, "We do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered."
[46]  When we are weak, unable to pray, the Spirit comes in to strengthen us.
[47]  Confessing to Us That Christ Came in the Flesh
[48]  The Spirit works in us to confess to us that Christ came in the flesh.
[49]  First John 4:2 says, "In this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God."
[50]  Witnessing with our spirit that we are the children of God.
[51]  The Spirit not only witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God but also cries with our spirit, "Abba, Father!"
[52]  Galatians 4:6 says, "Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!"
[53]  After 2 Corinthians 1:21 says that God has anointed us, verse 22 goes on to say that God has sealed us.
[54]  Being the Access for Us to Draw Near to the Triune God
[55]  The Spirit is also the access for us to draw near to the Triune God.
[56]  Ephesians 2:18 says, "Through Him Christ we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father."
[57]  In Ephesians 4, concerning the living and responsibility needed for the church life, Paul said, "Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace" v. 3 . This shows us that to have the proper Body life, we first need to care for the oneness.
[58]  Philippians 3:3 says, "We are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh."
[59]  Here we see that the Spirit is the means for us to serve, to worship, God.
[60]  Matthew 28:19 says, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
[61]  After Christ completed His ministry on earth, went through the process of death and resurrection, and became the life-giving Spirit, He charged the disciples to baptize those who were to become His disciples into the name of the Triune God.
[62]  Being the element for us to be the sufficient ministers of the new covenant.
[63]  Here, to receive power is to be baptized in the Holy Spirit v. 5 for the fulfillment of the promise of the Father v. 4; Luke 24:49 . Having the Holy Spirit upon us is different from having the Holy Spirit in us John 14:17 . The Holy Spirit was breathed into the disciples on the day of the Lord's resurrection John 20:22 to be the Spirit of life essentially.
[64]  After the Spirit descended upon the believers, He filled them outwardly.
[65]  On the day of Pentecost the Spirit gave the believers the utterance to speak in different tongues.
[66]  Acts 2:3 and 4 say, "There appeared to them tongues as of fire, which were distributed; and it sat on each one of them; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues, even as the Spirit gave to them to speak forth."
[67]  As the Means for Us to Speak for Christ
[68]  "I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit" v. 3 . Paul's thought was that the dumb, voiceless idols in verse 2 make their worshippers dumb and voiceless.
[69]  The Spirit works on the believers inwardly and outwardly as the means for them to predict something.
[70]  Guiding Us by Forbidding Us and Not Allowing Us
[71]  The Spirit works in us to guide us sometimes also by forbidding us and not allowing us.
[72]  Acts 16:6 says, "They passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia."
[73]  Manifesting Himself in Each One of the Members of the Body of Christ through Different Gifts
[74]  First Corinthians 12:7 says, "To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for what is profitable."
[75]  All the different gifts are the manifestation of the Spirit in that the Spirit is manifested in the believers who have received the gifts.
[76]  The Spirit speaks not only to the churches but also with the churches.
