   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INTERCESSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all know that intercession is a very crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We often have time for intercession but do not have the inspiration of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We do not know what we should pray for.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This does not mean that we do not need to intercede and can vainly spend our time for other purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, it means that we should use our mind to intercede, hoping to stimulate the collaboration of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, at this moment we should exercise our mind to consider whether our friends, family, and co-workers have any need.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we think of a need, we should intercede for it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the spirit within us still remains cold, we should realize that He does not want us to pray for that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It may occur to us that the church in our locality has some deficiencies, that the churches in all the localities are in the midst of some temptation, that the Lord's work in certain areas is hindered, or that God's children have a need of some particular truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once we think of a certain item, we should intercede for it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If our spirit still does not respond after a while, and we are still praying with our mind, we should realize that the Lord does not want us to pray for this matter either.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there is the anointing of the Holy Spirit as we are praying for another matter and the sense of our spirit also responds, we should know that we have touched and prayed for the appropriate item.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The principle that we should use is of the mind assisting the spirit to locate its inclination.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sometimes we only need to use our mind to consider a little, and the spirit responds; sometimes, however, we have to wait for a while before the spirit agrees with us, because our mind is too narrow, and we may not quickly realize through the spirit what the Holy Spirit delights in. Sometimes God desires to enlarge the scope of our prayers; He desires us to pray for the nation so that all of Satan's work behind the scenes will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He may want us to pray for all the sinners in the world or for the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If our mind is only set on the present, it will take some time before these things occur to us and for us to arrive at the prayer in which the Holy Spirit is in one accord with the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After we have obtained the cooperation of the sense of the spirit, we should pour out all the burdens of the spirit for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should pray for the various aspects of this matter in a detailed and adequate way until our spirit is unloaded.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we can continue to intercede for other items.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is one of the principles in our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whatever new prayers God gives to us, we obtain them in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But after a period of time, we cannot expect God to fill our spirit with this new prayer again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to continue praying with our mind, regardless of our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually we will obtain this prayer again in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>KNOWING THE WILL OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We already know that God's leadings are not always "direct"; rather, some are "indirect."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In His direct leading, God's Spirit moves in our spirit so that we may know His will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We only need to pay attention to the motion in our spirit to know the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, of all that we should do in our lifetime, not everything will be directly told to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are many needs which we see.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What should we do concerning them?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, we may be invited to a place to work, or something else may suddenly happen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not initiated directly from the spirit, but it reaches us through others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our mind may realize the importance of solving this matter, but our spirit may not be responsive.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What should we do to obtain God's leading?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After something happens, we should ask God to lead us in the spirit; this is called indirect leading.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the time for the mind to assist the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When there is no stirring in his spirit, a believer should use his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the spirit continuously uttered its intention, it would not be necessary for the mind to assist the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since, however, the spirit is sometimes silent, the mind has to fill the position of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At such a time, the believer should use his mind to consider and ponder his doubts and difficulties before God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although his prayer, consideration, and pondering all issue from his mind, after a while, the believer will see that his spirit also joins into his prayer, consideration, and pondering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When he senses the spirit, which was previously silent, the Holy Spirit will lead him in the spirit before too long.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this way we can use our mind to assist the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not think that something should not be done because the spirit does not move; rather, we should "draw up" our spirit with our mind to make it alive, and let it resolve whether the matter is according to God's will.</S>
