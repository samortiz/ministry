<P>What is emphasized in Luke is the holy city; what is emphasized in Matthew is the temple. Luke 21:20 says, "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that her desolation has drawn near." The question in Luke concerns the signs before the destruction of the temple. The question in Matthew concerns the signs before the consummation of the age.</P><P>Luke does not mention the false Christs, whereas Mark and Matthew both mention them. This may be because it was already mentioned in Luke 17. Mark and Luke are generally the same because these two Gospels are the same concerning the first question. Although the temple has already been destroyed once, there will be still be another destruction in the future.</P><P>The special point of Matthew is the parousia, the second question. The disciples asked well, "What will be the sign of Your coming and of the consummation of the age?" The parousia and the consummation of the age are put together. This shows that the disciples had a certain amount of understanding already. Mark and Luke do not emphasize the parousia. This is why they do not have parables such as Noah, the master of the house, the slaves, the virgins, and the giving of the talents. All these five parables have to do with the parousia.</P><P>There is one more similarity among all three Gospels: they all refer to the church and the Jews. Mark 13:5-27 refers to the Jews, and verses 28-37, to the church; Luke 21:8-28 refers to the Jews, and verses 29-36, to the church.</P><P>With regard to the third question, the question concerning the end, Mark and Luke seem to be different from Matthew. This is because "the consummation of the age" is related to both the Jews and the church. Matthew 24:20 says to pray that the flight not be in the winter, nor on a Sabbath. This applies to the Jews. Luke 21:36 exhorts us to pray that we may escape the things that are about to happen, and such an exhortation is moral in nature. The exhortations in the two books are different. One is to the Jews, and the other is to the church. Neither Mark nor Luke mention the promise of Noah, because the disciples did not ask about the things of the parousia, the rapture.</P><P>In the second section of Matthew 24, there are two signs: (1) Noah, concerning the sign of the parousia, and (2) the fig tree, concerning the sign of the consummation of the age. The parable of the sheep and the goats also is not in Mark and Luke because that too has to do with the consummation of the age. It is right that this parable should not be in Mark and Luke because what is spoken in Mark and Luke concerns the things that are near the end; they do not concerns the things at the very end of the age. The sheep and the goats refer to the things at the very end.</P><P>Concerning the parousia there are two signs: the sign of the celestial phenomena and the sign of the days of Noah. Concerning the rapture, one will be taken and one will be left behind. One sign of the end of the age is the gospel being preached throughout the earth. However, this does not mean that all will repent and be saved; it merely means that all will have the opportunity to hear the gospel. The fig tree must not be interpreted literally, because this is a parable. It refers to the reestablishing of the Jewish nation and its religion. The budding refers to its being revitalized. Recently one hundred twenty thousand Jews returned to Palestine as a result of Hitler's oppression. There has been no "rain" there for two thousand years. But now it is raining.</P><P>The temple is related only to the Jews. Hence, it is mentioned only in the first section. The consummation of the age is related to both the church and the Jews. The parousia is related only to the church.</P><P>Verses 4-6 belong to the first section, because the end of the age has not yet come.</P><P>Verse 4:"And Jesus answered and said to them, See that no one leads you astray." The disciples asked about the destruction of the temple. This was the question they were concerned about. In answering them the Lord first warned that they should take heed that they not be deceived. Our purpose in studying prophecy is that we can take heed and not be deceived. But regrettably, many believers do not pay attention to prophecies. As a result, many mistakes are made. Prophecy is like a lamp shining in a dark place (2 Pet. 1:19). To not be led astray means to be able to discern; it means to consider right as right and wrong as wrong.</P><P>Verses 5-6:"For many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ, and they will lead many astray. And you will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for it must happen; but the end is not yet." "They will lead many astray." Who will lead them astray? (1) The false Christs. In his book, Josephus (a Jewish historian) described the false Christs as impostors who exhorted people to go to the wilderness, and who pretended that they could perform miracles by God's arrangement. The false Christs deceived the Jews because the Jews rejected Christ. (2) "Wars and rumors of war." After the Lord's death, there were many rumors of war. "See that you are not alarmed...but the end is not yet." The disciples asked when the temple would be destroyed, and the Lord answered by two signs, the false Christs and the wars. But do not misunderstand this to be the end of the age. When the two signs are fulfilled, the temple will be destroyed. But "see that you are not alarmed, for it must happen; but the end is not yet." (In all the books of the prophets, except Daniel, we have no prophecy concerning the things of Titus. The destruction of the holy place by Titus is merely a symbol of the future destruction.)</P><P>Verses 7 through 14 form the second section; it is in the process of being fulfilled. Verses 7 through 31 refer to both Jews and believers; however, it is very much related to Christians. After the first rapture God gradually becomes more favorable to the Jews and gradually departs from the Gentiles. At the beginning God's dropping the Jews was gradual and was not sudden. For example, Paul's preaching gradually shifted from the Jews to the Gentiles. In the future, after the first rapture, the Jews will gradually be more and more favored, while the church will gradually lose her position. At that time the believers should stand in the position of the Jews. This is just like salvation for the Jews today: to be saved, they should stand in the Gentiles' position. The believers who will be left on the earth will have to learn how to flee according to the way of Matthew 24.</P>
