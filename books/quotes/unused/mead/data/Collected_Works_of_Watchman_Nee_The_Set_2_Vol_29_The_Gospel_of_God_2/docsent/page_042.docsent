   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING THE THINGS DONE THROUGH THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us read 2 Corinthians 5:10.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All Bible readers know that the judgment seat of Christ is in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, those standing before the judgment seat are those who have been raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And who can be raptured?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible tells us that only Christians can be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who are not Christians cannot be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a man is not saved and is not a child of God, he is not even qualified to be judged at this judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is God's judgment within His own family.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here it tells us what we will be faced with at the future judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We will be recompensed for the things done through the body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, we will be recompensed for the things done in the body, that is, for the things we have done while living on earth, whether good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you do good in the body, you will receive a good reward.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you do evil in the body, you will receive the recompense of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Word of God shows us clearly that at the judgment seat those who do well will receive a reward and that those who do not do well will lose their reward and will be recompensed according to their evil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because there is a future judgment, the apostle Paul prayed concerning mercy in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second Timothy 1:18 says, "May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And in how many things he served me in Ephesus, you know best."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul expressed the wish that Onesiphorus would find mercy from the Lord in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a Christian will at most lose his reward in the future when he stands before the judgment seat and will not be punished or disciplined, then this word is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul hoped that the Lord would be merciful to Onesiphorus at His judgment, because Onesiphorus had helped Paul so much and had propagated the gospel with him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If there were any wrongs that Onesiphorus had done, Paul hoped that the Lord would be merciful to him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, we see that Christians need not only forgiveness, but also God's mercy at the time of judgment at the beginning of the millennium; otherwise, they will fall under God's chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 2 Timothy 4 there is another verse which we should read.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 16 says, "At my first defense no one was with me to support me, but all abandoned me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>May it not be counted against them."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is another prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While Paul was in Asia, the whole of Asia abandoned him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While he was before the king being judged, many Christians were fearful of death and hid off to the side.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet even though they had abandoned him, Paul prayed that this sin would not be counted against them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, we see that in the future God will still judge our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul prayed here that this sin would not be counted against them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is enough light in the Bible to show us that if a saved person is not disciplined for his loose conduct in this age, or if he does not repent after discipline, he will not only lose his reward but will also be chastised in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Matthew 12 the Lord Jesus specifically mentions blaspheming the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All sins can be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the words spoken against the Son of Man can be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the sin of blaspheming the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There will not be forgiveness in this age, and there will not be forgiveness in the next age v. 32 . In the Bible the coming age always refers to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the original language the word for age is aion, not cosmos.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the word were cosmos, it would refer to the organization of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But since it is aion, it refers to a time span.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, it is translated age.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today is the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The next age is the age when the Lord will come to reign for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you read Matthew 12, you see that the forgiveness of sins is divided into two time periods.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some sins are forgiven in this age, and some sins are forgiven in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some people, through discipline, are forgiven in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some people may not have done well today, but they will be forgiven in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some people are forgiven when they are saved, but their subsequent sins will not be forgiven in the kingdom; they will be chastised severely instead.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the biblical teaching concerning chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Chastisement for the Christian in this age is clear enough.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some sinning Christians whose problems are not solved before God today will receive chastisement in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>THE KINGDOM BEING</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>THE TIME OF THE FUTURE CHASTISEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When exactly will the future chastisement be?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is clear that there will be chastisement in the future after the Lord comes back, but when after the Lord's return will it be?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let us consider three ages in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The present age can be called the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It can also be called the age of the gospel or the age of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The coming age can be called the age of the kingdom or the millennial age, because that age will only last a thousand years Rev 20:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After that age, there is yet another age, which is an eternal age.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is the age of the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Bible presents to us these three ages.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The age of the church is the age of grace because God's grace and love are manifested in it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this age God saves the unrighteous ones and causes man to receive the grace of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Everything in this age is of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The coming age is the age of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The eternal age is also an age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today is an age of grace, and the new heaven and new earth is also an age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But the kingdom is all righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you are not clear about these ages, your reading of the Bible, theology, and biblical understanding will be all wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Both the church age and the age of the new heaven and new earth are ages of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But the millennial age is a parenthetical age specially prepared by God for the reward of the faithful ones and the chastisement of the sinful ones.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>That is a special period.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Both the New Testament and the Old Testament tell us that in this period, God deals with man in righteousness Psa 72:2; 85:10-13; 96:13; 97:2; Isa 11:5; 26:9; 33:5; 62:1; Jer 33:15; Dan 7:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We can quote at least two hundred verses from the Old and New Testaments concerning the righteous judgment in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What is the difference between the kingdom and the new heaven and new earth?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Bible makes a clear distinction between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Let us consider Revelation 19:6-8.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>"And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Please notice that here is the beginning of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>"Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Here we read that fine linen is given to the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But though it is given, it is nevertheless of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The fine linen is the righteousness in the actions of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In the original language, the righteousnesses mentioned here refer to righteousness in actions.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The word has the sense of actions.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Hence, it refers to our own righteous acts.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Now let us read 20:4-6.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>"And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and of those who had not worshipped the beast nor his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were completed.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is the first resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years."</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>These verses tell us who will be the kings who reign with Christ a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The kingdom is not for everybody.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The kingdom is only for the martyrs.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>It is only for those who reject Satan and Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Only these ones can reign for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Hence, only the martyrs can reign; only those who reject Satan and Antichrist will be kings.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This proves to us that the millennial kingdom is not given as a free gift, but is obtained through good works before God.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Although in other passages we see other kinds of people reigning, in Revelation we see that there must be specific righteousness before there can be participation in the marriage feast of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Only those who are the martyrs can be the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Without having the particular righteousness and without being martyred, no one can have a part in the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is the millennium.</S>
