When we practiced the church life in mainland China before 1949, we had only home meetings, not group meetings
When the Lord brought us to Taiwan, we realized that just to have the home meetings was insufficient, so we began to have group meetings
Some in Korea in 1958 followed us to have this practice, but instead of using the word groups, they used the word cells
In the United States we adopted the practice of the groups, but the groups have entered into a dormant situation
The scriptural base for our teaching concerning the practice of the vital group meetings is in Matthew 18:15-22 and 2 Timothy 2:22
We need to read and consider prayerfully the Lord's speaking in Matthew 18:15-22, which reveals how we can live the kingdom life
Verses 15 through 17 say, 'Moreover if your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone
If he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
Verse 17 is so low, saying that we should let the sinning one who will not listen to the church be to us like a Gentile and a tax collector
Many times we feel that a certain saint is a hopeless case, and we stop with this feeling toward him in our small groups
We have to bind the binding one, Satan, and we have to release the sinning one, the one bound by Satan, through our prayer in harmony
When a piano is played properly, the many keys on the piano are struck in such a way so as to produce harmonious music
If we have a spirit to forgive a sinning one up to four hundred ninety times, surely that one will be recovered
When we become aware of someone sinning or of someone sinning against us, we should not talk to others but to the person directly
Paul in 1 Corinthians 5 rebuked the Corinthian believers and charged them to remove a wicked one from their midst
Paul did not have the peace when this sinful one was removed, so he still did something to take care of the situation
In summary, what is covered in Matthew 18:15-22 unveils to us how to take care of a sinning brother in a vital group
If he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
Such a situation is dealt with by the vital group in harmony with the Lord in their midst with a forgiving spirit
Timothy 222 says But flee youthful lusts and pursue righteousness faith love peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart
The kingdom is a matter of righteousness , and according to the Epistles, this surpassing righteousness is Christ Himself lived out from us
Also, when we come to God, we must believe that God is and we are not and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him diligently
To pursue peace is to take care of God's peace in producing the church for our relationship with others in the church
The end of this Epistle on how to deal with the degradation of the church is that we must enjoy Christ in our spirit as our abiding grace
In this message we will cover the first three categories: the believers in Christ, the disciples of Christ, and the witnesses of Christ
In the next message we will fellowship concerning the members of Christ, the brothers of Christ, and the prophets of God
We may feel that the believers in Christ is a common term, but actually we do not fully realize what a believer is
Vital groups are composed of people in the new creation who speak about the new creation, not about the old creation
Many Christians today do not realize that Christ is the life-giving Spirit and that we are joined to Christ to be one spirit
They followed the Lord and stayed with Him day and night, traveling with Him, eating with Him, and doing everything with Him
He was a divine and mystical person living in the divine and mystical realm, doing everything in a divine and mystical way
If we are working in an office, those around us should have the feeling that there is something extraordinary about us
We're Thy total reproduction, Thy dear Body and Thy Bride, Thine expression and Thy fullness, For Thee ever to abide
We are Thy continuation, Thy life-increase and Thy spread, Thy full growth and Thy rich surplus, One with Thee, our glorious Head
The disciples who followed the Lord for three and a half years saw what He did, how He behaved, and how He spoke
The concept of the disciples was revolutionized by what they saw of the Lord Jesus living God by denying Himself in His humanity
Christ had the human life and nature, but He lived the divine life and nature through the denying of His human life and nature
The resurrected Christ was made by God the Lord of the whole earth and the Christ, the Messiah, for carrying out God's economy
The crucial point of the witnesses of Christ is that they live Christ in His resurrection and through His death
The constituents of the vital groups are the believers in Christ, the disciples of Christ, and the witnesses of Christ
In message one we pointed out that to live the church life we have to pursue with those who call on the name of the Lord out of a pure heart
Also, we have to learn how to enjoy Christ as the Spirit in our spirit to be the abiding grace for our enjoyment
In our daily living, do we enjoy Christ as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit to be the abiding grace for our enjoyment?
Jesus spent time with Peter day and night for three and a half years in order to disciple him to be as He was, a God-man
We in the Lord's recovery are spreading Christ for His multiplication, but our rate of multiplication has not been that high
As such we must be the oracle of God, the speaking ones, to spread God for the multiplication and increase of Christ
The divine sonship of glory is corporate, consisting of Christ as the firstborn Son of God and His believers as the many sons of God
Since all the sons of God are God's oracle, they become God's prophets, the ones who speak God, speak for God, and speak forth God
The meetings in Christianity are for one speaker to speak, but according to 1 Corinthians 14, all the saints should be speakers
Corinthians 14:31 says that all the believers can prophesy, speaking God, speaking for God, and speaking forth God, one by one
In the four Gospels we see Jesus living the life of a God-man, and in Acts we see the disciples also living such a life
They were also the members of Christ, the parts of Christ, to spread God, multiply Christ, and increase Christ
The word oracle refers to God's speaking, to the persons who carry out God's speaking, or to the place of God's speaking
In the New Testament the apostle Paul was one who was always in the reality of the Holy of Holies within the ark, signifying Christ
Christ with His judicial redemption has become the very place where God speaks to His people, and this place is the oracle
The Lord called some to follow Him just to see how He lived so that He could show them the pattern of a God-man
God does not care whether you are a good man or a bad man, because everything of our natural man, good or bad, must go to the cross
The Lord Jesus was with the disciples for three and a half years, but He never called them His brothers until after His resurrection
His resurrection was a great delivery of Himself as the firstborn Son of God and of us as His many brothers, the many sons of God
The fallen human race is joined with Satan to be his world in his system, but God has a heart of love toward these people
Luke 15 records that the Pharisees and scribes criticized the Lord by saying, 'This man welcomes sinners and eats with them'
If all the churches receive this teaching to participate in Christ's wonderful shepherding, there will be a big revival in the recovery
In His heavenly ministry Christ is shepherding people, and we need to cooperate with Him by shepherding people
In order to be a shepherd, we must be a witness of Christ, a member of Christ, and a brother of Christ, sharing His sonship
Many in the past have used the term the great commission to describe the Lord's charge to His disciples before He ascended
Romans 1:3 through 4 says that Christ as the seed of David in the flesh was designated the Son of God in resurrection
In resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God; as the seed of David He was designated to be the Son of God
Also, whatever was terminated by Christ's death was redeemed, so His death is all-terminating and all-redeeming
Through His death Christ entered into His resurrection to carry out His ministry in the stage of His inclusion
Through His death He entered into His resurrection to carry out His ministry in another stage, the stage of inclusion
Many use the term the great commission, but they do not see that the great commission of Christ is to carry out God's eternal economy
The great commission to us revealed in the Bible is not soul-winning, to save sinners, but to carry out God's eternal economy
The great commission the Lord gave us is for us to disciple the nations and teach them the teachings of Christ
All things, whether on earth or in the heavens, were reconciled to God, and the gospel should be proclaimed to all creation under heaven
Everyone who is seeking after the Lord needs to have a full repentance and make a thorough confession of his sins to the Lord
If we do not confess our past sins to receive the cleansing of the Lord's blood with His forgiveness, we will be heavily burdened
When we experience such a repentance for the forgiveness of our sins, we will be able to effectively proclaim this to others
Those who are laboring for the Lord's interests in Russia are Christ's witnesses at the uttermost part of the earth
On the one hand those in the vital groups should go out to seek the lost sinners on the other hand they should go out to reap Gods harvest
Christ shepherds the sheep led astray and returned to Him, overseeing their inward condition as the Overseer of their souls
When the Lords shepherding goes deeper in us it reaches our soul to take care of our inward condition for the doing of the will of God in us
Christ as the Shepherd of our soul oversees the inward situation of our soul, which is composed of our mind, emotion, and will
The first Comforter was Christ in the flesh, and the second Comforter is Christ as the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of reality
As the second Comforter, Christ is the Spirit of reality who comes not only to be with us but also to be in us, the redeemed ones of God
John 1 through 7 is concerning the flowing Triune God to be the living water for the enjoyment of the believers in Christ
In the previous message we saw that shepherding and teaching are in Christ's ministry for carrying out God's eternal economy
He detoured from the main way to Sychar, near Jacob's well, in order to contact a sinful Samaritan woman, who previously had five husbands
If one hundred saints in a local church practice this, their number can be increased to five hundred after twelve years
The proper increase is due to the gospel shepherding, and shepherding means that we have to go and visit people
In his first Epistle, Peter spoke in 2:25 of Christ being the Shepherd and Overseer of our soul, our inner being and real person
We have God in our understanding, in our theology, and in our teaching, but we may not live God when we are shepherding people
Acts 20 says that while Paul was on his way to Jerusalem, he sent word to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church
If we teach the mysteries of the kingdom, we have to stress that we need to be the good ground, into which Christ sows Himself as the seed
Paul also said in 1 Timothy 5:17 that the elders who labor in the word and teaching are worthy of double honor
In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul charged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to tell certain ones not to teach anything different from God's economy
In 2 Corinthians 4:5 Paul said, 'For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus' sake'
The elders' willing and faithful shepherding will be rewarded with the unfading crown of glory at the manifestation of the Chief Shepherd
Although created man does not have the reality of love, there is something in his created being that wants to love others
The first one saved by Christ through His crucifixion was not a gentleman, but a criminal, a robber, sentenced to death
Love is not jealous is not provoked does not take account of evil covers all things endures all things never falls away and is the greatest
One sister may be jealous of another sister because she receives many 'amens' from the saints when she prays or prophesies
We realize that if we appoint a certain brother, another brother whom we do not feel to appoint may be stumbled because of jealousy
If a certain sister is asked to take the lead in a sisters' house, the others may become jealous, but love is not jealous
The elders need to realize that in their shepherding, they have to cover others' sins, not to take account of others' evils
Whoever uncovers the defects, shortcomings, and sins of the members of the church is disqualified from the eldership
Corinthians13 concludes by saying, 'Now there abide faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love'
God predestinated us unto sonship before the foundation of the world in love, and the Body of Christ builds itself up in love
The main gift which God has given us is our regenerated human spirit with His Spirit, His life, and His nature
If our spirit is not a spirit of love, our fanning it into flame will burn the whole recovery in a negative way
Under today's degradation of the church, we all need a spirit of love fanned into flame to be burning in spirit
According to my observation throughout the years, most of the co-workers have a human spirit of 'power' but not of love
If we do not love our brother, we abide in death and are dead, but if we do love him, we abide in life and are living
Corinthians 13 speaks of love, and then chapter fourteen begins by saying that we are to pursue love while we desire spiritual gifts
To overcome the degradation of the church we need to pursue love with those who seek the Lord out of a pure heart
If all the saints in the Lord's recovery love one another, the whole world will say that these people are of Christ
We must be perfect as our Father is perfect by loving the evil ones and the good ones without any discrimination
The church is not a police station to arrest people or a law court to judge people, but a home to raise up the believers
The content of God's entire New Testament economy is Christ as the Son of Man cherishing us and as the Son of God nourishing us
The word economy is not mentioned in the Old Testament, but it is mentioned in the New Testament by the apostle Paul
Isaiah 9:6 says that a child is born to us, a son is given to us, and His name is the Mighty God and the Eternal Father
The scribes and Pharisees, the self-justified ones, could not bear to see Him eating with tax collectors and sinners
Once He was walking in a pressing crowd, and a sick woman desperately touched the fringe of His garment and was healed
The totality of His nourishing will be this great universal city, which is the enlargement and expression of God
Christ as the Son of Man, in the form of the serpent, destroyed the old serpent, the source of sin, through His redeeming death cherishing
We were bitten by the old serpent in the garden of Eden in Genesis3, so we have the poison, the essence, of the serpent in our being
He was the reality of the brass serpent in Numbers 21 to destroy Satan, the source of sin, through His redeeming death
The very God who became a man traveled from Judea to Galilee, and He purposely detoured to a small city to cherish an immoral woman
Christ as the Son of God, sent by God as a gift, gave her to drink the water of life which springs up into eternal life nourishing
The judgment in Revelation 1467 as a part of the judgment of Christ will be declared to all the people on the earth as the eternal gospel
The Son of Man is the unique One without sin, so He was the only one qualified to condemn the sinful woman, but He would not do it
In other words, they would never be freed from their sins but would remain in their sins until they would die in them
Christ as the Son of Man will be the ladder sustaining and maintaining the life union of all His believers with God cherishing
He is strong in humanity to stand in an uplifted way, not a level way, to bring heaven to earth and to join earth to heaven
The model of Jesus as the Son of Man cherishing people needs to be reproduced in us so that we also will cherish others in His humanity
The Lord revealed that resurrection is not a matter of time but a matter of His person, because He is the resurrection
He saw Nathanael under that tree far away because of His divinity with the divine ability, but that divine ability was in His humanity
Only God is the resurrection that can stand against death, overcome death, enter into death, have a tour of death, and come out of death
His cherishing others to charm and attract them was not in His natural humanity, but in His humanity in resurrection
Ephesians 2 says that we were once dead in offenses and sins, but God made us alive together with Christ and raised us up together with Him
To be in resurrection means to be in Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God realized as the consummated Spirit
He was a person living a human life in resurrection, not by Himself, but by another source, that is, His Father
If we live such a life today, a life in humanity by resurrection, everyone will realize that there is something different about us
We should cherish people, not by our natural man, but by our regenerated man that has been conformed to the death of Christ
Ephesians 4:22-24 reveals that we must put off the old man and put on the new man by being renewed in the spirit of our mind
The mingled spirit must invade, take over, occupy, and saturate our mind with divinity; then our mind becomes a renewed mind
As the human King of the kingdom of the heavens, Christ cherished the kingdom-seekers by blessing them with a ninefold blessing
If we were the Lord, we might have read the law from Exodus 20 to the people instead of the jubilee of grace from Isaiah 61
The Lord read a portion from Isaiah to them to cherish them with the words of grace proceeding out of His mouth
Jesus became the ladder not by His divinity but by His humanity, not by Him as the Son of God but by Him as the Son of Man
He is the heavenly ladder, the uplifted stairway, to bring heaven to earth and to join earth to heaven for the building of the house of God
The first sign in Revelation shows us Christ in His humanity as the High Priest, and the last sign is the New Jerusalem
On the one hand, He is cherishing the churches in His humanity; on the other hand, He is nourishing the churches in His divinity
We do not nourish people when we speak to them about marriage, courtship, politics, the world situation, or education
In order to nourish people with Christ we first have to seek Christ experience Christ gain Christ enjoy Christ and participate in Christ
When you say that you are learning to preach Christ, they will not be able to understand what kind of person you are
When the wick was burned out it became charred and black, so the priest had to come to cut off the black part of the wick
If we do not enjoy Christ as the tree of life in the church life today surely we will not participate in the tree of life in the kingdom age
In the second epistle to Smyrna, a persecuted and suffering church, Christ said that He would give the crown of life to those who overcome
Also the Lord will give us a white stone and a new name signifying that we have become a transformed person to be material for Gods building
The Lord promised the overcomers in the church in Thyatira that they would have the authority to rule, to reign as kings, over the nations
If we do not reign as kings today in Christ's life, how can we be kings in the coming age to rule over the nations?
Those who overcome to hold fast what they have in the Lord's recovery will be built into the New Jerusalem, the temple of God, as a pillar
In His divinity He is nourishing us so that we may grow and mature in the divine life to be His overcomers to accomplish His eternal economy
In the previous messages, we have seen how Christ cherishes us in His humanity and nourishes us in His divinity
Because the United States is an old Christian nation, many people have already heard this kind of presentation of Christ
When we go to visit people, we do not want to merely tell them something but to nourish them with Christ as their food
When we contact people, we should always endeavor to present some spiritual food to them, not to teach them with mere knowledge
Christ accomplishes so much by His ministry, His service, from His incarnation to the consummation of the New Jerusalem
Matthew presents the birth of Christ, His incarnation, and Revelation presents the New Jerusalem, the holy city
When we contact an unbeliever, we can say, 'I want to tell you that Christ has brought the infinite God into the finite man'
Christ in His incarnation united and mingled these two parties the wonderful God, who is triune, and the excellent man, who is tripartite
Philippians 2:6-7 says that He existed in the form of God, but He took the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men
Verse 8 says, 'And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross'
He was in the form of God, but He humbled Himself to put on the form of man, becoming obedient to God, even unto the death of the cross
When the attributes of God became the virtues of Christ in His humanity, these virtues were very aromatic and sweet
Christ attracted and captivated people not by living His human life in the flesh but by living His divine life in resurrection
He should talk to her in his natural, human life by another life, that is, the life of Christ, the divine life, the eternal life
His judicial redemption is not only a foundation but also a procedure to attain His ministry in the stage of His inclusion
Now we want to see His accomplishments in the stage of His inclusion from His resurrection to the degradation of the church
In Christs resurrection He was begotten as Gods firstborn Son He became the lifegiving Spirit and He regenerated the believers for His Body
After the grain of wheat is sown into the earth, on the one hand it is dying, but on the other hand it is rising up
From eternity past without beginning, Christ was God's only begotten Son, possessing only divinity, without humanity
In incarnation the only begotten Son of God became flesh to be a God-man, a man possessing both the divine nature and the human nature
Through death and resurrection, Christ in the flesh as the seed of David was designated to be the firstborn Son of God
According to John 7:39, prior to the glorification of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, 'the Spirit was not yet'
Christ's resurrection was a big delivery of Himself as the firstborn Son and the believers as His many brothers, His millions of 'twins'
The best Christians are the ones who are in the Spirit and have the Spirit in them to make them completely one with the Spirit
The Christ in resurrection gave Himself as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit without measure through His speaking of the words of God
The Father is the fountain, the source, emerging in the Son as the spring, who flows out as the Spirit, the river, into eternal life
As we grow in the divine life, we are transformed into precious material for God's building: gold, silver, and precious stones
The chorus of Hymns, 976, a hymn concerning the New Jerusalem, says, 'Lo, the holy city,/Full of God's bright glory!
An overcomer's goal should be uniquely and ultimately the goal of God's eternal economy, that is, the New Jerusalem
The saints here are genuinely pursuing Christ and building up the church according to the New Testament ministry
The Lord has shown us in this series of messages that we need to contact people by cherishing and nourishing them
The Lord has taken us on to see that we need to cherish people in the humanity of Jesus and nourish them in the divinity of Christ
We cherish them with the goal of nourishing them with the unsearchable riches of Christ in His full ministry in three stages
The church in Laodicea was proud of being rich in the vain knowledge of doctrine, but they were poor in the reality of God Himself
Since the Triune God is contained in His word, His word is reality, and we are sanctified in the reality of this word
We may be rich in the knowledge of the high peak of the divine revelation, but we should not think that we have the reality
The vitality is hidden in our intimate, thorough fellowship with the Lord, with nothing between us and the Lord
We must confess that we have not been fully conformed to His death, especially in the way that we speak to our spouse
In the same way, we must confess our sins to the Lord throughout the day to receive the continual cleansing of His blood
The churches in Taiwan have entered into the way of pray-reading, studying, reciting, and prophesying all the items of the outlines
If we practice this, we will be saturated and soaked with all these points, and we will have much of the truth to speak to others
The saints here are genuinely pursuing Christ and building up the church according to the New Testament ministry
New ones steadily come into the church life through door-knocking, and contacting of neighbors, co-workers, and relatives
The person who wrote the above testimony said that he was shepherded by the saints, not by the elders or co-workers
The saints in this locality are pursuing Christ according to the New Testament ministry, not according to different teachings
We ourselves must be constituted with the riches of Christ revealed in the Bible, if we are going to dispense these riches into others
The Ethiopian eunuch whom Philip contacted was reading from Isaiah and Philip asked him Do you really know the things that you are reading
Although points like this have been made clear in our Life-study of the Bible, we may not pay attention to them to study them
We have inherited much from the foregoing interpretations of the Word and have had a life-study of the entire Bible
In the beginning was the Word, who is God, this Word became flesh, and this flesh was a shell to conceal the glory of Christ's divinity
Part of our upcoming winter training will be a crystallization-study of the Lord's organic salvation in Romans
We should prophesy with what we can recite; what we can recite is what we have studied; and what we have studied is what we have pray-read
If we pray-read, study, and recite the points of the outlines released in our crystallization-study of the Word, we will surely prophesy
If we practice PSR each day, from Monday through Saturday, we will surely prophesy in the Lord's Day meeting of the church
If he were not familiar with that portion of the holy Word, how could he have preached Christ as the gospel according to that portion?
If anyone comes to the Lord's Day morning meeting without being prepared to prophesy, this indicates he was lazy for the whole week
