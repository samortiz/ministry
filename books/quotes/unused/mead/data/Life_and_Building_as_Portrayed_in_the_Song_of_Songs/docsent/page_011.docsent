   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SEPARATING WALL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But suddenly there is another picture.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, showing himself through the lattice" 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The picture has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now her beloved is leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may think this is wonderful, but if you were the seeking one you would say, "I am here resting, and He is there jumping and skipping.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While I am resting, He is leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How different He is from me."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A short while before, He was with her in the banqueting house; now, she is still in the house while He is outside the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A wall is separating them; He is behind the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This portrays some separation between the seeking one and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the banqueting house they were one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But now she is within the wall, and He is outside the wall; she is resting, and He is jumping, leaping, and skipping.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>So you see, it is possible that while we are loving Jesus, He is away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He may not be far away, but there is a separation, a wall between Him and us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was with us in the banqueting house, but now there is a wall between us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was so wonderful to be in the banqueting house, but now while we are still inside, He is outside.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are still resting and enjoying, but He is leaping and skipping.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have our character, and He has His.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>While we have our resting personality, He has His skipping personality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But praise the Lord that walls nearly always have some openings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He can still see the seeking one by looking through the window.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Praise the Lord for the window; but there is a lattice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He can see through, but He cannot get in. This is really meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Song of Songs is poetry, and a picture is portrayed here.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is a wall with a window, but the window has a lattice.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many times our experiences with the Lord have been just like this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While we were so much in love with Him, He was not with us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was outside the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We were within and He was without.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But an opening was there for Him to see us and for us to see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, He could not get in, and we could not get out because of the lattice.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many times in our experiences with the Lord, something like this will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are separated, but we can still see through.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet we cannot get through, and the Lord cannot get through either.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the seeking one did hear His voice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She said, "The voice of my beloved!"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She heard His voice, and He seemed to be saying, "Rise up; don't rest anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Come out of the house; don't remain in your situation."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE REAL TEST</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the real test.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We say we love the Lord, but we love Him in our way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We love Him according to our taste, our intention, and our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We do not love Him according to His way, His taste, His intention, or His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our intention is just to enjoy rest and satisfaction, but suddenly Jesus is away.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are satisfied, but He is away.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So many dear ones become excited when they come to the local church and touch the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But then, after a time, they ask, "What happened?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It seems that the happiness is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At first they were so happy they were even in the heavens but now the happiness is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the test.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We love Him, but it seems that He is away.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We love Him, but we do not have His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is because we have loved Him for our goal and for our intention.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is the King.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>His intention is the intention.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His goal is the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we love Him, we must do so according to His intention and for His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is why He says, "Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is to call us away from our situation.</S>
