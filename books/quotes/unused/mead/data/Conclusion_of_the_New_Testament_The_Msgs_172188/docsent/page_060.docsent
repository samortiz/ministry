   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After His coming back, the Lord will drink the cup of the new covenant anew with the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the Lord's promise in Matthew 26:29 will be fulfilled with the overcomers in the kingdom of the Father during the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>3 Feasting with the Old Testament Overcomers</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1 Corinthians 6:10b Paul speaks of inheriting the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word "inherit" in this verse implies enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To inherit a certain thing is to enjoy that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, to inherit the coming kingdom means to enjoy the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The coming kingdom will be a joyful inheritance to the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to Matthew, the manifestation of the kingdom will be a reward to the overcoming saints as their enjoyment with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To inherit the kingdom is not just to enter the kingdom; it is to receive the kingdom as a reward for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This should be an incentive for us to live an overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By living an overcoming life today we shall be qualified to inherit the coming kingdom as a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Galatians 5:21 Paul, referring to the works of the flesh, says, "Those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The inheritance of the kingdom of God refers to the enjoyment of the coming kingdom as a reward to the overcoming believers.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those believers who practice the works of the flesh listed in Galatians 5 will not inherit the coming kingdom as a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Ephesians 5:5b Paul speaks of a believer's "inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The kingdom of Christ is the millennium Rev 20:4, 6; Matt 16:28 ; it is also the kingdom of God Matt 13:41, 43 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God John 3:5 and in the church life, are living in the kingdom of God today Rom 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, not all believers will participate in the millennium; only the overcoming ones will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The defeated believers will have no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The term "the kingdom of Christ and of God" refers not to the kingdom today in the church life but to the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The millennium will be a kingdom in a way that is more practical than what we are experiencing in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only in the millennium will the kingdom of Christ also become the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today all believers are in the kingdom of God, but not all of them will have an inheritance in the coming millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both the defeated ones and the overcoming ones may be in the church as the kingdom of God, but only the overcoming ones will inherit the kingdom during the millennium.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot receive the kingdom as a reward simply by believing.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to receive salvation, it is adequate that we believe in the Lord.</S>
