   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRANSFORMED FOR THE BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This organic transformation has very much to do with the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although we have been reconciled to God through the death of Christ, we still are very natural.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the church life we have believers of many different nationalities: Americans, Chinese, Mexicans, Japanese, Filipinos, British, French, Germans, Koreans, Ghanians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, if we remain in our natural status, we cannot be the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can the Chinese be built up with the Japanese, or the Westerners with the Easterners?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, in the Body of Christ we must be one and be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this, we need to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By nature, we all are either male or female.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, even this natural distinction causes problems in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A brother who uplifts his male status will cause problems to the sisters in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, even with respect to being male and female, we need to be transformed for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we remain in our natural life, we simply cannot be built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are natural, the brothers cannot be built up with the sisters, nor the sisters with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, if the sisters are not transformed, they cannot be built up with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our natural status, whether male or female, we are not capable of being built up as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Again we see that we need to be transformed, to be saved in the life of Christ from our naturalness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In speaking with the saints or in answering their questions, I am afraid of being natural.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I do not want to be in my natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do you know what disposition is?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is simply our natural expression, our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our disposition is what we are by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can the church be built up if we remain in our natural disposition?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How can those who differ in their disposition be built into one?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without transformation, it is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some who have realized this have become so disappointed that they have thought it hopeless to have the church life in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At such times, they have even considered giving up the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, there is no way for us to go back.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The train on which we are riding goes only in one direction; it never goes backward.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even when we are disappointed, the train of the church life carries us onward.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have no choice but to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We were born for this and even predestinated for it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We simply have to go along with what the Lord is doing in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>ALL THINGS WORKING FOR</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>OUR TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some have told me that they were tired of being Christians and no longer wanted to be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But once you have become a Christian, it is impossible to stop being a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The universe is not under our control.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are creatures, and certain decisions concerning us were made before we were born.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was not we who decided to be born into this world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This matter was of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is His universe and His earth, and we are His people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to God s economy, as typical human beings, we must be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As Christians, we have seen that we must be in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since we have no choice in this matter, let us simply place ourselves into the transforming hand of God and allow Him to do His transforming work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those of us who are married have just the wife or husband we need.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, in the church life we have the very brothers and sisters we need.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the dear ones in the church are necessary for our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord is sovereign, and we must worship Him for His sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is never wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes I am tempted to be impatient with the slowness of certain brothers or with mistakes they have made under the Lord s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At such a time the indwelling Spirit reminds me that all this is for my transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At other times I am reminded, perhaps by my wife, that God causes all things to work together for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All things work together for good in the way of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need this transformation in order to be saved from our naturalness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>THE RENEWING OF THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Romans 12:2 tells us to be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The source of our trouble is our mind, which has been saturated and permeated with all kinds of natural concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This mind filled with natural concepts is the cause of the trouble in the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The brothers, the sisters, the old, and the young all have their concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, those born in the Orient have their concepts, and those born in the West have theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>How can we be built up together if we hold on to our differing concepts?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For the building of the Body, we need the renewing of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to drop not only non-Christian concepts, but also Christian concepts, the concepts we took in when we were in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Denominations are divisions formed according to various concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now that the Lord, in His mercy, has brought us together for the church life, we need the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need to be inwardly unloaded of our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is related to the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The more we grow in life, the more we shall be saturated by life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then this life will transform our mind organically.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Spontaneously the concepts will be swallowed up by the growth of the life within.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have learned not to argue with the saints regarding their concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Instead, we should pray for them and minister life to them so that they may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As the saints grow, they experience transformation in the soul by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>By growing together in this way in the life of Christ, we eventually come to have one mind.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then we are one, not according to concept, but according to the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>MINISTERING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If a brother or sister holds a dissenting concept, you should not try to convince that one to change it.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The more you attempt to convince him, the stronger the dissenting concept will be.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The best way to help such a one is to allow the inner life to solve his problem.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Suppose you cut your arm.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>After applying medicine to the wound, leave the wound alone and let it heal itself.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>However, if you tamper with the injury, you will only delay the healing.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The life in the body will eventually take care of the wound.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Likewise, the best way to care for a dissenting one is to do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If the problem is left alone, he will sooner or later become dissatisfied with his dissenting.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Instead of correcting him or trying to change him, minister life to him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What the brothers and sisters need is the inward, organic supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>You can minister life to someone without even saying much to him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Simply by looking at him you can transfuse the life into him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Do not speak to others according to the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Instead, exercise your spirit to transfuse life from your spirit into them.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This life, which is the living Christ Himself, will work within them to transform them inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Eventually, the inner life will renew their minds and they will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Then the dissenting concepts will be swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Today, for the building up of the church, we need to experience this kind of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The more we are transformed, the more we are saved in the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>May we all pray that the Lord will grant us a genuine inner, organic transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is our need today.</S>
