<h2 class="head1">LEARNING OBEDIENCE IN THE BODY</h2><p>We have to see that it is difficult to practice obedience in the world or in the universe, but it is spontaneous to submit to authority in the Body. It is hard not to submit in the Body. In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul shows us the Body ministry. Today some people are fighting for a ministry. This is foolish. If we are in the Body, everything becomes one. Since the time of creation God has been manifesting His authority. Today is the age of the church; we are in the fourth stage. Only in the church, that is, in the Body of Christ, do we find a perfect relationship between submission and authority. It is hard to ask children to submit to their parents, wives to submit to their husbands, or servants to submit to their masters in the world. It is hard to find a person who happily pays taxes to a customs officer. However, the Lord is asking us to learn obedience in the church, the Body of Christ. The first place to learn submission is not in the family or the world. Unless we learn obedience in the church, we will not obey in the family or obey the government, because we will not have the proper foundation of obedience in us. There are many members in the Body of Christ, and there are many opportunities to learn obedience. If we learn the proper lessons in the Body, we will do well in every other relationship. I have seen many brothers and sisters who obey their parents only because they have learned obedience in the church. First we learn obedience from the Lord and the church, and then we will have proper relationships with others. The church is the test of our obedience to Christ. Unless a man learns these lessons in the church and tears down his individualism there, he will not know how to behave himself anywhere. The church is the testing ground; it is also the perfecting ground. If we do not learn our lessons here, we will fail in everything else we do. If we learn our lessons well in the church, the problem of the kingdom, of the world, and even of the entire universe will be settled.</p><h2 class="head1">AUTHORITY AND SUBMISSION BEING<br />PERFECTLY JOINED AS ONE IN THE BODY</h2><p>God's work is in the church. Everything depends on us today. God is recovering His system of authority; His authority must be recovered in the church. He does not wish to see even the slightest trace of rebellion in the church. The way to go on today is to live the Body life, where authority is complemented by mutual love and coordination. Once this problem is settled, all other problems are settled. In the past the truth of authority and submission was objective and impersonal. Authority was objective, and so was submission. Authority was impersonal, and so was submission. We submitted to outward things in an outward way. Today authority and submission have to become organic; they have to become inward and subjective. In the Body of Christ, that is, in the church, authority and submission meet in the same place. The two become a subjective and living whole. Authority and submission become one living entity, a oneness in life. This is the highest form of divine authority. No other oneness can be compared with the oneness of the Head with the Body. The Head and the Body are fully one; there is no possibility of separation. Previously, authority was one thing and submission another. Today in the Body of Christ there is no separation between them; they have become inseparably one.</p><p>The Body is the place where God's authority is manifested. It is also the place where submission is practiced. This is the place where one touches God's authority. This is the church, the Body of Christ. This is also the ultimate expression of God's authority. Authority and submission reach their peak in the Body. Therefore, the Body of Christ is the peak! If we cannot learn submission in the church, we will not learn it anywhere else. If we do not take this way, we will have no way to go on. If God cannot get through in this matter, He cannot get through in other matters. May we learn our lesson here. Without this, we do not have a way to go on. The one place where we will touch authority on earth is the Body of Christ. If we learn this lesson well, we will get through in everything. We have to learn to touch God's authority, not man's authority. The Head is in the church and so are all the members. If we do not touch authority here, we will not touch it anywhere. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p>
