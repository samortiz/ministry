The burden of these messages can be expressed in the following four statements:</P><P>1.The glory of Christ's divinity was concealed in Him as in a grain of wheat.<br>2.In His glorification He, as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit for His divine dispensing.<br>3.In His resurrection He was born with His humanity to be the firstborn Son of God for His divine transformation.<br>4.Through His resurrection all His believers were regenerated to be the many sons of God for His divine multiplication.</P><P>The matter of Christ's being glorified by the Father is referred to in the following verses of John: 7:39; 8:54; 12:16, 23; 13:31-32; 17:1, 5. This message, which is quite particular, is on the concealed glory of Christ's divinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. CHRIST AS THE SECOND OF THE TRIUNE GOD POSSESSING THE DIVINE GLORY FROM ETERNITY PAST</H2><P>Christ as the second of the Triune God possessed the divine glory from eternity past. John 1:1 reveals that Christ, the Word, is God: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." As God Christ has the divine glory. Since Christ was God from eternity past, He possessed the divine glory also from eternity past. What is the divine glory? The divine glory is God Himself. God Himself is glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. HIS HUMANITY THROUGH HIS INCARNATION BECOMING A SHELL TO CONCEAL THE GLORY OF HIS DIVINITY</H2><P>Christ's humanity through His incarnation became a shell to conceal the glory of His divinity. Instead of the words His humanity it is perhaps better to use the expression His flesh, for John 1:14 tells us that the very God became flesh. This flesh, this humanity, became a shell to conceal the glory of Christ's divinity. Christ's divinity is itself the divine glory. Just as God is light, divinity is glory. When Christ was in the flesh, in His humanity, His flesh was a shell which concealed His divinity and thereby concealed His glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. EXPRESSING THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD IN HIS HUMAN LIVING, YET THE GLORY OF HIS DIVINITY BEING MOSTLY CONCEALED</H2><P>Although Christ expressed the attributes of God in His human living as His virtues in His humanity, the glory of His divinity was mostly concealed by the shell of His humanity, His flesh. When He was living on earth in the flesh, on the one hand He was God, who is glory, and on the other hand He was flesh. This flesh was a shell that concealed the very God who is glory. Because the divine glory was concealed within the shell of His flesh, it was necessary for Him to be glorified. In John 12:23 He said, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified." In 17:1 He prayed, "Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You." In verse 5 He went on to say, "And now, glorify Me along with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was."</P><P>According to my limited knowledge, few readers of the Bible and Christian teachers pay adequate attention to the glorification of Christ mentioned in these and several other verses from John 7:39 to John 17:5. It is common for theologians to study redemption, justification, and sanctification, but rarely do they study the matter of Christ's glorification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. IN HIS TRANSFIGURATION THE GLORY OF HIS DIVINITY BEING MANIFESTED FOR A GLIMPSE TO HIS DISCIPLES</H2><P>As God Christ Himself was glory, but this glory was concealed in the shell of His humanity, and thus His divine glory could not be seen. Others could see His shell, but they could not see His glory concealed within the shell. However, in his Gospel the apostle John said, "We beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father" (1:14). He, along with Peter and James, beheld the Lord's glory when He was transfigured on the mountain. His transfiguration was a glorification. While He was living in the shell of His flesh, He temporarily came out of His flesh and was glorified.</P><P>It was only in Christ's transfiguration on the mountain while He was living in His humanity, that the glory of His divinity was manifested for a glimpse to His disciples. Matthew 17:2 says, "He was transfigured before them, and His face shined like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light." Peter refers to this in 2 Peter 1:17-18: "He received from God the Father honor and glory, a voice such as this being borne to Him by the magnificent glory: This is My Son, My Beloved, in whom I delight. And this voice we heard being borne out of heaven while we were with Him in the holy mountain." In Matthew 17 Peter, John, and James were the only ones who saw the glorified Jesus, and they testified that they could not deny what they had seen of the concealed glory of Christ. They were most blessed in seeing the Lord in His transfiguration. Whereas only three beheld the glorified Jesus on the mountain before His resurrection, after His resurrection millions can see Him. Today we see not a Christ who is still in the shell but a Christ who has come out of the shell and has been glorified.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. LONGING TO BE BAPTIZED WITH THE BAPTISM OF HIS DEATH FOR THE RELEASE OF THE GLORY OF HIS DIVINITY</H2><P>While the glory of His divinity was concealed by the shell of His flesh or humanity, the Lord Jesus was pressed and constrained, longing to be baptized with the baptism of His death for the release of the glory of His divinity. In Luke 12:50 the Lord said, "I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!" The Greek word translated pressed can also be rendered "constrained." The Lord was constrained in His flesh, which He had put upon Himself in His incarnation. He needed to undergo physical death, to be baptized, that His unlimited and infinite divine being with His divine life might be released from His flesh. The Lord Jesus therefore desired to be released from the constraint of the shell of His flesh. He refers to this release in John 12:24: "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." If the Lord Jesus as a grain of wheat had not died, He would have remained the same. But He fell into the ground and died, and that death released Him from His human shell. His incarnation caused His divine glory to be concealed in His flesh, but through His death His glory was released for the producing in His resurrection of the many grains, which become His increase as the expression of His glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE RELEASE OF THE GLORY OF HIS DIVINITY BEING TO CAST FIRE ON THE EARTH</H2><P>The release of the glory of Christ's divinity was to cast fire on the earth. In Luke 12:49 He said, "I have come to cast fire on the earth, and how I wish that it were already kindled!" This fire is the impulse of the spiritual life, an impulse that comes from the Lord's released divine life. To cast fire on the earth is to burn the people of the earth. When Christ was baptized with the baptism of His death on the cross, the glory of His divinity was released. From the time of His resurrection a fire has been burning on earth. This fire started from Jerusalem, and then it spread through Judea and Samaria to the uttermost part of the earth. Today this fire is burning all over the earth&#151;in America, in Russia, in Romania, in Poland, in Brazil, in Africa, in Australia, in New Zealand.</P><P>In the book of Revelation we see that Christ is the Lion-Lamb; He is the Lion to defeat Satan and He is the Lamb to redeem us (5:5-6). Revelation 5:6 says, "I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth." These seven eyes, the seven Spirits, are "like a flame of fire" (1:14; 2:18). Elsewhere we are told that the seven Spirits of God are "seven lamps of fire burning before the throne" (4:5). Christ today is a burning fire. We all have been burned by this fire; we have been brought together by this fire; and now we are burdened that this fire would burn many others. When the concealed glory of Christ's divinity was released, a divine fire was cast on earth to burn the whole earth. Let the fire burn on! No one can stop it.</P><P>At the beginning of this message, we pointed out that in His resurrection Christ was born with His humanity to be the firstborn Son of God for His divine transformation. The words His divine transformation actually refer to our experience of transformation. Christ becoming the Lord Spirit is for our transformation (2 Cor. 3:18). He first became the life-giving Spirit to dispense the divine life and nature into our spirit. Then He became the Lord Spirit to transform our soul (including our mind, emotion, and will). This is proved by Romans 12:2a, which says, "Be transformed by the renewing of the mind." The Lord has dispensed Himself into our spirit, and now He is transforming our soul. Today we are in the process of being transformed in our soul. Eventually, at the time of His coming back, He will transform our body to be conformed to His body of glory (Phil. 3:21).</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE RELEASE OF THE GLORY OF CHRIST'S DIVINITY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Through the breaking of the shell of His humanity by His death-John 12:24:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>He was the unique grain that contained His divine life with His divine glory.</li>	<li>When the shell of His humanity was broken through His crucifixion, which was the baptism He went through (Luke 12:50), all the elements of His divinity-His divine life and His divine glory-were released.</li>	<li>In this sense, His death is considered the life-releasing death with His glory released simultaneously.</li>	</ol></li><li>The release of the glory of Christ's divinity is His being glorified by the Father with the divine glory (John 12:23-24) in His resurrection through His death (Luke 24:26).</li><li>Christ in His human living prayed that His Father would glorify Him (John 17:1), and the Father answered His prayer (Acts 3:13).</li><li>Such a glorification is a transfer, transferring Christ from the stage of His incarnation into the stage of His inclusion, in which He, as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</li></ol>Note: Christ's being glorified was a drastic change not only in His condition and situation but also in His nature, element, and essence.</P><P>Prayer: Lord, we extol You as the glorified One. We appreciate and treasure Your being glorified. Hallelujah, our Christ is the glorified Christ! Lord, give us a heart to seek after You as the glorified One, and grant us the up-to-date utterance to release what You have shown us. Lord, in this matter we need You and we trust in You. Come in, Lord, to unveil to us more mysteries concerning Your being glorified. Amen.</P><P>The general subject of these messages is the issue of Christ being glorified by the Father with the divine glory. In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed to His Father concerning glorification, saying, "Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You" (v. 1). When we speak of glorifying a certain person, we mean that we praise or exalt that person. But this is not what God the Father did to Christ, and this is not what the Lord Jesus asked His Father to do. Rather, the Lord prayed that the Father would glorify the Son that the Father might be glorified in the Son's glorification. Christ's great prayer that God the Father would glorify Him was offered shortly before He was crucified. Immediately after He prayed that prayer, He was arrested and crucified so that He might be glorified.</P><P>The subject of the previous message was the concealed glory of Christ's divinity. In that message we saw that Christ as the second of the Triune God possessed the divine glory from eternity past and that His humanity, His flesh, through His incarnation became a shell to conceal the glory of His divinity. In this message we will consider the release of the glory of Christ's divinity. We all need to see that the glory of Christ's divinity, which was concealed in the shell of His flesh, has been released.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THROUGH THE BREAKING OF THE SHELL OF HIS HUMANITY BY HIS DEATH</H2><P>The glory of Christ's divinity was released through the breaking of the shell of His humanity by His death (John 12:24). The death of Christ was a release. In John 12:23 the Lord Jesus said, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified." For Him to be glorified was not to be exalted but to be released. This is clearly indicated by the following verse: "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." This was His release.</P><P>If a grain of wheat does not fall into the ground and die, it abides by itself alone and no one knows what is within the grain. But when the grain enters into death, its content is released. In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus likens Himself to a grain of wheat. When He was living in His humanity for thirty-three and a half years, no one, including His mother, knew who He was. Others regarded Him as nothing more than a man, but no one knew what He was according to the contents of His inner being. He was a man in the flesh, but there was another One in this man. This other One was God Himself, and God is glory. Since God as glory was concealed in His flesh as a shell, He needed the release spoken of in John 12:24. In order to be released and not to remain alone, the one grain of wheat had to fall into the ground and die. Through the Lord's death the glory of His divinity was released.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Unique Grain That Contained His Divine Life with His Divine Glory</H2><P>The Lord Jesus was the unique grain that contained His divine life with His divine glory. Concerning John 12:24 we often speak about the release of the divine life. Now we need to see that the divine glory of Christ was released with His divine life. When we received Christ, we received His life, and this life is His glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Shell of His Humanity Being Broken through His Crucifixion, and All the Elements of His Divinity Being Released</H2><P>When the shell of the Lord's humanity was broken through His crucifixion, which was the baptism He went through, all the elements of His divinity-His divine life and His divine glory-were released. In Luke 12:50 the Lord Jesus said, "I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!" The Lord's baptism was His crucifixion. He longed to be baptized, to be crucified, in order to be released. He was pressed, constrained, in His flesh, and He desired to be released by the baptism of His death. Through the breaking of the shell of His humanity by His death, His glory was released. His release was His being glorified. We need to praise Christ for His death because His death was His release.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Life-releasing Death</H2><P>In the sense explained above, Christ's death is considered the life-releasing death with His glory released simultaneously. We cannot separate His life from His glory. When His life was released, His glory was released also.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. CHRIST'S BEING GLORIFIED BY THE FATHER WITH THE DIVINE GLORY</H2><P>The release of the glory of Christ's divinity was His being glorified by the Father with the divine glory (John 12:23-24) in His resurrection through His death (Luke 24:26).</P><P>John 7:39b says, "The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified." Many readers of the Bible might find this verse easier to understand if resurrected were used instead of glorified, for then the verse would say, "The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been resurrected." But the verse does not say "had not yet been resurrected"; it says "had not yet been glorified." However, glorified actually stands for resurrected, for the Lord was glorified when He was resurrected. In Luke 24:26 the Lord said of Himself, "Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory?" This refers to His resurrection (v.46), which brought Him into glory (1 Cor. 15:43a; Acts 3:13a, 15a). For Christ to enter into His glory, into His glorification, was for Him to enter into His resurrection. This means that He was glorified in His resurrection. His resurrection was His glorification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. CHRIST PRAYING THAT HIS FATHER WOULD GLORIFY HIM</H2><P>In His human living Christ prayed that His Father would glorify Him (John 17:1), and the Father answered His prayer (Acts 3:13). The subject of Christ's great prayer in John17 was His glorification by the Father. Acts 3:13 says, "The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him." This was the Father's answer to Christ's prayer in John17. The Lord Jesus prayed that the Father would glorify Him, and the Father answered Him by resurrecting Him.</P><P>Acts 3:13 uses the expression the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, which indicates that God is the God of resurrection. A similar expression is used in Matthew 22, where the Sadducees were arguing with the Lord Jesus about resurrection. In His answer to the Sadducees He said, "But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living" (vv. 31-32). Here the Lord seemed to be saying, "God is the living God. As the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, He is the God of living persons. If you say that there is no resurrection, then Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will remain in the tomb. But God is the God of resurrection, and these three forefathers will not remain dead but will be resurrected to be living." As God is the God of the living and is called the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, so the dead Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will be resurrected.</P><P>According to the New Testament thought resurrection is a release in life, and this release in life is a matter of glorification. Just before He was about to be crucified, the Lord Jesus prayed not that the Father would resurrect Him but that the Father would glorify Him. As we have pointed out, the Father answered this prayer for glorification by resurrecting the Lord Jesus. Glorification is therefore a synonym of resurrection. However, glorification is not for resurrection; rather, resurrection is for glorification. Resurrection is the cause, and glorification is the effect, the result.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. GLORIFICATION TRANSFERRING CHRIST FROM THE STAGE OF HIS INCARNATION INTO THE STAGE OF HIS INCLUSION</H2><P>Such a glorification is a transfer, transferring Christ from the stage of His incarnation into the stage of His inclusion, in which He, as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</P><P>If we glorify a certain person in the sense of praising and exalting him, this kind of glorification does not transfer him. No matter how much he is glorified by being exalted and praised, he remains the same. However, God's glorification of Christ transferred Christ from one stage to another stage. He was in the first stage, the stage of incarnation, but He was transferred out of that stage into the second stage, the stage of inclusion. In the stage of inclusion He, as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</P><P>Christ's being glorified was a drastic change not only in His condition and situation but also in His nature, element, and essence. If we glorify someone by exalting him, we may change him in his condition and situation, but we do not change him in his nature, element, and essence. Because he is now praised instead of despised, his condition and situation are changed, but his nature, element, and essence remain the same. The glorification of Christ was very different. We need to see that Christ's being glorified by the Father was a drastic change not merely in condition and situation but also in His nature, in His element, and in His essence. This was the release of the glory of Christ's divinity through the baptism of His death on the cross.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ISSUE OF CHRIST'S GLORIFICATION&#151;THE INCORPORATION OF THE CONSUMMATED GOD WITH THE REGENERATED BELIEVERS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Through His glorification in His resurrection Christ became the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity, and became the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, and regenerated all His believers to be God's children, God's species.</li><li>Through this all Christ's believers have been brought into the union of life with the processed Triune God and mingled with the consummated God into an incorporation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God in His Divine Trinity is an incorporation&#151;John 14:10-11:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>By coinhering mutually&#151;"I am in the Father and the Father is in Me."</li>		<li>By working together as one&#151;"The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works."

You know, Lord, we are coming to a matter in Your holy Word which is most mysterious. We surely need You. Without You as the unveiling Spirit, we cannot see this matter. Lord, we trust in You for speaking, for listening, and for understanding. Defeat Your enemy, who for two thousand years has been deceiving Your people regarding this matter. Amen.</P><P>In considering the issue of Christ's glorification, we will use a very particular word&#151;incorporation. This word is often used in business, but according to my knowledge it has not previously been used in interpreting the holy Word. In this message we need to see that the issue of Christ's glorification is the incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers.</P><P>The issue of Christ's glorification is an incorporation. An incorporation usually involves a number of parties. What God plans to do in His economy is to incorporate all His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people with Himself as the consummated God into a great incorporation.</P><P>The Gospel of John, a book in which this incorporation is fully unveiled, is composed of three sections. John 1:1 through 12:16 is the first section. Although 7:39 says that "the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified," glorification is not covered in this section. The second section, which begins with 12:17 and ends at 17:26, is concerned with Christ's glorification. The issue, the outcome, of this glorification is an incorporation, which is revealed in chapter fourteen. The third section, chapters eighteen through twenty-one, covers Christ's crucifixion and resurrection.</P><P>Chapter twelve unveils Christ's glorification in a particular way. The Lord Jesus said that He was a grain of wheat (v.24), and His intrinsic content&#151;the glory of His divinity&#151;was concealed within the shell of His flesh. As the unique grain of wheat He needed to be put into death so that His intrinsic content could be released. The issue of this release, this glorification, was the producing of a universal incorporation. This incorporation is revealed in a full and detailed way in chapter fourteen. This means that the incorporation revealed in chapter fourteen is the issue of the glorification unveiled in chapter twelve. If we see this, we will realize that we cannot know chapter fourteen without understanding the glorification in chapter twelve.</P><P>The main point in chapter fourteen of John is incorporation. In verses 20 and 17 the word in is used four times. These four ins are the base for our understanding of the universal incorporation of the consummated Triune God with the regenerated believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. CHRIST BECOMING THE FIRSTBORN SON AND THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT AND REGENERATING ALL HIS BELIEVERS TO BE GOD'S CHILDREN, GOD'S SPECIES</H2><P>Through His glorification in His resurrection Christ became the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity, and became the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, and regenerated all His believers to be God's children, God's species.</P><P>How could Christ, who was the only begotten Son of God from eternity, become the firstborn Son of God? This is a mystery which has not been covered adequately by traditional Christian theology. The firstborn Son of God and the only begotten Son of God are the same one person, but there is nevertheless a difference between the firstborn Son and the only begotten Son. The difference is that the only begotten Son of God has divinity but not humanity, whereas the firstborn Son of God has both divinity and humanity. The only begotten Son of God is God, but the firstborn Son of God is both God and man. When Christ, who is the very God, became a man, He did not set aside His divinity. Rather, He retained His divinity, but, as Philippians 2 indicates, He concealed His divinity within His humanity (vv. 6-7). Through His incarnation He became the God-man, the One who is both the complete God and a perfect man. Before His incarnation He was the only begotten Son of God, and as such He had nothing to do with man. However, when He was incarnated, He became a man, and thus was no longer just God but was both God and man.</P><P>According to Romans 1 the gospel of God, the complete gospel preached in the New Testament, concerns the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord. This wonderful person has two natures&#151;the divine nature and the human nature, divinity and humanity. Verses 3 and 4 say, "Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord." According to the flesh He is the seed of David, a descendant of David. The seed of David implies Christ's human nature. According to the flesh He is a human descendant of David, but according to the Spirit of holiness&#151;that is, according to His divinity&#151;He has been designated to be the Son of God with His humanity as well as with His divinity. The word designated in verse 4 is very significant. Before His incarnation Christ was already the Son of God (John 1:18; Rom. 8:3). By incarnation He put on an element, the human flesh, which had nothing to do with divinity. By resurrection His human nature was sanctified, uplifted, and transformed. Hence, by resurrection He was designated the Son of God with His humanity (Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5). In this way the only begotten Son of God was made the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity. This matter is basic for understanding that the issue of Christ's glorification is the incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers.</P><P>In addition to becoming the firstborn Son of God, Christ became the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ. Furthermore, in His resurrection He regenerated all His believers to be God's children, God's species. In His incarnation He, the very God, became a man, and in His resurrection He regenerated His believers, who are men, and thereby made them the children of God. He was God becoming a man, and now we are men becoming God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. In this sense, we may say that He was God becoming a man, and now we, who are the children of God, are men becoming gods. The children of God are gods. However, to avoid theological misunderstanding, it may be better to say that as children of God we are God-men in the divine species.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. CHRIST'S BELIEVERS BEING BROUGHT INTO THE UNION OF LIFE WITH THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD AND MINGLED WITH THE CONSUMMATED GOD INTO AN INCORPORATION</H2><P>Through the matters mentioned above all Christ's believers have been brought into the union of life with the processed Triune God and mingled with the consummated God into an incorporation. Formerly, we had nothing to do with God, but regeneration has brought us into the union of life with the processed Triune God. Union, however, is not sufficient to bring us into an incorporation with the Triune God. In order to be incorporated with the consummated God, we need to be mingled with Him. Thus, through Christ's glorification we have not only been brought into a union with the processed Triune God, but we have also been mingled with the consummated God into an incorporation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. God in His Divine Trinity Being an Incorporation</H2><P>God in His Divine Trinity is an incorporation (John 14:10-11). The three of the Divine Trinity are an incorporation both in what They are and in what They do.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. By Coinhering Mutually</H2><P>The three of the Divine Trinity are incorporated by coinhering mutually. Concerning this, the Lord Jesus said, "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?" (v. 10a). In verse 11a He went on to say, "Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me." The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son by a mutual coinhering.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. By Working Together as One</H2><P>The three of the Divine Trinity are an incorporation also by working together as one. In verses 10b and 11b the Lord said, "The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works....Believe...because of the works themselves." Here the Lord seemed to be saying, "You have seen all the works which I have done. These works were not done by Me, for I never did anything of Myself. Whatever I did was the Father's work. The Father and I work together mutually." This working together as one reveals that the Divine Trinity is an incorporation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Consummated Triune God and the Regenerated Believers Being an Incorporation</H2><P>The consummated Triune God and the regenerated believers are an incorporation (John 14:16-19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Spirit Dwelling in the Regenerated Believers</H2><P>The Spirit, the third of the Divine Trinity as another Comforter, being the reality of the Son, the second of the Divine Trinity as the first Comforter and the embodiment of the Triune God, does not only abide with the regenerated believers but also dwells in them (vv. 16-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Son Coming Back to Be Another Comforter to Make the Believers Live with Him</H2><P>The Son as the first Comforter left His believers through His death and came back to be another Comforter to them through His resurrection to make them live with Him (vv.18-19). This is why He said, "Because I live, you also shall live" (v. 19b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Consummated Triune God and the Regenerated Believers Becoming an Incorporation in the Resurrection of Christ</H2><P>The consummated Triune God and the regenerated believers became an incorporation in the resurrection of Christ. John 14:20 says, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you." "In that day": This is in the day of the Son's resurrection. "You will know that I am in My Father": The Son and the Father are incorporated into one. "And you in Me": The regenerated believers are incorporated into the Son and into the Father in the Son. "And I in you": The Son in the Father is incorporated into the regenerated believers. Here we have three ins. In verse17 we have a fourth in: "The Spirit of reality...abides with you and shall be in you." The in of the Spirit of reality in verse17 is the totality of the three ins in verse 20. The in in verse17 is a general statement, and the three ins in verse 20 are the detailed statement.</P><P>In this message we have been burdened to point out that Christ's glorification produced an issue&#151;an incorporation. According to the divine revelation in the Scriptures God's work in the universe is to complete His economy, and God's desire in His economy is to have a unique incorporation. This is His universal concern. Millions of Adam's descendants have become believers in Christ. God's intention is to incorporate Himself with all the believers of Christ into one incorporation. The three of the Divine Trinity are an incorporation by coinhering mutually and by working together as one. This means that the three of the Divine Trinity are an incorporation by what They are and by what They do. This is the beginning of the universal incorporation, an incorporation which started with God Himself. God's intention is that all the believers of Christ would be incorporated into His incorporation to be an enlarged incorporation. This enlarged incorporation is unveiled in John 14:16-20. May the Lord open our eyes to see that the Triune God, who is Himself an incorporation, has incorporated all the believers of Christ into His unique, universal incorporation. This incorporation is the issue of Christ's glorification.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE THREE ASPECTS OF THE INCORPORATION OF THE CONSUMMATED GOD WITH THE REGENERATED BELIEVERS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The first aspect of the incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers is the house of the Father&#151;John 14:2:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Father's house was typified by the temple&#151;John 2:16-21.</li>	<li>The Father's house is a divine and human incorporation of the processed and consummated God constituted with His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed elect.</li>	<li>All the believers in Christ, redeemed through His blood, regenerated with His life by His Spirit, and transformed with the divine element by the life-giving Spirit, are the "abodes" in the Father's house.</li>	<li>This Father's house is built up by the constant visitation to the redeemed elect of the Father and the Son with the Spirit who indwells the redeemed elect to be the mutual dwelling place of the consummated Triune God and His redeemed elect&#151;John 14:23:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ as the cornerstone, growing into the holy temple of the Lord, the dwelling place of God in the believers' spirit&#151;Eph. 2:19-22.</li>		<li>In this building, Christ is making His home in the hearts of the believers strengthened in their inner man by the Father according to the riches of His glory with power through His Spirit unto the fullness (expression) of the consummated Triune God&#151;Eph. 3:16-19.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The Father's house is both:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The household of God, constituted by the children of God, the species of God, with His divine life for their growth in life and His manifestation&#151;Eph. 2:19.</li>		<li>The kingdom of God, composed of the believers in Christ as the citizens (John 3:3, 5; Rev. 1:4,6; Eph. 2:19; Matt. 16:18-19; Acts 1:3; 28:31), in two aspects:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>The kingdom of God as the church life in this age&#151;Rom. 14:17:				<ol class="none">				<li>1) For the believers' exercise and equipping in the divine authority through the endurance of sufferings&#151;Rev. 1:9; Acts 14:22; Matt. 18:18.</li>				<li>2) For the believers to learn how to reign in life&#151;Rom. 5:17.</li>				</ol></li>			<li>The kingdom of Christ in the kingdom age&#151;Rev. 11:15; 2 Pet. 1:11:				<ol class="none">				<li>1) For the overcoming saints to reign with Christ&#151;Rev. 20:4, 6; 2 Tim. 2:12.</li>				<li>2) To rule over all the nations&#151;Rev. 2:26; 12:5.</li>				</ol></li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	<li>The purpose of the Father's house:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>For the invisible and mysterious Triune God to have a visible and solid manifestation&#151;the church&#151;among men on the earth&#151;1 Tim. 3:15-16.</li>		<li>For the satisfaction and rest of the processed and consummated Triune God.</li>		<li>For the eternal and purposeful Triune God to carry out His eternal economy to consummate the New Jerusalem as His eternal goal for His eternal expansion and expression.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol><P>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that You are training us. We confess that we are still in the natural life which we received through birth. Our concepts and our understanding of the Bible are very natural. Lord, deliver us from being natural. You have regenerated us so that we would no longer be natural, but we remain in our natural life, and we are natural even in seeking You. Lord, we need You to speak a new word to us once again. Lord, have mercy upon us and be our High Priest, the One who is easily touched by the feeling of our infirmities. Lord, speak a word according to Your high priesthood and shepherd us and take care of us, especially of the co-workers who have been speaking for years in a natural way without any real understanding. Lord, be merciful to us and bless us under Your mercy. Amen.</P><P>In the Lord's recovery we need to learn how to know the Bible in its intrinsic significance. If we know the Bible in this way, we will have a proper theology. The theology of today's Christianity is wrong or inadequate in many ways. We have been raised up, taught, and trained under the influence of this theology, and we are still under its influence. Either consciously or subconsciously, the influence of the theology of Christianity remains in our being. We need to uproot this influence and not follow the way of the old theology in presenting messages.</P><P>In the previous message we saw that the issue of Christ's being glorified is an incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers. Before we begin to consider the three aspects of this incorporation, I would like to say a further word about the universal incorporation as the issue of Christ's glorification.</P><P>I have spent more than seventy years studying the Bible, but only very recently did I see that the Bible actually unveils just one thing&#151;the universal incorporation. The purposeful God has an economy, and in His economy He intends to have a universal incorporation. Deep within Himself, God has the purpose to produce a universal incorporation. Eventually, for eternity in the new heaven and new earth, there will be the New Jerusalem, the unique goal of God in His economy.</P><P>Although we have seen that the New Jerusalem is the goal of God's economy, we did not see that the New Jerusalem is an incorporation. In Revelation 21:2 the apostle John says, "I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem," and in the next verse he speaks of the New Jerusalem as "the tabernacle of God." As the tabernacle of God the New Jerusalem is God's dwelling place. We are quite familiar with this aspect of the New Jerusalem; it has become old knowledge to us. Now we need to learn something new and see that as the tabernacle of God the New Jerusalem is the universal incorporation.</P><P>At this juncture we need to consider the Lord's word to the church in Pergamos (2:12-17), the third of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3. Pergamos in Greek means "marriage," implying union. As a sign, the church in Pergamos prefigures the church that entered into a marriage union with the world to be one with the world. As part of His promise to the overcomer in Pergamos, the Lord Jesus said, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna" (v. 17). The hidden manna refers to Christ. Manna is a type of Christ as the heavenly food that enables God's people to go His way. A portion of manna was preserved in a golden pot concealed in the ark (Exo. 16:32-34; Heb. 9:4). This hidden manna, signifying the hidden Christ, is a special portion reserved for His overcoming believers, who overcome the degradation of the worldly church. While the church goes the way of the world, these overcomers come forward to abide in the Holy of Holies, where they enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion for their daily supply.</P><P>Now we come to a crucial matter: To eat the hidden manna is to be incorporated into the tabernacle. The tabernacle in the Old Testament is a sign of the universal incorporation. Christ as the hidden manna is the center of the tabernacle. The hidden manna is in the golden pot; the golden pot is in the ark, made of acacia wood overlaid with gold; and this ark is in the Holy of Holies. The hidden manna, which signifies Christ, is in the golden pot, which refers to God. The manna in the golden pot indicates that Christ is in the Father (John 14:10a, 11a). The ark is in the Holy of Holies, and the Holy of Holies is our spirit. Today, our spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit is the Holy of Holies. From this we can see that Christ as the hidden manna is in God the Father as the golden pot; that the Father is in Christ as the ark with His two natures, divinity and humanity; and that this Christ as the indwelling Spirit lives in our regenerated spirit to be the reality of the Holy of Holies. This means that the Son is in the Father, that the Father is in the Son, and that the Son as the Spirit is the reality of the Holy of Holies. This implies and corresponds to the four ins in John 14:16-20. Verse 20 says, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you," and verse 17 says, "The Spirit of reality...shall be in you." The Son is in the Father, we are in the Son, the Son is in us, and we are indwelt by the Spirit of reality. This is the incorporation of the processed God with the regenerated believers.</P><P>The way to be incorporated into the tabernacle is to eat the hidden manna. The more we eat Christ, the more we are incorporated into the Triune God as a universal incorporation. By eating the hidden manna we are incorporated into the tabernacle. The tabernacle in the Old Testament was a figure of the New Jerusalem, which is called the tabernacle of God. As the tabernacle of God the New Jerusalem is the universal incorporation. This universal incorporation is God's eternal goal. The New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God, and the center of this tabernacle is Christ as the hidden manna for us to eat. The way to be in the New Jerusalem is to eat Christ. The more we eat Christ, the more we are incorporated into this universal incorporation.</P><P>We have pointed out that the church in Pergamos signifies the worldly church, the church which has married the world to be in union with the world. The world will perish in the lake of fire. Are you a part of the world, or are you a part of the New Jerusalem as God's tabernacle, the universal incorporation? The Lord promised the overcomers in the church in Pergamos that if they ate Him, they would be incorporated into the universal incorporation, the consummated New Jerusalem. We should not be joined to the world&#151;we should be incorporated into the New Jerusalem by eating Christ as the hidden manna.</P><P>Let us now begin to consider the three aspects of the incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE FIRST ASPECT OF THE INCORPORATION OF THE CONSUMMATED GOD WITH THE REGENERATED BELIEVERS BEING THE HOUSE OF THE FATHER</H2><P>The first aspect of the incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers is the house of the Father (John 14:2). Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of John are a long message given by the Lord Jesus shortly before He was arrested. Each of these three chapters covers one of three aspects of the universal incorporation. In John 14 we have the Father's house; in John 15, the Son's vine; and in John 16, the child born of the Spirit. The house of the Father, the true vine of the Son, and the child of the Spirit are the three different aspects of the universal incorporation as the issue of Christ's glorification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Typified by the Temple</H2><P>The Father's house was typified by the temple of God in 2:16-21.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. A Divine and Human Incorporation of the Processed and Consummated God Constituted with His Redeemed, Regenerated, and Transformed Elect</H2><P>The Father's house is a divine and human incorporation of the processed and consummated God constituted with His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed elect. The Father's house is not only a constitution&#151;it is an incorporation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. All the Believers in Christ Being the "Abodes" in the Father's House</H2><P>In 14:2a the Lord Jesus said, "In My Father's house are many abodes." All the believers in Christ, redeemed through His blood, regenerated with His life by His Spirit, and transformed with the divine element by the life-giving Spirit, are the "abodes" in the Father's house. In our houses we have rooms. As believers in Christ and members of the Body of Christ, we all are rooms, abodes, in the Father's house.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Built Up by the Constant Visitation to the Redeemed Elect of the Father and the Son with the Spirit</H2><P>The Father's house is built up by the constant visitation to the redeemed elect of the Father and the Son with the Spirit who indwells the redeemed elect to be the mutual dwelling place of the consummated Triune God and His redeemed elect. In 14:23 the Lord Jesus said, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him." Verse2 tells us that in the Father's house there are many abodes, and in verse 23 we see that these abodes are built up by the Father and the Son's visitation to those who love Him. The Spirit is not explicitly mentioned in verse 23 but rather is implied, for the Spirit dwells in the regenerated spirit of all those who love the Lord Jesus.</P><P>From our experience we know that the Father and the Son pay us a constant visitation. In our daily life the Father and the Son often come to visit us. We may be at home, at school, or at work, but wherever we may be the Father and the Son come to visit us to do a building work in us, making an abode which will be a mutual dwelling place for the Triune God and for us. This is the building up of the Father's house through the constant visitation of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Built upon the Foundation of the Apostles and Prophets</H2><P>The Father's house is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ as the cornerstone, and it is growing into the holy temple of the Lord, the dwelling place of God in the believers' spirit (Eph. 2:19-22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Christ Making His Home in the Hearts of the Believers</H2><P>In this building Christ is making His home in the hearts of the believers strengthened in their inner man by the Father according to the riches of His glory with power through His Spirit unto the fullness (the expression) of the consummated Triune God (Eph. 3:16-19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Father's House Being Both the Household of God and the Kingdom of God</H2><P>The Father's house is both the household of God and the kingdom of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Household of God</H2><P>As the household of God the Father's house is constituted by the children of God, the species of God, with His divine life for their growth in life and for His manifestation (Eph. 2:19). This life is for our growth in life and also for God's manifestation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Kingdom of God</H2><P>The Father's house is also the kingdom of God, which is composed of the believers in Christ as the citizens (John 3:3,5; Rev. 1:4, 6; Eph. 2:19; Matt. 16:18-19; Acts 1:3; 28:31), in two aspects.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Kingdom of God in This Age</H2><P>The first aspect of the Father's house as the kingdom of God is the kingdom of God as the church life in this age (Rom. 14:17). The church life today is the kingdom of God for the believers' exercise and equipping in the divine authority through the endurance of sufferings (Rev. 1:9; Acts 14:22; Matt. 18:18) and for the believers to learn how to reign in life (Rom. 5:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Kingdom of Christ in the Kingdom Age</H2><P>The second aspect of the Father's house as the kingdom of God is the kingdom of Christ in the kingdom age, that is, in the millennium, the thousand-year kingdom (Rev. 11:15; 2 Pet. 1:11). This aspect of the kingdom is for the overcoming saints to reign with Christ (Rev. 20:4, 6; 2 Tim. 2:12) and to rule over all the nations (Rev. 2:26; 12:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Purpose of the Father's House</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. For a Visible and Solid Manifestation</H2><P>The purpose of the Father's house is first for the invisible and mysterious Triune God to have a visible and solid manifestation&#151;the church&#151;among men on the earth (1 Tim. 3:15-16.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. For Satisfaction and Rest</H2><P>Second, the purpose of the Father's house is for the satisfaction and rest of the processed and consummated Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. For the Triune God to Carry Out His Economy</H2><P>The purpose of the Father's house is also for the eternal and purposeful Triune God to carry out His eternal economy to consummate the New Jerusalem as His eternal goal for His eternal expansion and expression. The house of God, which is God's dwelling place, eventually will be the New Jerusalem, God's eternal goal for His eternal expansion and expression.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE THREE ASPECTS OF THE INCORPORATION OF THE CONSUMMATED GOD WITH THE REGENERATED BELIEVERS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>The second aspect of the incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers is the true vine&#151;John 15:1-8, 16:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The true vine as a sign of the all-inclusive Christ is the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God.</li>	<li>Its branches are the believers of Christ, who by nature were branches of the wild olive tree and have been grafted into the cultivated olive tree (Rom. 11:17, 24) through their believing into Christ (John 3:15).

Lord, we are short of words to utter it. Forgive us. We need You to be our utterance. Lord, You have to defeat Your enemy, who has been cheating and deceiving Your saints for centuries. Your elect through the past twenty centuries have been blinded, veiled, from seeing this. Thank You that today at the consummation of this dark age You are so merciful to us. You have come to Your recovery to open up this matter, to show us something which the angels and the worldly people have never seen. We ask You to open our eyes, and we are here seeking after You to see this matter. Amen.</P><P>With these messages, I feel that we all need to see a vision, not just learn the doctrine. We have to see that in the entire universe, there is only one thing that God wants, that is, the universal incorporation of Himself as the consummated God with the regenerated believers. In these days, this great universal incorporation is before me moment by moment. The entire world will go into the lake of fire. The only thing left will be this great universal incorporation. Although the word incorporation is not used in the New Testament, what is actually unveiled in the New Testament in the way of a vision is this universal incorporation. This incorporation started from God. The Triune God does have three parties&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The three in the Divine Trinity were incorporated already in eternity past. Through His incarnation, this incorporated One came into time. Whatever He does in time is to incorporate all His chosen ones into His incorporation to make a great universal incorporation.</P><P>We have seen that the way to be incorporated into this unique incorporation is to enjoy Christ, to eat Him, to partake of Him. This is why the New Testament stresses the matter of eating. The Lord said, "I am the bread of life....he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" (John 6:48, 57). When we eat Him, we live by Him in this great incorporation, which today is the corporate Body of Christ and which eventually consummates the New Jerusalem.</P><P>In John 16:12-15 the Lord said that He had many things to tell the disciples which they could not bear at that time. But when the Spirit of reality would come, He would unveil these things to them. These things were unveiled in the twenty-two Epistles of the New Testament, including Revelation. Revelation is the longest Epistle. The Epistles reveal that God's goal is to have a great universal incorporation of Himself with His believers. Ultimately, this incorporation is the New Jerusalem, which is God's goal.</P><P>In our ministry we have used three words to describe the believers' relationship with the Triune God: union, mingling, and incorporation. When I was in mainland China before 1949, we mostly used the word union. We have a divine union in life with God. We are united to Him in life. When I went from mainland China to Taiwan, we began to put out a paper called The Ministry of the Word. That publication served all the churches in southeast Asia in the Chinese language. While I was writing for this publication, I realized that the relationship we have with our Triune God is not only one of union but also one of mingling. When I came to the United States, I began to use the word mingling quite much. In the early history of the church, some taught heresy by saying that the two natures of Christ were merged into one and became a third nature. This is not the proper understanding of the word mingle. We agree with the definition of this word in Webster's unabridged dictionary, which says that to mingle is "to combine or join (one thing with another, or two or more things together), especially so that the original elements are distinguishable in the combination." According to this definition, when two or more things are mingled together, their original natures are not lost but remain distinguishable. When God and man were mingled together, they became one entity but no third nature was produced. This is according to the type in Leviticus 2:4-5 of the fine flour mingled with oil to make the meal offering.</P><P>Union is concerning our oneness in life with the Lord. Mingling is related to the divine and human natures. The Lord has gone further to show us that our relationship with Him is not only one of union and mingling but also one of incorporation. John 14 stresses the word in four times. Verse17 says that the Spirit of reality, another Comforter, would not only be with the disciples but also in them. The Spirit of reality, the person, is in us. Humanly speaking, we can have our physical father's life and nature, but our father as a person cannot be in us. But John 14:17 says that the Spirit of reality as a person would be in us.</P><P>Then in verse 20 the Lord said that on the day of resurrection the disciples would know that He is in the Father, that they are in Him, and that He is in them. The Son, the person, is in the Father, another person. Then we, the millions of persons, are in the Son, the person. Also, the Son is in us. Union and mingling refer to our relationship with the Lord in our life and nature but not in our person. Humanly speaking, no person can be in another person. But in the divine and mystical realm, the consummated God and the regenerated believers, the persons, indwell one another. This is an incorporation. In this universal, divine-human incorporation, persons indwell one another, that is, they coinhere.</P><P>In the whole universe, there are God, man, Satan, and the angels. The angels, including Satan and his fallen ones, are not considered persons. God and man are both corporate persons. God is not just a single person. He is three&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;a corporate person. We, the millions of believers, are also a corporate person. These persons are now in one another. This is not a mingling but an incorporation.</P><P>The word incorporation also indicates that these persons are incorporated together to carry out their purpose, that is, to carry out God's economy. God's economy is a big career, a big business. In order to carry out His economy, God needs man to be incorporated into Him. Man and God, humanity and divinity, as persons, are incorporated together for the same purpose, for the same goal, to carry out the same career, that is, God's eternal economy.</P><P>This divine-human, unlimited incorporation is the highlight of the Gospel of John. God's intention, His desire, and His career are to carry out His economy. The centrality and universality of God's eternal economy is Christ. Through His incarnation, death, and resurrection, Christ as the one grain of wheat became the many grains to be ground and blent together into one loaf. This loaf is the church, which is the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:17). Eventually, this Body of Christ, at the end of the sixty-six books of the Bible, will be the New Jerusalem. This holy city is the goal of God's economy&#151;the enlarged, universal incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers. The Triune God intends and desires to have this. This is His purpose, His goal, to fulfill His desire to satisfy His heart. The conclusion of the entire sixty-six books of the Bible is the New Jerusalem. The Bible begins with God and ends with a city. The unique God is eventually enlarged into one city for His eternal enlargement and eternal expression as a great universal incorporation.</P><P>In order to see this revelation, it will be helpful for us to reconsider how the New Testament is composed. The first three books, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are called the Synoptic Gospels; although they have some element of mystery, they are not Gospels of the eternal mystery. The eternal mystery is in the last Gospel, the Gospel of John. The Synoptic Gospels can be more easily understood than John can. John begins by saying, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (v. 1). Then verse 14 says, "The Word became flesh." John the Baptist saw this One and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" (v. 29). He also saw the Spirit as a dove descending upon and abiding upon Christ (v. 32). Then at the end of chapter one of John, we can paraphrase what the Lord said to Nathanael in this way: "You recognize Me as the Son of God, but you will see the angels ascending and descending on Me, the Son of Man" (v.51). All of these verses show that John 1 is a mystery. In order to see this mystery, we need to know how to interpret all these figures.</P><P>In chapter twelve of John this Wonderful One was exalted by His disciples, but He did not accept their kind of exaltation. That meant nothing to Him. Instead, He said, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified" (v. 23). What a mystery glorification is! Then He explained that one grain of wheat, if it does not die, abides alone. But if it dies, it will be glorified (v. 24). Christ as the one grain of wheat, through His death and resurrection, became many grains, and these many grains are the issue of His being glorified.</P><P>The Gospel of John explains the issue of His glorification in chapter fourteen. This issue is the universal incorporation. First, the three of the Triune God were incorporated from eternity. In John 14:10 the Lord told Philip, "I am in the Father and the Father is in Me." This reveals that the three of the Divine Trinity are incorporated into one incorporation by Their mutual coinhering. Verse 10 of John 14 unveils to us the beginning of this universal incorporation in eternity. Verse11 shows that the three are also an incorporation by Their mutual work. They work together as one.</P><P>One day the second of the Divine Trinity was sent by this incorporation. Acts 2:23 indicates that the three parties of this universal incorporation had a council (1 Pet. 1:20). In this council it was agreed to send the second into time to become a man (Micah 5:2). Before the incarnation, this universal incorporation consisted of three parties. Then the second of the Divine Trinity brought this divine incorporation into humanity. His disciples always wondered, "Who is this man?" They talked secretly among themselves about Him, but they did not know who He was intrinsically. In John 14:20 the Lord told them that on the day of resurrection they would know that He is in the Father, that they are in Him, and that He is in them. These three ins reveal that the consummated Triune God and the regenerated believers became an incorporation in the resurrection of Christ.</P><P>In John 14 the Lord revealed that He came as the first Comforter and that another One would come as the second Comforter. The second Comforter is the reality of the first Comforter. He is the Spirit of reality, and verse 17 says that this Spirit of reality would be in the disciples. The in of verse17 as a general statement is the totality of the three ins in verse20 as a detailed statement. When the Spirit of reality is in us, the totality of the Triune God is in us to incorporate us into the universal incorporation. In eternity it was a divine incorporation. By being enlarged, this incorporation became a divine and human incorporation. This incorporation is the house of the Father, the universal vine tree of the Son, and the new man of the Spirit.</P><P>In John 16:12-15 the Lord told the disciples, "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you." The Spirit of reality declares all the things concerning Christ in the last twenty-two books of the New Testament, the Epistles.</P><P>I began to love the Bible from the day I was saved in 1925. I have spent the past seventy-one years studying the Bible, but it was not until recently that I saw so clearly that the goal of God's economy is the enlarged, universal, divine-human incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers. The unbelievers will go into the lake of fire. They have nothing to do with this universal incorporation. But all of the believers will eventually be incorporated into this one great incorporation. The final consummation of this universal incorporation is the New Jerusalem. Mainly three apostles&#151;Paul, Peter, and John&#151;present this revelation to us in their Epistles piece by piece and bit by bit. By the Lord's mercy, we have put these pieces together to see a full and complete vision of this universal incorporation.</P><P>The three aspects of the universal incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers are revealed in John 14 through 16: a house, a tree, and a child. John 16 shows us the child born of the Spirit (v. 21). This child is Christ. Eventually, this child becomes the new man. In Colossians 3 we are told that Christ is this new man. He is every member and is in every member of the new man (vv.10-11). In God's eyes the house, the tree, and the man in John 14 through 16 are all Christ. Christ is the house, the temple, the dwelling place of God; Christ is the vine tree; and Christ is the new man. In the previous message we saw the Father's house. In this message we want to see the true vine and the new child, the new man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SECOND ASPECT OF THE INCORPORATION OF THE CONSUMMATED GOD WITH THE REGENERATED BELIEVERS BEING THE TRUE VINE</H2><P>The Lord is not a tall pine tree but a spreading vine tree (John 15:1-8, 16). The fruit of a vine tree is easy to reach and eat. This is a picture of today's Christ. Today's Christ is spreading Himself everywhere throughout the globe. In 1958 I was invited to speak in London to a group of people who were considered the most spiritual people on this earth. I considered them the last group of saints in the line of the inner life. I stayed with them for four weeks. One day they took me to see a big vine tree, which is the vine of the queen. The British people are proud of this vine. When they asked me what I thought of it, I said that I had seen a vine tree which is much bigger. The vine tree I have seen is Christ as the true vine. This vine needs the entire globe for its spreading. In John 15 the Lord said, "I am the true vine" (v.1). This means that actually all of the other vine trees are false, including the queen's vine. Only one vine is uniquely true. This is Christ spreading around the globe. Christ as the true vine has spread Himself from America to places such as Russia, Poland, Romania, South Africa, South America, New Zealand, and Australia.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Sign of the All-inclusive Christ</H2><P>The true vine is a sign of the all-inclusive Christ as the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Its Branches Being the Believers of Christ</H2><P>Its branches are the believers of Christ, who by nature were branches of the wild olive tree and have been grafted into the cultivated olive tree (Rom. 11:17, 24) through their believing into Christ (John 3:15). Both the cultivated olive tree and the true vine signify Christ. Hence, to be grafted into the cultivated olive tree is to be grafted into the true vine.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Regenerated with the Divine Life</H2><P>Its grafted branches have been regenerated with the divine life, brought into the life-union with the crucified and resurrected Christ, and incorporated with the processed and consummated Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. For His Universal Spreading</H2><P>This is for the unlimited Triune God's multiplication as the increase of the immeasurable Christ, the embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God (John 3:29-30), for His universal spreading through the fruit-bearing of the believers of Christ as the branches by their faithful abiding in Christ (15:4-5, 16) for the glorification of the Father (v.8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE THIRD ASPECT OF THE INCORPORATION OF THE CONSUMMATED GOD WITH THE REGENERATED BELIEVERS BEING THE CHILD OF THE SPIRIT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A New Child, a New Man</H2><P>A new child, a new man, was born by the consummated Spirit (John 16:21, 13-15). This new man was created by Christ on the cross by abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances (Eph. 2:15). While Christ was dying on the cross, He was creating this new man. Also this new man was regenerated by the Father with the resurrected Christ in His resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 1:4) and born by the Spirit in the believers' spirit (John 3:6b). The first group of Christ's believers who suffered Christ's departure through His death was the delivering woman (John 16:20-21). The Christ who returned in His resurrection was the newborn child (v. 22) to be the new man (Col. 3:10-11). Now we believers have to put on this new man through the renewing in the spirit of our mind (Eph. 4:23-24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. To Consummate the Body of Christ</H2><P>Our putting on the new man by being renewed in the spirit of our mind will eventually consummate the Body of Christ, and this Body of Christ which is the church will consummate the New Jerusalem.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE FUNCTIONS OF THE FATHER'S HOUSE, THE TRUE VINE, AND THE NEW CHILD</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The function of the Father's house:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>For the processed and consummated Triune God to have a mutual abode with the redeemed and regenerated believers in Christ&#151;John 14:2-3, 23.</li>	<li>For Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, to make His home in the hearts of His believers who are strengthened in their inner man by the Father, according to the riches of His glory, with power through His Spirit unto the fullness (expression) of the processed Triune God&#151;Eph. 3:16-19.</li>	<li>For the invisible and mysterious Triune God to have:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>A visible and solid household constituted by the children of God, the species of God, with His divine life for their growth in life and His satisfaction, rest, and manifestation&#151;Eph. 2:19.</li>		<li>A kingdom, composed of the believers in Christ as the citizens (John 3:3, 5; Rev. 1:4, 6; Eph. 2:19; Matt. 16:18-19; Acts 1:3), in two aspects:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>The kingdom of God as the church life in this age for the believers' exercise and equipping in the divine authority&#151;Rom. 14:17; Rev. 1:9; Acts 14:22; Matt. 18:18.</li>			<li>The kingdom of Christ in the kingdom age (Rev. 11:15; 2 Pet. 1:11) for the overcoming saints to reign with Christ over all the nations&#151;Rev. 20:4, 6; 2:26.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>The function of the true vine as a sign of the Son&#151;John 15:1-8, 16:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To have an organism in the Son for His multiplication, spreading, and glorification in His divine life&#151;v. 8.</li>	<li>Through the fruit-bearing of the believers in Christ as His grafted branches, by their faithful abiding in the organic vine&#151;vv. 4-5, 16.</li>	</ol></li><li>The function of the new child born of the Spirit&#151;John 16:13-15, 21:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To become the corporate new man as the increased Christ&#151;Col. 3:10-11; John 3:30.</li>	<li>To carry out God's eternal economy through the move and work of the consummated life-giving Spirit in building up the Body of Christ for the consummation of the New Jerusalem.</li>	</ol></li></ol><P>In this message we want to see the functions of the three aspects of the universal incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers. We have seen that these three aspects are a house, a tree, and a man. Christ is the house for God to have a mutual abiding place for His rest, satisfaction, and manifestation. Christ as the vine tree is God's enlargement for His multiplication, spreading, and glorification. Also, Christ is the new man to carry out God's eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE FUNCTION OF THE FATHER'S HOUSE</H2><P>God is the Owner of the entire universe, so in this universe there should be a house in which He can dwell.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. For the Processed and Consummated Triune God to Have a Mutual Abode</H2><P>The Father's house is for the processed and consummated Triune God to have a mutual abode with the redeemed and regenerated believers in Christ (John 14:2-3, 23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. For Christ to Make His Home in the Hearts of His Believers</H2><P>This house is also for Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, to make His home in the hearts of His believers who are strengthened in their inner man by the Father, according to the riches of His glory, with power through His Spirit unto the fullness (expression) of the processed Triune God (Eph. 3:16-19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. For the Invisible and Mysterious Triune God to Have a Household and a Kingdom</H2><P>The Father's house is for the invisible and mysterious Triune God to have a visible and solid household constituted by the children of God, the species of God, with His divine life for their growth in life and for His rest, satisfaction, and manifestation (Eph. 2:19). The house of God is the church (1Tim. 3:15), and the church is Christ because every member of the church is Christ (1 Cor. 12:12; Col. 3:10-11). The church is the composition of all the parts of Christ.</P><P>The Father's house is also for the invisible and mysterious Triune God to have a kingdom, composed of the believers in Christ as the citizens (John 3:3, 5; Rev. 1:4, 6; Eph. 2:19; Matt. 16:18-19; Acts 1:3), in two aspects. First, the kingdom of God as the church life in this age is for the believers' exercise and equipping in the divine authority (Rom. 14:17; Rev. 1:9; Acts 14:22; Matt. 18:18). Second, the kingdom of Christ in the kingdom age (Rev. 11:15; 2 Pet. 1:11) is for the overcoming saints to reign with Christ over all the nations (Rev. 20:4, 6; 2:26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II.

To Have an Organism in the Son</H2><P>The function of the true vine as a sign of the Son (John 15:1-8, 16) is for the Triune God to have an organism in the Son for His multiplication, spreading, and glorification in His divine life (v. 8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Through the Fruit-bearing of the Believers</H2><P>This is through the fruit-bearing of the believers in Christ as His grafted branches, by their faithful abiding in the organic vine (vv. 4-5, 16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III.

To Become the Corporate New Man</H2><P>The new child born of the Spirit (John 16:13-15, 21) becomes the corporate new man as the increased Christ (Col. 3:10-11; John 3:30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. To Carry Out God's Eternal Economy</H2><P>The function of the new man is to carry out God's eternal economy through the move and work of the consummated life-giving Spirit in building up the Body of Christ for the consummation of the New Jerusalem.</P><P>The functions of the Father's house, the true vine, and the new man are the contents of the New Testament in its twenty-two Epistles from Romans to Revelation. The twenty-two Epistles define these functions. The outline of this message is actually a crystallized abstract of the twenty-two Epistles. The Lord told the disciples in John 16 that He had many things to reveal to the disciples, but they could not bear them until the Spirit of reality would come to unveil all these things to them. This prophecy was fulfilled and the Spirit's unveiling is recorded in the twenty-two Epistles. The contents of these Epistles are a revelation of the unique universal incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers in three aspects with various functions. God needs a house for His rest, satisfaction, and manifestation; He needs a tree for His multiplication, spreading, and glorification; and He needs a man to carry out His eternal economy.</P></body></html>
