   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that the sanctifying life within us is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He lives in us, sanctifying us continuously by His eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By Christ being the sanctifying life, we are gradually being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>C. In God s Word, the Truth, Which Conveys</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>the Reality of the Holiness of God the Father</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In His prayer in John 17:17 to the Father, the Lord Jesus said, Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This word is truth, which conveys the reality of the holiness of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Father s word carries the reality of the Father with it.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is to be sanctified in God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This kind of sanctification not only changes our position but also our disposition, that is, what we are inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This holiness does not directly denote God s nature but rather an attribute of God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God s nature is holy, and this holy nature is conveyed in His word, because God s word transmits the holy nature of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we have the word as God s reality, this word sanctifies us subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This subjective sanctification is in the Spirit as the sanctifying power, by Christ as the sanctifying life, and in the word as the reality of the holiness of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word carries with it God s holy nature and dispenses this nature into our whole being, sanctifying us subjectively.</S>
