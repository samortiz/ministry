   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RESURRECTION MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now notice what the Lord said to Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Go unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God" 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord did not speak much with her; He gave her no long message.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There was absolutely nothing religious in that contact.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose we were Jesus: we would probably say, "Mary, let us bow our heads and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then let us sing a hymn and open to Psalm 16, where I will show you how I should rise from the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then surely we would say, "Now Mary, since you have learned everything, go and tell my disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I will stand with you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I will pray for you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God be with you."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But Jesus never did anything like this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He said one or two sentences that's all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No prayer, no singing, no Bible reading, no message, no promises of standing with you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was what happened early in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then in the evening of the same day, the disciples were in an extremely unsettled condition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some like Mary had seen the Lord after His resurrection and had brought the news to the others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some had seen the Lord during the day on the road to Emmaus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They came together not knowing where to turn or what to expect next.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suddenly the Lord Jesus was there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the doors were shut, but Jesus suddenly appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There was nothing formal, nothing religious, nothing arranged, nothing scheduled.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It simply says that Jesus came and stood in the midst and said unto them, "Peace be unto you."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Again there was no prayer, no singing, no Bible reading, no God bless you, no "I'm standing with you" no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Just "Peace be unto you."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After saying this, He did a very foolish thing to our natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He breathed upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jesus breathed into His disciples and said unto them, "Receive ye the Holy Spirit or we may say, as in Greek, the Holy Breath " v. 22 . Then, after breathing upon them, He said that they would be authorized either to forgive people or hold them sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That was all that was absolutely all!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is certainly nothing religious.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And there is no record that Jesus left.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The record only says that Jesus came in when the doors were shut; it does not mention His leaving.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we read that after eight days, the disciples were together again and Jesus was in the midst v. 26 . Jesus came in again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible records His coming in, but not His leaving.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What does all this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There was a meeting, in a sense, but never a dismissal.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There was no one who said, "Let us be dismissed."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We just read of the coming of the Lord Jesus, not His leaving.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I believe the Lord is revealing something to us which is absolutely different from today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you not believe that what is recorded of those two evenings in John 20 were meetings, real meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They were undoubtedly meetings of the disciples with the resurrected Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But according to our present realization there was no prayer there, no singing of hymns, no Bible reading, no message, and no dismissal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There was the coming in of Jesus, but not the going out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There was the start, but not the ending.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hallelujah!</S>
