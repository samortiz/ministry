   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. By Thorough Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The way to have a clear view concerning the present situation of the Lord's recovery is by thorough prayer Eph 1:16; 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When you hear the things spoken by the dissenting ones, do not take them at face value.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These sayings in themselves are only the "shell"; they are not the "kernel."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When you hear anything concerning the Lord's recovery, you should not receive it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead, you should bring it to the Lord in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You should not pray only once but should pray again and again concerning what you have heard, until you have prayed thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. In a Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to have a clear view concerning the present situation, we need to have a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul desired to help the Ephesians to know God's economy intrinsically.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Concerning this, he prayed twice.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Ephesians 1:17 he prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did not pray concerning the mind or the emotion; he prayed concerning the spirit, and this spirit is not a spirit of knowledge and understanding but a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To know God's economy intrinsically, we need more than knowledge and understanding; we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then, in Ephesians 3:14-19 Paul prayed for "this cause": that we may know Christ in such a way that He will be able to make His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this particular cause Paul did not pray lightly; rather, he prayed in an earnest and formal way, bowing his knees to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>C. Without Prejudice</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To have a clear view concerning the present situation of the Lord's recovery, we must be without prejudice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not say anything out of prejudice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, we should learn to be quiet and bring every problem to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>D. Without Partiality</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to have a clear view of the present situation, we must also be without partiality; that is, in any controversy we should not take sides.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>E. Without Personal Affection</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must also learn to view the situation without personal affection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should learn not to express our personal likes or dislikes concerning anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to know who we are.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are small slaves of the Lord, and in His great house we should not say that we like or dislike certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should say, "If the Lord shows me so, I will take it."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>F. Without Self-opinion</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>but Full of Spiritual Discernment</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Finally, we must be without self-opinion but full of spiritual discernment 1 Cor 14:29b .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The English letters o, c, and e are sometimes difficult to distinguish.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not exercise discernment, we may read something wrongly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Chinese language a number of characters differ only slightly in form.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, the character for heaven and that for monster are nearly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we attempt to get into the intrinsic nature of the twenty "problems" raised by the dissenting ones, we can see that none of them is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every one is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And these twenty items show clearly that there must have been a conspiracy among the dissenting brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Without a conspiracy, no one could have put forth all these items.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To enter into the intrinsic nature of all these items, we must not have any opinion but must be full of discernment.</S>
