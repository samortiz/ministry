   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Temperate</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to this verse, the aged men are to be temperate.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To be temperate is to have self-control and to be moderate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is often easier for an elderly person to be offended or angered than it is for a young person to be bothered in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As an elderly person myself, I can testify that in a family it is usually the older ones who become irritated or impatient.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today I can be bothered by certain irritations or nuisances that did not affect me in the least fifty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that, as an elderly man, I need Paul's charge to be temperate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Of course, temperateness is a virtue needed by everyone in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. Grave</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Elderly men should also be grave.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Gravity is a qualification of human character which is worthy of utmost respect.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It implies dignity and it inspires honor and invites it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Gravity is a virtue which invites the respect of others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. Of a Sober Mind</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 2 Paul charges the aged men to be of a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He says the same concerning young women v. 5 and younger men v. 6 . In 1 Timothy 3:2 Paul lists this among the qualifications of an overseer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To be of a sober mind is to be sensible and also discreet in understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No matter what our age may be, we all need a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are of a sober mind, we shall avoid the extremes of being too hot or too cold.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, we need to be burning in spirit; on the other hand, we need to be of a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we would be a proper human being, we need this quality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>D. Healthy 1.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Faith</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we would be healthy in faith, we need daily to be under the transfusion which comes through the organic union between us and the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word faith in verse 2 does not refer to the objective faith, to the things we believe, but to our activity of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In our daily living we need a faith which keeps us in the organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to be healthy in faith, we need to come to the Word and contact the Lord by praying in a living way with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we shall have faith, the infusion of the living God into us through our contact with the Word in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Faith, therefore, is a living Person infused into us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more we remain in the organic union with this divine Person, the more healthy we shall be in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Love</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are healthy in faith, we shall automatically be healthy in love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is possible to love others too much or too little.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In either case, our love is not healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead, we are somewhat sick in our love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why do you love a certain brother very much and another brother hardly at all?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is because you love others according to your own taste.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Philippians 2:2 Paul says that we should have the same love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that our love for all the saints should be on the same level.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To have a different love for different saints is to be unhealthy in love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But to have the same love for all is to be healthy in love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Endurance</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Titus 2:2, aged men should also be healthy in endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have adequate endurance, we shall be able to bear the things which bother us and trouble us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have pointed out that it is rather easy for an elderly person to be bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As one who has many children and grandchildren and who is involved with so many churches and co-workers, I can testify of the need for endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, I need endurance simply to care for all the mail I receive day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I receive so much mail that I have developed a filing system to categorize and arrange it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even this takes endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If I were short of endurance, I would not know what to do with all this mail.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Especially those of us who are elderly need endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The older we become, the greater is our need of endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In particular, the elders in a church need endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For example, sometimes telephone calls come late at night.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To take care of such a call in a proper way requires endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once again I wish to emphasize the fact that in the church life we aspire to live a proper human life, with all the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We do not want to be angelic.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our desire is to be genuinely human.</S>
