   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Persevering in Asking</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another point about prayer which requires attention is that we must persevere in prayer and never stop praying.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Luke 18:1 says, "They ought always to pray and not lose heart."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some prayers require perseverance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One has to pray to such an extent that the prayer seems to wear out the Lord and force Him to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is another kind of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord said, "Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?" v. 8 . This faith is different from the faith spoken of earlier, but they are not contradictory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Mark 11 says that we must pray until we have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Luke 18 says that we must ask again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must have the faith to pray to the Lord persistently until one day He is compelled to answer our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not care whether or not there is a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should just pray until God is compelled to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many prayers are inconsistent prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A person can pray for one or two days.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But after three months, he completely forgets it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some people can pray about something only once.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They cannot even pray a second time for it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such ones care little whether they receive what they ask for.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Please count how many of your prayers have been offered for the second time, the third time, the fifth time, or the tenth time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you have forgotten your prayers, how can you expect God to remember them?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you do not have a heart to pray, how can you expect God to have a heart to listen?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you have forgotten your prayer, how can you expect God to remember it?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, you have never wanted what you asked for.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A person will pray persistently only if he has a real need.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One prays persistently only when he is pressed in the environment and driven by needs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In such cases he may persist for decades and still not give up praying, "Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If You do not answer me, I will not stop asking."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you want to ask for something, you should trouble God about it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you really want it, you must ask persistently until God hears you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have to ask in such a way that God cannot do anything except answer your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You have to ask until God is forced to answer you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE PRACTICE OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every Christian should have a prayer-book, one a year.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He should record his prayers as one keeps books in accounting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Each page should be divided into four columns.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first column should record the date he begins to pray for something.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The second column should record the prayer item.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The third column should record the date the prayer is answered, and the fourth column should record how God answers the prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way, one will find out how many things he asks God for in a year, how many prayers God answers, and what prayers are still unanswered.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>New believers should definitely keep such a book.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But it is good for those who have been believers for many years to keep a prayer-book also.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The advantage of writing things down in a prayer-book is that it shows us whether or not God is answering our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once God's answers stop, something must be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is good for Christians to be zealous in serving the Lord, but such service is useless if their prayers are not answered.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a man's way to God is blocked, his way to men is also blocked.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a man has no power before God, he will have no power before men.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must first seek to be a man of power before God before we can be useful before men.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A brother once wrote down the names of one hundred forty persons and prayed for their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some names were recorded in the morning and the persons were saved in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After eighteen months, only two on the list remained unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a very good pattern for us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May God gain more Christians who will keep a record of their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I hope you will put this into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Write down the items you are praying for one by one and the items that God has answered.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Any item that has been recorded in the book, but has not received an answer, should be followed up by persistent prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You should only stop if God shows you that a certain prayer is not according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If He has not shown you this, pray persistently until you receive an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You should not be careless in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You should be strictly trained in this matter from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You should be this serious before God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Once you pray, do not stop until you receive an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In using the prayer-book, note that some items require daily prayer while others require prayer only once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The schedule depends on the number of prayer items you have in your prayer book.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you have little to ask, you can pray daily over every item in the book.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If there are many items, you can arrange for certain items to be prayed over on Mondays and others to be prayed over on Tuesdays.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Just as men schedule their time to do other things, we should set aside a specific time every day for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If our prayers are not specific, we will not need a prayer-book.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If our prayers are specific, we will need a prayer-book.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We can place this book in the same place we put our Bible and hymn book.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They are to be used daily.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After a period of time, count how many prayers have been answered and how many prayers have gone unanswered.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is a blessing to pray in a specific way according to a prayer-book.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As for the prayer that the Lord teaches us in Matthew 6, the prayer of 1 Timothy 2, and prayers for light, life, grace, and gifts for the church, these are general subjects for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They should not be classified under ordinary items for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should pray for these great things every day.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Prayer has two ends the person who is praying and the one who is being prayed for.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many times, the one being prayed for will not change unless the praying one is first changed.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If the situation on their side remains unchanged, we need to seek after God concerning our side.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should say, "O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What changes do I have to make?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What sins have I not dealt with yet?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What loves should I forsake?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Am I really learning the lesson of faith?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Is there anything else I should learn?"</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If there is a need for change on our side, we must change first.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We cannot expect those who are being prayed for to change while there is no change at all on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Once a person believes in the Lord, he must learn to pray earnestly.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He must learn the lesson of prayer well before he can have a deeper knowledge of God and a fruitful future for himself.</S>
