   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LEAKAGE AND THE BEGINNING OF THE RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible was completed by the end of the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The final books were John's writings the Gospel, the Epistles, and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But from that time a leakage began because the vessel became broken.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It continued through the second and third centuries and on, until by the end of the sixth century the Catholic Church and the papal system were fully established.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The years from about A.D. 500 to 1500 are called the Dark Ages.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the truths in the New Testament had leaked away.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible itself was locked up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The common people were told that they were not in a position nor did they have the capability to read the Scriptures; they needed the pope and the Church to interpret it for them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For a thousand years there was darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then the Reformation began, with Martin Luther boldly taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Reformation marks the beginning of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do you know what book the recovery began with?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was Romans, the first book of Paul's completing ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Luther, however, did not recover everything in Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have since seen far more.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we do not despise him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In his time he was a person to be really appreciated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He had the boldness to declare that justification is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That was the beginning of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Following justification by faith, one truth after another was recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the reason many seeking Christians began to dispute with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because one would see one thing and another something else, each would fight for what he had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many things were recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But, until these recent years none of the items in the verses listed at the beginning of this message were recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>ITEMS IN THE ULTIMATE RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From these verses we now see that the church in a locality is a lampstand and that each city has only one lampstand Rev 1:11-18, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Did you ever hear that Christ has promised to give the overcomer to eat of the tree of life 2:7 ?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many Christians think the tree of life was only in Genesis and has nothing to do with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Did you ever hear that you could be a pillar in God's temple and that you could bear the name of God, and of the New Jerusalem, and the new name of Christ 3:12 ?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Did you ever hear that God's Spirit is one but has become seven 4:5 ?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even we were not so clear about this before 1969!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Did you ever hear that these seven Spirits who are the one Spirit of God are the eyes of the redeeming Lamb 5:6 ?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Did you ever hear a message that the Lamb's marriage is come and His wife has made herself ready 19:7-8 ?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Did you ever hear a message on the spiritual significance of the New Jerusalem, with the throne of God, the flowing river, and the tree of life 22:1-2 ?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Did you ever hear of the enjoyment of Christ as life by those who wash their robes and thus have the right to the tree of life 22:14 ?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Did you ever hear "the Spirit and the bride say" together 22:17 ?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may have heard Christ and the church linked together, but probably you have not heard the Spirit and the bride linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All these items are different aspects of the Lord's ultimate recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many of them have been recovered just within these past thirty years, some of them in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet they are all in the Bible, especially in the last book of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They simply remained there, untouched.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Five hundred years ago, it was the same with justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It was there in Romans and Galatians, yet not understood or touched by most of the so-called Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Revelation was considered mysterious; it seemed better to leave it alone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE BIBLE UNLOCKED AND THEN OPENED</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>About the same time as the Reformation, movable type was invented in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am talking about the recovery with the world situation because these two things go together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The reformers made use of the printing press to publish the truths they had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible also could be printed instead of being copied by hand.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a result, it was spread among the people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Formerly it had been locked up by the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Martin Luther unlocked it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But the Bible was not opened up much; it was read but not really understood.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was not till 1830 or so that the great teachers among the Brethren opened up the Bible much more.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They came to understand the types and prophecies and the matter of Christ's second coming in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Gradually the prophecies in Revelation were opened up.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But some matters in Revelation they ignored: they did not touch the testimony of Jesus, the lampstands, the seven Spirits, the tree of life, and the spiritual significance of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What they studied was mostly the seven seals, the seven trumpets, the seven bowls, the seven heads, and the ten horns.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They were scholars, showing that many of the prophecies were historically fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Brethren gave us many basic interpretations of the Bible.</S>
