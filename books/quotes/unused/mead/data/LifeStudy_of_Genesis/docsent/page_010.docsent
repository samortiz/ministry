   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE TWO SATAN'S REBELLION AND CORRUPTION 2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Satan's Rebellion and Corruption</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We come to the matter of Satan's rebellion and corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That we should now study this subject may come as a surprise.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have been considering God's creation and suddenly we turn to Satan's rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must approach this matter with a sober mind in order that we may be crystal clear.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many good Christians think that Genesis 1:1 is the subject of the first two chapters of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They were taught that these two chapters are a record of God's creation, and that chapter 1, verse 1 is the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if verse 1 is the subject, how can verse 2 start with "and"?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"And" means that something is going on already, and then something else happens to follow it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"And" is a conjunction which combines two things: the first thing goes and the second thing comes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even the grammar shows that verse 1 is not the subject, but part of the description.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It describes the first event in a series.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, and..."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that after God created, something happened.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, and the earth became waste and empty."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Concordant Version of Genesis translates the verse this way: "Yet the earth became a chaos and vacant."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Concordant Version does not say "and"; it says "yet."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet the earth became a chaos and vacant."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A chaos is a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The earth became a chaos waste and vacant.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you build some apartments and no one dwells in them, they are vacant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may render this phrase as either "a chaos and vacant" or "waste and empty."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Something happened between verse 1 and verse 2 which caused the earth to become waste and empty.</S>
