   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Thus far, we have seen God's history in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have also seen His history in time in creating the universe, in judging Satan and the universe, and in restoring the judged universe and creating man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even the creating of man is part of the real history of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Genesis does not merely tell us a story of how man was created.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's creation of man is actually a marvelous part of God's history in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Genesis 1:26 says that God created man in His own image and after His own likeness.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Of course, God is almighty, but I believe that before creating man, God should have had much consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Carpenters who make furniture spend much energy to make designs before they actually make a piece of furniture.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why would God not say, "Let there be man," and there was man?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God did not create man by speaking him into being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He created man in a marvelous way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Genesis 2:7 says that God made man with a form.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God then breathed the breath of life into this form, and that breath became man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The result was that man became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then God put this man in a particular place, a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On this earth there was a garden, and this garden was full of trees that were pleasant to the sight and good for food to nourish man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But among those many trees were two trees the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil Gen 2:9 .</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to enter into the significance of all of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, Genesis 1 and 2 are not a history of Adam but a history of the Creator, of the wise Architect, God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first two chapters of Genesis are a part of God's history.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have seen that Genesis 3 reveals how God saved man from his fall.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we saw how God dealt with Abel, Seth, Enosh, Enoch, Methuselah, and Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With these men we can see the history of the acting God on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then on the negative side, God judged those who forsook Him and took the way of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the way of death.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The most crucial point in taking a photo, is the angle at which you take it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you do not have the proper angle, you cannot have a proper photo.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we take a picture of someone, and it is a photo of his feet, this means that we took the picture at the wrong angle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to view the Bible from the angle of the history of God to have a proper and complete view of the divine revelation.</S>
