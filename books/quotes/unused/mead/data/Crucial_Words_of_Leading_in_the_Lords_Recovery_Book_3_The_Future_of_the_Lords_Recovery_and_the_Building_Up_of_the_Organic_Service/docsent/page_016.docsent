   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Perfecting the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in All Areas of Church Service</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In relation to church service, we should make a list of the needs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, the chart should list cleaning, ushering, and other church services.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After we pray about the services, we should assign responsible saints to different services according to the need.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we should hold trainings for the different areas of service to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have been preaching the gospel in Taipei for nearly thirty years, and now there are approximately five thousand saints who attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the saints who are in the meetings have received some perfecting, but we must study how we can meet their need.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must continually endeavor; it may be that we will not be immediately successful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, we must put our heart, our strength, and our entire being into perfecting the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>PUTTING ASIDE OUR PERSONAL VIEWS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>TO BE IN HARMONY</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>WITH THE CORPORATE LEADING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have a heavy burden concerning the leading in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The co-workers and the elders are all faithful, they are willing to give themselves, and they are of the same mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, they have not put aside their personal views to receive a corporate view for the corporate need.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The brothers need to labor according to a corporate view and to function according to their measure.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They should cooperate with one other and strive together for the same goal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to set aside our personal views and receive a corporate view.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The brothers need to come together to pray until there is no more pride and no self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the way we will succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we would do this, the Lord will lead us step by step in our prayer and fellowship so that all the needs of the church are met.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Otherwise, even though the co-workers are not in division, they will not be in harmony regarding the corporate leading, nor will they be focused in their work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A personal view, no matter how good it is, cannot accomplish anything in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the elders and co-workers are in harmony and have one burden but do not have personal views, the practical needs will be met.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In addition to finding out why so few saints come to the meetings, we also need to consider different kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not good to have too many kinds of meetings, but too few meetings may not meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is best to have only one joint meeting every week when the whole church meets together for a corporate leading.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The other meetings during the week do not have to be corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>During the joint meeting, the different kinds of meetings can be announced and a printed schedule can be passed out to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must allow the brothers and sisters to choose meetings for themselves based on their personal situation and need.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not force them to go to a particular meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we have a meeting only for new believers, the saints who have met with us for twenty to thirty years will not be interested.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are soldiers, and we can be useful regardless of our age.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we have ten thousand children meeting with us every week, we will need five hundred teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The brothers and sisters in high school and college can be the teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In addition, we can train the saints in college to also preach gospel truths.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this way everyone will have the opportunity to be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the way a country builds up its infrastructure, and it is the only way for a country to be prosperous.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>DROPPING OUR OPINIONS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>TO CONSIDER THE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>AND NOT REMAINING IN OUR OLD WAYS</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must beseech the Lord s mercy in order to see that opinions are worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When I was working with Brother Nee, I never expressed my opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I entered into the work in 1932, which was ten years after some of the other co-workers entered the work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, only eight years later in 1940, when we were in Shanghai, Brother Nee was already giving me important assignments.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I never casually expressed my opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Brother Nee always asked me to go to difficult areas; I never chose where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I never said that I approved of this or disapproved of that; I never said we should do this or do that.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When I was playing soccer in my junior college, I never expressed my opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I told my teammates that I would play whatever position they put me in without any preference.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are many things that we can accomplish when we do not express our opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We could have gained at least twenty-six thousand children, junior high students, high school students, and college students.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must be able to pick up this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have no intention of being a leader in the Lord s work; I merely work diligently without opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If someone else has a better way of doing things, I will not argue with him; however, other people always argue with me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must realize that the blessing depends on the one accord, not on our opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must not express our opinions in the elders and co-workers meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must be practical in our leading, and we must study our situation so that we can meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This can be compared to using the resources, capital, and labor in a factory to manufacture products that meet a need in the market.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is our pressing need, and we must spend time on it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In our history we have never had a local church with more than three thousand five hundred saints regularly in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must learn how to lead the saints, to stir them up, and to motivate them so that the saints can spread.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot depend on the corporate meetings to meet this need.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To have only three meetings a week the prayer meeting, the mid-week ministry meeting, and the Lord s Day meeting is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some of the saints who are not in the meetings may be open to receive a burden for the gospel; hence, we must study and find a way to contact these saints and develop their function in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This requires much effort.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>People are complicated and therefore have many needs.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A person has needs in his body, in his soul, and in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He cannot take care of only one aspect; he must care for all three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we can speak only of spiritual things and tell people to be spiritual, but we do not care for anything else, then we will have no way to get through.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must remember to be practical in our care.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In our coordination we need saints to preach the gospel, and we also need saints to preach the gospel truths.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We cannot merely preach the gospel without speaking the gospel truths; otherwise, the newly saved ones will not be in the meetings after they are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We baptize people every year, but our numbers have not increased because we are unable to keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The leading brothers must study how to keep the newly saved ones after they have been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Merely preaching the gospel and baptizing people is inadequate; we must edify the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hence, the co-workers and elders must come before the Lord and study how they can meet this need.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must be like the widow in the Gospel of Luke who kept bothering the unrighteous judge, asking him to avenge her, until he finally avenged her 18:2-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The responsible brothers love one another; but they lack one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If the leading brothers are not in one accord, how can the entire church be in one accord?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The situation of the church in Taipei depends on the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Taiwan has been blessed by the Lord; the churches are stable because they are kept by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But we should not remain in this condition; we must change our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must bring our situation before the Lord to seek His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There are more than twenty thousand brothers and sisters in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The elders should pray and seek a way to lead and perfect the saints so that all the saints function.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When I gave the Life-study training on the Gospel of Luke, I did not merely preach concerning the Gospel of Luke in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Even while I was resting, I was thinking about the Gospel of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Therefore, I was able to receive light.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The responsible brothers in Taipei should not pray and ask the Lord for light on the one hand and sleep peacefully on the other; if they do this, they will not receive light.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They should even dream about the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>They must continually consider the way to perfect all twenty thousand saints and how to bring the ten thousand children into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We must dream about the children, the junior high students, the high school students, and the college students.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In this way the saints in every meeting hall in the church in Taipei will carry out their function to the highest degree.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Some of the elders must receive the burden to dive into these things and to labor on them diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If I had returned twenty years ago, this would be our practice in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We cannot continue to do things according to the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We need to change.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If the business community in Taiwan operated according to old ways, Taiwan would have no economy.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>People in the business world know how to work and make profit.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If the elders express their opinions in the church without working, this is a great shame.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Opinions nullify our ability to make profit.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The Lord s work needs us to work; it does not need us to express our opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>For example, when others are driving, we do not need to tell them how fast or how slow they should drive.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>When we drive, we should pay more attention to arriving at our destination with no accidents rather than pay attention to driving at only one speed.</S>
