<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages spoken by Brother Witness Lee in New York City on September 1 through 4, 1978. From July through September 1978 Brother Lee visited many localities in the United States and Canada, giving a series of conferences to meet a timely need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. His two main burdens in these conferences were the believers&rsquo; personal contact with the Lord as branches abiding in the vine, and the vision and practice of the proper church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WORD BEING THE EMBODIMENT OF GOD, CHRIST, THE SPIRIT, AND LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4; 14:6a; 10:10b; 6:63; 15:7a; 14:17, 20; 1 John 1:1; Rom. 8:2</h1>
<p>The main items mentioned in the Scripture reading above are God, Christ, the Spirit, and life. These four items are mysterious, abstract, invisible, and intangible. God is mysterious. We have never seen God or touched God. Christ also is mysterious, abstract, and invisible. Although the Spirit is in us, we have never seen the Spirit. Life is perhaps the most abstract item. Even our physical life is quite mysterious. We know that we have life and are alive, but we cannot see our life. God, Christ, the Spirit, and life are all real yet mysterious and abstract. Because these four items are invisible, unbelievers even consider them to be matters of superstition.</p>
<p>All believers can testify that God is in them, Christ is in them, the Spirit is in them, and life is in them. All these wonderful, mysterious, excellent, abstract, and intangible things are in us, but we cannot show them to others. However, God, Christ, the Spirit, and life are all embodied in the word of God in the Bible, which is solid and tangible. The word in the Bible is the very embodiment of these four mysterious things. God is mysterious, but He is embodied in His word. God&rsquo;s word is the very embodiment of God. I recently spoke with the unbelieving mother of a Jewish brother. She made excuses for not believing in the Lord, asking, &ldquo;Where is Jesus? I believe God exists, but where is God?&rdquo; Eventually, I said, &ldquo;Please promise me that you will do one thing: from today on read a few chapters from the Bible every day.&rdquo; She immediately answered, &ldquo;I promise you; I will do it.&rdquo; By making this promise she was caught. I said, &ldquo;Before you finish reading the Bible, you will receive something.&rdquo; If we read the Bible, we will receive God, for God is embodied in His word.</p>
<p>The Bible is not a common writing. The Bible is altogether different from a magazine or a newspaper. Whenever we come to the Bible, even before we open it, we have a sensation that we have come into the presence of God. This is not a psychological matter, for we cannot reproduce this sensation when coming to a secular magazine or newspaper, no matter what we do. Whenever we come to the Bible, however, we sense that we are immersed in the presence of God because the word is the embodiment of God. God, Christ, the Spirit, and life are all in God&rsquo;s word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD, CHRIST, THE SPIRIT, AND LIFE<br />
ALL BEING ONE</h2>
<p>We need to realize that God, Christ, the Spirit, and life are actually all one. Christ is God (Rom. 9:5; John 1:1; Heb. 1:8; 1 John 5:20), the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17), and life (John 11:25; 14:6a). Moreover, the Spirit is life (Rom. 8:2). The burden in this chapter is to see something concerning the word of God in the Bible, for the word is the embodiment of these four mysterious items&mdash;God, Christ, the Spirit, and life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING NOT A CONDITION<br />
BUT A PERSON&mdash;CHRIST</h2>
<p>When I recently heard the speaking of some saints, I realized that some consider that life is liberation. They think that the more we are liberated from bondage and legality, the more life we have. However, according to this concept, the birds have more life than we do, for we are not as liberated as the birds. For instance, when we drive, we are limited and bound by the road, traffic, and the police. It is wrong to think that to be liberated is to have life. Life is not a condition or a situation. Life is a person. Through excessive interpretation of the Bible, Christians often lose sight of the simple realities. First John 5:12 clearly says, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; The birds are much more liberated than we are, but they do not have the divine life, the eternal life, which is Christ Himself.</p>
<p>The life we speak of is not a condition or situation. A mistaken, damaging concept has crept into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery that life is the condition of being released by shouting and jumping. If this were true, spectators at sporting events would have more life than we do, for they jump, shout, and are fully released. Although spectators at sporting events shout and jump a great deal, they do not have life. They have a perishing life, but they do not have the divine life. We need to see what life truly is. Life is not shouting, jumping, or being released. Life is a person&mdash;the Lord Jesus Christ. We may not be shouting or jumping, but as long as we have Christ, even if we are sleeping, we are full of life.</p>
<p>The wonderful person who is life, Jesus Christ, is composed of two natures and two wonderful facts. These two natures are divinity and humanity, and these two facts are His all-inclusive, all-accomplishing death and His excellent resurrection. Christ, who is the divine, eternal life, is an eternal, infinite person composed not only of God and man but also of His death and resurrection. Christ is an all-inclusive person. If we receive Him, we receive God, the highest humanity, Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive, all-accomplishing death, and His resurrection. By receiving Christ, we receive divinity, humanity, a positive, life-releasing death, and a germinating resurrection.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO TOUCH THE LORD<br />
THROUGH THE WORD</h2>
<p>Although we have received Christ and He is now in us as our life, in our experience the life within us will gradually disappear if we do not touch the Word, the Bible. The way for us to touch life is not to meditate. As a young believer, I was taught that I needed to meditate, but the more I tried to mediate, the more my mind wandered. Though I tried my best, I could not focus my thoughts on the Lord. Because meditation did not work, I quickly dropped it. In my experience I have found that the best way and the unique way to touch life is to come to the Bible.</p>
<p>If a believer feels cold toward the Lord, the reason may be that he or she is not reading the Bible. We need to read the Bible as much as we can. Regardless of how cold our heart is, we need to come to the Bible. We may not love the Lord, and we may even dislike the Lord because we feel that He has not answered our prayers. Nevertheless, we need to come to the Lord just as we are by coming to the Bible. The Lord is not in our imagination or our logic; rather, He is in His word in the Bible.</p>
<p>Some may think that I am a brother who is always zealous and on fire for the Lord, but this is not true. Sometimes I am inwardly frozen like a piece of ice. However, regardless of whether I am on fire or frozen, every day I come to the Bible. There is no other way to go on in the Christian life. If we are dead, nothing can make us alive but the word in the Bible. If we are going to an extreme, nothing can balance us but the word. The word is all-capable and all-sufficient. We simply need to come to the Bible because the word contains and embodies God, Christ, the Spirit, and life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE BEING GOD&rsquo;S BREATHING</h2>
<p>The Bible is not an ordinary piece of literature like a newspaper or a magazine; rather, it is the word of God. Second Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed.&rdquo; The Bible is God&rsquo;s breath objectively and God&rsquo;s breathing subjectively. If we come into someone&rsquo;s presence, we come into that person&rsquo;s breathing. God&rsquo;s breathing is full of life. The Bible is God&rsquo;s word, His breath, and His very breathing.</p>
<p>After rising up in the morning, many people like to breathe in some fresh air. They may take a walk to be refreshed by the morning air. Likewise, every morning we need to be refreshed spiritually by coming to the Bible and thereby coming into God&rsquo;s presence and God&rsquo;s breathing. The number of verses that we read and memorize does not matter. After a time of deep breathing, it is difficult to remember the details of our first breath or of our second breath. We do not memorize air. We simply breathe to receive the benefits of the air. The same principle applies when we come to the Bible, which is God&rsquo;s breathing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RICH, ALL-INCLUSIVE FUNCTION<br />
OF THE LIFE IN THE WORD</h2>
<p>When we come to the Word, we receive life. This life is God, Christ, and the Spirit. The function of this life is rich and all-inclusive. This life nourishes, waters, strengthens, supports, supplies, enlightens, rebukes, preserves, and safeguards us. The only way to live the high standard of the Christian life is to daily come to the Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPENDING TIME IN THE WORD<br />
BEING A LIFE NECESSITY</h2>
<p>We should not think that to come to the Word every day is to be religious or legal. We should not care for religion or legality; we should care only for life. For the sake of our physical life, we are legal in the sense that we eat every day. We would never try to liberate ourselves from the legality of eating. Even if we dislike our food, we will eat to live. Because young children sometimes refuse to eat, their mothers must encourage them and, if necessary, force them to eat. Regrettably, some young brothers and sisters need to be encouraged and even compelled to come to the Word for the sake of their spiritual health. If we are loose about spending time in the Word, we will not be healthy. For our spiritual health, we need to be legal in coming to the Word regularly every day.</p>
<p>The reason I am still physically strong at my advanced age is that for many years I have been legal in the matter of eating three meals a day. Every meal I eat is a large meal, and the largest one is breakfast. To be legal in this way is not bad; actually, it is necessary. Some legalities are life necessities. For our physical life we all need to keep four legalities: drinking, eating, sleeping, and breathing. If we are liberated from these legalities, we will die. We even need to be legal about when we eat and the quantity of food that we eat. We should eat three meals at the same times every day. We should not eat too much or too little, nor should we eat too much dessert. If we are legal in this way, we will be physically healthy. Our spiritual health also depends on keeping certain legalities. I encourage the young people to build up a legality of coming to the Word every morning. We should be condemned by our conscience if we do not spend ten to fifteen minutes each morning to pray over a few verses in order to eat the Word. If we make this a legality and build up this good habit, after a month we will see a positive difference in our Christian life.</p>
<p>We should not merely receive this word as a doctrine; rather, we should make a commitment before the Lord to practice this. As a young believer, Brother Watchman Nee read through the New Testament fifty-two times in one year. If we do not spend time in the Word every day, we cannot be healthy Christians. We will be noticeably healthier if we daily receive the food of the Word. May the Lord grant us the grace to realize our need to come to the Word. If we love the Lord and desire to glorify the Lord and live as a testimony for Him, the only way to do so is to daily come to the Word. We should not trust in so-called revivals and being stirred up. These things are vain, for they do not last. One thing is real&mdash;the continual touching of the Word of God. Every day&mdash;morning, afternoon, and evening&mdash;we need to touch the Lord through the Word.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE WAYS TO COME TO THE WORD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Way of Being Nourished</h2>
<p>Now that we have seen that we need to come to the Word daily, we need to go on to see the way to come to the Word. According to our experience, there are three ways to come to the Word. The first way is the way of being nourished, which is to spend at least ten minutes to read the Word and five minutes in prayer. We should take three or four verses each time to read and then pray-read. To pray-read is to make reading and prayer one thing, mingling our reading of the Word with our prayer.</p>
<p>In our times of coming to the Word in the way of being nourished, we should not pray for our relatives, our friends, or any situation. Rather, we should simply praise the Lord for His many wonderful attributes and virtues, give Him thanks, or talk to Him from our heart, confessing our real situation. We may pray, &ldquo;Lord, You are so good. I just love You. Lord, I am sorry that I am cold toward You. Lord, stir up my love for You; kindle the fire within me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We do not need to compose prayers, for we already have a wonderful prayer book&mdash;the Bible. The words of the verses we read may be used to compose our prayers. If we use the words of the Bible for our prayer, we will touch God, Christ, the Spirit, and life. Moreover, we will be watered, enlightened, sustained, supported, supplied, strengthened, and nourished. Everyone can spend at least ten to fifteen minutes each morning to come to the Word in this way.</p>
<p>We should not read the Bible in a random order but consecutively from the first verse of a book to the last. We should first ask the Lord to show us which book of the Bible we need to read at the present time. If the Lord leads us to the Gospel of John, we should read and pray-read a few verses from John every morning, beginning with John 1:1. If we pray-read through the whole book of John, verse after verse, there will be a great difference in our life because we will be nourished every day.</p>
<p>I recently heard that some saints hold the concept that the more they sleep in the morning, the more spiritual they will be. This concept is absolutely wrong. If we are not already spending time every morning in the Word, we need to begin to rise up at least fifteen minutes earlier to make time to do so. Early rising will make us healthy, not only spiritually but also physically and mentally. By rising fifteen minutes earlier, we can spend time in the word of our heavenly Father and thereby absorb all His unspeakable riches. This is not a one-day matter; it is a lifelong matter. If every morning we spend at least fifteen minutes in the Word, we will be satisfied. This is the way to be nourished by the Word.</p>
<p>Spending fifteen minutes in the Word in the way of being nourished each morning is to have our spiritual breakfast. If we do not do this, we are like a naughty child who refuses to come to breakfast. Mothers know that in order to have healthy children, they must feed them a healthy breakfast every day. The mothers of children who refuse to eat their breakfast may discipline them in order to encourage them to come and eat. Many dear saints have been disciplined by the Holy Spirit for remaining in bed too long and not spending time in the Word.</p>
<p>If we will rise up only fifteen minutes earlier, we will receive a great blessing. Everyone can do this. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace, every day for the past fifty-four years I have spent time in the Word. I will never regret this; rather, I will always be thankful to the Lord for this. I cannot describe what abundant blessing I have received from the Word. If we come to the Word daily, we will never regret it. If we do not do this, we will suffer a great loss in our life. Spending time in the Word every day is crucial.</p>
<p>Every morning we need to spend at least ten to fifteen minutes in the Word, but thirty to forty minutes is better. We should never think that we do not have the time to read the Bible; this is not true. We know that this is not true because when we receive a phone call, we always have time to talk, sometimes for almost an hour. If we receive no phone calls for two days, we will wonder why. Our ears are always itching for a phone call. We need phone calls to tickle our itching ears, but we may think that we have no time to read the Bible. We may say that we cannot spend time in the Word because we are busy doing laundry and cleaning our house, but if a phone call comes, we have plenty of time to talk. We should not allow our time on the phone to replace our time in the Word, even if our conversations are about spiritual matters. There is nothing more important than spending time in the Word. We need to change our habits. We all need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, rescue me from my unnecessary occupations and strengthen me to spend more time in the Word.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">The Way of Reading</h2>
<p>The second way to come to the Bible is the way of reading. This way is to find at least twenty minutes to read several chapters during our lunch break, after leaving work in the afternoon, after dinner in the evening, or before going to bed. It is best to read three chapters of the Old Testament and one chapter of the New Testament every day. If we do this, we will read the entire Bible once a year. The way of reading enables us to pick up a general sketch of the Bible and accumulate something of the Bible within us for further nourishment.</p>
<p>The way of being nourished and the way of reading are the common ways in which all the believers should come to the Word. These ways are good for the older ones, the young ones, and the new ones. We can all spend at least fifteen minutes to read and pray-read a few verses early every morning. Then we can find time to read a few chapters later in the day. If we make a decision to practice this, we will be able to do it. We need to choose life by making a decision to practice this. We even need to make a deal with the Lord to spend time in the Word every morning so that we will be accountable to Him concerning this matter.</p>
<p>When we come to the Bible in the reading way, we should not read in a random order or according to our preference. We should not skip over Matthew 1:1-17 because we think that genealogies are uninteresting. Regardless of whether we understand or can even pronounce every word, we simply need to read the Bible consecutively&mdash;in the New Testament from Matthew to Revelation and in the Old Testament from Genesis to Malachi.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, we do not need to understand everything. It is all right if we understand what we read, and it is all right if we do not understand it. We do not need to strain our mentality to try to understand the Bible. If we contact the Lord as we read, He will surely give us the needed understanding. Our Father knows our need. If we try to understand the Bible in a natural way, our effort will be a great frustration and a great disappointment. We should never expect to understand or try to understand. We simply need to continue reading. By reading, we will surely understand something, and we should be content to understand just that much.</p>
<p>We sometimes do not understand a verse the first time we read it, but when we read the same verse again later, we understand it. If we do not understand it the second time we read it, we may understand it the third or the fourth time. Sooner or later, we will understand it. We have a long time to understand the Bible&mdash;a lifetime. No one can fully understand the Bible. Although I have been reading the Bible for more than fifty-four years, I still do not fully understand the Bible. It is too profound for anyone to fully understand. Although I have been ministering from the Bible for more than forty years, every time I come back to a verse, such as John 1:1, I always see something new. The Bible is inexhaustible. Therefore, rather than trying to understand everything, we simply need to be faithful to continue reading and understand spontaneously.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Way of Studying</h2>
<p>Besides the ways of coming to the Bible to be nourished and to read, ways that should be practiced by all believers, there is a special way, the way of studying. Some saints should spend time to study the Bible. This is mainly for some who could be teachers in the churches. According to the Bible, teaching is shepherding (Eph. 4:11). If we do not know how to teach, we cannot shepherd properly. Shepherding is the main function of the elders. First Timothy 3:2 says that the elders should be apt to teach (cf. 5:17). Because the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is spreading and the number of churches is increasing, there is a need for more elders. All the elders must be qualified by having the proper knowledge of the Bible. In order to be prepared, qualified, and edified for future leadership, many brothers need to study the Bible.</p>
<p>Before we begin to study the Bible, we first need to pray to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading concerning which book we should study. To come to the Bible in the way of studying is not mainly for us to receive nourishment or simply to read, but to study in a thorough way. We need to study every word of every verse. For this, we need the Greek text. Even if we do not know Greek, we can use reference books, such as Strong&rsquo;s <em>Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible,</em> Young&rsquo;s <em>Analytical Concordance to the Bible,</em> Vine&rsquo;s <em>Expository Dictionary of NewTestament Words,</em> Vincent&rsquo;s <em>Word Studies in the New Testament,</em> an interlinear Greek and English New Testament, and a Greek dictionary. We can also compare different versions, such as the American Standard Version, Darby&rsquo;s New Translation, the Amplified Bible, and Wuest&rsquo;s Expanded Translation. These references will render much help to us.</p>
<p>As we study the Word, we should expound each verse to find the meaning. We need to interpret a little to enter into the depths of each verse. This requires time. After we have studied an entire book in this way, we can go through it again to study certain topics. For instance, in Romans we can study the subject of sin or the subject of justification. Other subjects in Romans are being in Christ, being in the spirit, being in the flesh, as well as the subjects of sanctification, transformation, and conformation. We can study many subjects in one book. Furthermore, we can use the Life-study messages on each book. Our study of each book will help us to realize the riches in the Life-study messages, and the Life-study messages will help us to have a thorough, clear, and rich view of each book. Any book that we study in this way will become transparent to us. Then we will surely have something with which to teach others. If we can teach others, we will be able to shepherd and will be qualified and constituted to be a proper leader in the church life. This is the way of studying the Word. I hope that some young saints will make a decision before the Lord to study the Bible in this way.</p>
<p>In matters related to life there are no shortcuts. Life is altogether a legal matter. Everything in the physical realm has legalities. The legalities never change; the regulations are always there. The planets are very legal in the sense that they move in a regular way. If the sun, the moon, or the earth were free like the birds, the solar system would immediately collapse. Each planet is on its proper track; each has its legality. Life is the same. Science tells us that the physical life is altogether legal. A plant will not grow if certain regulations of the plant life, such as a supply of light and water, are not fulfilled. Neither will a child grow up if certain life regulations are not fulfilled. In order to have life, we must keep regulations; there are no shortcuts.</p>
<p>For life, we should not depend on revivals or on being stirred up. I have been a faithful and good Christian for over fifty-four years, and I have never depended on revivals or on being stirred up. Life does not need revival or stirring up; rather, it needs proper growth. We need to grow properly. The best and most proper way for us to grow in the spiritual life is to spend time in the Word. Every morning we need to spend at least ten to fifteen minutes in the Word to receive the nourishment. We also need to read a few chapters of the Bible every day. If we practice this, we will grow. If all the saints in a locality do this, the church in that locality will have a great revival after only half a year. The saints will be stirred up, not in a superficial way but in a way full of life, weight, and depth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CONTENT OF THE WORD<br />
AND OF THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:63; 1 Cor. 1:18; Phil. 2:16a; 1 John 2:27; John 7:39; Exo. 30:23-25</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE BEING THE EMBODIMENT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The New Testament clearly reveals that God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense Christ into all His believers. God&rsquo;s economy is a dispensing work to dispense Christ into our very being, making Christ our life and even our person. In the previous chapter we saw that the Christ who is being dispensed into us is God, the Spirit, and life. Christ, God, the Spirit, and life are all mysterious, abstract, intangible, and invisible. However, these four mysterious items are all embodied in God&rsquo;s word in the Bible.</p>
<p>The Bible, the word of God, is not a human writing composed according to human logic. It is absolutely different from a textbook, newspaper, or magazine. The Bible is God&rsquo;s breathing (2 Tim. 3:16), and Christ is embodied in this breathing. Christ as the Spirit is the real element, essence, and constituent of the Bible (John 6:63). The Bible is tangible, for we can see it and read it, yet the reality, the living, prevailing element, within the Bible is Christ Himself, who is God (Rom. 9:5), the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), and life (John 14:6). Therefore, whenever we come to the Bible with a sincere heart and an open spirit, we immediately have the deep sensation that we have come into the presence of God. When we take the words of the Bible into us, we immediately have the sensation and the conviction that we have received Christ into us, because Christ is embodied in God&rsquo;s word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT BEING ONE</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will see that the word of God is the Spirit. We should not separate the word from the Spirit or the Spirit from the word. In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; Thus, the word is the Spirit. Newspapers, textbooks, novels, and other such writings can never be the Spirit, but the word in the Bible is the Spirit. When the word is outside of us, it is the word. When it enters into us, it immediately becomes the Spirit. When the Spirit is spoken out of us, He becomes the word once again. Then when the word enters into the person to whom we are speaking, it becomes the Spirit again. This process is repeated when any person receives the word and speaks the word. Thus, the word and the Spirit are actually one. We can never receive the word of the Bible yet not receive the Spirit. Whenever the word is received into our being, it immediately becomes the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT BEING THE MEANS<br />
BY WHICH WE ABIDE IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>It is through the word, which is the Spirit, and through the Spirit, who is the word, that we contact Christ and remain in Christ. In other words, it is through the word and the Spirit that we abide in Christ. In John 15:4-5 the Lord Jesus told us that He is the vine, that we are the branches, and that as the branches we need to abide in Him as the vine. Just as our arms need only to remain attached to our body, so the branches need only to abide in the vine. In life and nature our arms are exactly the same as our body. Likewise, the branches are exactly the same in life and nature as the vine. Actually, the branches are part of the vine and are one with the vine. If the branches simply abide in the vine, the life-juice of the vine flows into the branches. This is the reason the Lord Jesus told us that we as His branches need to abide in Him as the vine. When we abide in Him, His life, His nature, and all that He is flows into our being, just as the life-juice of the vine flows into all the branches.</p>
<p>The key, the crucial point, that we need to see is how to abide in Christ. We can abide in Christ by two means&mdash;the word and the Spirit. Although Christ is real and living, He is altogether mysterious and abstract. We believe that He is present and lives within us, but we need to know the way to contact Him. We may illustrate this matter with electricity. Electricity is real and powerful, but we cannot see electricity. The distribution of electricity from a distant power plant into a building requires at least two wires. Christ as the divine electricity is mysterious yet real and powerful, and He is brought into our being by two &ldquo;wires&rdquo;&mdash;the Spirit and the word. By touching the word, which then becomes the Spirit, Christ is transmitted into us. Just as electricity is transmitted from a distant power plant into a building, Christ is transmitted from the heavens into our being through the word and the Spirit. When we touch the word and the Spirit, there is a transmission within us; something moves within us. This is the transmission, or moving, of Christ within us through the word and the Spirit.</p>
<p>Because Christ is transmitted into us through the word in the Bible and the Spirit, we Christians must daily come to the Bible and the Spirit. Our two great inheritances are the Holy Bible without and the Holy Spirit within. These inheritances are our real riches. The value of money and property cannot compare to the value of the Word and the Spirit. The Bible is more valuable than gold (Psa. 119:72, 127). We are the richest people because we have the Word and the Spirit. Our true wealth is the word of God in the Bible and the Spirit because these are the two &ldquo;wires&rdquo; that daily and hourly transmit the rich Christ into our being. Within us there is always a current, a transmission, of Christ through the word and the Spirit. For this reason, we must daily contact and receive the word and the Spirit. If the Bible were only letters printed on paper without the Spirit, it would be an empty book with no reality. However, the living word of the Bible is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reality of the word.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CONTENT OF THE WORD BEING<br />
A KILLING ELEMENT AND A NOURISHING ELEMENT</h2>
<p>Now we need to see what the real content of the word is. In order to see the content of the word, we may use the illustration of food. Although there are many different kinds of food with many different vitamins and minerals, our food consists of two main kinds of elements&mdash;killing elements and nourishing elements. We have many germs in our body. If we do not eat for a few days, the germs in our body will multiply, and we will become sick. In all the food that we eat, there is an antibiotic, killing power that kills the negative germs. At the same time, there is also a nourishing element in the food we eat, which nourishes the positive cells. In the word of God, which is our spiritual food, there are the same two kinds of elements&mdash;killing elements and nourishing elements. The contents of God&rsquo;s word are mainly Christ, the death of Christ, and the resurrection of Christ. Some may point out that in the Bible there are many items, such as the heavens, the earth, animals, plants, human beings, and history. However, these many items are like the many different foods we eat with the many different vitamins and minerals. In all these different items in the Bible, there are actually only two main elements&mdash;a killing element and a nourishing element. These elements are Christ&rsquo;s death and Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, both of which are in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Killing Element, the Word of the Cross,<br />
Being the Death of Christ</h2>
<p>The killing element in the Bible is referred to in 1 Corinthians 1:18 as the word of the cross. The word of the Bible crosses us out. The more we receive the word, the more certain things within us will be crossed out. The word crosses out our temper, our ambition, our natural life, our pride, our hatred, and even our hating self. The young brothers sometimes experience jealousy, not only in school life and family life but also in the church life. If the elders mention one young brother&rsquo;s name in a meeting, other young brothers may immediately become jealous. This jealousy can never be corrected outwardly, but if we take in the word every morning by coming to the Bible, our jealousy and our jealous self will be crossed out. The word in the Bible has killing power.</p>
<p>There is a great difference between the teachings of Confucius and the Bible. In the word of the Bible there is a killing element. In the teachings of Confucius, however, there is no killing element. Rather, the more we study the teachings of Confucius, the more we may become proud, thinking that we are more ethical, humble, and honest than others. In contrast, we will not be proud after pray-reading a few verses of the Bible. The word of the Bible kills the proud self. Although there is a killing power in the food we eat, this killing power is completely digested and depleted after several hours. At that time we need another meal. Our pride will be killed if we pray-read in the morning, but because our pride may return in the afternoon, we will need another meal of the word of the cross.</p>
<p>There were many problems in the church in Corinth. Therefore, the believers there needed the word of the cross. In every chapter of 1 Corinthians there is a killing word, a word of the cross. Some in Corinth exalted tongue-speaking, but in 1 Corinthians 12:10 and 28 Paul ranked it last among the aspects of God&rsquo;s operation in the church. This was a killing. Paul says, &ldquo;The word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God&rdquo; (1:18). Because the word of the cross kills all the negative germs, it is able to rescue and heal the believers.</p>
<p>To be a young brother in the church is not easy. In the church life the young brothers are very competitive. Without competition in academics and business, there would be no growth. Nevertheless, in the church life competition needs to be killed. However, if the elders rebuke the young brothers, this will not kill their competitiveness. The only thing that works is for the young brothers to come to the Word every morning to pray-read a few verses. In this way they will spontaneously and unconsciously receive a killing element. After pray-reading, it is impossible to be proud because the word kills our proud self. As long as there are germs within us&mdash;negative things such as competition, pride, and jealousy&mdash;the word will carry out its killing work within us every time we come the Bible. The word in the Bible will spontaneously become the word of the cross, which is the death of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">The Nourishing Element, the Word of Life,<br />
Being the Resurrection of Christ</h2>
<p>Philippians 2:16 says, &ldquo;Holding forth the word of life.&rdquo; The word of life is the nourishing element in the Bible. Every morning when we pray-read a portion of the Word, we receive a killing element and a nourishing element at the same time. The nourishing element in the Word sustains, satisfies, waters, and supports us. It brings many positive riches into us. The word of life is the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>The word in the Bible is composed of Christ, His death, and His resurrection. Regardless of the page of the Bible that we read, we will receive these three things. We should not study the Bible as we would study a book of ethics. The Bible is not a book of ethics; it is the word of God, composed of Christ as life, His death as the killing element, and His resurrection as the nourishing element. These three main items are in every portion of the Scriptures, regardless of what the subject matter is. There are many stories in the four Gospels, but either Christ, His death, or His resurrection is in every story. Whatever portion of the Bible we read, something always kills us, and something always supplies us with the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>Whenever we read or study the Bible, if we do not receive Christ, His death, and His resurrection, our reading or our studying is vain. Regardless of the kind of food we eat, we always need to receive a killing element and a nourishing element from our food. Likewise, regardless of the book, page, chapter, or verse we read in the Bible, we need to receive some killing element and some resurrecting power to meet our spiritual need. Science has discovered that the content of healthy food exactly matches our physical needs. The various vitamins and minerals that our bodies need are all found in our food. Some are in meats, and others are in grains, fruits, and vegetables. Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty all our necessities are included in our food. When we eat food, we receive all the elements that we need. In the same way, whatever we need in our spiritual life is all included in the word of God. We need Christ, His death, and His resurrection. These items constitute the word of God in the Bible.</p>
<p>Because we all are fallen, old, and corrupted human beings, every day we need some killing. We are all part of Adam and are therefore six thousand years old. We are old and full of corruption. As fallen, old, and corrupted people, we daily need a killing element, and this element, this antibiotic, is found in the Word. We receive certain antibiotic elements by taking in three healthy meals every day. Likewise, we receive spiritual antibiotics by taking in the word every day. We need to come to the Word two or three times each day to receive the killing element. The Bible is a killing book. Many saints, both young and old, have experienced the killing element in the Bible.</p>
<p>Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty all the necessities of our physical life are found in natural foods. In the same principle, all that we need for our spiritual life is in the word of God. We need both the killing and the nourishing. Every morning I receive nourishment from the Word. Even if I do not have much time, I always come to the Word for nourishment. We always receive nourishment when we come to the Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONTENT OF THE WORD<br />
AND OF THE SPIRIT BEING THE SAME</h2>
<p>We have seen that in order to touch Christ, we must touch the word. When we touch the word, we receive Christ in reality, not only in name, doctrine, or theology. We also receive the killing element of His death and the nourishing element of His resurrection. Now we will see that the content of the word and of the Spirit are exactly the same.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Being Compounded</h2>
<p>Few Christians know that today God&rsquo;s Spirit is no longer simply the Spirit of God (Gen. 1:2). God&rsquo;s Spirit today is a compound Spirit, compounded with the same elements that are the constituents of the word of God in the Bible. The Holy Spirit today is compounded with Christ, with His death, and with His resurrection. There is a wonderful type in the Old Testament, a picture, showing that God the Spirit has been compounded with Christ&rsquo;s divinity, humanity, death, and resurrection (Exo. 30:23-25). Today the Holy Spirit is a compound Spirit. The Spirit of God in Old Testament times can be compared to a cup of pure water with no other elements, but the Spirit of God today can be likened to a rich drink in which tea, milk, and sugar have been added into the water. The Spirit today is a compound drink, composed of God&rsquo;s divinity compounded with other elements. This drink is an all-inclusive drink. When we drink this compound drink, we receive all the elements that have been compounded into it. The Spirit of God in the New Testament age is no longer only the Spirit of God; He is also the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19).</p><h2 class="head2">The Old Testament Type of<br />
the Compound Anointing Ointment</h2>
<p>Exodus 30:23-25 describes the ingredients of the holy anointing oil. These verses say that four spices were added to one hin of olive oil. A hin is a measure of liquid. In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, oil typifies the Spirit of God. The holy anointing oil in Exodus 30 was a compound with four spices&mdash;myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. Myrrh, a spice used in burials, signifies death. Calamus, a reed that shoots up from muddy places, signifies resurrection. Cinnamon signifies the sweetness of Christ&rsquo;s death. Finally, cassia, which was used in ancient times to repel insects and snakes, signifies the fragrance of the resurrection of Christ, which repels the demons and Satan. Thus, myrrh and cinnamon signify Christ&rsquo;s death with its sweetness, and calamus and cassia signify Christ&rsquo;s resurrection with its sweet fragrance and repelling power. This indicates that the Holy Spirit has been compounded with Christ&rsquo;s death and Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>The quantities of the ingredients are also significant. There were five hundred shekels of myrrh, two hundred fifty shekels of cinnamon, two hundred fifty shekels of calamus, and five hundred shekels of cassia. These measurements form three units of five hundred shekels each. The number three signifies the Triune God. The middle unit of five hundred shekels is split into two halves of two hundred and fifty, signifying that Christ, the second of the Triune God, was &ldquo;split&rdquo; on the cross. There were four spices. The number four signifies God&rsquo;s creatures, for Ezekiel 1:5 and Revelation 4:6 mention four living creatures. Among God&rsquo;s creatures, man is the head (Gen. 1:26). Thus, four signifies humanity, and the one hin of olive oil signifies the unique Spirit of God with divinity. This picture shows that humanity, divinity, the death of Christ with its sweetness, and the resurrection of Christ with its fragrance and power have all been compounded into the Spirit. Through such a compounding, the olive oil became a compound ointment. It was no longer simply pure oil but became a compound with several ingredients.</p>
<p>The compound ointment was the holy anointing oil that was used to anoint the tabernacle, all its furniture and utensils, and the priests (Exo. 30:26-30). The word <em>anointing</em> in 1 John 2:20 and 27 corresponds directly with Exodus 30. John used the word <em>anointing</em> in reference to the Spirit of God, who has been compounded with Christ&rsquo;s humanity, His death, and His resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Both the Spirit and the Word Being Composed<br />
of Christ, His Death, and His Resurrection</h2>
<p>The compound Spirit corresponds to the word of God. The word of God in the Bible is composed of Christ, His death, and His resurrection. As we have seen, the compound Spirit is composed of these same elements. This compound Spirit is the Spirit mentioned in John 7:39, who was not yet. Before Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, the compounding of the Spirit had not been completed. However, when Christ resurrected, His death, His resurrection, and His being were all compounded into the Spirit of God. Therefore, from that day the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19). Formerly, the Spirit of God was only the divine Spirit, but He has become the Spirit of Jesus Christ&mdash;a compound Spirit, compounded with Christ&rsquo;s divinity, humanity, death, and resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OLD MAN NEEDING TO BE KILLED AND<br />
THE NEW MAN NEEDING TO BE NOURISHED DAILY<br />
BY THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Our need is not to know the doctrine of the content of the word and the Spirit. Rather, our need is to take in the word, touch the Spirit, and thereby receive Christ, the killing element of His death, and the nourishing element of His resurrection. If we receive only doctrine when we come to the Bible, it will mean nothing. However, what we actually receive is an antibiotic and a supply&mdash;the killing element and the nourishing element.</p>
<p>We all have two statuses. On one hand, we are the old man, the fallen man; on the other hand, we are the new man, the regenerated man (Eph. 4:22-24). The old man needs to be killed, and the new man needs to be nourished. Our Father is very wise. He prepared the word and the Spirit in such a way as to kill our old status and nourish our new status. Every day through receiving the word and the Spirit, we are being killed, and we are also being nourished. The word and the Spirit are the two means by which Christ, His death, and His resurrection are transmitted into our being.</p>
<p>A physical metabolism operates in our bodies every day to process the food we eat. As a result, there is a killing and a supplying in our body every day. The germs within us are killed, and our healthy cells are able to grow. Likewise, a daily spiritual metabolism occurs within us through the word and the Spirit. As a result, the old man is killed, and the new man is nourished so that we may grow spiritually. We cannot grow if we do not come to the Word, just as a child cannot grow physically if he or she does not eat. If we mean business with the Lord for His recovery and for His church, every day we must contact the Lord through His word and through His Spirit. We must take in His word and touch His Spirit.</p>
<p>Verse 4 of <em>Hymns,</em> #501 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of life causes Thee / By Thy Word to transfer to me. / Thy Spirit touched, Thy word received, / Thy life in me is thus conceived.&rdquo; By the word and by the Spirit, Christ&rsquo;s life is conceived within us. Therefore, we need to daily spend time in the Word. When we spend time in the Word, we need to exercise our spirit to touch the Spirit within by prayer. We need to not only read but also pray by exercising our spirit. In this way we will have the two &ldquo;wires&rdquo; for the spiritual transmission of Christ with His death and resurrection into our being. Then we will daily experience the killing and the nourishing that we need. This is the way to grow spiritually, and this is the way to abide in Christ. This is not a mere doctrine; we all need to put this into practice every day. Until the Lord comes back, we all need to daily contact Him by taking in the word and by touching the Spirit in order to receive Christ with His killing and nourishing elements. Then the spiritual metabolism within will cause us to grow.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY<br />
BEING THE RECOVERY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 2:20; Phil. 1:21; Col. 3:4, 10-11</h1>
<p>We need to see what the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is. We may be accustomed to speaking about the recovery, yet I am concerned that even those who have been in the church for many years do not adequately know what the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is. We do not need to learn a complicated definition. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is simply the recovery of Christ. This simple definition is adequate because Christ is everything to us. Some may define the Lord&rsquo;s recovery as the recovery of the genuine oneness, but genuine oneness is simply Christ Himself. Others may define the Lord&rsquo;s recovery as the recovery of the proper church life, but the proper church life also is Christ. Thus, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the recovery of Christ as everything to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING CHRIST</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and His economy is to work Christ into His chosen people so that they may become the Body of Christ. To become the Body of Christ is to become a part of Christ. A person&rsquo;s body is simply the main part of the person. A complete person is composed of a head and a body. Just as we cannot say that a person&rsquo;s head is not the person, neither can we say that a person&rsquo;s body is not the person. If neither the head nor the body is the person, there is no person. Every part of a person, even a little finger, is the person. Some may say that in order to be accurate, we must say that a finger is only a part of the person, not the person. This may seem logical, but if we follow this line of thought to its ultimate conclusion, we will see that it cannot be true. If we say that a person&rsquo;s finger is not the person, we must also say that the hand is not the person, that the arm and shoulder are not the person, and so on until eventually there is nothing that is the person. Therefore, every part of a person is the person. We need to see that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover Christ and that God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and His economy is to work Christ, to dispense Christ, into our being to make us a part of Christ, the Body of Christ. We also need to see that the Body of Christ is simply Christ. The Head is Christ, and the Body also is Christ (1 Cor. 12:12).</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING CHRIST</h2>
<p>The apostle Paul did not say, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rsquo;s Body.&rdquo; Rather, he said, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21a). Like Paul, we should have the boldness to say this because Christ lives in us (Gal. 2:20) and is being formed in us until our being becomes Christ (4:19). Because Christ is our life (Col. 3:4), our person (3:10-11), our love, our kindness, our humility, our long-suffering, our holiness, our righteousness, and our everything, we are Christ. To us, to live is Christ. God&rsquo;s intention is to work Christ into us and to make us a part of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CHRISTIAN BEING A CHRIST-MAN</h2>
<p>To be a Christian is to be a Christ-man, a man of Christ. A steel chair is a chair made of steel; the whole chair is steel. Likewise, to be a Christian, a Christ-man, is to be Christ. Our whole being should be Christ. However, our daily living reveals that we are not entirely Christ; rather, we are partially a Christ-man and partially the old man. We may be a Christ-man in name, but we may not actually have very much of Christ in our being. This does not mean that we are not Christ when we are evil and that we are Christ when we are good. Only when we are living Christ are we genuinely Christ. We need Christ to be our love, our humility, our holiness, and everything positive to us. Negative things such as our pride and our looseness are Satan. All negative things are Satan, but not all positive things are Christ. Some love is Christ; some love is not Christ. If a young brother fights with his siblings, it is obvious that his fighting is not Christ. However, if the brother is kind to his siblings, his kindness also may not be Christ. I have seen many unbelieving young people behaving properly, but their good behavior is certainly not Christ. Evil things are not Christ; neither are good things necessarily Christ. Only Christ is Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRISTIANITY HAVING CHRIST ONLY IN NAME</h2>
<p>Christianity has Christ only in name and very little in reality. Instead of Christ, Christianity is composed mainly of four categories of things. The first category is concepts, doctrines, and teachings. The second category is certain ways, such as ways to preach the gospel. Many Christian groups use worldly music, dramas, movies, and other ways to preach the gospel. The third category is various activities and movements. The final category of things that compose today&rsquo;s Christianity is organizations. If these four categories of things were removed from Christianity, there would be little left. This is the regrettable situation among God&rsquo;s people today. Christ is altogether missing from Christianity (Rev. 3:20).</p>
<p>Near the end of his life A. W. Tozer, a faithful servant of the Lord in the Christian and Missionary Alliance, wrote an article entitled &ldquo;The Waning Authority of Christ in the Churches.&rdquo; In it he described church boards discussing ways to work for the Lord and preach the gospel yet not giving Christ a place in their decisions. Tozer said that in Christianity today Christ is &ldquo;little more than a beloved symbol.&rdquo; Only the name of Christ, not His person, has a position in Christianity. There are many doctrines concerning Christ and many activities for the work of Christ, but Christ Himself is missing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR RECOVERY</h2>
<p>The church as the Body of Christ is nothing other than Christ. Therefore, there is a desperate need today for a recovery of Christ as our everything. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery Christ is our only concept, doctrine, and teaching. Furthermore, Christ is our way. In John 14:6 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the way.&rdquo; Christ, not rock music or dramas, is our way. Furthermore, Christ, not any kind of movement, is our activity. The church is not an organization. Rather, the church is an organism, the Body of Christ, which is Christ Himself. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there is nothing but Christ. Colossians 3:10-11 says, &ldquo;Put on the new man...where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; In the new man, the church, Christ is all. Because Christ, as everything in the church, has been lost and missed in Christianity, the Lord has come in to recover this crucial matter. The Lord has a recovery in order to recover Christ as everything to the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATIONS OF CHRIST<br />
BEING EVERYTHING TO US</h2>
<p>Now that we have seen what the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is in principle, let us apply this principle. Some illustrations may help us to understand the practical application of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery being the recovery of Christ as everything to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Caring Only for Christ in Our Gospel Preaching</h2>
<p>In Christianity today gospel preaching is carried out by certain methods. These methods include rock music, dramas, and movies. However, the Bible does not give us a method to preach the gospel. Rather, the Bible likens gospel preaching to fruit-bearing. The Lord said, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing&rdquo; (John 15:5). The branches of a vine bear fruit simply by living the vine, growing the vine, and producing the vine. As branches of Christ, we should preach Christ not by rock music, dramas, or any other method, but by living Christ, growing Christ, and producing Christ. When the branches abide in the vine, the life-juice of the vine flows into the branches, resulting in an overflow of life from within the branches. This overflow becomes fruit. Fruit is simply the overflow, or outflow, of the inner life. Thus, the way to preach the gospel is not by any kind of activity but by a daily life of living Christ, growing Christ, and producing Christ.</p>
<p>Approximately twenty-five years ago a group of young people came from the United States to Taiwan to preach the gospel by playing basketball. A large number of Taiwanese young people were attracted to see the Americans play basketball, and perhaps a few were brought to Christ. Because today is the age of grace, anyone who believes in the Lord will be saved (3:16; Rom. 10:9). Salvation in the age of grace may be likened to rain coming through an opening in a roof. Regardless of who is under the roof, whether it is a band of bank robbers or a person with the highest morality, the rain will come in wherever there is an opening, but no rain will come in if there is no opening. In the age of grace, regardless of what ways are used to attract people to hear the gospel, people can be saved if they open to receive the Lord.</p>
<p>Suppose there are three young Christians who are zealous for the gospel. After praying, they may begin to consider the best way to preach the gospel. One may say, &ldquo;We need guitars.&rdquo; Another may say, &ldquo;We need trumpets.&rdquo; The third one may say, &ldquo;We need tambourines.&rdquo; Eventually, they may decide that they need to have a band or an orchestra in order to attract a group of young people to hear the gospel. After preaching the gospel in this way on a Saturday and perhaps even bringing some to Christ, one of the three young Christians may go to a movie theater during the week. Another one may go to a bar, and the third one to a dance club. This may be their daily life. When the next Saturday comes, they may once again preach the gospel by using music to attract some young people. They may still be very zealous for gospel preaching. They may even bring some people they met at the theater, the bar, and the dance club to hear the gospel. The Bible says that everything is produced according to its kind (Gen. 1:11-12, 21, 24-25). However, these young Christians are not according to their kind. On one hand, they are Christian preachers; on the other hand, they are persons who visit defiling places. We cannot expect God to bestow His blessing upon this kind of situation.</p>
<p>A brother may speak often to his relatives and friends concerning the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and the church, but if he goes to movie theaters and bars, his relatives and friends will look down on his living, and his testimony will spontaneously lose its impact. However, if the brother lives a Christian life with a high standard, pursuing only Christ, although his relatives and friends may outwardly criticize him as being religious or legalistic, deep in their heart they will admire him. Their conscience will testify that he is a genuine lover of Jesus and that his speaking is sincere. The Lord will use his living to touch their hearts. Perhaps one year one of his relatives will turn to the Lord. The next year a schoolmate may turn to the Lord. The third year one of his friends may turn to the Lord. The rate of bearing one fruit per year is not too slow. If we all lived this way and brought one person to Christ per year, we would have a hundred percent increase every year. Moreover, most of those we gain in this way will become remaining fruit.</p>
<p>Rather than gimmicks, dramas, or rock music, we need a proper testimony in our living. Moreover, we need to love the Lord with our whole being, live Christ, and unceasingly pray. This is the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the recovery of Christ in an absolute way. We need to be clear that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we do not accept anything other than Christ. We have no ways and no concepts but only Christ. We have no method to preach the gospel; we only live Christ, pray, love Christ, and love others. Through the testimony of our daily living, many of our relatives, friends, neighbors, classmates, and colleagues will eventually turn to the Lord. Then the church, which is a lampstand shining over the dark worldly society (Rev. 1:12, 20), will increase. This is the Lord&rsquo;s way of fruit-bearing. If instead of the Lord&rsquo;s way we take the low way of joining unbelievers in worldly activities in order to preach the gospel to them, even our gospel contacts will inwardly criticize us and mock us. We must maintain the standard of having a proper testimony by living Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">Caring Only for Christ<br />
Rather Than Religion or Legality</h2>
<p>Some brothers and sisters are crazy lovers of Jesus. They do not care for movies, bars, or dancing; they care only for Christ. Day and night they do nothing but pursue Christ. At home, at school, and everywhere they care only for Christ. As branches in the vine, they do nothing but live the vine. As branches of Christ, we should do nothing but live Christ.</p>
<p>Another Christian may try to discourage such crazy lovers of Jesus, saying, &ldquo;You do not need to be so religious, caring for nothing but Christ all the time. To go to the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting every week is to be religious. It is better to stay in bed.&rdquo; Such speaking has been heard even in some local churches. Some even say, &ldquo;The more you sleep in the morning, the more spiritual you will become.&rdquo; Others say, &ldquo;You do not need to be so legal. You are bound by a legality to not go to the movies. Not all movies are bad; some movies are very good. You need to be liberated to go to the good movies.&rdquo; If someone speaks to us in this way, we need to be clear that this person is sent not by God but by God&rsquo;s enemy. Both going to the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting and not going may be legalities. We should not care for either legality; rather, we should care only for Christ. However, it is doubtful that we can receive more of Christ by sleeping in on Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. If we care only for Christ, we will rise up early in the morning to contact the Lord and prepare to meet with His church. Likewise, if we care only for Christ, we will see that we certainly cannot receive more of Christ by going to a movie. Attending sporting events may not be sinful, but our experience tells us that we do not receive more of Christ by going to sporting events. We should not care for whether something is legal or not. We should not care for any particular ways or concepts. We should care only for Christ. We need to go only where we can receive more of Christ, and we need to take only the way by which we will receive more of Christ.</p>
<p>Some young people recently asked me concerning a certain kind of speaking they heard. Some saints told them not to go to movies, but others said, &ldquo;Do not be so legal; go to the movies.&rdquo; Some also told them not to be religious by always coming to the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting, but others told them that they needed to come. I explained to the young people, &ldquo;Religion is to serve or worship God without Christ.&rdquo; In other words, anything we do for God apart from Christ is religion. Anything that has Christ in it is not religion. To go to a Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting without Christ is religion, but to stay home on Lord&rsquo;s Day morning to try to be spiritual or liberated without Christ also is religion. What matters is not whether we go to the meeting or stay home but whether we do all things with Christ. It is not a matter of what we should or should not do; it is a matter of Christ.</p>
<p>When we contact Christ, live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ, Christ surely will not lead us to a theater, a bar, or a dancing club. However, we cannot assume that Christ is in a certain thing simply because it is practiced in the church life. If we shout in the meetings without Christ, our shouting is not the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If our singing is void of Christ, our singing is only a musical activity, not the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Every bit of everything in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must be Christ. We do not care for any way or any concept; we care only for Christ.</p>
<p>If a brother is weak, he may occasionally slip into a theater to see a movie, but he should not promote this activity. We should preach only Christ, not our private life and certainly not our weaknesses. Going to movies is a sign of weakness in one&rsquo;s Christian life. I believe that a saint who is strong in life would refrain from going to a movie theater, even if only to avoid the appearance of sin. We may go to a movie out of weakness, but we should never promote this, make this a teaching, or bring this into the church as a practice, telling others that to go to the movies is a liberation. I know of many young people who have been influenced by this kind of teaching. In our conscience we know that this is not liberation but looseness. We need to realize that any kind of looseness may lead to the indulgence of lust.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Caring Only for Christ in Our Way of Meeting</h2>
<p>A dissenting concept is held by some who say that the church should not meet in large general meetings. They think that it is better to have small family-style meetings in the homes. Concepts always damage. We should not care about the kind of meetings we have; we should care only for Christ. If we would like to have some saints meet in our home, and if we have the assurance that Christ is in this, we should simply do it. However, we should not promote it. If we promote it, we will make trouble. Everyone has different opinions. Certain kinds of meetings suit certain people&rsquo;s personal preferences. To insist on meeting in a certain way is to mix Christ with our preference or taste. In a meeting that we have insisted on according our taste, our conscience will tell us that our enjoyment of Christ is not pure. If we would bring all things to the Lord and pray without insisting on anything, I believe that the Lord will tell us, &ldquo;You may have this kind of meeting, but do not insist on it.&rdquo; We need to consider whether our motive is pure. If our motive is purely for Christ without our preference, any kind of meeting is good. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not to recover big meetings or to recover small meetings. All the ways and concepts must be buried. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we care only for Christ. We care only for wherever, whenever, and however we can receive more of Christ and minister Christ to others, not for our concepts, opinions, or personal tastes. Everything must be Christ.</p>
<p>Everyone prefers his way, but no way is the right way. Only Christ is right. Our purpose is not to recover a certain way of meeting. We should not care for any way of meeting; we should care only for whether Christ is in our meeting. This is the major object. If we drop our teachings, our concepts, our ways, and our activities, we will have the genuine oneness. If some insist on having a certain kind of meeting according to their concept, this will cause division. We should not hold on to any concept. If some brothers feel to meet in their homes, we should not oppose them, but neither should they impose or promote their kind of meeting. To promote our concept only causes trouble.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Caring Only for Christ in the Speaking and Singing in the Meetings</h2>
<p>A brother may not be eloquent, but his awkward speaking in a meeting may be full of Christ. Another brother who is very eloquent may capture the attention of the whole congregation after only two sentences, but there may not be much of Christ in his speaking. Rather, his speaking may be full of his personal influence and impact. Regrettably, many saints prefer the speaking of an eloquent brother because it is full of excitement. We need to see that such speaking without Christ is vanity. We may experience excitement during such speaking, but when we go home, nothing goes with us. However, after listening to an awkward brother speak for a few minutes, something of Christ may be wrought into us. Even if we shake our head at his poor words, we can never shake away the Christ he ministers into us. Years later, the Christ ministered through this awkward brother will still be in us. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not concepts, ways, doctrines, practices, eloquence, or activities, but only Christ.</p>
<p>I enjoy hearing beautiful singing in the meetings, but if we care mainly for the music in a meeting, we have fallen back to the condition of degraded Christianity. I would rather hear simple singing that is full of Christ, singing that is sincere and with the exercise of the spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not the recovery of good singing, good meetings, shouting, or excitement. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the recovery purely, wholly, and uniquely of Christ. Everything must be Christ. We should not care for beautiful musical voices or instruments. If we care for the proper singing from our spirit, even if our voices are off key, our singing is still precious to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DROPPING EVERYTHING BUT CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery today is absolutely different from Christianity. Christianity is composed of various concepts, ways, activities, and organizations. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we do not have any concepts, ways, activities, or organizations; instead, all we have is Christ. Every &ldquo;letter&rdquo; and every &ldquo;word&rdquo; of our &ldquo;language&rdquo; is Christ. We have nothing but Christ. We do not care for different ways of meeting, singing, or releasing our spirit. We care only for Christ. In the church life Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:10-11). By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace, we need to drop all our concepts. We should not bring in any concept, whether good or bad, right or wrong. We must keep only Christ so that we may come together to have the church life as a living testimony of Jesus shining in this dark society. This is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Throughout the past fifty years of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have never promoted any way. We care only for a living person, Christ. Christ is our singing and our way to meet. He is the gospel and also our way to preach the gospel. Christ is our life, our living, and our conversation. Christ is everything in our Christian life and church life. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the recovery of Christ as everything to us so that we may have the proper church life and the genuine oneness, both of which are simply Christ Himself. Only when we live Christ and drop all the different teachings and concepts can we have the genuine oneness, which is the very Christ whom we are living. I hope that this word will help us to be clear concerning the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">WALKING IN CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 1:13-16; 2:20; 4:19; Col. 1:12, 15, 18-19; 2:9, 2b, 16-17; 3:10-11, 4; 1:27; 2:6-7</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST<br />
REVEALED IN GALATIANS</h2>
<p>Galatians shows that Christ is versus religion. The religion referred to in Galatians is Judaism. Before the apostle Paul was saved, when he was Saul of Tarsus, he was at the top level in the Jewish religion (1:13-14). He thought that what he was doing was right. He was zealous for God, yet he was altogether in darkness and did not see Christ. One day while Saul was on the way to Damascus to arrest the believers in Christ, the Lord appeared from the heavens, and Saul was caught by the Lord (Acts 9:1-9). He was caught not by an outward power but by an inward revelation, for Paul said that it pleased God to reveal His Son in him (Gal. 1:15-16). From that day Paul realized that he was crucified with Christ. He said, &#8220;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&#8221; (2:20). Paul went on to say that he travailed so that Christ would be formed in the believers (4:19). Thus, Galatians reveals three major points concerning our experience of Christ. First, Christ is revealed in us, second, Christ lives in us, and third, Christ is formed in us. Although these words may be familiar to us, the reality may still be unfamiliar. The reality is not the words or the doctrine but the genuine experience. It is difficult to say what it means for Christ to live in us and be formed in us experientially. A doctrine is easy to learn, but the experience does not come as easily.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST REVEALED IN COLOSSIANS</h2>
<p>Colossians reveals that the Christ who has been revealed in us, who is now living in us, and who is being formed in us is the all-inclusive Christ. According to Colossians 1:12, this Christ is our portion. The King James Version renders the word <em>portion</em> in this verse as &#8220;inheritance.&#8221; However, Christ is not merely something that we will inherit in the future. He is our present portion; we are participating in Him day by day. This portion is the image of the invisible God (v. 15). He is the portion to us, yet He is the image of the invisible God, and He is the embodiment of God (v. 19). Colossians 2:9 says, &#8220;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&#8221; Christ is also the mystery of God (v. 2b). God is a mystery, and this mystery is Christ Himself.</p>
<p>Colossians also reveals that Christ is the body of all the shadows, the reality of every positive thing in the universe (vv. 16-17). All the positive things in the universe are merely shadows of Christ. The light we see with our eyes is not the real light; it is a shadow of Christ as our real light (John 8:12). The food we eat every day is not the real food; it is merely a shadow. The real food is Christ (6:35). The air we breathe every minute is not the real air; it is a shadow of Christ (20:22). When we see someone&#8217;s shadow, we know that the shadow is not the real person. The real person is the reality of the shadow. Every positive thing is a shadow of Christ. The real feast, or holiday, is Christ. If we do not have Christ, we have a weeping, miserable day, not a happy day. The Sabbath also is a shadow. The real Sabbath, the real rest, is Christ. The real day also is Christ. Christ is the reality of every positive thing in the universe.</p>
<p>The Christ who is every positive thing is all and in all in the church. Colossians 3:10-11 says, &#8220;Put on the new man... where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&#8221; The all-inclusive Christ, who is God, man, the Creator (1:16), a creature (v. 15b), the Firstborn in resurrection (v. 18b), the Head of the Body, the beginning (v. 18a), and every positive thing, is now our life (3:4). If we weep, it does not mean that we have less life, and if we laugh, it does not mean that we have more life. Life is not a certain situation or condition; life is a person. This person, who is the all-inclusive Christ, is great, infinite, and all-inclusive, yet He is real, living, and present within us as our life. Christ is our life today, and He will be our glory in the future. Thus, He is our hope of glory (1:27).</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST<br />
REVEALED IN COLOSSIANS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving Christ</h2>
<p>Thus far, we have seen the Christ revealed in Colossians mainly in a doctrinal way. Now we need to see the experience of this Christ. Colossians 2:6-7 says, &ldquo;As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him, and being established in the faith even as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.&rdquo; We need to consider what it means to receive Christ. We received Christ when we opened our being, repented, confessed our sins to Him, and said, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I believe into You. Please come into me.&rdquo; When we are newly saved, we may not know that Christ is the life-giving Spirit or that we have a human spirit. We may pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, come into my heart.&rdquo; There is even a popular gospel hymn that says, &ldquo;Into my heart, into my heart, / Come into my heart, Lord Jesus&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #1061). This song is good, but it is not entirely accurate. Second Timothy 4:22a says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; It does not say, &ldquo;The Lord be with your heart.&rdquo; The Lord first comes into our spirit. Ephesians 3:17a speaks of Christ making His home in our heart. After coming into our spirit, Christ gradually makes His home in our heart.</p>
<p>Our spirit may be likened to the living room in a home, and our heart may be likened to the bedroom, the inner chamber. When an unfamiliar guest comes to visit us for a short time, we may welcome him into our living room. However, when an intimate acquaintance comes to stay for several days, we will show him to a bedroom and tell him to feel at home. Regrettably, many of us have received the Lord only into our living room, our spirit. We have not ushered Him into our inner chamber, our heart.</p>
<p>We have received Christ into our spirit, and He now desires to spread into the parts of our heart. The four parts of our heart are our mind, emotion, will, and conscience. Christ is spreading from our spirit in the center of our being to the surrounding parts of our mind, emotion, and will. The Christ whom we have received is not far away, like money in a bank account. Rather, Christ is in our spirit, spreading into our heart. When Christ has spread into all our inward parts, He will be settled in our heart, having made His home in our heart.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Walking in Christ</h2>
<p>Colossians 2:6 goes on to say that we should walk in Christ. We need to see how to walk in Christ. It is easy to understand the phrase <em>walk in Christ,</em> but we need to see what it is experientially to walk in Christ. It is not easy to define what it is to walk in Christ experientially because Christ is mysterious and abstract. However, the Word says that we must walk in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Walking in Christ by Walking in the Mingled Spirit</h2>
<p>In order to understand how to experientially walk in Christ, we need to be clear concerning two points. First, Christ is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Second, this life-giving Spirit is in our human spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). Nothing is as crucial in our spiritual experience as these two points. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; This means that the life-giving Spirit and our spirit are one mingled spirit. Therefore, to walk in Christ is simply to walk in the mingled spirit. In order to walk in Christ, we do not need to know many doctrines. We need only to see that Christ is the life-giving Spirit, that the life-giving Spirit is now in our spirit, and that these two spirits are one. The practical way to walk in Christ is to walk in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Walking in Christ Being the Way of Life<br />
and Being Versus All Other Ways</h2>
<p>A disagreement has arisen among the saints in certain localities. Some say that it is better to stay home to sleep on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning; they call this &ldquo;having a solid time.&rdquo; Others argue, &ldquo;No, we must go to the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting.&rdquo; In order to resolve this question, we should not listen to either side; rather, we should simply walk in Christ by walking in the mingled spirit. If we walk in the mingled spirit, we will spontaneously know whether to stay home to sleep or to go to the meeting.</p>
<p>Another disagreement has arisen as a result of some who say that we should not be legal. They say that we need to be liberated to go to movies, bars, and dance clubs. Others say, &ldquo;No, as Christians, we should not do these things.&rdquo; Once again, we should not listen to either side. Rather, we should simply check with the Lord in our spirit. In other words, we should walk in Christ, that is, walk in the spirit. When we walk in the spirit, we will spontaneously refrain from going to movies, bars, or dance clubs.</p>
<p>Because Christianity today is void of Christ, Christians often speak of what we should and should not do. Our physical bodies are full of life and therefore do not need to be told how to move. On the other hand, a machine is void of life and therefore must be commanded to move in certain ways. To go to the meetings legally or to not go to the meetings legally are different ways, but neither way is according to life. With life there is no need to talk of which way to take. Christianity is full of ways&mdash;ways to pray, to preach the gospel, to honor our parents, to love our wife, to submit to our husband&mdash;but it is void of Christ. We need only Christ. When we have Christ, we are living and do not need to be given a way; life is our way.</p>
<p>More than fifty years ago in the heathen land of China the Lord granted us His gracious visitation and caused us to see the real salvation of God. The real salvation of God is not a way but a living person, Christ. When this living person comes into us to be our life, we have everything. Christ is holiness, righteousness, humility, love, kindness, patience, endurance, long-suffering, and faithfulness. From the time we received such a vision of Christ, we stopped all our ways. By so doing, we entered into God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s salvation, and God&rsquo;s way. Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the way&rdquo; (John 14:6a). We do not need any other way; Christ is the unique way. Christ is the way to pray, the way to preach the gospel, and the way to do everything in our daily Christian life (Phil. 4:13).</p><h2 class="head3">Walking in Christ Being<br />
the Way to Preach the Gospel</h2>
<p>Colossians 2:6 is a great word. Christ is the all-inclusive One who includes both God and man, yet we can walk in Him, for He is now the Spirit in our spirit. We need to forget about our ways, our doing, our striving, and our endeavoring. Instead, we simply need to walk in Christ. Some may ask, &ldquo;What about the preaching of the gospel?&rdquo; My answer is, &ldquo;Walk in Him.&rdquo; Most Christians think that in order to preach the gospel, they need to find a way. They think that during the week they can walk in the self and live by the self, even doing things such as gambling and going to night clubs, dancing parties, and movies. Then because they want to preach the gospel on Saturday, they seek for a way, such as playing rock music. Rather than life, Christianity seeks for a way. The Bible does not say that a certain kind of music is the way to preach the gospel; the Bible says to walk in Christ.</p>
<p>We need to walk in Christ every day of the week and every hour of the day. Walking in Christ should be our daily living. Seemingly, we may not preach the gospel, but our daily walking in Christ will spontaneously be a living testimony to our family, neighbors, classmates, colleagues, and friends. Everyone we know will see that we walk in Christ, that we have a different way of living from that of others. Outwardly, they may criticize us, despise us, and say that we are crazy, strange, or peculiar, but deep within they will admire and respect us because day after day they see that our living is different from that of the worldly people. Such a testimony will be our preaching of the gospel.</p>
<p>Eventually, the sovereign Lord will cause something to happen in the circumstances of one of our acquaintances. At that point the Holy Spirit will remind him of us. He will want to have a talk with us. We will visit him, and he will open up and eventually pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I am a sinner. I believe in You. Lord, come into my heart.&rdquo; Thus, this person will be saved not by our energy, endeavoring, and striving but spontaneously through our living testimony. Perhaps within a year one person will be saved in this way; one fruit will be brought forth. After another twelve months another acquaintance may be saved through the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement of his or her circumstances and the testimony of our daily living. If we continue in this way year after year, from the age of twenty to the age of eighty, at least sixty people will be brought to the Lord through us. Gradually, all our relatives will be brought to the Lord. This will produce a great increase in the church, and those who are brought to the Lord through our testimony will be remaining fruit. This is the way of life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Walking in Christ Being<br />
the Way to Do Everything in the Church Life and the Way to Live the Normal Christian Life</h2>
<p>Not only in preaching the gospel but also in everything in the church life we do not have a way; we have only Christ. We do not need to know how to pray. If we walk in Christ, we will spontaneously pray throughout the day because we will be one with Christ. Christ is our way to pray. Similarly, we do not need to learn how to be humble. The humility that we learn will become our pride because we will think that we are more humble than those around us. The humility that we work out is not real humility. Real humility is Christ. If we daily walk in Christ, He will become our humility. Although we will be very humble, we will not have any consciousness of our humility. We will not have any sensation or feeling that we are being humble. Our sensation will only be that we are walking in Christ. This is the proper Christian life.</p>
<p>Recently, a brother asked me what the normal Christian life is. To go to movies and bars is certainly abnormal. The normal Christian life is simply to walk in Christ. Some may ask, &ldquo;What should we do to avoid losing our temper?&rdquo; The word <em>temper</em> is not in the &ldquo;dictionary&rdquo; of the Christian experience. In our dictionary there is only one word&mdash;<em>Christ.</em> Even the words <em>love,humility,</em> and <em>kindness</em> are not in our dictionary. The only word in our dictionary is <em>Christ.</em> Whenever we pick up a new word, it causes problems and gives us trouble. We should not try to be humble or loving. Husbands should not try to love their wives. The more a husband tries to love his wife, the more he will lose his patience with her. Likewise, wives should not try to be submissive to their husbands. The more they try, the more they will fail. Trying to exhibit Christian virtues does not work. We simply need to walk in Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Tim. 4:22). We do not need to listen to any concepts or pick up any new words. The only word we need is <em>Christ,</em> and the only thing we need to do is to walk in Him. Whoever walks in Christ is blessed.</p>
<p>We should not try to do anything; we should only walk in Christ. We can walk in Christ by contacting Him, spending time in the Word, praying, pray-reading, and worshipping Him. All these practices help us to walk in Christ. Early in the morning, the first thing we should do after rising up is to contact the Lord, pray-read His Word, fellowship with Him, and pray by talking to Him. This will usher us into walking in Him. We should not pay attention to disturbances from within or distractions from without. We simply need to walk in Christ. When others come to us with a question or a problem, this may be a temptation from Satan, just as he tempted Eve in the garden of Eden. Whenever someone comes to me with a question, on the one hand, I listen to the question, but on the other hand, I walk in Christ. My answer may not be related to the question because I avoid Satan&rsquo;s temptation and walk in Christ.</p>
<p>Wives often ask their husbands tempting questions. The husbands should not be quick to answer. If they answer, they will be caught. The more questions the wives ask, the more the husbands need to walk in Christ by walking in the spirit. It is not easy to refrain from answering, but if we answer quickly, we are not walking in Christ. We should not be distracted by anything. Regardless of what happens, we should still walk in Christ. This is the truth according to the Word and according to our experience. We all need to learn to walk in Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit. We do not need any ways or activities. We need only one thing&mdash;to walk in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Walking in Christ<br />
Enriching and Uplifting the Meetings</h2>
<p>If all the saints practice daily to walk in Christ, our meetings will be enriched and uplifted because we will all be full of the experiences of Christ. Every morning we need to rise up early and immediately contact the Lord, pray, pray-read a few verses for nourishment, worship the Lord, talk to Him, and fellowship with Him. This will enable us to walk in Christ for the whole day. If we practice this, we will experience the Lord every day, and when we come to the meetings, we will come in Christ and with Christ&mdash;with the rich experiences of Christ. Whenever there is the need in a meeting of a certain aspect of the experience of Christ, we will immediately be able to share a testimony to meet that need because we will be rich in the experiences of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Walking in Christ Leading to<br />
Growth and Building Up</h2>
<p>The key to the Christian life for the church life is to walk in Christ. If we walk in Christ, we will eventually be rooted in Him for growth in life and built up in Him for God&rsquo;s building (Col. 2:7). The growth in life and the building up both depend on one thing, that is, our walking in Christ. When we walk in Christ, we grow and are built up. This is the normal Christian life. To be normal is simply to walk in Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY AND GODLINESS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 1:3-7; 3:15-16; 2:2; 4:7-8; 6:3, 11; 2 Tim. 3:12</h1>
<h2 class="head1">DROPPING ALL OUR CONCEPTS AND CARING ONLY<br />
FOR CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We all need to learn to have no concepts in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Our only concept should be Christ. We need to allow Christ to saturate our being, occupy our being, and replace all our concepts. This is not easy. The young people may not say much in the meetings, but their talk outside the meetings shows that they are full of concepts. Not long after I was saved as a young person, I came into the church life. The first lesson the Lord taught me in the church life was that we need to have no concepts and care only for Christ and the church. We need to learn to drop our concepts and care only for Christ in everything. In our daily life, our marriage life, our family life, our school life, and especially our church life, the solution to every problem is Christ. In our &ldquo;dictionary&rdquo; there is only one word, <em>Christ,</em> with a footnote, <em>and the church.</em> If we care only for Christ and the church, we will be under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing and on the line of His economy every day, always enjoying life, peace, and grace. In our private talk, in our prayer, and in the meetings, we should speak of nothing but Christ and the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A DEFINITION OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY AND OF GODLINESS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Economy Being His Administration to Dispense the Triune God into His Chosen People</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider two terms found in the two Epistles to Timothy: <em>God&rsquo;s economy</em> and <em>godliness.</em> We will first consider the term <em>God&rsquo;s economy.</em> The word <em>economy</em> is commonly used today as a financial term. The biblical word <em>economy</em> refers to a dispensing administration, an administration that dispenses something into people (1 Tim. 1:4). In a kindergarten class at a certain time every day there is an administration to dispense a snack to every child; this is a dispensing administration. The word <em>economy</em> is the anglicized form of the Greek word <em>oikonomia,</em> which denotes an administration or stewardship to dispense something. In ancient times large, wealthy families had a steward to take care of the family affairs. The stewardship was an administration mainly for dispensing things to the members of the family.</p>
<p>God has a great family. All His chosen people are the members of His family, His children. Second Timothy 2:20 says that God has a great house. In His great house, His great family, there is a stewardship. Paul was entrusted with this stewardship, as were all the other apostles (1 Cor. 9:17; Eph. 3:2; Col. 1:25). Those who minister the word to the children of God today also have a part in this stewardship. Thus, the stewardship is the New Testament ministry. In the New Testament there is only one ministry, and this ministry is the stewardship in God&rsquo;s house, that is, the divine administration to dispense something to God&rsquo;s chosen people. What is being dispensed is simply God Himself in His Trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In God&rsquo;s economy, His household administration, the Triune God is being dispensed into His children. In God&rsquo;s house there is a stewardship, an administration, to dispense the Triune God into us. The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit reaches us. In this way the Triune God is being dispensed into all His chosen people. This is the definition of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Godliness Being God&rsquo;s Manifestation in the Flesh</h2>
<p>The word <em>godliness</em> is used nine times in these two Epistles (1 Tim. 2:2; 3:16; 4:7-8; 6:3, 5-6, 11; 2 Tim. 3:5). Also, the word <em>godly</em> occurs twice (1 Tim. 2:10; 2 Tim. 3:12), and the word <em>ungodliness</em> is used once (2:16). Therefore, <em>godliness</em> is an important word. However, very few Christians know that the proper definition of the term <em>godliness</em> is God manifested in the flesh, or the manifestation of God in the flesh. This definition is based on 1 Timothy 3:16, which says, &ldquo;Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit, / Seen by angels, / Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory.&rdquo; Verse 15 says that the church is the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth. Verse 16 indicates that the church is God manifested in the flesh, or the manifestation of God in the flesh. Some may think that to say that the church is God manifested in the flesh is heretical. Most Bible scholars do not realize that 1 Timothy 3:16 reveals that the mystery of godliness is God manifested in the church; they think that this verse refers only to Christ. However, because <em>taken up in glory</em> is the last phrase in verse 16, it must refer not only to Christ&rsquo;s ascension but also to the church&rsquo;s rapture, for Christ&rsquo;s ascension preceded His being preached among the nations. This proves that God&rsquo;s being manifested in the flesh refers not only to Christ but also to the church, His Body.</p>
<p>If the head is something, the body must be the same thing. Christ, the Head, is the manifestation of God in the flesh; therefore, the church, His Body, also must be the manifestation of God in the flesh. First Corinthians 14:24-25 says that when the church is meeting properly, if an unbeliever enters, he will say, &ldquo;Indeed God is among you.&rdquo; Whenever the church comes together properly, God&rsquo;s presence is there&mdash;God is manifested in the flesh.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 3:16 the manifestation of God in the flesh is called the mystery of godliness. Godliness is a mystery because it is real and living yet invisible. When unbelievers come into a church meeting, they may consider it to be quite mysterious, not understanding why a group of people are singing, shouting, and giving testimonies concerning their personal experiences. Some relatives of the saints have asked them, &ldquo;Why do you go to that meeting place several times every week, always on time and always for several hours? What is there? Is there some entertainment?&rdquo; Many unbelievers do not understand this mystery, but often when people come into a meeting, they realize that God is there. The church is God manifested in the flesh, the mystery of godliness.</p><h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Economy Being God Coming into Us and Godliness Being God Going Out of Us</h2>
<p>In brief, God&rsquo;s economy is God coming into us, and godliness is God going out of us. Hallelujah for such a heavenly, divine traffic! The Christian life is simply God coming in and God going out. This traffic goes on hour by hour. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery our church life, our daily life, and our family life is simply God coming in and God going out all day. This traffic may be likened to an electrical current in a circuit, which is electricity constantly coming and going. We have a divine current among us and within us; it is the Triune God coming in and going out. God coming in is God&rsquo;s economy, and God going out is godliness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Teaching Things That Are Different<br />
from God&rsquo;s Economy</h2>
<p>From our youth we need to learn not to teach things that are different from God&rsquo;s economy. Paul charged Timothy to remain in Ephesus with the sole purpose of charging certain ones not to teach different things (1:3). We should always teach God&rsquo;s coming in and God&rsquo;s going out and nothing else. We should not teach different things, such as how long our hair should be or whether or not we should go to certain places. This kind of teaching will produce questions and stir up disputations (v. 4). We need to teach God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>All the saints need to learn the things of God&rsquo;s economy, not only for the sake of their own experience but also in order to be able to teach others in an accurate way. They also need to learn how to teach. A newly saved young person may ask us, &ldquo;What is your opinion about going to movies? Before I was saved, the movies were my second life; I could not live without seeing at least one movie a week. Now I have heard some saints say that we should not go to movies and others say that we should be liberated to go to the movies. Please tell me whether I should go to a movie or not.&rdquo; We should answer this new one by saying, &ldquo;In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul says that we should not teach things that are different from God&rsquo;s economy. We should not care for these kinds of concepts, which produce questions. Rather, we need to take care of God&rsquo;s economy, which is the dispensing of the Triune God into us. Now that you are saved, you have the Triune God within you. The Father is in you, the Son is in you, and the Spirit is in you. You should forget about movies. It is not movies that abide in you; it is the Triune God. We are not saved for movies or for anything other than our Triune God. Now that the Triune God is in you, you do not need to ask me. Instead, you can ask the Triune God within you, &lsquo;O God, would You like to go to a movie? If You go, I will go. If You do not go, even though movies were my second life, I will not go, because I love You and because I love to be one with You. I love to live with You.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After receiving such an answer, the young person may reply, &ldquo;This morning I prayed in this way, asking the Lord to tell me whether or not to go to a movie. The more I prayed, the more it seemed that He did not want to go.&rdquo; We could then ask, &ldquo;How do you know that the Lord did not want to go?&rdquo; The new one may answer, &ldquo;When I considered going, something within was silent. However, when I considered not going, something within was joyful.&rdquo; We should fellowship with people in this way.</p>
<p>A newly saved young sister may ask another sister concerning the proper length of hair for a sister. The sister should answer her, &ldquo;We are not saved in order to have a certain length of hair. Hair is not our Savior. We have been saved for Christ, and Christ today is the life-giving Spirit. He is now dispensing Himself into our being.&rdquo; This kind of teaching should be prevailing among all the saints. Such teaching has been ministered among us for many years, but it is not often heard in our daily talk. We read this teaching in the ministry books, but afterward we do not apply what we read. In our daily talk we argue concerning things such as the proper length of hair. We need to change our vain talk and nonsensical gossip into talk about God&rsquo;s economy. Regardless of the question that is raised, we should give only one answer&mdash;God&rsquo;s economy. The Bible teaches God&rsquo;s economy, which is God&rsquo;s stewardship, the dispensing of God into us. God&rsquo;s economy, which issues in godliness, should be the unique topic of our fellowship.</p>
<p>If the saints in the churches, both old and young, will restrict their fellowship to God&rsquo;s economy, the church life will be enriched and uplifted. We need to learn to make God&rsquo;s economy our daily talk, applying all the messages we hear and read to our daily life. Even in our family life we should discuss God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s dispensing of Himself into our being.</p><h2 class="head1">A FURTHER WORD CONCERNING GODLINESS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Leading a Life in All Godliness</h2>
<p>Godliness is God manifested in our flesh. First Timothy 2:2 says that we need to lead a quiet and tranquil life in all godliness. The kind of pictures we hang in our bedroom may indicate whether or not we care for godliness in our private life. The pictures we choose may manifest God to others, or they may manifest something else. We can apply the same principle to hundreds of things in our daily life. For instance, going to a movie does not manifest God to others; rather, it produces questions in others about our character. Likewise, going to a bar, even if it is to preach the gospel, will not give others an impression of godliness; rather, it will cause us to lose our testimony. This is not merely an outward matter. If we kneel down to pray in our bedroom while a certain kind of picture is hanging on the wall, we may immediately have a sense to rise up and throw it away. There is no need for anyone to tell us to take it down. Because the Triune God has been dispensed into us in His economy, we may have a sense from within that He is not happy as long as that picture is hanging on our wall. This is godliness, not a doctrine. Likewise, if we go to a bar, the next morning we will have difficulty praying because the Triune God who has been dispensed into us does not agree with our going to a bar. This is not an outward regulation but an inward reality. As children of God, regardless of our age or status, we all have the reality of the Triune God within us. This is godliness.</p>
<p>If a brother tries to speak the word of God while wearing a showy tie, he may lose the anointing of the Spirit within, and the saints who are listening to him may be distracted by the tie. Wearing such a tie, therefore, cannot be godliness, God manifested in the flesh. These are not insignificant matters. My burden is not to give regulations concerning the kind of ties we should wear or concerning anything else. Rather, we need to see that whatever we do, whatever we are, and whatever we wear should give others an impression of godliness.</p>
<p>Another practical area in which we should lead a life in all godliness is our conversations. The words out of our mouth should give others the impression of God being manifested in the flesh. We should not allow loose talk and gossip to come into the church life. We must exercise our spirit to reject such talk, which does not bear any impression of God being manifested in our flesh.</p>
<p>Even in the small things, we need to lead a life in all godliness. When deciding whether or not to buy a certain pair of shoes, we should not consider the style first. Rather, we need to consider whether God could be manifested in this pair of shoes. This is my practice. If we choose the hairstyle of a movie star, when others see us, they will be impressed with the movie star, not with God. Our hairstyle should give others the impression of godliness. If we choose a worldly hairstyle, we will not have any impact on the barber if we try to preach the gospel to him. If a barber proposes a new worldly hairstyle to a young brother, but the young brother asks instead for a common hairstyle, the barber may ask why he has made this choice. Thus, the brother&rsquo;s testimony opens up a way for him to say a few words concerning the Lord Jesus and gives impact to what he says. The barber may initially argue with him, but something will impress the barber within. Perhaps he will wake up that night and consider the testimony of the young brother. The Holy Spirit will then speak to him. This is the proper way to preach the gospel. We do not merely preach the gospel; we live it. As branches of Christ, we live the vine and grow the vine. We preach the gospel by our daily living. This is godliness.</p>
<p>We need to lead a life in all godliness, not only in certain things, such as coming to the meetings, singing, praising, and testifying, but everywhere and in everything. A famous Christian minister in the late 1800s once purchased and moved into a new house. Once he had arranged everything and decorated the house, he invited his father to come to see his new house. After his father had looked in every room, he said that everything was nice but that he did not see anything indicating that the house&rsquo;s owner was a child of God. What we display in our home should strongly impress others with godliness. Godliness is not merely an outward matter. The word <em>manifested</em> in 1 Timothy 3:16 indicates that godliness is an inward life with an outward expression. In order for God to be manifested in the flesh, godliness needs to be expressed in our whole living. Whatever we say, express, do, and wear should give an impression of God being manifested in us. If we practice to lead a life in all godliness, we will not go to certain places or attend certain events. Godliness would not allow us to touch unclean things; rather, godliness will separate us from all ungodly things.</p><h2 class="head2">Exercising Ourselves unto Godliness</h2>
<p>First Timothy 4:7-8 says, &ldquo;Exercise yourself unto godliness. For bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the present life and of that which is to come.&rdquo; Bodily exercise is necessary; Paul did not say that it is not profitable. However, many sports today go beyond the realm of health into the realm of showing how capable and skillful one is. Rivalry, pride, and other sinful things are found in sports. We need to exercise our bodies for the sake of our health, but we should not do this in the realm of making a show.</p>
<p>We need to consider what it means to exercise ourselves unto godliness. Regrettably, even in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery many saints do not exercise themselves unto godliness. One way to exercise ourselves unto godliness is to show the proper reverence when reading the Bible. This is not to be old-fashioned or legal. If a new brother comes to ask an older brother a spiritual question and sees him reading the Bible while carelessly lying on the floor with his feet on the sofa, the new believer may doubt whether this brother is the right one to answer his question. Surely, this is not godliness; reading the Bible with improper posture or attire would never give others the impression that God is manifested in us. On the other hand, if a new believer sees a more mature believer kneeling before an open Bible, praying and reading, the new believer may receive much help without even asking a question. The new believer will be impressed with the other&rsquo;s respect, fear, and love of God. This is godliness, God manifested in the flesh. Even when no one sees us, we need to exercise ourselves unto godliness when reading the Bible, for it is the word of our heavenly Father.</p>
<p>Another way to exercise ourselves unto godliness is to be restricted in our speaking. We need to learn to express godliness when we speak to others. Whether they are believers or unbelievers, our speech should show them that we are not loose and lawless without any restraint but that we love God and have a holy fear of God. Nothing has a greater impact on others than our speaking. If we preach the gospel to an unsaved family member, but we speak in a light and loose way at other times, this family member will not be impressed that what we are preaching is truly meaningful. However, if we learn to speak by exercising ourselves unto godliness, always speaking with accuracy and sobriety, the family member will gradually receive an impression that we are truly different. Eventually, he will be convinced by our way of speaking and will be brought to the Lord. This is to exercise ourselves unto godliness.</p>
<p>We need to exercise ourselves unto godliness in everything&mdash;in small things and in great things. We need to exercise our bodies, but we should exercise ourselves unto godliness even as we are exercising our bodies. The way we exercise can give others an impression of godliness. We need to exercise ourselves unto godliness in considering what to wear while exercising.</p>
<p>The church does not have any regulations concerning the kind of clothes we should wear, but if a young sister stands up in a meeting to share a testimony of how she has been revived and has consecrated herself to Christ and the church, yet she is not properly covered by her clothing, the saints may wonder if God has truly been dispensed into her. They may think that God&rsquo;s economy is only a doctrine to her and is not her experience. This is not a matter of morality but a matter of godliness. Testifying before the church while wearing improper attire will not give any of the saints an impression of godliness; they will not see God manifested in us. What we wear is one of hundreds of areas in which we need to exercise ourselves unto godliness.</p>
<p>Sometimes our shouting in the meetings may be overstepping the line. In a race all the runners must run within their own lanes. If a runner runs out of his lane, he is overstepping. Even in shouting in the meeting, we must stay within our &ldquo;lane.&rdquo; Some shouting gives people the impression not of godliness but of looseness or lawlessness. Shouting is not wrong, but whatever we do must be done without overstepping. Whether we are singing, shouting, or jumping, we should bear an impression of godliness. This requires our being exercised unto godliness.</p>
<p>Shopping is another area in which we need to exercise ourselves unto godliness. Window-shopping can lead to the indulgence of lust. If we are exercised unto godliness, we will turn our eyes away from certain things. What we buy shows others the kind of person we are.</p>
<p>We also need to exercise ourselves unto godliness in our correspondence with other saints. By being restrained, accurate, and in fear of God when passing on church news, we can show care for the edification of others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Teaching Different Things but<br />
Consenting to Healthy Words and the Teaching Which Is according to Godliness</h2>
<p>First Timothy 6:3-5 says, &ldquo;If anyone teaches different things and does not consent to healthy words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching which is according to godliness, he is blinded with pride, understanding nothing, but is diseased with questionings and contentions of words, out of which come envy, strife, slanders, evil suspicions, perpetual wranglings of men corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth, supposing godliness to be a means of gain.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s word here is strong. We need to exercise ourselves unto godliness when we speak to others, being careful to speak healthy words. Healthy words supply life to others, but unhealthy words are full of death. We need to learn the lesson to exercise ourselves unto godliness in everything, but especially in the words we speak to others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">All Who Desire to Live Godly Being Persecuted</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 3:12 says, &ldquo;All who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.&rdquo; We need to live godly and be ready to suffer for it. There will be suffering, but it is a joy for us to live godly.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LAW OF FREEDOM</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 8:10-11; Rom. 6:14; 1 Cor. 9:21, 26-27; James 1:25; 2:12; 2 Tim. 1:7; 4:22</h1>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIPPING CONCERNING<br />
THE HEALTHY TEACHINGS IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we learned the definitions of the terms <em>God&rsquo;s economy</em> and <em>godliness.</em> We need to review the definitions of these terms not only in church meetings but also in smaller times of fellowship and even in family conversations. Such spontaneous fellowship will be a great help to us. We should not think that it is enough to hear or read a message one time. We first need to study the content of the message; then the Spirit will bring us into the experience of the message. The Lord has given us much new light in His recovery. Because the teachings in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are not ordinary shallow Christian teachings, we need to pay our full attention to them in order to fully understand and experience them. We need to be bathed in all the terms and healthy teachings in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery by making them the topic of our daily conversations. Rather than talking about low, worthless things, we should speak to one another about what we have read in the Life-study messages and other ministry books. This will enrich our Christian life and uplift the standard of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony among us.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 of this book is entitled &ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s Recovery Being the Recovery of Christ.&rdquo; In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we do not have various ways, activities, organizations, or dissenting, divisive teachings and doctrines; rather, we have only Christ. These words may be easy to understand and repeat, but we need to be able to illustrate what it means practically that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is nothing but Christ. We need to spend time to enter into these matters.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 concerns the content of the word and the Spirit. The content of both the word of God in the Bible and the Spirit is Christ, His death, and His resurrection. We should be able to explain that all the words in the Bible either cross us out with Christ&rsquo;s death or enliven us with His resurrection. Therefore, the word is our spiritual food that contains all the elements needed to kill the germs in our body and to supply us with life and strength. Every time we take the word of the Bible into us, we receive Christ, His death, and His resurrection. Then the word works within us, killing us and strengthening us.</p>
<p>We all need to fellowship about all these matters. Although these chapters are in simple words, they are quite profound and rich. As we fellowship concerning these matters, the Holy Spirit will work to bring us into the depths of all these truths. Then these truths will gradually be wrought into our being. These truths are rich food. Every time we read these chapters, we will receive something new, fresh, and refreshing because they contain the deep truths from the Word of God. Therefore, we need to fellowship concerning these matters until we fully enter into them and they are wrought into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GRACE NOT MAKING US LAWLESS</h2>
<p>Romans 6:14 says, &ldquo;For you are not under the law but under grace.&rdquo; This verse does not mean that we are fully liberated to do anything we want; grace does not make us lawless. The law referred to in this verse is the Old Testament law, the law given through Moses. Although we certainly are not under that law today, this does not mean that God has no law toward us. God is not a lawless God. In the New Testament God has imparted His law upon our hearts (Heb. 10:16). In the Old Testament it may have been possible to disregard the Ten Commandments, which were written on tablets of stone, but today God&rsquo;s law has been written into our hearts. We cannot disregard this subjective law within us. Furthermore, the law of the New Testament is stricter than the law of Moses. What God does is always advancing and going higher. Romans 6:14 does not mean that today we are not under any law; rather, it means that we are not under the Old Testament law, the objective law written on tablets of stone. Today we are under a law that is stricter and more subjective to us; it is written upon our hearts.</p><h2 class="head1">THE OLD TESTAMENT LAW<br />
BEING THE LAW OF BONDAGE</h2>
<p>The Old Testament law, the law given through Moses, was a law of bondage (Gal. 5:1). Because we are not able to keep the Old Testament law, we are bound by it. The law says, &ldquo;You shall not covet&rdquo; (Exo. 20:17a). A missionary in China once preached the gospel to his cook, explaining that all people are sinners and need salvation. However, the cook resisted, claiming that he was a good man who never sinned. The missionary wisely did not argue with the cook but instead began to talk about a fine horse that the missionary owned. The cook immediately began to think about the missionary&rsquo;s horse and how he could obtain it. The next day, when the missionary spoke again to the cook concerning all men needing salvation, the cook again claimed to be a good man who never sinned. The missionary then asked what the cook had been thinking about since their previous conversation. The cook admitted that he had been thinking about the missionary&rsquo;s horse and how to obtain it. The missionary pointed out that this was covetousness and was a sin, and the cook was convicted.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW TESTAMENT LAW<br />
BEING THE LAW OF FREEDOM</h2>
<p>Because no one can keep the Old Testament law, it is the law of bondage. Because the New Testament law, which is written upon our hearts, frees us, it is a law of freedom. Romans 8:2a says, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Today we are under the law of freedom, not under the law of bondage. The law of freedom is written not on stone but upon our hearts. Many saints have testified that as they were going to an ungodly place, although they were outwardly claiming to be liberated, something bothered them within. This inward feeling, sensation, or consciousness is the function of the law written upon our hearts. This shows that we are indeed under a law. Regardless of how much we believers may declare that we have been liberated, there is always a living law within us. Whenever we do something that offends God, this living law within rebukes us. Although we are always under the inner law, if we obey this law, it immediately frees us.</p>
<p>Many people are under the bondage of movies. A young brother may lie to his mother, telling her that he is going to the library when he is actually going to a movie theater. After returning home, the young brother may lie again when his mother asks about what he studied. By telling two lies, both of which will be judged by God, this young brother has shown that he is bound by movies. However, the law written in our hearts can free us from such bondage. This law frees us by troubling us. Before being saved, a young man may have felt fine and even proud after deceiving his mother in such a way. After being saved, however, something within will bother him both about going to a movie and about lying to his mother. Thus, the law of freedom bothers us, troubling us within. This law is very patient. If we disregard the troubling within, this law will simply continue to trouble us. Sooner or later, we will be subdued because a bothering element has been written upon our hearts.</p>
<p>Apparently, to be a Christian is to have peace. Actually, however, after becoming Christians, we do not always have peace. We are often bothered by the One who is within. This bothering One will not stop His bothering. He may continue bothering us for years. We will never convince Him to allow us to do certain things. He will patiently and gently continue bothering us until He subdues us. When He subdues us, the law within becomes the law of freedom. The law of freedom can thus free us from the bondage of movies or anything else.</p>
<p>We should not think that today we are not under any law. Christians are under the strictest law; it binds us even in minor points. This law, which is within every believer, requires not only that we speak the truth but also that every word be accurate. The more we love the Lord, the more this law will operate by troubling us. Before being saved, we were lawless, but after being saved, we become people of law. God&rsquo;s law is written upon our hearts. In 1 Corinthians 9:21 Paul says, &ldquo;I am not without law to God but within law to Christ.&rdquo; We are under the law to Christ. There is a new law in the New Testament, the law of freedom, which is also called the law of Christ (Gal. 6:2). We are under the law of freedom, the law of Christ. Every Christian is a lawful person, a person under law. This law is stricter and finer than the old law. If we have only a little pride within us, although no one may perceive it, the law within will condemn our pride. We all need to realize that we are under this law.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW TESTAMENT COMMANDMENTS</h2>
<p>Those who misuse Romans 6:14 as a justification to live lawlessly say that as New Testament believers we should not be under any commandments. However, there are far more than ten commandments in the New Testament. The first commandment in the New Testament is &ldquo;repent and believe&rdquo; (Mark 1:15); the second is &ldquo;be baptized&rdquo; (Acts 2:38). Other commandments in the New Testament are &ldquo;love one another&rdquo; (John 13:34), &ldquo;unceasingly pray&rdquo; (1 Thes. 5:17), and &ldquo;always rejoice&rdquo; (v. 16). If we do not rejoice, we are disobeying God&rsquo;s commandment.</p>
<p>Another commandment in the New Testament says, &ldquo;In nothing be anxious&rdquo; (Phil. 4:6). To be anxious is to worry. Parents know that the more children they have, the more anxieties they have. My mother often worried about her second daughter, my sister, who was teaching hundreds of miles away in another province. One morning my mother was nearly weeping and seemed to be angry with me. I asked, &ldquo;Mother, what happened?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;It has been four weeks since we received a letter from your sister, but you have not said a word. Last night I dreamed that she is very sick. You do not have a heart for your sister.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Mother, this was only a dream. Be at peace.&rdquo; However, this only made her more upset. I did not understand that what she really wanted was for me to send a telegram to check on my sister. She did not say this but instead rebuked me with the intention that I would understand her heart. I said many things to appease her, but nothing worked. Finally, she said, &ldquo;Why are you so dull? Don&rsquo;t you know that you should send a telegram?&rdquo; I immediately ran to send the telegram, and that afternoon the reply came from my sister that all was well. When we are anxious about anything, we commit a sin, for the New Testament says, &ldquo;In nothing be anxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Romans 12:2a says, &ldquo;Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; Verse 11 says, &ldquo;Do not be slothful in zeal, but be burning in spirit, serving the Lord.&rdquo; These also are commandments. If our spirit is not burning, we are disobeying a commandment. Therefore, we cannot say that we are not under any commandments. The New Testament is full of commandments that are even finer than the law in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Second Timothy 2:22 says, &ldquo;Flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&rdquo; This is a commandment to the young people. The young people should not believe that they cannot overcome their flesh and that they should therefore allow their flesh to do whatever it desires. This is terrible lawlessness. Young believers should heed the commandment to flee youthful lusts.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Christians are not lawless people; we are the most lawful people on the earth. In our eating, dressing, and lodging we are lawful. In everything we are under the commandments of the New Testament, the new law, which is the law of Christ and the law of freedom. The more we keep the new law in the New Testament, the more we are truly liberated. Genuine, true freedom is not lawlessness but the new law, which releases us from the bondage of all kinds of wrongdoings and sinfulness. When we are freed from all kinds of wrongdoings and sinfulness, we are fully in freedom. This is the Christian life.</p>
<p>In this book we have seen a number of crucial matters. First, we need to spend time in the Word every day, for the word in the Bible embodies God, Christ, the Spirit, and life. The word and the Spirit are composed of Christ, His terminating death, and His enlivening resurrection. Every portion in the Bible is either the word of the cross or the word of life. We also need to see that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is simply the recovery of Christ Himself as everything to us. If we see this, we will drop all concepts, ways, activities, and organization and simply cleave to Christ in everything. Furthermore, we need to realize that God&rsquo;s economy is God coming into us and that godliness is God flowing out of us. If we see and practice these things, we will live under the law of freedom. We need to review all these matters, fellowship concerning them, and practice them until they are wrought into our being. Then the church will be uplifted and enriched and will grow unto maturity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: Why does the law of freedom continually bother us?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The law of freedom is the law of life (Rom. 8:2). A baby does not know the words <em>bitter</em> or <em>sweet,</em> but he will always swallow something sweet and spit out something bitter. This illustrates the function of the law of life. The baby is living, and in his life is a law that regulates him, causing him to swallow the sweet and spit out the bitter. Every life has a law. Because we have been born of God, we have received the life of God. With the divine life there is a divine law. Before being saved, if we went to a movie, we did not sense any bitterness. Rather, we may have felt happy. After being saved, if we still go to a movie, something within will cause us to feel bad. However, not many Christians are immediately willing to obey this inner feeling. Therefore, this inner feeling will trouble us again and again, even for years, until we are eventually subdued. Nevertheless, the sooner we obey, the better. By obeying sooner, we save ourselves from the bitterness and from wasting time.</p>
<p><em>Question: How can we keep the New Testament law?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Second Timothy 1:7 concerns our human spirit, and 4:22 concerns Christ as the life-giving Spirit being with our spirit. The real experience of the Christian life is entirely related to these two spirits&mdash;our spirit and Christ as the life-giving Spirit. The unique way to keep the New Testament law is to always remain in our spirit. As soon as we realize that we are not in our spirit, we need to immediately turn back to our spirit. To walk in Christ, to walk in the spirit, and to keep the New Testament law are all the same thing. Our spirit indwelt by Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the basic principle of every experience of the Christian life. We should not care for our reasonings, our arguments, our emotions, our decisions, or anything else within us. We need only to take care of remaining in our spirit, going along with our spirit, and always returning to our spirit. The only way to live the Christian life is to practice this.</p>
<p><em>Question: In 1 Corinthians 9:21-22 Paul says, &ldquo;To those without law, as without law (though I am not without law to God but within law to Christ), that I might gain those without law. To the weak I became weak that I might gain the weak. To all men I have become all things that I might by all means save some.&rdquo; Based on this verse, some have said that we can participate in worldly activities in order to preach the gospel. Is this right?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Verses 21 through 22 do not mean that we must be the same as the person whom we intend to save. They do not mean that in order to save a robber, we must become a robber. We must always understand a portion of the Bible according to its context. The context of these verses shows that Paul was speaking in reference to the different ways of eating and practice held by Jews and Gentiles. When Paul was with the Jews, he behaved in a way so as not to violate their laws, particularly with regard to eating, but when he was with the Gentiles, he did not behave according to the practices of the Jews. The &ldquo;all things&rdquo; that Paul spoke of becoming were related to different ways of eating and living, not to worldly, defiling activities.</p>
<p><em>Question: My children are saved, but I cannot always convince them to come to the meetings. What is the best way to care for them?</em></p>
<p>Answer: To be a parent is very difficult. No amount of teaching concerning parenting is adequate. When couples do not have children, they pray as Hannah, the mother of Samuel, prayed for a son (1 Sam. 1:10-11). The Lord may hear their prayer and give them a child, but this child may become a great troublemaker. Although there is no unique, fail-safe method for parenting, there are a few lessons we can learn.</p>
<p>First, in order to raise our children to love the Lord and to come to the church meetings regularly, we must be a proper person. We must have a proper living before the Lord. Besides the Lord, the persons who know best about the kind of life we live are our children. We may be able to fool others about the kind of person we are, but we can never fool our children. Therefore, we need to be genuine. If we tell our children not to tell lies, yet we lie to our spouse, the children will see it. This is very serious, for if we lie to our spouse only one time, our children may remember it for their whole life. Our behavior and our way of living does not affect anyone as much as it affects our children. This is a universal spiritual principle. Therefore, being a parent is not easy. Our children will be negatively affected if we are not upright persons, but this does not mean that our children will be good if we are upright persons. If an upright mother has four children, two may be good, and the other two may be bad. However, if she is not upright, all her children may be worse. It is difficult to predict how a child will turn out; this depends on many factors.</p>
<p>Besides being proper persons, parents need to exercise their wisdom. This is the area in which most parents are lacking. It is easy for a parent to have love, but it is not as easy to have wisdom. Parents must exercise their wisdom to discern whether or not to charge their children to come to the church meetings. Asking whether or not parents should charge their children to come to the meetings may be likened to asking whether or not we should take an umbrella when we go out. For such situations, we need to exercise our wisdom to discern the situation. According to our discernment, we may exhort our children. However, some parents are zealous without wisdom, and their zealousness offends their children. The more they charge their children to come to the meetings, the more they offend their children, causing a strong reaction. This matter is not easy. Parents need to be proper persons and exercise their wisdom. It is right to charge our children to come to the meetings, but we need to discern, based on our children&rsquo;s condition, the proper time and the proper way to charge them. If our children are in a certain condition, it may be better not to charge them to come the meetings until their condition improves.</p>
<p>Finally, parents need to trust in the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. Romans 9:16 says, &ldquo;It is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy.&rdquo; I have seen many spiritual parents whose children have not been good. I have also seen worldly, backslidden, careless parents who are absolutely indifferent about their children&rsquo;s spirituality, yet their children are good and spiritual. Therefore, we must conclude that the way our children turn out depends on the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. The first part of verse 18 says, &ldquo;He has mercy on whom He wills.&rdquo; As parents, our duty is to be proper persons and to exercise wisdom to discern when and how to speak to our children. We need to do our duty, but we should not trust in anything we do. Without the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, everything we do means nothing. We must trust in the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, praying, &ldquo;Lord, it all depends on Your mercy. I do my duty as a parent by being a proper person to be a good example and to not stumble my children and by exercising my wisdom to know when and how to speak to my children. However, my trust is in You, Lord.&rdquo; We all need to learn this lesson. Parents should never be proud, thinking that their ability can produce the best children. There are many different factors in producing a good child, but in the end it depends on the Lord&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p><em>Question: How should I regulate my children concerning watching television and movies?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Because of the current of the age, it is very difficult for parents to forbid their children to watch television and movies. Therefore, parents need to exercise their wisdom to restrict which television shows or movies to allow their children to see. We also need to teach our children the reasons for these restrictions so that they will understand our decisions as they grow older. We need to give them a proper explanation according to their age, not prematurely. We should not tell them something that they cannot understand at their age. Our training must be according to their age.</p>
<p>To raise children is not easy or simple. It requires that we spend much time with our children. The more time we spend with our children, the better. We should spend at least two hours every evening doing nothing but being with our children, talking to them, or teaching them something. This will make them happy and give them some training. If we do not spend time with our children, we should expect that they will have problems. Although we cannot always afford to spend that much time with our children, the principle is that we need to spend as much time as possible with our children and give them the proper education according to their age.</p>
<p><em>Question: Some young brothers and sisters who leave home to study end up staying in dormitories with unbelievers. What is the best way to care for these young ones?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is difficult to know whether it is better to keep our children at home or send them to school in another city. This is a very complicated matter with many factors involved. However, one thing I know is that in order to take care of our children, we always need to prepare them ahead of time. In order to properly care for a fifteen year old, we need to spend fourteen years to educate the child. Every bit of proper education at the proper age is an inoculation. If we adequately educate and inoculate our children, they can leave home to study without any problem. If we do not adequately educate and inoculate our children, it will not matter much if they stay at home while studying. A fifteen year old&rsquo;s spiritual health depends on how much education and inoculation he received in his first fourteen years. If parents do not properly prepare their children, it will not help much to suddenly consider where they should go to school. This is a warning to all parents. We must not neglect the raising of our children. If God has given us children, we must spend adequate time to raise them properly. Everyone likes to have choices, but we lose all our choices when we have children. Besides the time we spend in the meetings, we need to spend every minute for our children. Otherwise, we should not expect that we would have good children. The only way to have good children is to spend all our time with them and exercise our wisdom to give them a proper education and adequate inoculation beforehand. However, after all this, we still must place our trust in God&rsquo;s mercy.</p></body></html>
