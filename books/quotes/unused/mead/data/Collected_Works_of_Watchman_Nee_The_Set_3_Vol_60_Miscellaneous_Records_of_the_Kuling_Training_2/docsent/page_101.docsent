   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN A FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to fellowship some concerning our work and service.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE WORK IN KWANGTUNG AND KWANGSI</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Canton is the center of Kwangtung and Kwangsi provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A great need exists there, but there are not enough workers in Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moreover, it is easy for Canton to be affected by the "customs of the nations."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The general atmosphere of the south is more relaxed and loose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Subconsciously, this looseness creeps into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the workers who are in south China have to be strict and firm in their character; they have to bring in an atmosphere of strictness and firmness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In working for the Lord, we have to learn to seize opportunities, and opportunities are contained in time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus said to the disciples, "We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world" John 9:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord has entrusted the gospel work in the whole of China into our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are presented with an unprecedented opportunity for our work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to seize this opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1919 the Soviet Union seized power, but it did not start persecuting Christians until 1929.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before that time the believers seized the opportunity to preach the gospel, and they gained many.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Soviet Union did not return to a policy of freedom of religion until around 1940.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although the Christians lost much time during these eleven years, they had a firm foundation because they had seized the opportunity during the previous eleven years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to do the same thing today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should do a day's work when there is a day provided to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should try our best to gain as many people as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CENTER OF WORK</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have seen clearly that the line of work began from Acts 1.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Acts 1 all the apostles gathered together in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By chapter eight the disciples had suffered great persecutions and were scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the apostles remained in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They went out only when there was a need.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After they worked, they returned to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, Jerusalem was a center of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the apostles remained in this center, and all of them served in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today we have to follow the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we have twenty workers, there will not be a center of the work unless these twenty gather together in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If every apostle works separately, it would be easy for each one to dominate over his own locality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>NOT RECEIVING CO-WORKERS LIGHTLY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to be very careful not to receive a co-worker lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There must be an official letter of recommendation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some brothers have joined us from the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They can give messages and may be quite eloquent, yet it is possible that they will criticize our work as soon as they step off the platform.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will destroy our work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We hope that all the co-workers will be co-laborers in one accord, and that they will all see God's way today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is easy to come up to Kuling Mountain, but it is not that easy to go back down.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I hope that you will have genuine growth through this training, and I hope that you will no longer recognize anyone according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After you leave the mountain, you have to raise up a group of people wherever you are and train them to serve the Lord together.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You have to perfect them to do what you can do and even to do better than what you can do.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In selecting people, do not consider just outward factors; you have to consider their spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You must give them the special kind of food they need.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You have to feed them and perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The best place to start is with the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They are not as subjective, and it is easier to perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some people are soft outwardly but hard inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These ones may never have admitted their mistakes to God or to man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Such ones are useless in the hand of the Lord, even if they are very clever and gifted.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The principle of work is to do everything to perfect the brothers and to build up some leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You are not going to the different places to be "resident pastors."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Never fall into the Protestant practice of the pastoral system.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Never grab the meetings and the services and put them into your own pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every locality should produce its own people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You should perfect at least eight or ten people to serve together and to manage the church together with you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You have to perfect all the brothers and sisters so that they can all serve.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Brother Witness Lee's virtue lies in his ability to perfect the saints and to usher them all into the service.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In order to perfect and lead, you have to be a pattern to them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For this reason, you have to sanctify yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Brother Witness Lee says that the more we dig the channels, the deeper the water will flow.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Water flows to the deepest places.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If our digging is too shallow, water will flow elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God's blessing depends on our capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I hope that we will all dig deeply and dig thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The church must not only preach the gospel but must also conduct new believers' trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we do not catch up with this second phase of the work, our gospel work will come to a standstill in a year, and it will not be easy to conduct make-up lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is hard to have make-up lessons with the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have to start early.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have to try our best to bring saints up to the proper standard while they have a heart for this.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The ministry should not interfere with the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In fact, the ministry is for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In terms of material supply, a worker should not ask for anything from a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He should not covet a thread or a needle.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If a local church does not receive my ministry, I can only withdraw from it.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We should not try to impose our ministry on others.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Another point worth noting is that our church meetings should not be too long.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Our messages should not be too long, and our prayers should not be too long.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Once they are long, they lose the impact, and our spirit becomes weak.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Kuling is an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When messages or prayers become long, our spirit becomes worn out, and it is hard for it to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Unless we are constrained by necessity, our messages should be only forty-five to sixty minutes long.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There are many long Epistles in the Bible, but it is best if our messages on the platform are short.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The training on the mountain is only a beginning for you.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It sets the basis for you to receive further training in many areas.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>After you leave the mountain, there are richer and deeper lessons you have to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The most important thing to learn is to exercise accurate judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It is a pity to make mistakes in your actions, but it is a greater pity to make mistakes in your judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In this matter, you have to learn to free yourself from individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Only then will you be able to pick up accurate judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>On the one hand, you have to be enlightened within.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>On the other hand, you have to touch God's mind by going to Him together with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>What does the Lord want you to do in coordination with the other brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Even though other co-workers may not be with you, this asking will save you from acting according to your own will.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Brother Witness has good judgment because he has learned his lesson this way.</S>
