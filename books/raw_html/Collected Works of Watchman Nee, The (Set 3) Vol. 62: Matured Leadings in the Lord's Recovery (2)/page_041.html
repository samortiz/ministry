<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE GENUINE SERVICE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Evening, February 25, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee<br />Scripture Reading:Eph. 4:11-12, 16</h1><h2 class="head1">MAINTAINING A FRESH CONSECRATION</h2><p>Watchman Nee:These are sobering days. Some of you have handed yourselves over to the Lord and are willing to rise up to serve Him. You might have struggled a little at the beginning. During your struggle you might have experienced pain and sadness, but once you offered yourself, you were filled with joy. I can sense your feeling. Many people have filled out a consecration slip and indicated a willingness to offer all, including future, career, time, and body to the Lord. But today I want to ask a question: Is your feeling different today from when you handed yourself over to the Lord ten or twenty days ago? It seems as if your feeling tonight is not as strong as it was a few days ago. Whenever we slip back in our consecration, we slip back in our Christian life. Every day we have to ask ourselves, "Am I still fresh? Am I still shining inwardly?" The Christian life is like polishing shoes; they must be polished again and again to maintain a shine. If we feel that we are no longer shining inwardly, we have to ask the Lord if something is wrong with us. We have to find out why we have lost the heavenly taste. We must learn to maintain a fresh consecration all the time.</p><p>In the Old Testament, the fire in the outer court was lighted only once. After that it needed wood and sacrifice daily to keep the fire burning day and night (Lev. 6:12). The fire could only be lighted once. One does not wait until the fire goes out to light it again. The fire on the altar is an unceasing fire. In order to keep it burning, there must be sacrifices every day. In the New Testament we offer ourselves as a living sacrifice (Rom. 12:1). In order to keep the fire burning, we need to offer ourselves up continually as a sacrifice. A living sacrifice means that we offer ourselves to God as a sacrifice while we are living. If there is sin, reservation, or staleness in us, or if we forego our consecration, the divine fire on the altar will stop. If we do not do anything that hurts ourselves, if we will not inflict pain on our feelings, love, will, ambition, human aspirations, desires, and hopes, we have stopped offering ourselves as a living sacrifice. If we have never hurt ourselves once, we can claim that we are filled with joy, but this joy will be unreliable. Once we offer up everything as an offering, we have sacrificed ourselves. We will suffer loss, pain, and wounds, but God will gain something. Therefore, if you feel that your joy in the last few days has waned, you can try giving away some of your cherished items again. When you give them away with one hand, you may be filled with pain and hurt, but you will receive joy with the other hand. It seems as if you are acting against yourself, but this is the only way to ensure that your joy remains.</p><p>Please forgive me for saying this: The joy in some people's face changes all the time, but when others make a decision, they never change back. If our consecration does not change, our joy will not change. Those whose joy has changed have changed their consecration. If we want to maintain and even deepen our joy, we need a constant consecration. A Christian's face is a window. From this window we see his consecration. It is one thing to fill out a consecration slip. It is another thing to draw a sword to kill. We admit that we are too slow in reviewing and processing your consecration. The brothers and sisters who are responsible for this work are not experienced enough. But what we have offered to the Lord belongs to Him forever. We cannot regret and try to take it back. We must never eat what we have vomited. Otherwise, we will lose the blessing of the Lord which we are entitled to receive from Him.</p>
