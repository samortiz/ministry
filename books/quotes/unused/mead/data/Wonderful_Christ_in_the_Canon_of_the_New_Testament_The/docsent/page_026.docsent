   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the way to open the kingdom and establish the church?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is by imparting King Jesus as the seed of the kingdom into others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jesus is the king, and He is the seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we were saved, this kingly seed was sown into us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>None of the kings in the world could rule over our family and home life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The president of the U.S.A. would never come into our kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But King Jesus not only comes into our kitchen, He comes into every corner of our house.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He cares about every little detail.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is such a king in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hallelujah, Jesus is our king!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And as our king He is on one hand the sower, and on the other hand the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The king came as the sower to sow Himself as the seed of the kingdom into our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the king, and this is also the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The king, the kingdom, and the seed of the kingdom all are Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Isn t this wonderful?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE POOR IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How can we take this kingdom into us?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The answer is in a verse fully missed by today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven Matt 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Most Christians do not know what it means to be poor in spirit, therefore the kingdom is not theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The spirit mentioned here in Matthew 5:3 is not the Holy Spirit, but our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we would touch Him, we must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Most people are filled with worthless things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are full of religious concepts, human concepts, and dead knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was the case with the Pharisees and the Sadducees.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They were full of religious refuse and had no room in their spirit for Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What does it mean to be poor in spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It means we are clear that religion, science, culture, philosophy, and dead Bible doctrines are all refuse, and we should not be preoccupied with any of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be poor in spirit we need to pray in this way: O Lord Jesus, all the doctrines mean nothing to me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Regardless of what I have learned in the past years, I am still poor, I am still hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I need You, Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I don t need anything but You.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we begin to pray like this, something deep within is flowing, living, working, watering, enlightening, strengthening, and reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is Jesus as the seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once we call on Him in this way, we can never be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we realize that all the things which we have held onto in the past are refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Religion, doctrine, dead Bible knowledge, philosophy, and science all are refuse!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only Jesus is worth anything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A MATTER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Jesus came to preach the kingdom, He did not preach to the Gentiles, but to those who knew the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They had the scriptural knowledge, but they did not have the King Jesus, and they did not have the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>So Jesus came to sow Himself as the seed of the kingdom into the people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The growing up of this seed becomes the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This kingdom is altogether a matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jesus said that if our righteousness does not exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, we are finished as far as the kingdom is concerned Matt 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But, praise the Lord, we have Jesus within us growing as our righteousness; so we are in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>FULFILLING GOD S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The kingdom is also something which absolutely fulfills God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no more rebellion, because there is no discrepancy between God s will and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In fact, the kingdom is just God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Matt 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many Christians have done things in the name of the Lord, but the Lord will never own or approve that kind of thing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you or, allowed you : depart from me, ye that work lawlessness Matt 7:23 Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>. In the Lord s eyes, even prophesying and casting out demons in the name of the Lord not according to God s will is lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The kingdom is absolutely a matter of righteousness, a matter of God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>TAKE JESUS IN</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How can we do God s will in the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is no other way but to take Jesus in. We should not try to do the will of God ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We will only fail.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The way to fulfill God s will is to take in the One who obeys God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Jesus is the kingdom of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We simply need to take Him in, to eat Him as the children s bread.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We may be the Gentile dogs, but we all have our portion under the table Matt 15:22-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We all can eat King Jesus and take Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All the kingly elements are in this bread.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The more we eat Jesus, the more the royal ingredients will get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Praise the Lord for such a ruling element within.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the mysterious kingdom that is mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Now we are clear why Jesus told the disciples at the end of this book, All authority is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit Matt 28:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are to disciple the nations and baptize them into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When we baptize people into the Triune God, we baptize them into Christ, into the kingdom seed, and into the kingdom!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When we baptize people, we must exercise our faith to put them into the King and into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is why all the people in the churches are the kingdom people.</S>
