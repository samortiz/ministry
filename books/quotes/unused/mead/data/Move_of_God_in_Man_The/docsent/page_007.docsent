   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit participated in the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many Christians are accustomed to saying that the incarnation is merely the incarnation of Christ, but we must realize that this is the incarnation of Christ with the Divine Trinity.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why we do not say that God the Father accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We say that God the Son accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Acts 20:28, however, says that God obtained the church with "His own blood."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, the blood of Christ is the blood of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This implies that the Lord Jesus is God.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Is this One the Son or the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 5:43a says that the Son came in the name of the Father.</S>
