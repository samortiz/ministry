   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EYEWITNESSES OF THE LORD S MAJESTY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the word eyewitnesses Darby comments, Admitted into immediate vision of the glory, a word used for full initiation into the mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Peter realizes that he James, and John were admitted to the highest degree of initiation at the Lord s transfiguration, admitted to be the initiated spectators of His majesty.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Peter considers the Lord s transfiguration as a figure of His second coming, even as the Lord did in Luke 9:26-36.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord s transfiguration in glory was a fact, and Peter was in it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord s coming back in glory will also be a fact as real as His transfiguration, and Peter will also be in it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not a cleverly devised myth passed on to the believers by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Peter says that the apostles became eyewitnesses of the Lord s majesty.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This majesty denotes magnificence, greatness in splendor, honor, and glory, even magnificent glory 2 Pet 1:17 , as appeared to the eyes of Peter and the other two disciples in the Lord s transfiguration Matt 17:2; Luke 9:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 16 Peter seems to be saying, We have told you that the Lord Jesus will come back in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not a tale or a myth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even when He was on earth, the glory came out of Him, and He was transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We saw His majesty when we were with Him on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We were eyewitnesses; we were initiated into a vision of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this verse Peter combines the Lord s transfiguration with His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that Christ s transfiguration is a prefigure of His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Luke 9:26-36 the Lord Jesus also indicated that His transfiguration was a figure of His glory in His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verses 17 and 18 Peter continues, For He received from God the Father honor and glory, such a voice being borne to Him by the magnificent glory: This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And this voice we heard being borne out of heaven, being together with Him in the holy mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Honor is a matter of position, and glory is a matter of state.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the mount of transfiguration, the Lord was in a position of honor and in a state of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peter says that a voice was borne to the Lord by the magnificent glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This magnificent glory denotes the overshadowing cloud at the Lord s transfiguration Luke 9:34-35 , like the shekinah glory overshadowing the propitiation cover Exo 25:20; 40:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we read the account in Matthew, Mark, and Luke concerning the Lord s transfiguration, we shall see that the magnificent glory in verse 17 refers to the overshadowing cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Peter, James, and John saw the cloud, and that cloud was the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, in ancient times, after the tabernacle had been erected, it was filled with the glory of God, for the cloud of God s glory overshadowed the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It would have been difficult to discern the cloud from the glory, because the cloud was with the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>INOCULATING THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>AGAINST APOSTASY</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This Epistle was written in the time of the church s degradation and apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This apostasy was the background of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Peter s burden was to inoculate the believers against the poison of apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Apostasy is a deviation from fundamental truth or belief.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Approximately thirty years after the church had been established, apostasy began to creep in. There was a deviation from the track of fundamental belief.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Certain ones were teaching heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One of these heresies was that the preaching concerning the coming back of the Lord Jesus in glory is a myth, a tale that is not believable or trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we shall see when we come to chapter three, certain mockers said, Where is the promise of His coming?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These heretics and apostates regarded the teaching that the Lord would come back in glory to judge the earth as a superstitious tale.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The heretics at the time this Epistle was written can be compared to today s Modernists.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Modernists are a class of teachers who claim that the Bible is not inspired by God and that the miracles recorded in the Bible are merely superstitious stories.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, Modernists do not believe that the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea in a miraculous way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead, some Modernists think that the children of Israel walked through shallow water, water that was made shallow by the blowing of a strong wind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In like manner, Modernists do not believe that the Lord Jesus fed the multitude with five loaves and two fishes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They explain this by saying that those in the crowd brought food with them and simply ate whatever they had brought.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even more serious, Modernists teach that Jesus was not born of a virgin and that He was not God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They claim that He died on the cross not for our redemption, but as a sacrifice for the kind of ism in which He believed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, they do not believe in the bodily resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In many respects, the Modernists of today and the heretics of the first century are similar.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this Epistle Peter is giving the believers a strong testimony as an inoculation against heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the reason he points out that the apostles did not follow cleverly devised myths when they spoke to them about the coming of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Peter seems to be saying, Don t listen to the heretics.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Along with John and James, I was an eyewitness of the Lord s majesty on the holy mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We were with Him when He was transfigured, and we heard the voice declaring, This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What we have told you is not a legend, myth, or superstitious tale.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We testified of what we have seen and heard.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We saw the Lord Jesus transfigured, and we know that as He was glorified in His transfiguration, so He will come again in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You need to receive our word and believe it.</S>
