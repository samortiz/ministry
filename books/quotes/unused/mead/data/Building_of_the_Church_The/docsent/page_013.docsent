   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO BE TRANSFORMED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO PRECIOUS STONES FOR GOD S BUILDING By Regeneration</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we need to see how we fallen, sinful, polluted, and contaminated human beings can become precious stones for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to become such precious stones, we first must be regenerated, born again.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Peter 1:3 says that we have been regenerated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates we have been identified with Christ, just as the eight persons in Noah s family were identified with the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because they were in the ark, they were one with the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Wherever the ark was, they were, and whatever the ark experienced, they experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The ark s history was their biography; the ark s life was their life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For us to be regenerated through the resurrection of Christ means that we are identified with Christ we were put into Christ and are one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 23 tells us that we have been regenerated with an incorruptible seed, which is the living and abiding word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word of God is the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In regeneration the divine word of life comes into us as a seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We now have this seed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are each like a plot of soil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Soil can never produce a carnation flower if it does not have a carnation seed sown into it; it can be only a plot of soil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It can never be living, full of life, and full of beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No amount of teaching concerning what a proper plant should look like can ever cause a plot of soil to produce a plant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many teachers, such as Confucius, have taught man for centuries how to be proper and virtuous, but this teaching has not worked.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nothing of life or beauty has come forth from all this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jesus came not to teach but to sow Himself as the seed of life into man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Matthew 13 clearly reveals that the Lord Jesus came as a sower to sow the seeds of life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3-8, 37 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These seeds are the word of God, the Lord being in this word as life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>19-23; Luke 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Peter was not naturally a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It might have been that when he was young, he was a naughty boy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nevertheless, when Peter came to the Lord, without Peter s knowing it, the Lord sowed Himself into Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then when the Lord resurrected, the seed within Peter germinated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After the Lord s resurrection Peter became another person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was no longer a naughty boy but a great apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, he was able to stand on the day of Pentecost to subdue thousands.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The old Peter could not have done that.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, the seed that had been sown into him three years earlier was in blossom on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all have such a glorious seed within us that is growing and will blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In some it has begun to blossom already.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By Drinking the Milk of the Word</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to become precious stones for God s building, we also must drink the milk of the word so that we will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First Peter 2:2 says, As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Regardless of our age, we all need to be like newborn babes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Newborn babes do not know how to do anything other than to drink milk.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Day and night they are drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As newborn babes, we should all have an appetite to drink the milk of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is by drinking milk that newborn babes are able to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Likewise, we must drink the milk of the word in order that by it we may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should come to the Bible not mainly for teachings but mainly to drink the milk, to take in the nourishment, that we may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The growth of a human being never comes from teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Growth comes from only one thing, that is, nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Mothers know that in order for their children to grow, the children do not primarily need teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If children are given only teaching, they will become thin and unhealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, if children are fed with much nourishing food, they will be happy and will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the local churches in the Lord s recovery everyone has a pleasant, happy, and bright face.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Several visitors have asked me, What happened to these people?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some have said to me, When I went into one of your meetings, everyone was glowing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Did they all win valuable prizes?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There are no material prizes for the saints to win, but every morning they receive the prize of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They receive Christ as their nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Others have asked me, Brother Lee, you are an old man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why are you so happy every day?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You are like a young man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At times I have replied, Please do not call me an old man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I am not old; I am young because of the nourishment I receive from the Word day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have been drinking the milk from the fountain of the Word for over fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By now I am very familiar with this fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many times even when I am not looking at the physical Bible, I am still drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After I speak a message, my wife is often surprised and says to me, I did not see you open the Bible once this week.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Where did such a wonderful message come from?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I answer, I open the Bible within me a hundred times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Others do not see this, but the Lord as the Spirit with my spirit sees it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When I am drinking from the inner fountain, the Lord Jesus is always happy, and I am therefore happy as well.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The milk we drink makes us grow.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Eventually, by this growth we become different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>By the growth of a carnation seed, a blossoming carnation flower is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Outwardly, I am a Chinese man, but within me something is blossoming; something is living.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we see one another, we should not look at the earthen vessel but at the blossoming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Moreover, this growth issues in building.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The more we drink the milk of the word, the more we will desire to contact the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Today I find that without the dear brothers, I simply cannot live.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The more we grow, the more we desire to be one with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is building.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The building of the church is not carried out by organization or by a disorderly piling up ; it is entirely a matter of organic growth.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The members of our physical body were not systematically organized, nor were they merely put together without any particular order.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Rather, they have grown together organically.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is for this reason that our body cannot be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Likewise, the proper church life in the Lord s recovery is not something organized or piled up but something that grows up.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is absolutely different from Christianity or any kind of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is the growth of Christ corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Lord desires that the church be built up not by teaching but by the nourishment of the milk and the solid food in the word 1 Cor 3:2; Heb 5:12-14 .</S>
