<p>Zechariah 14:5b says, &ldquo;The Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with thee.&rdquo; This is a prophecy of Christ&rsquo;s coming with His saints. Some Bible teachers interpret the saints in this verse as being the angels, as holy ones. Actually, the saints in Zechariah 14:5 denote the Old Testament saints and New Testament saints who will come back with Christ as the Son of Man.</p>
<p>The fulfillment of the prophecy in Zechariah 14:5 is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:14: &ldquo;If we believe that Jesus died and rose, so also those who are asleep will God, through Jesus, bring together with Him.&rdquo; Another verse, 1 Thessalonians 3:13, speaks of &ldquo;the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.&rdquo; These saints are the believers in Christ, including the Old Testament saints (Dan. 7:18, 21-22, 25, 27).</p>
<h2 class="head3">d. With the Kingdom He Received of the Father</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will come with the kingdom He received of the Father. In Daniel 7:14 we have the prophecy concerning this: &ldquo;There was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.&rdquo; This prophecy is fulfilled in Luke 19:12 and 15a. In verse 12 the Lord, in a parable, says, &ldquo;A certain man of noble birth went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.&rdquo; Verse 15a says that &ldquo;he came back, having received the kingdom.&rdquo; The certain man of noble birth signifies the Savior with the highest status, the status of the God-man. The word &ldquo;went&rdquo; signifies the Savior&rsquo;s going to heaven after His death and resurrection (Luke 24:51; 1 Pet. 3:22), and &ldquo;return&rdquo; signifies the Savior&rsquo;s coming back with the kingdom (Rev. 11:15; 2 Tim. 4:1). The kingdom which the Lord will bring with Him at His second coming is the eternal kingdom that God will set up on earth (Dan. 2:44) and which is received from the Ancient of Days and belongs to the Ancient of Days, that is, to God. The kingdom which Christ will establish on earth will be the kingdom of God, the kingdom that is from ancient times, even from eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">61. The Coming Messiah<br />
Seen by Those Who Pierced Him<br />
and Wailed Over by All the Tribes of Israel</h2>
<p>In Zechariah 12:10-14 we have a prophecy of Christ as the coming Messiah seen by those who pierced Him and wailed over by all the tribes of Israel. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.&rdquo; According to this prophecy, the Lord Jesus will pour out His Spirit upon the Jewish people. Then all of the house of Judah will repent and mourn, weeping because of their rebellion against Christ. They will realize that He was the One whom they crucified and pierced on the cross. They will repent and receive Him as their Savior.</p>
<p>As the fulfillment of Zechariah 12:10-14, Revelation 1:7 says, &ldquo;Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him, those also who pierced Him, and all the tribes of the land shall wail over Him.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;land&rdquo; in this verse refers to the Holy Land. All the tribes of the Holy Land will see Christ in the open aspect of His coming back. Revelation 1:7 surely is a reference to Zechariah 12:10-14. The &ldquo;tribes&rdquo; mentioned in Revelation 1:7 are the tribes of those who pierced the Lord Jesus. According to the context of Zechariah 12, the tribes are not all the nations of the earth but the twelve tribes in the Holy Land. Based upon this, we may say that the tribes in Revelation 1:7 are the twelve tribes in the Holy Land. When Christ appears with power and glory to be seen by all in the Holy Land, the twelve tribes will behold Him and weep. In repentance the Jews will wail over Him, the One whom they pierced.</p>
<h2 class="head2">62. The One Coming in the Name<br />
of Jehovah and Blessed by Repentant Israel</h2>
<p>In the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies Christ is the One coming in the name of Jehovah and blessed by repentant Israel. This is prophesied in Psalm 118:26: &ldquo;Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord: we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord.&rdquo; The One coming in the name of the Lord is Christ as the coming Messiah. This verse will have a double fulfillment: at the Lord&rsquo;s first coming and at His coming back. Our emphasis here is on the second fulfillment. This prophecy was first fulfilled when Christ entered the gates of Jerusalem and the people laid their garments before Him and shouted, &ldquo;Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord&rdquo; (Matt. 21:9). But following that, in Matthew 22, the Jewish people rejected Him. Then the Lord said to them, &ldquo;You shall by no means see Me henceforth until you say, Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord&rdquo; (Matt. 23:39). This will be at the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, when the remnant of Israel will turn to believe in Him and be saved (Rom. 11:23, 26). Israel will not see Him again until His second coming. According to Zechariah 12, the remnant of Israel will repent when Christ comes back. Then they will say to Him, &ldquo;Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearly two thousand years have passed, and Israel still has not seen the Lord Jesus. Although He has left the nation of Israel, individual Jews may still come to Him and be saved. When the Jews are persecuted by their enemies at the end of this age, they will cry out to their God. Then Christ will descend and place His feet on the Mount of Olives, which will be cleft like the waters of the Red Sea. This will enable the Jews to escape from persecution. At that time they will repent to the Lord and call upon Him, and the nation will be saved. This salvation will be not only for individuals but for the entire nation.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
