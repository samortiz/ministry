<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>Rev. 21:14, 18-19 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb....And the...wall was jasper....The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation was jasper...</strong></p>
<p><strong>22:1-2 And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month...</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3">Its Wall with Its Foundations</h2>
<p>We see the twelve names of the twelve apostles on the twelve foundations of the city.<sup>306</sup> The apostles here represent the grace of the New Testament, signifying that the New Jerusalem is built upon the grace of God. While entrance into the holy city is according to the law of God, the city is built upon the grace of God. <em>Apostles</em> here implies that the New Jerusalem is composed not only of the Old Testament saints, represented by Israel, but also of the New Testament saints, represented by the apostles.<sup>307</sup> Peter, the first of the twelve apostles, was originally named Simon. When Simon was brought to the Lord, the Lord changed his name to Peter, meaning <em>a stone</em> (John 1:42). Later, the Lord called him by that name when He spoke concerning the building of His church (Matt. 16:18). Precious stones are not created but are produced by the transforming of things created. All the apostles were created as clay, but they were regenerated and were transformed into precious stones for God&rsquo;s eternal building. Every believer needs to be thus regenerated and transformed that he may be a part of the New Jerusalem.<sup>308</sup></p>
<p>The first layer of the wall&rsquo;s foundation, as well as the entire wall of New Jerusalem, is built with jasper [Rev. 21:18-19].<sup>309</sup> Thus, the appearance of the wall is the appearance of jasper. This is also the appearance of God, for in Revelation 4:3 we are told that the very God sitting on the throne looks like a jasper stone.<sup>310</sup> According to 21:11, the jasper is &ldquo;a most precious stone...as clear as crystal.&rdquo; Its color must be dark green, which signifies life in its richness. Jasper [in 4:3], as indicated in 21:11, signifies God&rsquo;s communicable glory in His rich life (John 17:22, 2).<sup>311</sup> This is very meaningful. The jasper God within the city is expressed by the jasper wall. Hence, the two are one. This indicates that the New Jerusalem is the expression of God.<sup>312</sup></p>
<h2 class="head2">The New Jerusalem&mdash;Its Furnishings</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Throne</h2>
<p>The first item of the furnishings of the New Jerusalem is the throne of God and the Lamb as its center. This throne is joined to the street, on which flows the river of life with the tree of life as the supply.<sup>313</sup> That the one tree of life grows on the two sides of the river [Rev. 22:2] signifies that the tree of life is a vine that spreads and proceeds along the flow of the water of life for God&rsquo;s people to receive and enjoy....Christ as the tree of life [John 1:4; 14:6; 15:1, 5] is the life supply available along the flow of the Spirit as the water of life. Where the Spirit flows, there the life supply of Christ is found. This is all in and with the divine nature as our holy way, signified by the street.<sup>314</sup> With the street we have the communication for administration, and with the river we have the water of life and the fruit of the tree of life for supply. The water of life is for drinking, and the fruit of the tree of life is for eating. This is a matter of provision. For administration this throne is the throne of authority, and for provision this throne is the throne of grace. Hebrews 4:16 tells us that we may come to the throne of grace to &ldquo;receive mercy and find grace for timely help.&rdquo; If there were not such a throne, then in the New Jerusalem there would be no administration, no communication, no food, and no water. Thus, there is the need of the throne as the first item of the furnishings.<sup>315</sup></p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> </body></html>
