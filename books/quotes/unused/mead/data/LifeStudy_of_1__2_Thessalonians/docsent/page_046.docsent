   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE REWARD OF FOSTERING Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 2:13-20</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter one we have the structure and origin of a holy life for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In chapter two we have the fostering of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When reading chapter two, we may have the feeling that Paul places too much emphasis on the apostles' entrance among the Thessalonians and the way they lived among them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may think that Paul should have given the new believers more doctrine, teaching, and instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead, Paul emphasizes the apostles' coming, their preaching and teaching of the Word, and how the new believers accepted this word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul's emphasis is on the apostles' conduct, on their living and manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The reason for this emphasis is that Paul wanted to nourish the believers, to cherish and foster them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was not Paul's intention to give them a lot of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He did not have the burden to teach them so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the twenty verses of chapter two there is actually very little teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 12 he does say that God has called the believers into His kingdom and glory; however, he does not develop these matters or explain them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, in verse after verse, Paul mentions his manner of life, his way of preaching, and his being a pattern to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE WORK OF FOSTERING</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What we have in chapter two of 1 Thessalonians is the fostering of the young Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this chapter Paul is nourishing and cherishing the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to his writing, he behaves himself as a nursing mother and an exhorting father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, he is a mother cherishing; on the other hand, he is a father exhorting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His main concern is not teaching, but the carrying out of a fostering work to help the young saints to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Most Christian workers lack the concept that their work should not mainly be a work of teaching, but should be a work of fostering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul's concept concerning his work was one of helping believers to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this reason, in 1 Corinthians 3 he says that he planted and Apollos watered, and then God gave the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that Paul's concept of Christian work is that it is a work of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not work in a school: on the contrary, it is work on a farm, in an orchard, in a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, it is not mainly a work of teaching others or educating them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But today the work of most Christians is mainly for education and somewhat for edification.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This edification, however, is not directly related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, it is related to ethics, morality, or the improvement of character.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But with Paul the concept of Christian work was altogether different.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to what he says in chapter two, Paul regards the believers as members of a large family.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Of course, in a family there is the need for some amount of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Both a mother and a father teach their children.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, in a family the focus is not on teaching the children, but is on raising them by cherishing, nourishing, and fostering them so that they may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Their growth is not mainly in knowledge: it is primarily a growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As children grow in life, they spontaneously receive more education.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The knowledge they acquire always goes along with their growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They should not be given knowledge prematurely.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that their knowledge should not exceed their growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the proper concept of Christian work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Concerning this matter, we in the Lord's recovery must have a change in our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not think that in the recovery we regard work higher than life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No, we need to concentrate on life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church is a family.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church may also be compared to a farm or a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A family is a place where children grow up, and an orchard is a place where trees grow and produce fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul's concern in chapter two is with the growth of his children.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is fostering the young believers so that they may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may also say that he is watering, nourishing, and cherishing the tender young plants so that they may grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the reason that instead of giving the believers a great deal of teaching, he presents them a pattern of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This pattern of a proper living is actually Paul himself.</S>
