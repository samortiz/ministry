   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"The star which they saw" was the same star they saw the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we want to know the certainty of God's leading, we need a second revelation of the star after its first revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a principle: the second appearing of the star is a confirmation that its first appearing is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God said to Abraham, "Unto a land that I will show thee" Gen 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we took the first step, yet we do not have "I will show thee" as the second step, we were probably wrong in our first step.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The revelation after a revelation is a confirmation that we are on the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a principle: always verify a revelation with a follow-up revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 10:"And when they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In contrast, when the people in Jerusalem heard the news, they were troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our attitude toward the Savior is an indication of the degree of our spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One characteristic of the Lord is that He requires man to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A Christian should not only believe in the Lord but also love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If one who believes in the Lord is not affected by the Lord in his inward emotions and feelings, he is not worthy to be called a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 11:"They...saw the child."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here it does not say "a baby."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that a period of time had passed since the event mentioned in verse 9.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The magi's traveling required some time because transportation was not convenient then.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Herod had inquired previously concerning the time that the star appeared, but eventually those whom he killed were children who were two years old and under.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, this verse mentions "the house," not a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>House is a particular word used in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the first time it is used.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It might have been a house rented by Joseph; perhaps at that time they lived alternately between Nazareth and Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These things may prove that the time when the magi came to see the Lord was not when the Lord was newly born.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That the magi from the east came to see the Lord shows that the Lord is King.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Moreover, they went into the house to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Gospel of Mark writes concerning the Lord as a slave; therefore, it does not give a record of His birth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Gospel of Luke portrays the Lord as a man; therefore, it gives an account of His birth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It also tells us that those who came to see Him were shepherds, common people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was born in a manger, but He was not the son of a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Gospel of John unveils the Lord as God; therefore, instead of mentioning His birth, it only says, "The Word became flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Gold signifies the divine nature, frankincense denotes delight, and myrrh is used for the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Isaiah 60 mentions only gold and frankincense, not myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because Isaiah is a book on the Lord as the King in the millennium, it mentions only gold and frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here the magi presented myrrh, signifying that the coming of the Lord this time was for Him to go through death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Fittingly, the gold provided the travel expenses for Joseph to flee from Herod.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How wonderful is God's doing!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 12:"And because they had been divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed by another way to their country."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One who has seen the Lord cannot return to Herod.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 13:"Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying, Arise, take the child and His mother and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is going to seek the child to destroy Him."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"Until I tell you" indicates that God's leading is step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 15: "And was there until the death of Herod, in order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, Out of Egypt I called My Son.'"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of performing a miracle for His Son, God told Him to flee.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From the time of His birth, the Lord had to flee.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He did not resist.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His word to Christians who are to suffer persecution is: "When they persecute you in this city, flee into another" Matt 10:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"Out of Egypt I called My Son."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a word spoken by God to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the children of Israel were no longer able to bear it, they fled.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Isaiah 49:3 shows us that the Lord and Israel are one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It seems that the Lord was the last Israelite; He included the Israelites in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Israel was exceedingly wicked; therefore, the Lord had to go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verses 16-18:This portion is quoted from Jeremiah 31:15.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rachel was buried in Bethlehem, which means "house of bread."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"Rachel weeping for her children" is a modifying clause.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because Herod had killed so many children of Bethlehem, it seemed to cause Rachel to come out of the grave to weep for her children.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Ramah was about two hundred yards away from Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 19:"And when Herod had died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Man is nothing; once he dies, everything of him comes to an end. Herod had caused others to die, but now he himself died.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God did not perform a miracle so that His Son might remain; rather, He called His Son out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verse 20:"Saying, Arise, take the child and His mother and go into the land of Israel, for those who seek the life of the child have died."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>"Go into the land of Israel" indicates that the Lord still had to be an Israelite.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Verse 22:"But because he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there; and having been divinely instructed in a dream, he departed into the regions of Galilee."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need not only the Lord's leading but also common sense.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God only commanded Joseph to go into the land of Israel; He did not tell him where to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At that time, if he had gone back to Jerusalem, he would have had trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, because he had this common sense, while he hesitated, he was led by God and departed into Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The land of Galilee was a large region.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Matthew 4:15 reads "Galilee of the Gentiles," indicating that Galilee was a place with a mixed population of Gentiles and Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The first three Gospels contain mainly records of what the Lord spoke in the land of Judea, whereas the last Gospel contains mainly records of what the Lord spoke in the land of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Verse 23:"And he came and settled in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, He shall be called a Nazarene."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the Bible, no prophet ever prophesied that the Lord would be called a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Nothing good can be from Nazareth John 1:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, to call the Lord a Nazarene is to despise Him and consider Him low.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The prophecies of the prophets concerning the Lord implied that He is lowly and low Isa 53:2-3; Psa 22:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Chapters one and two include five quotations from the Old Testament, with three kinds of fulfillment: 1 2:6 and 2:15 would be fulfilled they were of the same situation; 2 2:17-18 was fulfilled literally; and 3 1:23 and 2:23 should be fulfilled a fulfillment in teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In chapter two, concerning God's leading, there is the need of 1 Bible knowledge, 2 heavenly revelation, 3 man's common sense, and 4 faith, waiting, and obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>These two chapters mention three characters:</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>First, Joseph having great faith.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>1 For a virgin to be with child is against the natural law, yet he believed 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>2 Even though he needed to flee with Jesus, the Son of God, he still believed 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>3 He obeyed God's command and returned to the land of Israel 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Second, Herod 1 He was troubled because of Christ's birth 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>2 He envied the Lord 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>3 He sought to destroy Jesus 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This shows how Satan transfigures himself into an angel of light.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Third, the magi 1 They had the knowledge of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>2 They had a seeking and waiting attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>3 They had the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>4 They had the expression of honoring the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>5 They did not take the same way back.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The conclusion: God's ways are higher than man's ways Isa 55:9 .</S>
