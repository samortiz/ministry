   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Only the Tree of Life Being Living</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We often become convicted in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who serve the Lord want to serve Him more.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is a good and right thing to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our service to the Lord often demands that we suffer, sacrifice ourselves, and expend our energy and our money.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the strange thing is that when we do these things, we often do not touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead, we touch death, we become weakened, and we feel that something is wrong inside.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Something within us tells us that we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why are we wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While we are serving the Lord, while we are working and planning to do this and that for the Lord, we become weakened, and something within strongly rebukes us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many times, the rebuke we suffer through sin is not as severe as the rebuke we suffer through doing many good things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many people think that the Lord within only rebukes them when they sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But no!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord often rebukes us while we are doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The proper principle in God's eyes is not the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, but the principle of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Being able to differentiate between good and evil is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everything hinges on life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All those who eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil will surely die the day they eat it; only the tree of life is living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Two Kinds of Christian Life</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Among God's children, there are two kinds of Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One kind is filled with things, and the other kind is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Outwardly, both kinds look equally good.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One cannot detect much of a difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One talks about humility; the other also talks about humility.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One talks about meekness, and the other also talks about meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One talks about love, and the other also talks about love.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One talks about forgiveness, and the other also talks about forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Outwardly, both are more or less the same.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They appear to be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But with one, we just have a list of things, while with the other, we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In reality, the two are entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With Christ, There Being the Need of the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I would like to point out that when we have things, we do not need the cross anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With Christ, there is the need of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The cross restricts us not only from sin, but from our own activity as well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The cross not only tells us that we should not sin, but forbids us from our own activities.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The problem with God's children is that they think everything is fine as long as they do something well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They have not seen that the good things are only things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God cares for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ is the very good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If He does not move, we cannot move.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is easy for us to say many comforting words to others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if He has not said them, we should not, because once we do, we will touch death; we will be inwardly weakened and deflated, and we will collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can help others in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can be very gentle, and others may consider us nice men.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when we act this way, something within us collapses, and we become weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here we see the need of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The many things we gain through good works do not require the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order for us to allow the Lord to live in us to be our everything and become our things, we need the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When He does not move, we cannot move.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to ask the Lord to deliver us from good and righteous acts as much as we ask Him to deliver us from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is easy for us to ask God to deliver us from sins, because we have condemned sins already.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But it is not easy to be delivered from the natural life, because many of us have not condemned the natural life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have not seen the natural life, and we have not rejected it.</S>
