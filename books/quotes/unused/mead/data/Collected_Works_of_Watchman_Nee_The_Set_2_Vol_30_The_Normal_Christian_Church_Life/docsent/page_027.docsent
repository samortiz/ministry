   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HIGHEST COURT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since there is a spiritual relatedness between the various local churches, no one church may strike out on an individualistic line, and taking advantage of its independence, decide things after its own good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Each must rather cultivate a relationship with the other churches, seeking their sympathy and working with their spiritual good in view.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the other hand, since each is totally independent of the other, the decision of a church in any locality is absolutely final.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no higher court of appeal; the local court is the supreme court.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is no organization to whose control it must submit, nor is there any organization over which it exercises control.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It has neither superiors nor subordinates.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If any one is received or refused by a local church, its judgment in the matter must be regarded as absolutely decisive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even should the decision be wrong, all that can be done is to appeal for a reconsideration of the case.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The local church is the highest church authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If other churches object to its decisions, all they can do is resort to persuasion and exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no alternative course, because the relationship which exists between the churches is purely spiritual, not official.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a brother who has been disciplined in Nanking moves to Soochow, and there proves himself to be innocent of the charge brought against him, then Soochow has full authority to receive him, despite the judgment of Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Soochow is responsible for its actions to God, not to Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Soochow is an independent church, and has therefore full authority to act as it thinks best.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But because there is a spiritual relationship with Nanking, it is well for the brother in question not to be received before Nanking's mistake in judgment is pointed out to Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If Nanking's relationship with the Lord is right, then it will pay attention to what Soochow has to say.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if it refuses to do so, Soochow cannot press anything against Nanking, because Nanking as a local church is directly responsible to the Lord alone, and has full authority to decide and act independently of Soochow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the churches are spiritual, there will be no difficulty in their relationship one with the other.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if they are not, and difficulties should arise, we must not seek to solve them by interfering in any way with their independence, for it is ordained by an all-wise God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The organization of no one church is superior to another, nor is its authority greater.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many Christians regard Jerusalem as the mother-church, possessing supreme authority, but such a conception has its source in the human mind, not in the divine Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every church is locally governed and is directly responsible to God, not to any other church or organization.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A local church is the highest Christian institution on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is none above it to whom appeal can be made.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A local church is the lowest scriptural unit, but it is also the highest scriptural organization.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Scripture warrants no centralization in Rome which could give Rome authority over other local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is God's safeguard against any infringement of the rights of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is the Head of the Church, and there is no other head in heaven or on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There must be a spiritual relatedness among the churches if the testimony of the Body is to be preserved, but there must at the same time be an absolute independence of government if the testimony of the Head is to be maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Each church is under the immediate control of Christ, and is directly responsible to Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then why, when a question arose concerning circumcision, did Paul and Barnabas go to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders there?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because those who were responsible for the erroneous teaching in Antioch had come from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jerusalem was the place where this problem originated; therefore, it was to Jerusalem the apostles went to have it settled.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a boy were caught in mischief, we would report his misdeeds to his father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In going to Jerusalem Paul and Barnabas were bringing the case to those who had control of the brethren who had created trouble, and once they brought the matter to the responsible source, a speedy settlement was effected.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The elders in question were not the elders in Jerusalem, but the elders of Jerusalem; and the apostles were not the apostles of Jerusalem, but the apostles in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The former were the representatives of the church; the latter, the representatives of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul and Barnabas referred the matter to the apostles and elders, because the apostles had been responsible for teaching in the churches, and the elders for any decision made regarding local matters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the apostles and elders both repudiated responsibility concerning the teaching propagated by these troublesome brethren from Jerusalem, Paul and Barnabas on their later visits to different places were able to show to the churches there "the decrees to keep which had been decided upon by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem" Acts 16:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must not infer from this that the elders of Jerusalem had any authority over other churches, but merely that they, as well as the apostles, repudiated the teaching of those who had gone out from them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Besides, in Jerusalem some of the apostles occupied the double office of elder and apostle.</S>
