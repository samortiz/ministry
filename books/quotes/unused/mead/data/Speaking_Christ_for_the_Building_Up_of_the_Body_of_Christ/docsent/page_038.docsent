   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have to reach your destination.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not go to someone s home to have a legal, formal meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Go there to spend one hour in an informal way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Talk to the new ones in a conversational way and let them say something.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As you are meeting with them, one of them may remark that his shoes are too old and that he needs a new pair.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Overcome this deviation in a pleasant way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may say something about their need for a new pair of shoes and then bring the meeting back to the Bible.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you have a prearranged program, you will have a legalistic attitude to stop any distraction that comes in.

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should always endeavor to share some spiritual reality in life or in truth to swallow up the emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The meeting may have been going on for close to one hour, yet you should still grasp the last ten minutes to minister some reality either in truth or in life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the end of a meeting, you may raise up the word redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then you can speak a little bit about how the Lord died on the cross to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You can say that we needed redemption because we got lost.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We needed to be brought back to God, so the Lord Jesus shed His blood on the cross to take away our sin John 1:29 , to deliver us from the penalty of God s righteousness John 3:18; 5:24 , and to repossess us, accomplishing an eternal redemption for us Heb 9:12 .</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this short time you can impress them with the word redemption.</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to be brought into the full knowledge of the truth and we also need to bring the new ones into this full knowledge.</S>
