The first part consists of five books including the four Gospels and the Acts, which tell us the history of a universal man
The first four books reveal the Head of this universal man-Christ, while the last book in this group shows us His Body
The first five books of the New Testament give a portrait, or history, of the universal man but not much definition or explanation
The last section of the New Testament contains one book, Revelation, which reveals the ultimate consummation of this universal man
If we keep these four terms in mind-universal man, history, definition, and consummation-we have the entire New Testament
To understand the genealogy in the first chapter of Matthew requires an understanding of the entire Old Testament
As we have indicated, the first crucial point mentioned in the New Testament is that God Himself came to mingle Himself with man to be a man
Following the matter of incarnation, the first word proclaimed, announced, and declared in the New Testament is the kingdom
After John the Baptist announced the kingdom, Christ repeated the same thing , and He instructed His disciples to repeat it again
The reason we repent of our sins and receive God's gospel concerning Christ is that the kingdom has drawn near
Some may answer that it is the rule of the King, but this matter is hard to understand merely by our human mind
God's authority is for dealing with His enemy, and God's glory is the very manifestation and expression of God Himself
Man is the glory of God because he is the image of God; he was made in the image of God for God's expression, that is, for the glory of God
On the negative side, the kingdom is for subduing and ruling over God's enemy, while on the positive side, it is to glorify and express God
In Matthew 12:28 the Lord also said, 'But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you'
On the negative side, sin, sickness, demons, evil spirits, and Satan himself were all conquered, subdued, and defeated by Christ
When the Lord Jesus was incarnated as a man to live, walk, and work on this earth, He brought the divine authority and God's glory with Him
All God's enemies were subdued, conquered, defeated, and overcome, and God's full glory was expressed through Him
When Christ as the Head comes into us all the enemies of God within us are also subdued by Him and the full glory of God is expressed in us
The principle of the kingdom is of two aspects: divine authority to deal with the enemy of God and God's glory to express God Himself
As we have seen, the first principle of the New Testament is incarnation, God mingled with man and becoming a man
With the kingdom there is a demand, or requirement, which is much higher than the requirements of the Mosaic law
Regardless of how good we are, we are still not qualified to enter the kingdom because we need another birth; we must be born anew
Even if we were as good as Confucius or even better, we still would have no qualifications to enter into the kingdom
In order for us to enter God's kingdom, we must be born of God, that is, we must have the life of God, God Himself within us as life
Merely by our natural life, we can never fulfill the requirements of the kingdom; this is beyond all possibility
The gospel preached by John the Baptist, Christ, His disciples, and His apostles was full of glory and authority
It is a gospel of God Himself as our life within for us to subdue, conquer, and overcome all God's enemies and express God in His full glory
The four Gospels show us a full picture, not only of the incarnated God with His kingdom, but of man's fallen condition
Many pages in the four Gospels reveal the real condition of man as the third item, a negative item, of the New Testament
On the one hand, such a living conquers all the enemies of God, and on the other hand, it expresses God, manifesting Him in a full way
When we read the four Gospels, we should have a deep impression of the living of this Man, a living of the divine life through a human being
The sixth main item revealed in the New Testament is the impartation of God's life by the Lord's death and resurrection
By Christ's living of the divine life through the human nature, He conquered the enemies of God and expressed God in full glory
By His death and resurrection He imparted Himself into us as life in order to meet all our needs and fulfill the requirements of the kingdom
The first three Gospels show us what the kingdom requires, while the last Gospel tells us how life fulfills the requirements of the kingdom
The Lord's coming in incarnation brought God into man, and His going through death, resurrection, and ascension brought man into God
In incarnation Christ brought God into man on the earth; in His resurrection and ascension He brought man into God in the heavens
By His incarnation He brought His divine nature into man, and by His resurrection and ascension He brought the human nature into God
On the surface, it may seem that we understand them, but we will not understand them deeply if we do not have this insight
The general teaching in Christianity concerning the incarnation is that God's Son had to become a man in order to save man
In this way He can exercise and manifest His authority to rule over things and accomplish what is on His heart
The third main item revealed in the first section of the New Testament is the miserable condition of fallen man
The first two items above-the incarnation and the kingdom-are very important, but they are neglected by many Christians today
The third and fourth items, however, are not as important as the first two, but they are overemphasized by many today
Wherever we go, we may hear people speaking about the miserable condition of fallen man and the sufficiency of Christ to meet our need
The fifth, sixth, and seventh of the main items of the New Testament are especially deep and vitally important
In the entire history of the human race and of the universe itself there had never been a living which was the living out of the divine life
Our Christian living must be the living out of God Himself through man, a living by the divine life through the human life
We were instructed from the Scriptures to love our neighbors, to love one another, and to love even our enemies
The genuine Christian living is not a matter of loving or hating, or of being humble or proud; it is a matter of living out God
The living that the Lord Jesus had while He was on earth was the living of the divine life mingled with the human life
Although this wonderful Jesus had His human life, He did not live by that human life; rather, He lived by God as His life
The first few books of the New Testament reveal a wonderful, real man living on this earth not by His own life but by God as His life
The entire Gospel of Matthew shows us that with the living of Jesus there was the kingdom of God and the real submission to God
The kingdom of God was brought in to exercise God's authority because there was a person who was completely submissive to God's authority
In the Gospel of Mark we find a person who lives a life in absolute obedience to God to serve God's will and His purpose
Luke's Gospel presents the Lord Jesus as a proper, normal person who is wrong in no way with God, with Himself, and with others
The Lord's death and resurrection are a matter not only of Christ imparting Himself to us but also of His redemption
Redemption is not all; redemption is for imparting life, just as cleaning a cup is for the purpose of filling it
John 19:34 says, 'One of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water'
In the process, Christ needed to redeem us before He could fill us, but God's original goal is that man would be filled with His life
Following this, we declare to the universe that we, the fallen race, can be one with the Lord because of His redemption
Although we were sinful, dirty, and fallen, we are one with Him and one in Him because He has shed His blood for us
We must always keep in mind that in the Lord's death and resurrection there is redemption and the impartation of Christ
In John 19 redemption is signified first, but this is not the most important thing; it is part of the process as an additional matter
Similarly, without cleansing it is impossible for a cup to be filled up; the filling of a cup includes its cleansing
John 12:24 tells us that the one grain of wheat fell into the earth and died to produce many grains as the increase of Christ
After His resurrection, He told Mary to go to His brothers, who are the reproduction, the duplication, of Himself
He brought God into man to make God one with man, and He also brought man into God to make this man one with God
In the electricity, however, all the lamps are one with the generator, and the generator is one with the lamps
By Christ's incarnation God has been brought into man, and by His redemption and life-imparting, man has been brought into God
We must realize Christ's work to the extent that we are clear about these truths, which are mostly neglected by Christianity today
We cannot deal with many details, but by the grace of the Lord, we will see the main points and the main line of the New Testament
In the Old Testament are all the figures, shadows, and pictures which describe, portray, or predict God's eternal purpose
Before incarnation, God was God and man was man; the Creator was the Creator, the creature was the creature, and the two were not one
Incarnation, however, is a real landmark in time, dividing the dispensation of the Old Testament from that of the New Testament
The third great matter that the New Testament reveals is a universal man, a man so great as to fill the entire universe
The Head of this universal man is Christ, and the Body is the church composed of millions of believers as His members
The entire New Testament also reveals a couple composed of Christ as the Bridegroom and the church as the bride
At the close of the New Testament there is a marriage , and before the wedding there is a period of time for the preparation of the bride
Lastly the New Testament shows us the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of God's work in the universe
The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the church and of all God's work through all the generations
Pember's interpretations of prophecy reveal much about events but not much concerning the central thought of God
The central thought of prophecy is not the events mentioned in the prophecies; rather, it is Christ and the church
Pember's interpretation of prophecy mainly tells us what will happen to the nation of Israel, to the church, and to the Gentile world
The first prophecy concerning Christ in the Old Testament is the seed of the woman, which is found in Genesis 3:15
Among the entire human race, there is only one person of human blood and flesh whose birth had nothing to do with a man
The fulfillment of this prophetic word is in Galatians 3:16; it is also in Matthew 1:1, which says that Christ is the Son of Abraham
Isaiah 11:1 says, 'Then a sprout will come forth from the stump of Jesse,/And a branch from his roots will bear fruit'
The first verse in the New Testament Matthew 11 is very meaningful telling us that Christ is the son not only of Abraham but also of David
From this point of view, Christ is the branch coming out of the root, the descendant coming out of the forefather
These verses say, 'Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them, saying, What do you think concerning the Christ?
If we do not know this One, our mouth will be shut like the mouths of the Pharisees , and we will not be able to understand the Scriptures
The little child born in a manger in Bethlehem is called Mighty God, and the son who is given to us is called Eternal Father
The expression is one hundred percent in oneness with the source, as indicated by the fact that the Son is called the Father
The central thought of God, that He mingles Himself with man, is clearly seen in Isaiah 9:6 in that the expression is one with the source
Christ as the eternal root is God Himself as the Lord and Creator, yet here He is another root, a root in time, grown out of dry ground
According to Micah 5:2, Christ is eternal in the past, and according to Psalm 102, He is eternal in the future
In summary the church is the same to Christ as Eve was to Adam that is the church comes out of Christ to match Christ and be one with Christ
The church issues from Christ as life because all of the members of the church are born of Christ, who is the very source of the church
These three prophecies clearly show us that the church is a part of Christ, born of Christ to match Him, and one with Christ
Two central matters, Christ and the church, are the fulfillment of all the types and prophecies of the Old Testament
Isaiah 9:6 also tells us that a child is born, yet His name is called Mighty God, and a son is given, yet His name is called Eternal Father
In the matter of time, Christ came forth in time, yet His goings forth are from ancient times, from the days of eternity
All of these Old Testament prophecies give us a picture of God's intention to mingle Himself with the human race
The central insight into the prophecies is that God's intention is to come into man and mingle Himself with man
For this reason Ephesians 531 says A man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife and the two shall be one flesh
Originally Christ was the only begotten Son of God , but in resurrection He became the Firstborn among many brothers
If we read the New Testament again with the point of view of the kingdom, we will see the matters of authority and glory
In the four Gospels there are many stories and cases that reveal to us the miserable condition of fallen mankind
The book of Matthew shows us a life that brings in the reality of the kingdom and enables us to fulfill the requirements of this kingdom
Luke's Gospel reveals a life which is able to make us a genuine, proper, and normal man before God and among men
The four Gospels tell us that this wonderful life was imparted into man based upon the redemptive work of Christ
A wise playwright makes his drama interesting by means of a straight line through the story, along with many twists
He wants to mingle Himself with man, to make Himself one with man, so that He becomes man's life and content, and man becomes His expression
Christ came to the very place where man was, and through His redemption God brought man back to the tree of life
The redemption of Christ for the recovery of fallen man is the upward twist in the line of God's original intention
By Christ's redemption, the fallen and distracted man was redeemed, recovered, and brought back to the tree of life
Most Christians today neglect the tree of life and pay their full attention to the 'twists,' the aspect of redemption
It is wonderful and precious to speak of God's love for the fallen race and the shedding of Christ's blood on the cross to redeem us
Very few Christians today are clear about the straight line that is the eternal purpose of God and because of this they emphasize the twists
Christ's coming in incarnation brought God into man, and His going by death, resurrection, and ascension brought man into God
These four chapters give us a clear vision of the way in which the Lord brings us into the Father by His death, resurrection, and ascension
If we do not have the kind of insight revealed in these seven foregoing points, we can never be clear about the New Testament
If we are clear concerning these few matters, God's eternal purpose and the entire holy Word will be transparent to us
Of all, the Gospel of John is constructed in a certain historical sequence, especially with respect to eternity
Even after the last chapter, the record of this Gospel is not finished, for the history recorded in it has no end
The first section is composed mostly of the first twelve chapters and shows how Christ came through incarnation to bring God into man
The second part, chapters fourteen through twenty-one, unveils how Christ went through death and resurrection to bring man into God
The Lord unveiled the kingdom with its requirements, He exposed the real condition of the fallen race, and He manifested His all-sufficiency
The sea signifies a situation in which there is no peace and no satisfaction, in which people are hungry and troubled all the time
Now at the end of His coming He declared that He needed to go by death and resurrection for the purpose of multiplication
In this crucial chapter as the turning point of this book, the Lord did one main thing; that is, He washed the disciples' feet
Christ's going was not to bring us to heaven; it was to bring us into another, wonderful person, the divine person, God the Father Himself
Just as His coming was to bring God not merely to the earth but into man, so His going was to bring us not to heaven but into God
To those who were selling the doves He said, Take these things away from here; do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise'
Since My Father's house in chapter two refers to the temple, could the same term refer to heaven in chapter fourteen?
For two thousand years the work has been going on and still has not been finished; therefore, they say, how wonderful that mansion will be!
In Greek, the singular word abode in verse 23 is mone, the same word translated by some in the plural as mansions in verse 2
The King James Version translates 'I am coming again' as 'I will come again,' and some interpret this to refer to the Lord's second coming
The former indicates that while the Lord was speaking this word, He was already on the way; He was already coming
The disciples were then like a woman travailing in birth, and Christ was the child to be brought forth in His resurrection
Verse 22 continues, 'And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit'
We cannot understand in a full way how He came, but the fact is that after He resurrected, He came back to the disciples
We should not try to analyze it and understand it by our natural mentality; we should simply receive the word of John 20
In the form of flesh He could not enter into His disciples, so He had to be transformed, transfigured, into another form
After His death and resurrection, He could enter into His disciples in a mysterious way, a way which we cannot understand in full
If the disciples did not have this wonderful Spirit within them, how could the one hundred twenty pray for ten days together in one accord ?
They stayed together and prayed for ten days in one accord, and Peter could even understand the prophecies of the Psalms
The Gospel of John reveals that the Father is in the Son, coming to be among humanity, and the Son became the Spirit to enter into humanity
For this reason, the Gospel of John does not say that after Christ died and resurrected, He left the disciples
While the Lord was speaking this, they were not yet in the Father because Christ had not yet died and resurrected
In this way God becomes our abode, and we become God's abode, so in the following chapter there is the mutual abiding
By His coming in incarnation, Christ brought God into man, and by His going through death and resurrection He brought man into God
Now, in the Father's house, that is, in the temple of God, the church, each one of us not only has a place, but each one of us is a 'place'
The Lord needed to die and resurrect, and in so doing, He was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit, who is a wonderful person
On the one hand, John 14:10 tells us that the Lord is in the Father, while on the other hand, the Lord needed to go to the Father
When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, according to His divinity, His inward essence, He was already in the Father
He also had another part, another nature, which is His humanity, which had not yet been transfigured to be in the Father
Our intention in stressing this matter is not merely to adjust and correct the wrong teachings in Christianity
We must realize that it is not the Lord's intention to prepare a place for us in the heavens and then one day to bring us there
May we all be clear that this is the basic thought of this Gospel and the basic thought of the entire New Testament
The Acts should be included with the Gospels because these five books together give us a full picture of a universal man
In some versions of the Bible the book of Acts is simply called The Acts but in the King James Version it is called The Acts of the Apostles
Strictly speaking, however, this book records not merely the acts of the apostles but the acts of Christ by the Spirit in the church
The acts of the apostles and of all the believers, that is, of the church, are the acts of Christ in the church by the Holy Spirit
In brief, in the four Gospels, there is the printing plate, and in the Acts we find the duplication, the reproduction
Verses 3 and 4 say, 'And as he went, he drew near to Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him
In this way, Saul of Tarsus received the revelation that the Body of Christ, including all His members, is Christ Himself
When Paul recounted this incident in Acts 26, he added that the Lord said, 'It is hard for you to kick against the goads'
Verses 10-17 continue, 'And there was a certain disciple in Damascus named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias
If anyone puts on a police uniform and stands on the street, he can command the same respect; everyone will obey his orders
We may drink something and be filled within, but if we have no uniform, no one will respect us or listen to us
They were filled with Christ within, and they were clothed with Christ without; that is, they were clothed with the Spirit
The real meaning of the baptism in the Holy Spirit is that we are immersed in God and put God on as our clothing
We have it; we are filled within and clothed without, and in this way we are persons who are fully mingled with Him
Every day they lived and moved according to the living guidance of the Holy Spirit; that is, they lived by this living One
When that missionary looked into the table of contents, he asked, 'Do you have a category for songs about heaven'?
We should not care for the traditions, and we should not be affected by what people say about us, whether they criticize or appreciate us
We should forget lesser matters, such as speaking in tongues and healings and simply be filled with Christ and clothed with Christ
We must have a clear vision that we are Christ's members who are filled with Him within and clothed with Him without
We also must pass through the same kind of transition, not merely in the knowledge of these matters but even more in our experience
In the Acts, there are thousands of persons as His Body, the church, who live, walk, work, and act in the same life and by the same Spirit
Before His resurrection, Christ and we were separate, but by His resurrection Christ came into us to be our life and our very nature
For a grain of wheat to fall into the earth signifies death, and for it to grow up out of the earth signifies resurrection
Even though a person is living and healthy, he cannot go into the street and act as a policeman without the proper authorization
It imparts Christ Himself into us as our life and nature, but His resurrection is not sufficient to equip us, qualify us, and authorize us
Whereas resurrection is a matter of life, Christ's ascension is a matter of position, and position is a matter of authority
Resurrection is a matter of life while ascension is a matter of headship lordship kingship authority government enthronement and power
In the evening of the day of resurrection, the Lord came to the disciples in a very mysterious way; that is, He came to them as life
Ephesians 1:20-22 tells us that God raised Christ up and seated Him in the highest place as the Head over all things
Inwardly we have the Triune God Himself as our life, and outwardly we have the Triune God Himself as our authority
We have Him not only within as our life to live Him but without as our power and authority to act, to work, and to do things
Following this, He died a wonderful, all-inclusive death on the cross, and in resurrection man was brought into God
Now a man with all His accomplishments has been brought into the heavens, where He has been glorified and enthroned
The coming of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost was the 'inauguration ceremony' which brought the church into its office
Concerning this matter we must realize that when Christ was crucified on the cross, we were crucified with Him
Acts 1:5 says, 'For John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now'
Ephesians 2:15-16 tells us that Christ on the cross created a new man, which is His Body, out of two peoples-the Jews and the Gentiles
For this reason, the other cases of the outpouring of the Spirit, without exception, required only the laying on of hands
The way to experience it is to realize the right relationship with the Body, which is the principle behind the laying on of hands
On the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius the ascended Head directly baptized His Body in the Holy Spirit
We need the form of baptism in water, but the form does not accomplish anything in itself; its significance is its principle and reality
In the same way, the laying on of hands is a principle representing the reality of the right relationship with the Body
The most important matter is that we have a heavenly vision to see what the real significance is of the Lord's resurrection and ascension
If we are in the Body, with the Body, and for the Body, we are in the position to claim whatever is of the Body
They have the authority and the power, and they are qualified, equipped, and authorized to do something for the Head in the Body
The Greek preposition here is better translated into as in Romans 63 in which Paul tells us that we have been baptized into Christ Jesus
It is the death and resurrection of Christ implied by the water of baptism that saves us, not the water of baptism in itself
We must learn always not to live by ourselves, to reject ourselves, to deny ourselves, because within us is the living One, the Triune God
What we need is not mere teaching but the real knowledge of a living person, Christ, the Triune God, who lives in us today as our life
Since we are members of this Body, we can stand in the position of the Body, for the Body, and with the Body for whatever we need
Those that oppose us will find themselves in trouble, because we do things not by ourselves but by our 'uniform,' our authority
We may compare our bold speaking to that of a policeman; a policeman speaks with authority, and others must obey him
The book of Acts is the record of a group of people who are regenerated by the Triune God and inaugurated with authority by the Triune God
As we saw in the previous chapter, two important things transpired after the Lord's death-resurrection and ascension
Resurrection is the strongest proof that the Son of God is the divine life, a life which nothing can damage, hold, or overcome
The resurrection of Christ is not only a proof or testimony; it is also an imparting of Himself into His members
On the other hand, because we were identified with Him in His ascension, we also were brought into the heavens with Him
The Lord told His disciples to go and disciple all the nations because all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him
They were sent not to preach the gospel in a common way but to preach the gospel of the kingdom and make people Christ's disciples
How can the wonderful, objective facts accomplished by the resurrection and ascension of Christ be our experience?
On the one hand, the Holy Spirit comes into us as life, while on the other hand, the Spirit comes upon us as power, as authority
After His resurrection, on 'that day' , Christ came to His disciples to breathe Himself into them as the Holy Spirit
On the day of resurrection Christ came back to His disciples to breathe Himself into them as the Spirit of life
As we have illustrated before, although water becomes vapor, the water and the vapor are different only in form; in substance they are one
In the same way, Christ is the very Spirit of life which He breathed into the disciples on the day of resurrection
On the day of resurrection there was the breathing, but on the day of Pentecost there was the rushing of a violent wind
In the same principle, by the blowing of the wind on the day of Pentecost what He accomplished in His ascension was applied to the disciples
Just as we take water in, Christ dispensed Himself as the living water of life into His disciples on the day of resurrection
On the day of resurrection Christ put the 'water' into the disciples, while on the day of Pentecost He put the disciples into the 'water'
The Triune God was put into us as our life on the day of resurrection, and we were put into the Triune God on the day of Pentecost
The Triune God is power to us; because we have been put into Him, we have been put into His power and authority
In the same way, the heavenly position and enthronement which Christ obtained in His ascension was applied to us on the day of Pentecost
We must be clear that we were already appointed, inaugurated, and authorized on the day of Pentecost by the ascension of Christ
They walk act and work not by their own strength their own way or their own method but by Christ as their power their way and their method
Because Peter was very much influenced by the teachings of Judaism, God was forced to give him a vision from the heavens
There should have been no need for Peter to have that vision; it was only because he was deeply influenced by the teaching of Judaism
In the record of Acts, the disciples did not act or work according to the teaching of Judaism or according to the Old Testament
All that they did and worked was according to the living guidance of the Triune God who came down after His enthronement to dwell upon them
In the Holy Spirit within us we have the reality of resurrection, and with the Holy Spirit upon us we have the reality of ascension
As His enthronement is ours, we are those coming from the heavens to announce something of our King to His subjects
Not only in preaching the gospel, but in any kind of ministering we must stand in the position of Christ's authority
If we look into the Acts thoroughly, we will see a clear picture that all of those sent ones went out with the heavenly power and authority
It was when Peter and John came and laid hands on the Samaritan believers that the Holy Spirit on the Body was transmitted to them
The activities recorded in Acts were not only of the Body but also for the Body, that is, for the building up of the church
As we have seen, the Acts is a record of a group of people who act and work all the time for the Body and through the Body
There was much traffic on the Mediterranean Sea, and it was very easy for people to sail from Palestine to the west
Not only so, there was much intermingling of the people, and their language and even citizenship were brought together
Beginning from Jerusalem in Acts 2 there was only one flow on this earth, and all the early disciples moved, acted, and worked in the flow
Following this, there is no further record of Barnabas in the book of Acts, because he was no longer in the flow
The central meaning of the flow in the Acts is that there is a group of people who know the meaning of resurrection and ascension
They realize that they are the Body, and they always act in the Body and for the Body in the one divine stream
