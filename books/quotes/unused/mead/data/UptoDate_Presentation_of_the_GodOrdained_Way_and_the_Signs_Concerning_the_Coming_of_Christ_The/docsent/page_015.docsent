   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Chosen and Appointed by God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Bear Remaining Fruit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sixth, we have been chosen and appointed by God to bear remaining fruit John 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not difficult to bear fruit, but to bear remaining fruit requires effort.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the time of fruit bearing, a farmer must be busier than in ordinary times.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, he must prevent the birds from coming to eat the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In like manner, to bring forth children is easy, but to nurture them is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to my observation, the number of baptized ones among us is not small; there are many baptized ones everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, at the end of the year, when we take a count, not many remain.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The reason is that after people are baptized, there is a lack of care and there is not much nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason, after people are saved, we need to spend time to nourish them and to care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do this, after half a year or a year, they will be solidly in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Living of the Priests of the Gospel of God Being Revived Every Morning</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order that we may be the New Testament priests of the gospel, we must have a living that matches our priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be a certain kind of people, we must have a certain kind of living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To be the priests of the gospel, we must have the living of the priests of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, we need to be revived every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Psalm 119:147 says, "I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Morning is the beginning of a day; in the morning everything is fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we desire to enjoy the Lord's fresh supply, like the psalmist, we need to rise early to call on the Lord and to look to His word to eat, drink, and enjoy Him through His word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You do not need to spend too much time or read too many verses; two or three verses a day are sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the same time, do not skip in your reading.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, read book by book.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The best way is to start with the books that are easy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Books such as the Gospel of John, Romans, Galatians, and Philippians are very good material for morning revival.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Read two or three verses every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then, on Saturday go back to review the verses for the previous five days, and try to put your impressions and feelings together and arrange them so that they become the contents of your prophesying in the Lord's Day meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Overcoming Every Day</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the priests of the gospel of God, we need not only to be revived every morning but also to overcome every day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Romans 8:37 says, "But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although Paul encountered many problems in his experience, he could always give thanks to God because he had found the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In his living he adopted an overcoming attitude with an overcoming standing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We also should be like this in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Regardless of what happens, we should have an overcoming faith, take an overcoming attitude, and stand on the position of the Lord's victory to boast to our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Being Filled with the Spirit Every Moment</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>and Speaking Christ Everywhere</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be revived every morning and to overcome every day has become our motto in all the churches around the globe today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As priests of the gospel, we must have this kind of living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only so, we need to be filled with the Spirit every moment Eph 5:18b and to speak Christ everywhere 2 Tim 4:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This truly is the most beautiful and best living in the world.</S>
