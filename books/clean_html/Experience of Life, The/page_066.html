<p>The strange thing is that today’s Christians are occupied with many things that are not mentioned in the Bible. Conversely, many things that are mentioned in the Bible are unknown to them. Such is the case of many in knowing the will of God. The Bible never tells us to pay continuous attention to sickness, occupation, traveling, and other matters pertaining to our living, and to study the will of God concerning them. However, most Christians are fully occupied with these matters. Every time the will of God is mentioned in the Bible, it touches God’s heart desire, God’s plan, God’s work on this earth, the church of God, the Body of Christ, etc., all of which are matters of great importance and eternal value. Among God’s children, we have seldom seen or heard these things mentioned.<p>For example, one brother may testify concerning some article of his possessions; it had been borrowed from him a long time ago and had not been returned. Therefore, he prayed to the Lord, and after a few days that article was returned. He was very glad and praised the Lord exceedingly. When we hear this kind of testimony, our heart groans. This type of person has seen neither heaven nor earth. He is completely enveloped in himself. All he sees is his little earthly benefits. When he seeks the will of God, he can never forget himself or be severed from his selfish interests of gain. This kind of person is not qualified to talk about the will of God.<p>If anyone wants to talk about the will of God, he must first come out of himself. Moreover, to come out of himself and understand the eternal and lofty will of God, he must study God’s creation carefully. Man must thoroughly study creation in order to become enlarged, withdraw from himself, touch a little upon God’s desire and plan in the universe, and understand the will of God. The more spiritual a person is, the more he will realize God in all things. The deeper he lives in the Lord, the more he will understand the will of God through creation.<p>God promised Abraham that he would become a great nation and that his descendants would be as the sand upon the seashore. But Abraham, still in himself, could not believe God’s word. He still thought that his steward, Eliezer of Damascus, would be his heir. Therefore, God led him out and said, “Look toward the heavens and number the stars” (Gen. 15:1-6). God then promised him that his descendants would be as great in multitude. When Abraham looked, he believed. Because he beheld God’s creation and realized the deeds of God, he found faith. At that moment God accepted him, and he was reckoned righteous in the eyes of God.<p>Take, as further illustration, the story of Job. Although Job was repeatedly stricken by the hand of God, he failed to realize God’s intention because he was completely in himself. His speeches were full of “I,” full of himself. Thus, in order to bring him out of himself, God brought him to His creation. From Job chapters 38 through 41, God questioned Job repeatedly regarding the created things in the universe. From this he finally came to see God’s greatness and transcendency and thus came out of himself, saying with repentance of heart, “Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge?” (Job 42:3). Originally, because he lived in himself, God’s will was obscured from him. Now since he withdrew from himself, he saw God with his own eyes and understood His will. Therefore, it was through God’s creation that Job was delivered from himself and touched the will of God.<p>Since the understanding of God’s will has much to do with our knowing of God’s creation, we need a scheduled plan to study God’s creation, as though we were attending school. We must spend time to expose ourselves to nature in order to comprehend God’s will. The study of both astronomy and geography would prove very helpful.
