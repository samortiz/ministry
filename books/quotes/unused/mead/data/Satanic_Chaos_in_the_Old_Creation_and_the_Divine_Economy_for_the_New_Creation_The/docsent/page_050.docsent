   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>D. In the Fullness of the Godhead</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ also has the preeminence in the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Colossians 1:19 says that "in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, the fullness in this verse is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is the center, Christ is the embodiment, Christ is the image, and Christ is the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, in every way, in every aspect, and in everything, Christ must have the first place, the preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the church life, everything must be for giving Him the preeminence, the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>PRODUCING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's economy takes Christ as its centrality and universality, makes Christ preeminent in all things, and also produces the church to be the Body of Christ, the house of God, and the kingdom of God, consummating in the holy city, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whatever we do in the God-ordained way is for Christ to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are here living a church life to take Christ as the center and to make Christ the preeminent One for the purpose of producing the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A. The Body of Christ 1.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Fullness of Him Who Fills All in All</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>to Be His Expression</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Body of Christ is the fullness of Christ as the One who fills all in all to be His expression Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is immeasurably full, vast, and great.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Ephesians 3:18 speaks of our apprehending the universal dimensions of Christ the breadth and length and height and depth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How broad, how long, how high, and how deep is the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The breadth, the length, the height, and the depth are the immeasurable dimensions of the universe, and these dimensions are the dimensions of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because Christ is so vast, He needs the Body of Christ as His fullness, His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to be those who live Christ and magnify Christ for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If Christ is not full in us, we cannot express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can illustrate this by the amount of water in a cup.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the cup is not full of water, no one can see the water.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, the water is hidden, concealed, not expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the cup is filled with water to the extent that it is overflowing, this overflow of water is the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the cup is overflowing with water, everyone sees the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nobody knows that we have Christ in us, so we need to be overflowing with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We overflow with Christ by speaking Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we overflow, Christ flows.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This overflow is Christ's expression, and this expression is the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible does not tell us to come to the meetings to be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the practice of degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The architecture of the cathedrals and many denominational meeting places, with their stained-glass windows which do not let in much light and their high ceilings, promotes people's silence.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our meeting places are not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our meetings should not be full of silence but full of the divine speaking for the exhibition of Christ, the expression of Christ.</S>
