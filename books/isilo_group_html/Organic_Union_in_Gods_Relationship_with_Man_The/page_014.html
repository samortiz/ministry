In this organic union God and man are one person, signified by the true vine in John 15:1. In the organic union the vine and the branches coinhere; the vine abides in the branches and the branches abide in the vine (v. 5). The first, the vine, lives in the second, the branches (Gal. 2:20a), and the second lives in the first to manifest Him (Phil. 1:20-21a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ORGANIC UNION IN INCARNATION</H2><P>We may think that the incarnation lasted for only nine months. However, the incarnation of God for Him to enter into man has been going on for two thousand years, from the first century to the twentieth century. One afternoon in April 1925, at the age of nineteen, I heard the wonderful gospel. As a result, I opened myself and received God into me. I became a different person. At that juncture God was incarnated into me. Although at times I even tried to deny that God was in me, I cannot deny that from the hour of my conversion God has been in me.</P><P>God is still going to be incarnated into many thousands of people. How fast could this take place? It depends on us. If we would go and disciple the nations quickly, God would be incarnated in a fast way. God's incarnation is just to carry out God's desire with His good pleasure to be one with man in the organic union. Through God's incarnation man is in an organic union with the organic God.</P><P>God created man, and then He came to be a man in incarnation. After passing through the processes of human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension, He as the life-giving Spirit, who is the consummated, compound Spirit, entered into us. This is the completion of His incarnation. Now we are here in a completed union with God organically.</P><P>This is God's creation, this is God's incarnation, and this is our conversion. He created us six thousand years ago, He became us two thousand years ago, and He entered into us to be us today. Thus, we are a part of Him. We are His counterpart. A counterpart of God is just a part of God. What He is, we are. He is the Head and we are the Body. We cannot say that the Head is God and that the Body is not God. The Body and the Head are one and the same.</P><P>To be a Christian is not only to be moral with a high standard of morality. To be a Christian is to be God, to be a part of God, to be a counterpart of God. As Christians, we should live God, express God, and manifest God by walking and doing everything in the Spirit and according to the Spirit. The very God whose counterpart we have become is the life-giving, compound, all-inclusive Spirit, who is the consummation, the totality, the aggregate, of the processed Triune God. Such a Spirit is the great blessing to all the nations on this earth in Jesus Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Organic Union in God's Relationship with Man &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
