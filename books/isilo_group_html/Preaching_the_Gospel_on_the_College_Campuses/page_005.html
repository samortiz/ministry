You may think that you are too young, that you do not know very much, and that you do not have much experience in life. Do not listen to these thoughts. You have to reject them. I have seen many newly saved ones who were bold, strong, and powerful in the preaching of the gospel. I have also seen ones who became old in their experience of the Lord. When they preached the gospel, they did not have any power. Then they turned to gimmicks and exercised their cleverness to convince people. You do not need to use crafty words. As long as you are in the Spirit, you should be frank and strict with your words.<p>Once in my hometown, someone came to me and said, &#8220;Brother Lee, your gospel preaching is very good, but you should not be so frank and strict in your speaking.&#8221; I told him that although he was nice in his gospel preaching, he had not brought many people to the Lord. Should I have learned from him? I may not have seemed nice in my gospel preaching, but I brought many people to the Lord. The effectiveness of the gospel is not a matter of being nice and crafty or even frank and bold. It is a matter of power. Those who exercise their faith to preach the gospel in the baptism in the Spirit have power. Today the power is in your faith and your faith has a base, a ground, and a standing. The base is the Bible. First Corinthians 12:13 says, &#8220;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body.&#8221; We do not need to use any gimmicks when we preach the gospel. We should just exercise our faith to apply the word of the truth which says that we have been baptized in the Spirit.<p>You do not even need to claim the baptism in the Spirit in a religious way. Simply apply the accomplished fact of the baptism in the Spirit. Whenever I get home, I take out my key and apply it. The key has been made and it is ready to be applied. I do not need to say, &#8220;Oh, I claim the key. The key is mine. The key was made for me. The key has been given to me. The key is waiting for me.&#8221; I could claim the key in this way from morning to evening and still be outside my door. I just need to take the key out of my pocket and apply it. When you go to the campus, just apply the Spirit by exercising your faith. Make a strong decision that you will not do anything without the Spirit. In the morning, when you are going to the campus, exercise your faith. You can say, &#8220;Lord, thank You, the Spirit is mine. I am in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in me because the Bible tells me so.&#8221;<p>We all have to be rescued from the concept that we need gimmicks. This thought has to go. We do not need any gimmicks like rock music, movies, or dramas. The demons are not afraid of gimmicks. The demons are afraid of our faith. If we exercise our faith, we will have the power to preach the gospel. Today, the seven Spirits are for the seven churches and for God&#8217;s administration. The seven Spirits have also been sent forth into the whole earth. We should exercise our faith to tell the Lord, &#8220;Lord, I am in the churches, I am for Your administration, and I am for the preaching of the gospel, the sending forth of Christ.&#8221; This will give us the standing to apply the divine truths. The New Testament tells us that Christ has been crucified and resurrected. He has ascended to the heavens, and He has baptized all of His chosen people in the Spirit. Let us believe in the Word, exercise our faith, and go to the campuses to preach the gospel.<p>Let me say a balancing word. We must love the Lord and His Word, forsake sinful matters, open ourselves to be fully cleansed, and consecrate ourselves to the Lord, or our faith will not work. We will not have a living faith because we do not have a good conscience (1 Tim. 1:19). Whenever there is an offense in our conscience, there will be a leakage, and our faith will leak away. If we have a bad conscience, we will not be able to exercise our faith. But if we love the Lord and His Word, deal with all our sins with a thorough confession, apply the blood to our situation, and consecrate ourselves to the Lord, our faith will work. A strong and prevailing faith always comes from a good conscience without offense. We do not need to fast and pray. Rather, we need to confess and consecrate. Then we can apply what the Bible says by exercising our faith.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Preaching the Gospel on the College Campuses &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
