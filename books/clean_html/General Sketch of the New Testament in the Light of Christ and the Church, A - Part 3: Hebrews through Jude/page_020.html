<h2 class=head2>Enduring Various Trials</h2><p>Living faith also endures various trials (1:2, 12). If we suffer trials for a short time and fall away, this proves that we do not have living faith. If we have living faith, we will endure the trials.<h2 class=head2>Overcoming All Temptations</h2><p>In addition, if we have living faith, we will overcome all temptations. As we have seen, verses 2 through 12 deal with trials, whereas verses 13 to 18 deal with temptations. Trials come from God, but temptations come from the devil. As far as trials are concerned, we must endure, while concerning temptations, we have to overcome. Both the enduring of trials and the overcoming of temptations are the fruit of living faith.<h2 class=head2>Being Doers of the Word</h2><p>Fifth, if we have living faith, we will be not only hearers of the word, but also doers (vv. 22-25). Living faith causes us to act and work according to what we hear of the word, making us doers of the word.<h2 class=head2>Being Separated from the World</h2><p>Sixth, living faith causes us to be separated from the world, to be unspotted from the world and to not have any friendship with the world (1:27b; 4:4).<h2 class=head2>Caring for Orphans, Widows, and Poor Ones</h2><p>The seventh issue of living faith is that we are kind to orphans, widows, and poor ones (1:27a; 2:1-6, 14-16). If we have living faith, we will be generous to spontaneously take care of these needy ones.<h2 class=head2>The Work of Faith</h2><p>If we have living faith, we will have the conduct, the work, of faith. James 2:14-16 illustrates this. To tell a needy, poor brother to trust in the Lord and go in peace is to have a faith which is not living. Living faith gives something to the needy one. We cannot speak to a needy one with vain words about faith. We must have the true work of faith. If we believe that God is living and can care for this needy one, we should share what we have with him and let God care for us. Why would we believe in God for him, yet not believe in God for ourselves? We may believe that God will care for the needy one, but we may believe that only the money in our pocket and in our bank account, not God, will take care of us. This faith is full of doubt. If we have living faith, we should take out all we have in our pocket in order to care for the needy one, and then we can let God care for us. This is a true work to confirm and prove that we have a living faith.<h2 class=head2>Bridling Our Tongue</h2><p>Another issue of our living faith is that we bridle our tongue (3:2-12). We should not talk too much. We should bridle our tongue like we would bridle a horse. The more faith we have, the more we will pray and not gossip, but to have gossip and vain talk means that we lack living faith. In fact, the more we talk vainly and gossip, the more we lose our faith.<h2 class=head2>Trusting in the Lord</h2><p>Living faith always causes us to trust in the Lord (4:13-17). In whatever we do and wherever we go we should not trust in ourselves. We should say, “Lord, if You will, I will go, and if You will, I will do. I do not know whether or not tomorrow I will live. My breath is like a vapor, and perhaps tomorrow this vapor will disappear. Therefore, I do not trust in myself. I trust in You, Lord.”<h2 class=head2>Using Our Riches in the Proper Way</h2><p>Furthermore, if we have living faith, we will use all our wealth and riches in the proper way. James 5:1-6 is a warning to the rich. In the entire New Testament, there is no other book which warns the rich as much as this one does. Rich people may love their money and trust in their wealth simply because they do not have living faith. If we have living faith, we will use all our riches and wealth in the right way.<h2 class=head2>Being Right with the Brothers</h2><p>The twelfth and final issue of our living faith is that it causes us to be right with the brothers (5:19-20). This means that we do not speak anything critical against a brother. Rather, we rescue the fallen ones who are led astray from the truth, and we take care of them to bring them back to the Lord.<p>The foregoing twelve items are different aspects of the living work that issues out of living faith. If we have living faith, we will manifest these living works. They are the reality of our conduct as persons who have living faith. If we consider these points, the entire book of James will be open to us.
