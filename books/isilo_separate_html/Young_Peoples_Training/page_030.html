THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Throughout the centuries, many great teachers have attempted to reconcile the two aspects of the Triune God. In doing so, they have invented certain terms. For example, they invented the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; and spoke of the three persons of the one God. Humanly speaking, as a convenience in explaining the Trinity, we may temporarily borrow this term. But we should not stress it. It is illogical to speak of the three persons of the one God. Let us see what Augustine has to say on this matter. Augustine was accused of being a modalist because he was unable to find human language to adequately express the mystery of the Triune God. Augustine said:</p>
<p>Our Greek friends have spoken of one essence, three substances, but the Latins have one essence or substance, three Persons... provided that what is said is understood only in mystery, such a way of speaking was sufficient...We say three Persons, then why do we not also say three Gods? Or else, on account of their ineffable union these three are together one God, why not also one Person; so that we could not say three Persons, although we call each a Person singly, just as we can not say three Gods, although we call each singly God, whether the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit? Is it because Scripture does not say three Gods? But neither do we find that Scripture anywhere mentions three Persons.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;three Persons&rdquo; does not exist in the Scripture, but is added by men in their interpretation. Since they cannot say that the Three&mdash;Father, Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are three Gods, what else can they say? So the designation &ldquo;three Persons&rdquo; is used. Actually, to use the designation &ldquo;three Persons&rdquo; to explain the Father, Son, and Spirit is also not quite satisfactory, because &ldquo;three Persons&rdquo; really means three persons. Therefore, Griffith Thomas, famous for his exposition on the book of Romans and for being one of the founders of Dallas Theological Seminary, says in his book, <em>The Principles of Theology:</em></p>
<p>The term &ldquo;Person&rdquo; is also sometimes objected to. Like all human language, it is liable to be accused of inadequacy and even positive error. It certainly must not be pressed too far, or it will lead to Tritheism...While we are compelled to use terms like &ldquo;substance&rdquo; and &ldquo;Person,&rdquo; we are not to think of them as identical with what we understand as human substance and personality...The truth and experience of the Trinity is not dependent upon the theological terminology.</p>
<p>The terms such as substance, essence, subsistence, and person were all invented for/or adapted to theological usage. Very few English-speaking people are familiar with these terms. These terms are used because, as Griffith Thomas says, we do not have language adequate to explain the mystery of the Trinity. However, the more terms you invent, the more trouble you will have. Not long ago, I read a mimeographed article written against us by some opposers. On one page, this article says that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three separate and distinct persons in the nature of one God. Toward the end of the article, it says that these three persons should not be made so separate that They become three Gods. I laughed when I read this. The writer of this article cannot reconcile his own words. On one page, he says that the Father, Son, and Spirit are three separate and distinct persons, but on another page, he says that we should not make Them &ldquo;too separate.&rdquo; How separate is &ldquo;too separate&rdquo;? To what extent are the three persons separate? As you separate the Three, you will have three Gods. The manner of speaking employed in this article causes entanglements. It is better to adopt the attitude taken by Martin Luther who said:</p>
<p>Those who neglect the Scripture and approach such questions with confidence in their own mental power are the teachers of God, not His pupils...If reason disturbs you here and questions arise like those of the Turks: Are there, then, two gods? Answer: There is only one God, and still there is the Father, and the Son. How is this possible? Respond with humility: I do not know.</p>
<p>As much as possible, we should avoid words such as person, substance, essence, subsistence, and hypostasis. Do you understand the word hypostasis adequately? Some say that it means &ldquo;persons,&rdquo; but this is their interpretation. Hypostasis is an ancient Greek word denoting the elements that constitute a philosophy. Hence, hypostasis actually means substances. Some of the early teachers, in their attempt to define the Trinity, borrowed this term and said that within the Trinity there were three elements or hypostasis. But if you trace the history of language, you will see that hypostasis do not refer to persons. This is the theologians&rsquo; interpretation to match their concept. Hence, do not bring in this term, for it will just cause trouble. Rather, simply say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, our God is triune&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.&rdquo; Isaiah 9:6 says that the Son is the Father, and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit. According to our experience, if we have the Son we have the Father, and if we call on the name of the Lord, we receive the Spirit. Today, the Lord surely indwells us as the life-giving Spirit. It is sufficient to say this much. There is no need to argue for any doctrine. However, many only care for traditional knowledge and doctrine, not for their experience or for the pure word of the Bible.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> </body></html>
