   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 23 says, Curse Meroz, says the Angel of Jehovah; / Bitterly curse its inhabitants.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>/ For they did not come to the aid of Jehovah, / To the aid of Jehovah against the mighty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Angel of Jehovah is Christ as the sent One of God, and Jehovah is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Divine Trinity s involvement in Deborah s victory over Sisera, the captain of the Canaanite army, was for her and her followers to enjoy the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 12 says, Awake!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Awake, Deborah!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>/ Awake!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Awake, speak forth a song!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>/ Arise, Barak; / And lead captive your captives.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verses 15 through 16 say, The princes in Issachar were with Deborah; / And Issachar was true to Barak; / Into the valley they were sent behind him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>/ Among the divisions of Reuben / There were great resolutions in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>/ Why did you sit among the sheepfolds / Listening to the pipings for the flocks?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>/ In the divisions of Reuben / There were great searchings of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These verses indicate that when Deborah was stirred up by the Triune God, Barak came in to help her.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then many of the defeated children of Israel were stirred up as well, and they seriously considered their situation and made a strong decision to follow Deborah and Barak to fight the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A great resolution in heart is a firm decision.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to search our heart and strongly resolve to fight for God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 31 says, May all Your enemies so perish, O Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>/ But may those who love Him be like the sun / When it rises in its might.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>IN THE CASE OF GIDEON</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Judges 6:12 says, The Angel of Jehovah appeared to him Gideon and said to him, Jehovah is with you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 14 says, Jehovah turned to him and said, Go in this strength of yours, and save Israel from the hand of Midian.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not say that we are weak and do not have strength.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What we have is enough; we need to go with whatever we have.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 19 says, Gideon went and prepared a kid and an ephah of flour in unleavened cakes...And he brought it out to Him...And he presented it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verses 21 through 26 say, The Angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in His hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And Gideon said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For I have seen the Angel of Jehovah face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And Jehovah said to him, Peace be with you...Then Gideon built an altar there to Jehovah, and he called it Jehovah-shalom...Jehovah said to him, Take your father s bull...And build an altar to Jehovah your God...And offer a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 34 says, The Spirit of Jehovah clothed Gideon; and he blew the trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Gideon blew the trumpet, many followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As in the case of Deborah, in the case of Gideon the Angel of Jehovah was Christ as the sent One of God, and Jehovah was the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The kid typifies Christ as our burnt offering, and the unleavened cakes typify Christ as our meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The fire typifies God as the accepting agent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have seen that such a consuming, devouring, accepting fire is God Himself Heb 12:29 .</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The burnt offering typifies Christ for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Finally, the Spirit of Jehovah is the Spirit of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Divine Trinity s involvement in Gideon s victory over the Midianites was for Gideon to enjoy the Triune God with His redemption in Christ and with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The sacrificed animals indicate redemption.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>IN THE CASE OF JEPHTHAH</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 32 says, Jephthah passed on to the children of Ammon to fight against them, and Jehovah delivered them into his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can see the Trinity involved here because there is the Spirit of Jehovah, who is the Spirit of the Triune God, and Jehovah, who is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Divine Trinity was for Jephthah s victory over the Ammonites.</S>
