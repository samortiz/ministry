   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR SUITABLE MEETING HALLS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN DIFFERENT PLACES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Furthermore, we need suitable meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Miao said that he has been to many places and that nowhere is the meeting hall as bad as the one here in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the winter it is cold, and in the summer it is hot.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When someone gives a message, the audience is spread out over seven or eight different places; the listeners cannot see the speaker, and in some places they cannot even hear the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to build a meeting hall that can seat three thousand right from the start and that can hold another two thousand if we add another level to it later.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In total, we need a place that can seat five thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many people have been stirred up in Nanking already.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, Nanking also needs a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In addition, we have to consider how to maintain a strong message meeting in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Foochow also needs a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At present, the meeting hall in Foochow is very hot in summer, and the windows are on the roof.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What the brothers and sisters have offered up in these days is not enough to take care of these three meeting halls alone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE NEED FOR THE PUBLICATION OF THE MAGAZINES</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before the war, we published on an average eighteen thousand copies of The Christian every issue.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At its peak, we were publishing twenty-one thousand copies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The publication of one magazine alone requires seven hundred million dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is only one magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are three other kinds of magazines.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not think that it is a simple thing to put out a magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As far as an individual is concerned, it is an embarrassing thing to ask for money.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But here we are not afraid of misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every month, we need a lot of money.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE NEED OF THE TRAINING WITH THE HOSPITALITY</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One other thing needs to be mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Among us, some want to serve the Lord, but there is no place where they can receive any training.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a shameful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In two places, brothers wanted to learn to serve the Lord and were sent to seminaries.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At present, the brothers in all the places can surely learn something in their own church regarding how to take care of affairs and how to participate in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, at the same time, they need some specific trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At present, we have two hundred mous Chinese acre of land in Kuling.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are some houses there, but the preparation work is only half complete; there are still many things that are not yet ready.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This time when we had a few dozen co-workers meeting there, the hospitality became a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some had to sleep in the hospital nearby like patients on hospital beds, because the hospitality was not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is too poor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to consolidate the hospitality before we can meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>GRASPING THE BEST OPPORTUNITY</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>TO OFFER UP EVERYTHING FOR THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today, we have to offer up all our time for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once I was at a meeting, and I asked the attendants if there were over fifty young people among them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I discovered that all of them were above middle-age and I could not go on with what I was going to say.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today, if we have six hundred young people raised up among us, we will be busy all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, we are short of people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the same time, we need a few hundred or even a few thousand brothers who are holding jobs to provide the support.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do not do this, we will have no way to take care of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today, our work has to be done in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the past, we thought that as long as we would find the full-time brothers and would commit to them the responsibility of the gospel work, all the problems would be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But this is not the way today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today, we need to take care of the work together.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No other period of time has been as easy as today for the gospel to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The opportunity for the gospel will be over in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Manchuria, only two places are left where the gospel can still be preached.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although North China has not yet fallen completely to the Communists, other than along a few railway lines, all the other places can no longer afford us the liberty to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These days, if there are people who are strong enough, and if we have enough money, we can bring three or five thousand people to the Lord in Foochow within a month.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today, once a person touches the gospel, he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we want to give our all, now is the best time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once a person touches the gospel, he is subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why are we not able to send out more people?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In these days, we are eager to go on in a fast way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I hope that some would rise up from among us right away.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I am not asking a little from you; I am asking everything from you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the Lord's word, there is no such thing as half-hearted Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If a man wants to serve God, he has to offer up everything.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If there is a group of people who will rise up to truly offer up everything, the world will see the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Unless we serve in this way, God will have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we want to serve, we have to be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we are not absolute, we may as well not serve.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What God wants is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What the Lord requires is also everything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Today, all those who are in their jobs, in their occupations, in their schools, or in their homes have to offer up themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We need all the people and all the money to be spent on China.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today is the best opportunity for the gospel to be preached.</S>
