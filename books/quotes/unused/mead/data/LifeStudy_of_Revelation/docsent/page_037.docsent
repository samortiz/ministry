   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS THE PRIEST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 13 says that Christ is clothed with a garment reaching to the feet.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This garment is the priestly robe Exo 28:33-35 signifying the fullness of Christ s divine virtues and human attributes cf.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Isa 6:1, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although the word priest is not mentioned here, we know by His garment that Christ is depicted here as the High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today, the Son of Man, Jesus Christ, who is walking in the midst of the churches, is a Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Among the three offices of priest, prophet, and king, the most dear, intimate, precious, and lovely office is that of the priest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The priest is so dear and lovely because he takes care of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As Christ walks among the churches, He takes care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>NOT WORKING WITH STRENGTH,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>BUT CARING FOR THE CHURCHES IN LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 13 also says that Christ, the Son of Man, was girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Have you ever seen someone girded about at the breasts with a girdle?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is quite meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The priests in the Old Testament were girded at the loins for their ministry Exo 28:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Daniel 10:5 Christ is also girded with fine gold at His loins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But here Christ as our High Priest is girded about at the breasts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The breasts signify love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be girded at the loins is to be strengthened for work, whereas to be girded about at the breasts signifies care in love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ s work in producing the churches has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now He no longer needs to be girded at His loins for work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What He is doing now in the midst of the churches is to care for them in love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This requires Him to be girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This golden girdle signifies divine strength.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is now exercising a divine care over the churches, moving among them in His humanity and caring for them with His divine strength.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What a loving care He exercises over His churches today!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>BEING ANCIENT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 14 says that His head and hair were white as white wool, as snow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>White hair signifies great age Job 15:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The black hair with which the Lord is depicted in Song of Songs 5:11 signifies His unfading and everlasting strength, but the white hair with which He is depicted here signifies His ancientness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although Christ is ancient, He is not old.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this chapter we see that His head and His hair were white as wool and as snow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>White wool issues from the nature of life, and white snow comes down from the sky, from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Wool is not made white; it is born white, and its whiteness comes out of its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>White wool is the color of Christ s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His ancientness is of His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Snow is white because it comes from heaven and contains no earthly dirt or stain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, white wool, both here and in Daniel 7:9, signifies that the ancientness of Christ is of His nature, not of His becoming old, while white snow signifies that His ancientness is heavenly, not earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>V. WITH WATCHING, OBSERVING, SEARCHING,</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>JUDGING, AND INFUSING EYES</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In verse 14, we see that His eyes are as a flame of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Song of Songs 5:12 the eyes of Christ are like doves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That is for the expression of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here His eyes are as a flame of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is for Him to observe and search in His judging by enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this book His eyes are not two but seven 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Seven is the number of completion in God s move.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, His eyes in this book are for God s operation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These seven eyes of His are the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God 4:5; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Dan 10:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The fire burning equals the flame of fire and is for observing and searching.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The seven Spirits of God which are sent forth into all the earth are also for God s move upon the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, the eyes of Christ in this book are the seven Spirits of God for God s move and operation on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ s eyes are for watching, observing, searching, judging by enlightening, and infusing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must experience all these different aspects of His eyes, especially the aspect of infusing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His eyes infuse us with all that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>His infusing eyes are a flame of fire which is continually burning.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This can be proved by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not exercise your mind to understand this, but check with your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since the day we were saved, Christ s eyes have been like a burning fire enlightening and infusing us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>His eyes also stir us up to be hot.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After Christ has looked at us, we can never be cold as we once were.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>By looking at us, He burns us and stirs us up in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many times the Lord comes to us with His piercing eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Perhaps when we are trying to hide something from our wives, the Lord comes with seven shining eyes piercing into our being and exposing our true condition.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I have had this kind of experience hundreds of times.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When I was arguing with others, especially with my intimate ones, the shining eyes of Christ were upon me, and I could not go on speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>His shining stopped my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The book of Revelation is a book with a judging nature.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Fire is for divine judgment 1 Cor 3:13; Heb 6:8; 10:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Our God is also a consuming fire Heb 12:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>His throne is like the fiery flame and its wheels as burning fire, and a fiery stream issues and comes forth from before Him Dan 7:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All this is for judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The main significance of the Lord s eyes being as a flame of fire is for His judgment 2:18-23; 19:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When He comes to take possession of the earth by exercising judgment over it, even His feet will be like pillars of fire 10:1 .</S>
