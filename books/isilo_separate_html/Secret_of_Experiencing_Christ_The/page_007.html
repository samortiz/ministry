In resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). He is not only the Giver and Sender of the Spirit, but in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. Hence, 2 Corinthians 3:17 tells us that He is the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last,<br>the Beginning and the End</H2><P>In Revelation, the last book of the Bible, the Lord declared that He is the Alpha and Omega (22:13). Alpha and Omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. To say that Christ is the Alpha and Omega means that He is every letter in the alphabet. He is not only the first letter and the last, but He is every letter. Therefore, in Revelation 22:13 the Lord continued to declare that He is the First and the Last, and that He is the beginning and the end. This means that He is all-inclusive. He is all twenty-two letters of the Greek alphabet, and He is every word composed with this alphabet. Furthermore, He is every sentence composed with all the words, and, moreover, He is the entire composition composed with all the sentences. Eventually, the entire composition is just Christ. Christ is all-inclusive.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Eternal Life</H2><P>Such an all-inclusive Christ is the eternal life (1 John 2). He is the eternal life for us and to us that we may experience Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Mystery of God</H2><P>Colossians 2:2 tells us that Christ is the mystery of God. God is mysterious. God Himself is a mystery, and this mystery is fully revealed by Christ and in Christ. That Christ is God's mystery indicates that if we desire to know God, we must know Christ. Christ is the definition and explanation of God. Christ is also the expression of God. Everything concerning God is in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Embodiment of the Triune God</H2><P>Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God. Colossians 2:9 tells us that in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. All the fullness of the Godhead refers to the Trinity&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The divine Trinity is the fullness of the Godhead, and this fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ. Therefore, Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all embodied in Christ.</P><P>Christ, our Redeemer and our Savior, is all-inclusive. As such an all-inclusive One, He is the complete God. We need to spend much time to enter into the significance of all the foregoing details regarding Christ's Person, until we are fully saturated and immersed in these things. Then we shall realize that the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;is one God who is embodied in the Person of Christ. When we receive Christ, we receive the Triune God. When we enjoy Christ, we enjoy the Triune God. When we experience Him, we experience the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. How wonderful this is!</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
