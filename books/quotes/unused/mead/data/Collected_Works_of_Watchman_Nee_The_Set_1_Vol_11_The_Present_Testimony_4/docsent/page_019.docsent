   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ANNOUNCEMENT Issue No. 34</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second part of this issue contains the notes of the messages of our Third Overcomer Conference.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Publishing the full text of these messages will not only be time-consuming as far as the editing work is concerned, but it will also take up too much room.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We roughly estimate that there would be over two hundred thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, in this issue we will only publish the outlines.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We hope that in the future, we can publish in separate issues the detailed record of every message.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this we need the readers' prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>April 18, 1934</S>
