   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lesson Eighteen CONFORMATION Scripture Reading Rom 6:3-5; 8:29; Phil 3:10, 21; 2 Cor 3:18;</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eph 4:20-21 Outline Life-shape, life-power, life-essence Being conformed to the image of Christ By the growth of life and environmental dealings The mold and the dough Being conformed to the body of the Lord s glory Text</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 8:29 says, Because whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. LIFE-SHAPE, LIFE-POWER, LIFE-ESSENCE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every life has its own form.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, a dog has one form and a chicken has another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The growth of a certain life brings in the full form of that life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today we are sons of God, but we do not yet have the full form, the complete shape, of sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, by growth and transformation we need to be conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, we shall be completely conformed to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we shall possess the full life-shape which comes from the life-power with the life-essence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A carnation, a chicken, and a dog all have a different life-form according to their life-essence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A carnation has the form of a carnation because it has the life-essence of a carnation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The carnation essence develops into the carnation form by means of the life-power within the carnation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Praise the Lord that we have the life-essence and the life-power within us!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This life-power is shaping us into the image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through this shaping function of the life-power, we shall be fully conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>BEING CONFORMED</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TO THE IMAGE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have been predestinated by God to be conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One day, we will be like Him inside and out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First, Christ died to take care of our objective problem before God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Second, He regenerated us with the divine life by the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Third, He is sanctifying us with His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Fourth, He is transforming us from an old person into a new person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are being changed in life and nature, not just in outward form.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Fifth, He is conforming us to His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What a salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BY THE GROWTH OF LIFE AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEALINGS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The life He puts into us grows.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As it grows, it sanctifies and transforms us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we are being transformed, we are being conformed inwardly to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the outside, we have sufferings, but inside of us, the Spirit is working.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we pray or call on His name, we touch Him and He conforms us a little bit more to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE MOLD AND THE DOUGH</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God s firstborn Son is the prototype, and we are the mass production.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ is the model, mold, and pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has put us all into Him that we may be molded into the image of His firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually we all shall be conformed to the mold.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes when the sisters make cakes they put dough into a mold.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By being put into the mold the dough assumes the pattern and image of the mold.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, the dough must also be baked that the cake may bear the pattern of the mold without any change.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the dough could speak, it probably would cry out, Sister, have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Don t apply so much pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I can t bear it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please keep your hands off.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, the sister would reply, If I keep my hands off, how will you fit into the pattern of the mold?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Dear dough, after my molding you must be put into the oven.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may think that pressure is enough suffering for you, but you also need burning.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After you have experienced pressure and intense heat you will bear the pattern of the mold permanently.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Likewise, Christ, the firstborn Son of God, is the prototype, pattern, and mold, and we are pieces of dough.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We all have been put into the mold, and are now being kneaded by the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ is the mold and we are the dough.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through the outward situation and the inward working of the Spirit, we get conformed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>V. BEING CONFORMED TO THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>OF THE LORD S GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As this process is accomplished, our body will be conformed to the body of the Lord s glory Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>That will be the last great step of conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At that time, we will be like Him inwardly and outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This will be the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We will be a corporate man in His image to express Him and with His full authority to represent Him for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Questions Explain the terms life-shape, life-power, and life-essence.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How is conformation related to sanctification and transformation?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What two factors are at work to conform us to the image of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Can you give your experience?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What will we be like when conformation is completed?</S>
