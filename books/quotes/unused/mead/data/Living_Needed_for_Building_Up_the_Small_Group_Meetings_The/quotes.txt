[1]  The Living Needed for Building Up the Small Group Meetings CONTENTS
[2]  NOTES FROM MESSAGE ONE A LIVING THAT IS OUT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[3]  AND THROUGH THE HUMAN SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 4; Gal 5:16, 25 TWO KINDS OF MEETINGS
[4]  This time the Lord has led us to have a number of weeks of special weekly conference meetings.
[5]  As a result, the Lord showed us that at the beginning of God s New Testament economy, that is, at the beginning of the New Testament age, the Holy Spirit led the first group of Christians, those who were freshly saved at Pentecost, to have two kinds of meetings.
[6]  In the past six months, after much seeking of the Lord, I have realized a basic problem.
[7]  According to my understanding of the Bible and my experience through so many years, I can say that in summary what the Bible talks about is this kind of living a living that is out of the Holy Spirit and through the human spirit.
[8]  When you are stirred up, you forget that you are to honor your parents, or that you are not to provoke your children.
[9]  In the first half Paul explained clearly that the Triune God has become the Spirit, that He has entered into you, and that He has filled you in your spirit, so that you can live by this spirit to live out a superb living.
[10]  Since you love the Lord, come to meetings, seek after the Lord, and pray, surely the Holy Spirit will flow through you.
[11]  If you are such a person, whenever you come to the meetings you do not need to say much, and you do not have to exhibit yourself.
[12]  Brothers and sisters, if we love the Lord, if we love the church, and if we have a heart for the Lord s recovery, we need to see clearly that we must put our efforts here.
[13]  NOTES FROM MESSAGE TWO A LIVING THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:4; Gal 5:16a, 25 THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SMALL GROUP GATHERINGS
[14]  In this message we will continue to see a living that is solely according to the spirit.
[15]  If you call on His name out of a sincere heart, this life-giving Spirit will enter into you to be your life and will be in you as your salvation, saving your entire being from sin and the world.
[16]  Because of the influence of culture, tradition, religion, philosophy, morality, ethics, customs, and habits, whenever we read the Bible, we are affected by all these things in our background.
[17]  As a result, we think that the Bible teaches us concerning all these things.
[18]  I hope that the Lord will be merciful to us all, so that we may all remove our colored glasses to read the Word of God solely with our God-created spirit.
[19]  The Christian life is not a life according to culture.
[20]  In the end I saw that the Bible only shows us one way, and that way is to walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit in our daily life.
[21]  When we wake up in the morning, no matter how busy we are, we should spend a few minutes to have a time with the Lord.
[22]  NOTES FROM MESSAGE THREE A LIVING THAT IS OUTWARDLY BAPTIZED IN
[23]  If you study thoroughly verses 12 and 13, you will see that the functioning of all the members of the Body of Christ is nothing but a living.
[24]  If the Lord asks you today, What do you want? and you say, Lord, I am thirsty today; I want the Spirit, that is very good.
[25]  In this message we shall see a living in which we meet in the Spirit and by Christ.
[26]  THE CHURCH MEETINGS BEING THE HIGHEST FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT
[27]  Under God s ordained way, every man needs to sleep, work, and eat.
[28]  If you read the Bible carefully you will realize that the proper pastime for man is God.
[29]  If you keep them home and look at them every day, even you eventually will be bored by them, not to mention the fact that they will never be bound by you anyway.
[30]  First Corinthians 14:26 says, Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.
[31]  Moreover, I hope that they would not be long speakings, but would be in the way where I speak a few sentences, you speak a few sentences, and every one stands up and speaks a few sentences.
[32]  From church history we know that the Pentecostal movement did not exist until two centuries ago.
[33]  When you present in the meetings the Christ that you experience and speak forth this Christ with your mouth and spirit, you are offering up your harvest and you are exhibiting Christ.
[34]  NOTES FROM MESSAGE FIVE A LIFE OF MEETING BY SPEAKING
[35]  BY THE SPIRIT OF FAITH Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:13; 1 Cor 12:3, 8, 10; 14:1, 4, 26 THE SPIRIT OF FAITH
[36]  First Corinthians 14:31 says, For you can all prophesy one by one.
[37]  But when I look at the way you stand up to speak, I am convinced that you all need to practice speaking in the meetings.
[38]  The reason you cannot speak is because you do not practice speaking.
[39]  You say that you come to the meetings to worship God, but if your mouths are shut it is difficult for you to be released to serve God.
[40]  First Corinthians 12:3 says, No one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.
[41]  In the meetings, whether we are reading the Scripture or speaking about the Lord Jesus, or whether we are proclaiming the hymns to one another, we all have to exercise our spirits.
[42]  THE LORD S RECOVERY NOT DEPENDING ON ORGANIZATIONS OR PREACHERS
[43]  In order that our home meetings be strong, living, and fresh, we all have to strive to grow in life, to be filled in the spirit constantly, and to seek after the truth, so that we can be an expression of the Spirit.
[44]  You may feel that you do not know how to speak, but if you open your mouth you will know how to speak.
[45]  We have to learn to speak forth our experience of Christ by our spirit in a simple way.
[46]  A lot of times when you stand up to speak there is no spirit, and there is no faith.
[47]  If you do not have this kind of testimony, you are merely a Christian who comes to meetings; you are not one who lives Christ and experiences Him in your daily life.
[48]  You have to pray sincerely, asking and telling the Lord that you really desire to walk according to the spirit in everything, and that you truly desire to live a life that is no longer you, but Christ living in you.
[49]  When you pray this way, you will see that during the day, maybe only five percent of your living is Christ, but even if you would bring that five percent to the meeting, the meeting would be filled with a lot of testimonies.
[50]  NOTES FROM MESSAGE SIX EVERYONE CAN PROPHESY Scripture Reading: Num 11:29; 1 Cor 14:1, 31; Col 3:16; 1 Tim 2:4 OUR MEETING BEING AN EXHIBITION OF CHRIST
[51]  In every meeting we have the Bible and the hymnal in our hands.
[52]  Everyone can stand up to declare the Lord s word or to choose a hymn to speak to one another.
[53]  Rather, it is our coming together with an open spirit to speak forth the Christ whom we experience, treasure, and love with the utterance that He gives us.
[54]  After Joshua, the helper of Moses, heard this, he said, My lord Moses, forbid them v. 28 . But Moses said to him, Enviest thou for my sake? Would God that all the Lord s people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them v. 29 . Moses seemed to say, Even you, Joshua, should prophesy.
[55]  The more we speak by the spirit of faith, the more we will experience the Lord as our riches.
[56]  The Spirit of the Lord is in us as well as upon us, but we still need prayer and the proper preparation.
[57]  First Corinthians 14:1 says that we should desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that we may prophesy; verse 31 of 1 Corinthians 14 says that we can all prophesy one by one; and Colossians 3:16 tells us to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in our hearts to God.
[58]  AND COME TO THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH
[59]  Although I have expounded all twenty-seven books of the New Testament during the past twelve years, and although my exposition has been printed and published in volumes totaling over 10,000 pages, I am afraid that it is difficult to find one in a hundred among us who has come to a full knowledge of these truths.
[60]  If we have not learned these truths and have no deposit within us, then when the time comes to speak, we will have no words; we will have nothing to say.
[61]  We all desire that the Lord would have a way in His recovery, and we all desire to grow in life and be filled with the Lord within.
[62]  NOTES FROM MESSAGE SEVEN PRACTICING TO SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD Scripture Reading: Col 3:16; John 6:63b; Eph 6:17; 1 Cor 2:13 THE CHRISTIAN LIFE BEING A LIFE OF SPEAKING
[63]  It is not easy to speak the word of the Lord.
[64]  This is because we do not have this concept or practice in our daily life.
[65]  To speak the word of the Lord is to speak forth something concerning God s mystery, God s will, something concerning His riches and His truth, and especially something concerning Christ.
[66]  It is rather easy for us to speak ordinary words, but to speak spiritual words, words that speak of Christ and speak forth Christ, requires special practice.
[67]  To speak the Lord s word does not mean that you recite the words of the Bible verse by verse.
[68]  Rather, it means that when you have some experience of the Lord and some understanding of God, you relate to others your experience and understanding by biblical words and spiritual expressions 1 Cor 2:13 .
[69]  When you speak, you should not speak as if you are writing a formal composition; rather, you should speak in an ordinary way.
[70]  In other words, if we have been a Christian for many years, but we still cannot speak the Lord s word today, we are not proper and are not qualified.
[71]  If you want to digest the word of the Lord, you need to pray-read; that is, you must first read and then pray.
[72]  Sometimes when you have your morning watch, you try to hurry a little because you want to be on time to go to work.
[73]  If while you are reading the Word of the Lord, your spirit is not exercised and you do not take the words you read as the Lord Himself, your morning watch is not right.
[74]  Whether you are having morning watch by yourself or with a few others, a principle must be kept: whenever you come to read the word of the Bible, you should regard it as the Lord Himself.
[75]  When we come to the Bible, we should have the attitude that we are coming to the Lord with His Word in our hand, taking the Word as Himself.
[76]  In the end, you are not merely reading the word of the Lord; you are speaking to the Lord with His word.
[77]  If I were to visit your home, when I knocked on the door, you would let me in. But how could we speak of letting some rice come in? No matter how much we let the rice in, the rice will never come in, because rice is not a living person.
[78]  Whenever we come to read the Lord s Word, we need to realize that the Lord s word is not only living; it is a living Person, the Lord Himself, who is waiting to come into us and dwell in us.
[79]  THE RESURRECTED JESUS TRAINING THE DISCIPLES TO BE ACCUSTOMED TO HIS INVISIBLE PRESENCE
[80]  When the Lord was on the earth for three and a half years, He was with the disciples visibly.
[81]  When they did not know that it was the Lord, the Lord followed them and walked with them for a long journey; but when they recognized that it was the Lord, He disappeared from them.
[82]  In this way, the Lord s word will automatically be constituted into you, and spontaneously you will have the burden to speak for the Lord.
[83]  All the pastors and preachers in Christianity today know that it is very difficult to help believers lead a life of constant fellowship with the Lord.
[84]  We must be clear that the big meetings cannot build up the church.
[85]  First Corinthians 14:26 shows us that when the whole church gathers together, it is not that one man speaks and everyone else listens; rather, it is that each one has a psalm, a revelation, a teaching, a tongue, or an interpretation.
[86]  Everyone who comes to the meetings must learn to speak for the Lord, and everyone must open his mouth to speak forth Christ.
[87]  But to help everyone to seek after the Lord, fellowship with Him, read His Word, digest it through pray-reading, and then speak for and speak forth the Lord is not easy.
[88]  If we love the Lord and we love the church, we must pray much before the Lord.
[89]  If we would practice this way, the word of Christ will surely be constituted into us, and our daily experience and enjoyment of the Lord will become our words.
[90]  Hence, in the small group meetings, on the one hand we need to read the Word of God, and on the other hand we need to receive some guidance and explanation from the Life-study messages, so that those who attend the meetings may be further enlightened in the Word of God and be nourished through the reading of the Word.
[91]  Then there are times when you can sing-read; when you come to a passage that touches you, you can put the words to a short tune and sing it together.
[92]  I hope that you all will take this word and put it into practice in your daily life, so that the Lord may have a way among us in the building up of His church.
[93]  NOTES FROM MESSAGE EIGHT THREE THINGS FOR FOUR THINGS Scripture Reading: Acts 4:31; 6:4; Jude 20 THREE THINGS
[94]  Acts 4:31 says, And as they were beseeching, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness.
[95]  In this verse, first there is the beseeching, the prayer; second there is the Holy Spirit; and third there is the word of God.
[96]  to Build Up Ourselves in Our Most Holy Faith
[97]  In these messages we have been concerned with the matter of strengthening the small group meetings.
[98]  In order for the church to be built up by the saints, we must labor on the Lord s word.
[99]  To labor on the Lord s word is to build up ourselves in our most holy faith.
[100]  Sometimes I sigh because during the meetings it seems that you do not know how to exercise your spirit to speak the Lord s word.
[101]  When you are at home, it is impossible for you not to speak, but once you are in a meeting, it is easy for you to stop speaking.
[102]  However, if you are not one who loves the Lord, I wish that you would not come to the United States, because in the United States there are also many evil things.
[103]  If I ask you to speak the Lord s word, it may be difficult for you now because within you there is a shortage of vocabulary and utterance.
[104]  We do not need to have more meetings, but we do need to utilize two meetings per week to give some educational teaching on the truth.
[105]  The first meeting which we can use for this purpose is the Lord s Table meeting.
[106]  On one hand we need to rise up to build up a spiritual education, and on the other hand we need the adequate prayer.
[107]  It is necessary to read the Bible, the Life-study messages, and books on the truth so that we can build up ourselves in the truth.
[108]  But if we do this without prayer, all this will merely be in our mind.
[109]  If you want the truth in your spirit, you surely need prayer.
[110]  When you pray for these things, God will give them to you and also add to you the necessities of your living.
[111]  Thus, the Lord s word, your prayer, and the Spirit of God will be mingled together and will saturate you within.
[112]  If you lack the word, prayer, and the Spirit, when you go to preach the gospel and you meet your relatives, you will not have the word to preach to them.
[113]  In the matter of recovering the saints, you may visit someone, but if you have no life supply, you can only say, We have not seen you for a long time.
[114]  Today if we want the Lord s recovery to have a future and we desire that the church be built up, we must labor in the word of the Lord.
