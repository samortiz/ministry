<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF MARK</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE MOVE OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR&rsquo;S<br />GOSPEL SERVICE</h1><h1 class="title">(6)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mark 7:24-30</h1><p>The Gospel of Mark is a progressive book, a record of the Lord&rsquo;s life on earth. No doubt, whatever the Lord experienced was sovereign, for God arranged the environment so that the Lord would experience certain things in His earthly life.</p><p>Thus far, we have seen the contents of the Slave-Savior&rsquo;s gospel service, the ways to carry out this service, and the auxiliary acts for the gospel service. We have also seen that, in chapter four, the Lord Jesus gave a strong word concerning the intrinsic element of the kingdom of God. Following this, He exercised His authority, the authority of the kingdom, to deal with man&rsquo;s outward situation. Concerning this, we have in Mark a picture of human society. We also have a picture showing the attitude of the worldly people toward the Lord&rsquo;s gospel. Then in chapter seven there is a turn from the dealing with man&rsquo;s outward situation to the dealing with the inward condition of man&rsquo;s heart.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SYROPHOENICIAN WOMAN<br />AND THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S BREAD</h2><p>In this message we shall consider the case of the Syrophoenician woman (7:24-30). Mark 7:24 tells us that the Lord &ldquo;went away into the districts of Tyre.&rdquo; Then a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, came to Him and fell at His feet (v. 25). &ldquo;The woman was a Greek, Syrophoenician by race.&rdquo; She was a Syrian by tongue, Phoenician by race (see Acts 21:2-3), and, the Phoenicians being descendants of the Canaanites, a Canaanite woman (Matt. 15:22). What made her a Greek&mdash;religion, marriage, or something else&mdash;is difficult to discover. In the New Testament the word &ldquo;Greek&rdquo; is used to signify the Gentile world. This woman was a typical Gentile. We may say that she was manifoldly a Gentile, for she was a Greek, a Syrophoenician, and a Canaanite. Nevertheless, she came to ask the Lord to do something for her. She wanted Him to cast a demon out of her daughter (v. 26).</p><p>Because this Syrophoenician woman was such a Gentile, the Lord Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the children&rsquo;s bread and throw it to the little dogs&rdquo; (v. 27). Here the Lord seemed to be saying to her, &ldquo;As a Gentile, you are a little dog, and I cannot throw the children&rsquo;s bread to you. You are not qualified to be one of the children. You are qualified only to be a Gentile. Because I must satisfy the children first, I should not take the children&rsquo;s bread and throw it to you.&rdquo;</p><p>In chapter six of the Gospel of John the Lord clearly told the Jews that He is the bread of life (John 6:35). He indicated to them that He is the bread of God, the One who &ldquo;comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world&rdquo; (John 6:33). He came down from heaven to be the bread of life to satisfy the hunger of the world. Although a word concerning this was clearly given in John 6, there is not such a word in the synoptic Gospels, in Matthew, Mark, or Luke. But in Mark 7:27 the Lord Jesus used the word &ldquo;bread.&rdquo; He said that the bread should first be given to the children.</p><p>What the Lord says concerning the children&rsquo;s bread in verse 27 indicates that He did not come simply to do miracles. The Lord Jesus came to feed the hungry children. The Lord&rsquo;s word here definitely indicates that in the previous chapters the Lord was feeding the people.</p>
