<h2 class="head1">ADDRESSES OF A FEW CHURCHES</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE CHURCHES</h2><h2 class="head2">Yi-Lin, Northern Kiangsu</h2><p>Thank the Lord that by His grace He has given me the opportunity to write to you. Since the war spread to northern Kiangsu, everyone is frightened. Those of our village are also very uneasy. Most of the brothers and sisters moved to the countryside. My family and the local brothers and sisters moved temporarily to Tao-Lao-She (a village ten miles from south Yi-Lin) because of the tense situation. Later, we moved to Hsu-Tsia Lou. Since then the Lord has led us safely back to Yi-Lin.</p><p>On May 28 of the Chinese calendar, Yi-Lin, Dong-Gou, Ban-Hu, and Su-Jia-Tsui were all bombed. At that time Brother Feng Shien-Tze and I were both in Yi-Lin. I hid temporarily in the fields. In my prayer I recalled the Lord's words: "Not one of them will fall to the earth apart from your Father....You are of more value than many sparrows." Although the bombs came down like rain and my body was covered with dust, I praise the power of God for protecting my life and delivering me from danger. In Yi-Lin over sixty people died and twenty houses were burned (all of which were very close to our home). My family and my house and the houses of all the brothers and sisters meeting in Yi-Lin were saved. This was truly God's grace!</p><p>Brothers from Ban-Hu wrote and told us that some of our brothers and sisters experienced some bombings, but their bodies were not hurt. Some crawled out of holes near fallen walls and houses. No one was hurt under such a barrage of fire and bombs.</p><p>According to Brother Hu Siao-lan, the meeting place was preserved, although the town of Dong-Gou was damaged. The brothers and sisters were scattered. Although they often met with danger, the Lord was with them, and they are all safely back home.</p><p>Brother Ji Yung-tung from Soo-Jia-Tsui said that when the bombing came to Soo-Jia-Tsui, both he and Brother Chiu Ri-jien were at home. One heavy bomb hit the northwest corner of the meeting hall. But thank the Lord; it fell harmlessly into the river, and no damage was done. A neighboring house caught fire, but it was extinguished. Because of the Lord's protection, the meeting hall was undamaged.</p><p>The brothers and sisters as well as the meeting halls in Yien-Chen and Fu-Ning are all safe and unharmed. We marvel at the Lord's grace and cannot thank Him enough for having cared for the churches in northern Kiangsu and having kept His children in safety. We also thank the brothers and sisters for remembering us before the Lord. We have had heavy rain here for many days, and the water is fierce; many fields in the lower plains have been flooded. The disruption of the war has caused many people to become unemployed. May the Lord lead us and arrange everything for us. Please do not forget to pray for us.</p><p>We have received Issue Nos. 5, 6, and 8 of The Open Door, but have not received Issue No. 7. If you still have some copies of Issue No. 7, please send them to us. In the future please send us fifty copies of each issue. The postal service in other places in northern Kiangsu is functioning, so please send the magazine to them as before.</p><p>Brother Wu Wei, August 9</p><h2 class="head2">Hangchow, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Brother Run Chi-yu wrote to Brother Yu Shiung-fei on July 10: "My nephew's wife and Brother and Mrs. Hsu Yung-ming and their two children are lodging at my house. My third uncle, Hsu Si-chiao, is safe in Ning-Hai. Brother Lee Kwei-sien visited me once; he is still living in Si-Wen-Che, a suburb of Hu-Shu. Brother Wang Shun-fah still has a business in Hu-Shu. Brother Lou Feng-ming went to Fu-Yang once. His wife was seriously sick at one time, but she has now recovered. Chang Wen-jih is my brother-in-law. According to Brother Hwang Tsai-ching, he is definitely saved. His family still lives in the same place. God's grace has been great in me. Although I am not good, He has treated me with grace and enabled me to stand firm in Hangchow."</p>
