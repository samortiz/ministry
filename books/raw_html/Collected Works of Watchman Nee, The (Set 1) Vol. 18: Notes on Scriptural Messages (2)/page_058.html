<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE OTHER ASPECT<br>OF THE TRESPASS OFFERING</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 42</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Lev. 6:1-7</H1><P>Today we want to read carefully before God this portion of the Scripture which talks about the trespass offering. The trespass offering is very important in the Bible. Altogether there are five offerings spoken of in Leviticus 1â€”6. These five offerings typify the five aspects of our Lord Jesus' offering of Himself as an offering. Jesus Christ is one offering; however, viewed from our side, this offering has five aspects. Our view can only be complete with these five aspects. If only one is used to typify the Lord, our view will not be complete. There need to be five offerings to typify the Lord. Therefore, these five offerings are very important.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RELATIONSHIP<br>BETWEEN THE TRESPASS OFFERING<br>AND THE OTHER FOUR OFFERINGS</H2><P>What relationship does the trespass offering have with the other four offerings? In order to answer this, we need to consider the four offerings. Then we will talk about the trespass offering. We need to understand the offerings one by one. In this way we will not over-emphasize the trespass offering.</P><P>First, the burnt offering typifies our Lord's offering His whole being to God. This is very important. This offering is not for the propitiation of sin. However, if the Lord did not offer Himself absolutely to God, He could not propitiate our sins.</P><P>Second, the meal offering, which has no blood, typifies the Lord's living; His living in this world was very pure. Flour can be food for man. Our Lord lived before God in a very pure and fine way. This offering emphasizes His perfection. We can say that He was a perfect man.</P><P>Third, the peace offering signifies that the Lord has accomplished peace between God and man. This not only enabled God to be at peace with us, but it also enabled us to be at peace with God.</P><P>Fourth, the sin offering typifies the Lord's propitiation of our sin, enabling us to be reconciled with God. The Lord propitiated our sin so that we could be saved through His blood.</P><P>The fifth offering is the trespass offering. Some may ask what the difference between the sin and trespass offering is. Sin denotes our sin generally; this is the sin before God. Trespasses are the individual sins we commit day by day; they can be counted. We may say that the sin offering is for all of our sins, the totality of sin, while the trespass offering is for our particular sins which can be counted.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TWO PARTS OF THE TRESPASS OFFERING</H2><P>The trespass offering is divided into two parts. One part is recorded in Leviticus 5; the other part is recorded in Leviticus 6. Chapter five talks about what we must do before God day by day when we sin against Him. Chapter six talks about what we must do before man day by day when we sin against man. I am not going to speak on chapter five. Rather, I want to speak on chapter six, that is, on what we must do if we sin against man in certain areas after we were saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TRESPASS OFFERING</H2><P>I am not saying that this offering can bring salvation to a man. After we have the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, and the sin offering, we are saved and have life. The trespass offering mentioned in chapters five and six speaks of our fellowship with God. Receiving life is one thing; having fellowship with God is another. When you believe that Christ died for you and receive the Lord as your Savior, you have life. But this does not mean that from now on you will never lose your fellowship with God. The minute you were saved, you began to have fellowship with God. After you are saved, however, if you sin again and do not repent, you will lose your fellowship with God. You will feel that God is very far from you and that it is very difficult to pray and very hard to read the Bible. This does not mean that you have become unsaved again. Once a person believes, he is saved; this can never be changed. But his fellowship with God may change. If you have sinned and do not deal with it, you will lose your fellowship with Him. Many people are saved, but they cannot freely pray, and they find it difficult to read the Bible. The reason may be that their daily trespasses have not been dealt with properly.</P><P>At the time we were saved, we surely had a kind of joy; it was the joy of salvation. We wished that we could tell everyone about our salvation. How joyful we were. Unfortunately, this joy did not last very long. How was this joy lost? Perhaps we said some harsh words and offended someone. We became ashamed to face God. We sinned against man, but lost our joy. We sinned against man, but we lost our fellowship with God.</P><P>Today we must learn the lesson that a person should not remain merely saved, but should learn day by day to pray well, read the Bible well, testify well, and maintain a living fellowship with God. A man may lose his fellowship, but he can never lose his salvation. "They shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father's hand" (John 10:28-29). This is what our Lord has said. Eternal life can never be lost; life can never be lost. But the one thing that can be lost, perhaps more than ten times a day, is our fellowship with God.</P><P>Suppose a father tells his son to be good and not do certain things. If the son opens the cabinet, steals a piece of candy, and eats it, or if he soils his clothes, or if he plays with bad children, he will be somewhat afraid to see his father when he hears him calling. They are still father and son. But since he has done something which displeases his father, he dares not see his father right away. When he hears his father calling, his little heart jumps because he knows that something has gone wrong between him and his father. He will think that he cannot face his father when his clothes are soiled or his toys are ruined. He dares not see his father's face. But does this mean that he is no longer his father's son? This can never happen. The relationship of the father to the son can never change; it is the fellowship between the father and son that changes. The Father and son relationship that we have with God and the relationship in life can never be lost because of some change in our daily living. However, one thing can be lost: our daily fellowship with God.</P><P>The trespass offering is to bring us back into fellowship with God. The sin offering is to bring a sinner into believing in the Lord Jesus, while the trespass offering is to bring a Christian into fellowship with God. The sin offering removed our sin when we were unbelievers; the trespass offering removes the sins which hinder our daily fellowship with God. One gives us life, and the other gives us fellowship.</P>
