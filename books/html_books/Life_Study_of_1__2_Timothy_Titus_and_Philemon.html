In previous Life-studies we have covered six books written by Paul: Romans, Hebrews, Ephesians, Colossians, Galatians, and Philippians. In these six books the basic and crucial truths concerning Christ and the church are revealed. The other four Epistles written by Paul are 1 and 2 Corinthians and 1 and 2 Thessalonians.<p>Of the fourteen Epistles written by Paul, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Romans, and Hebrews are very basic and may be regarded as a group. First Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon may also be considered a group. We believe that the arrangement of the books in the New Testament is according to the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty. In this sovereign arrangement, the four books of 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon are put together as a group.<p>Perhaps you are wondering how the other four of Paul&#8217;s Epistles-1 and 2 Corinthians and 1 and 2 Thessalonians- relate to the first two groups of writings. The first group, composed of six books, contains the basic revelation concerning Christ and the church, whereas the second group, composed of four books, deals with God&#8217;s economy regarding the church. This group covers the dispensation of God with respect to the church. First and 2 Corinthians strengthen both of these groups of Epistles. In these two books we see some further and richer revelation concerning Christ and the church. On the one hand, in 1 and 2 Corinthians we have further riches of Christ; on the other hand, these books strengthen the economy of God concerning the church. Then what about 1 and 2 Thessalonians? In these Epistles Paul shows us our hope, the hope of glory, that is, the appearing of our dear Lord Jesus Christ.<h2 class=head1>I. THE PURPOSE OF THE FOUR EPISTLES</h2><h2 class=head2>A. First Timothy-to Unveil God&#8217;s Dispensation concerning the Church</h2><p>First Timothy unveils to us God&#8217;s dispensation concerning the church. It is not easy to present such a brief yet all-inclusive summary of this book. Only when we dig into the depths of this Epistle do we realize that this is the subject. If we get into the depths of this book, we shall see that it can be summarized as a book which speaks of God&#8217;s dispensation, His New Testament economy, concerning the church.<p>In 1:4 Paul uses the marvelous term &#8220;God&#8217;s dispensation.&#8221; This dispensation is an economical administration. Hence, it refers to God&#8217;s economy. God&#8217;s economy is revealed in four expressions found in 1 Timothy 3: Great is the mystery of godliness; God was manifested in the flesh; the church is the house of the living God; the church is the pillar and base of the truth. God&#8217;s dispensation is related to the great mystery of godliness, to the manifestation of God in the flesh, and to the church as both the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth. When God&#8217;s dispensation is put together with these four matters, we see that 1 Timothy does in fact reveal God&#8217;s economy concerning the church.<h2 class=head2>B. Second Timothy-to Inoculate the Church against the Decline</h2><p>The purpose of 2 Timothy is to inoculate the church against the decline. On the one hand, an inoculation is positive; on the other hand, it is negative, for it indicates that we need to be protected from a disease that could kill us. Paul&#8217;s purpose in writing 2 Timothy was to inoculate the church against decline, degradation, and deterioration.<h2 class=head2>C. Titus-to Maintain the Order of the Church</h2><p>The purpose of the book of Titus is to maintain the order of the church. It was written to assure that a local church would have a proper order.<p>The unveiling of God&#8217;s dispensation concerning the church in 1 Timothy, the inoculation against the decline of the church in 2 Timothy, and the maintaining of the order of the church in Titus are three aspects of one purpose: that is, to preserve the church as the proper expression of the Triune God, as symbolized by the golden lampstands in the ultimate portion of the divine revelation (Rev. 1:12, 20). For the accomplishment of this purpose, the following basic and crucial things are stressed repeatedly in these three books:<p class=otl1>1)<p class=otl1t>The faith, the contents of the complete gospel according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy; hence, it is objective, as mentioned in 1 Timothy 1:19; 2:7; 3:9; 4:1, 6; 5:8; 6:10, 12, 21; 2 Timothy 2:18; 3:8; 4:7; Titus 1:13.<p class=otl1>2)<p class=otl1t>The truth, the reality of the contents of the faith, as mentioned in 1 Timothy 2:4, 7; 3:15; 4:3; 6:5; 2 Timothy 2:15, 18, 25; 3:7, 8; 4:4; Titus 1:1, 14.<p class=otl1>3)<p class=otl1t>Healthy teaching, in 1 Timothy 1:10; 2 Timothy 4:3; Titus 1:9; 2:1; healthy words, in 1 Timothy 6:3; 2 Timothy 1:13; healthy speech, in Titus 2:8; healthy in the faith and in faith, in Titus 1:13; 2:2. All these are related to the condition of life.<p class=otl1>4)<p class=otl1t>Life, the eternal life of God, in 1 Timothy 1:16; 6:12, 19; 2 Timothy 1:1, 10; Titus 1:2; 3:7.<p class=otl1>5)<p class=otl1t>Godliness, a living that is the expression of God, as mentioned in 1 Timothy 2:2, 10 (godly); 3:16; 4:7, 8; 5:4; 6:3, 5, 6, 11; 2 Timothy 3:5, 12 (godly); Titus 1:1; 2:12 (godly). The opposite, ungodliness, is mentioned in 1 Timothy 1:9 (ungodly); 2 Timothy 2:16; Titus 2:12.<p class=otl1>6)<p class=otl1t>Faith, our act of believing in the gospel, in God, and in His word and deed; hence, it is subjective, as mentioned in 1 Timothy 1:2, 4, 5, 14, 19; 2:15; 3:13; 4:12; 6:11; 2 Timothy 1:5, 13; 2:22; 3:10, 15; Titus 1:1, 4; 2:2; 3:15.<p class=otl1>7)<p class=otl1t>Conscience, the leading part of our spirit, which justifies or condemns our relationships with God and with man, as mentioned in 1 Timothy 1:5, 19; 3:9; 4:2; 2 Timothy 1:3; Titus 1:15.<p>The faith equals the economy, the household administration, the dispensation, of God. The truth is the contents, the reality, of the faith according to God&#8217;s economy. Healthy teachings, healthy words, and healthy speech are the ministry of the truth, ministering to people the reality of the divine truths. Eternal life is the means and power to carry out the divine realities of the faith. Godliness is a living that expresses the divine reality, an expression of God in all His riches. Faith (subjective) is the response to the truth of the faith (objective), receiving and participating in the divine realities. Conscience is a test and check to preserve us in the faith.<h2 class=head2>D. Philemon-an Illustration of the Believers&#8217; Equal Status in the New Man</h2><p>Philemon does not seem to be related to 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus. According to many Bible teachers, these three books are called pastoral Epistles, books that give instructions on how to pastor, shepherd, a church. Because the term pastoral as applied to these books is too shallow, I prefer not to use it. I admit, however, that there is an element of pastoring, of shepherding, in these books. But it is altogether too superficial to speak of them as pastoral Epistles. If we look into the depths of these books and realize that they speak respectively of God&#8217;s dispensation concerning the church, inoculation against the decline of the church, and the maintenance of the order of the church, we shall realize that Philemon should be put together with them.<p>In Philemon we have an illustration of the believers&#8217; equal status in the new man. Although Philemon was a master, and Onesimus was a slave, they shared an equal status in the new man. As we shall see, Onesimus ran away from his master, but was saved through Paul in prison. Then Paul sent him back to Philemon not as a slave, but as a dear brother in Christ. Therefore, here we see an illustration of the equal status of all believers in the new man. If we put this Epistle together with 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, we shall know how to have a proper local church life.<p>The title of this message is &#8220;God&#8217;s Dispensation versus Differing Teachings.&#8221; Very few Bible readers have seen this point in chapter one of 1 Timothy. But in this chapter there is the matter that God&#8217;s dispensation is versus differing teachings. What is the focus of God&#8217;s revelation, the focal point of God&#8217;s economy, His dispensation? God&#8217;s economy is to dispense Himself in Christ through the Spirit into His chosen people so that they may have the divine life and nature to be Christ&#8217;s Body, the new man, the church, to express God in the universe. This is the crucial point.<p>The problem among Christians throughout the centuries has always been the differing teachings versus God&#8217;s revelation. Some may argue that when they teach people to be immersed, they teach according to God&#8217;s revelation. Although this may be true, immersion is not the main point of the divine revelation. The crucial point is not related to immersion, to whether we use wine or grape juice at the Lord&#8217;s table, or to whether we believe in a rapture that is pretribulation, post-tribulation, or mid-tribulation. Neither is the focal point of God&#8217;s economy the huge image in Daniel 2 or the beasts in Revelation 13. How pitiful that Christians have argued over the type of water used in baptism, but have altogether neglected God&#8217;s dispensation! It is vital for us to see that God&#8217;s economy is God&#8217;s dispensing of Himself as the wonderful Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-into His chosen ones so that, having His very life and nature, they may become His many sons, the members of Christ, to manifest Him in the universe. This is the central revelation in the Scriptures; it is what the Bible speaks of as God&#8217;s dispensation.<p>There were some during Paul&#8217;s time who were teaching differently, just as there are today. They were teaching things that were versus God&#8217;s dispensation. However, Peter, John, James, Paul, and the rest of the apostles preached the same thing-Christ and the church. Although the apostles were many, their ministry was one. We should never think that Peter, John, James, and Paul taught differently from one another. No, they all taught Christ and the church.<p>In the four Gospels one Person is revealed through four biographies. These biographies are written from different angles, but they do not reveal more than one Person. All four reveal the same Person, the Lord Jesus Christ. Because this wonderful Person has a Body, beginning with Acts and continuing through to the end of the New Testament, we see the Body of this Person. Again I say, all the apostles preached and taught the same thing, Christ and the church.<p>Because the apostles taught and preached Christ and the church, they all had one ministry. For this reason, Paul could say, &#8220;We have this ministry&#8221; (2 Cor. 4:1). The apostles were many, but they had received just one ministry. In chapter one of Acts there is a further indication that all the apostles were in one and the same ministry (v. 17). Any so-called ministry that is different from the ministry of Paul and the other apostles is actually not a ministry at all; it is a different teaching. According to the New Testament, the one ministry is to minister Christ to God&#8217;s chosen people so that the church may be formed. This is God&#8217;s economy, and it is versus all manner of differing teachings. God&#8217;s economy certainly is not a matter of head covering, foot-washing, and regulations about eating or the keeping of days. God&#8217;s dispensation is versus these differing teachings.<h2 class=head1>II. INTRODUCTION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Paul, an Apostle of Christ Jesus</h2><p>Paul opens 1 Timothy with the words, &#8220;Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, according to the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope.&#8221; It was according to the command of God and of Christ that Paul became an apostle. In his earlier Epistles, he told us that he was an apostle through the will of God (1 Cor. 1:1; 2 Cor. 1:1; Eph. 1:1; Col. 1:1). The command of God is a definite expression, a further direction, of the will of God.<p>God our Savior (1 Tim. 1:1; 4:10; Titus 2:13) and our Savior God (1 Tim. 2:3; Titus 1:3; 2:10; 3:4) are titles particularly ascribed to God in these three books, which take God&#8217;s salvation as a strong base for the teachings concerning God&#8217;s New Testament economy (1:15-16; 2:4-6; 2 Tim. 1:9-10; 2:10; 3:15; Titus 2:14; 3:5-7). It was according to the command of such a saving God, a Savior God, not according to the command of the law-giving God, a demanding God, that Paul became an apostle.<p>In 1:1 Paul speaks of &#8220;Christ Jesus our hope.&#8221; Christ Jesus is not only God&#8217;s Anointed (Christ) to be our Savior (Jesus) that we may be saved to gain the eternal life of God, but also our hope to bring us into the full blessing and enjoyment of this eternal life. The hope of eternal life revealed in Titus 1:2 as the base and condition of Paul&#8217;s apostleship, and the blessed hope revealed in Titus 2:13, which is the appearing we are waiting for of the glory of the great God and our Savior, are all wrapped up with the Person of God&#8217;s Messiah, our Savior. Hence, He Himself is our hope, the hope of glory (Col. 1:27). It was according to the command not only of our Savior God, but also of the One Who has saved us with eternal life and will bring us into the glory of this life, that Paul became an apostle. His command is of the eternal life and is to be fulfilled by the eternal life, in contrast to the command of the law-giving God, which was of letters and which was to be fulfilled by human effort, without the supply of eternal life.<h2 class=head2>B. To Timothy, Genuine Child in Faith</h2><p>In verse 2 Paul continues his word of introduction: &#8220;To Timothy, genuine child in faith: grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.&#8221; In Greek the name Timothy is timotheos, composed of time, meaning honor, and theos, meaning God. Thus, it means to honor God. Timothy became a genuine child of Paul, not by natural birth, but in faith, that is, in the sphere and element of faith; not naturally, but spiritually.<h2 class=head1>III. GOD&#8217;S DISPENSATION VERSUS DIFFERING TEACHINGS</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Differing Teachings</h2><p>In verse 3 Paul says, &#8220;Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently.&#8221; Paul&#8217;s word about &#8220;going into Macedonia&#8221; must refer to his travels after his liberation from the first imprisonment in Rome. Probably he wrote this Epistle from Macedonia, which is made up of what is today northern Greece and southern Bulgaria.<p>In verse 3 Paul refers to &#8220;certain ones.&#8221; These were dissenting ones, as mentioned in verse 6 and in Galatians 1:7; 2:12.<p>To teach differently was to teach myths, unending genealogies (v. 4), and the law (vv. 7-8), all of which were vain talking (v. 6) and differed from the apostles&#8217; teaching centered upon Christ and the church.<p>Paul&#8217;s Epistles are the completion of the divine revelation concerning God&#8217;s eternal purpose and economy (Col. 1:25). His ministry completes the revelation concerning the all-inclusive Christ and His universal Body, the church as His fullness to express Him. Concerning the church as the Body of Christ, there are two sides: life and practice. From Romans through 2 Thessalonians, a full revelation is given concerning the life of the church, including its nature, responsibility, and function. Now, from 1 Timothy through Philemon, a detailed revelation concerning the practice of the church is presented. This pertains to the administration and shepherding of a local church. For this the first thing needed is to terminate the differing teachings of the dissenters, which distract the saints from the central line and ultimate goal of God&#8217;s New Testament economy (vv. 4-6). The differing teachings in 1:3-4, 6-7; 6:3-5, 20-21, and the heresies in 4:1-3, are the seed, the source, of the church&#8217;s decline, degradation, and deterioration dealt with in the second book.<h2 class=head3>1. Myths</h2><p>In verse 4 Paul continues, &#8220;Nor to occupy themselves with myths and unending genealogies, which give occasion for questionings rather than God&#8217;s dispensation which is in faith.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;myths&#8221; in this verse is muthos. The same word is translated tales in 4:7 and fables in 2 Timothy 4:4. It refers to words, speeches, and conversations concerning such things as rumors, reports, stories (true or false), and fictions. It might include Jewish stories of miracles and rabbinical fabrications. They were the profane and old-womanish tales (4:7) and Jewish myths (Titus 1:14). The Jewish myths may have been the seed of Gnostic mythologies.<h2 class=head3>2. Unending Genealogies</h2><p>The &#8220;unending genealogies&#8221; mentioned in this verse probably refer to Old Testament genealogies adorned with fables (Titus 3:9).<h2 class=head3>3. Giving Occasion for Questions</h2><p>The myths and unending genealogies give occasion for questionings and vain talking rather than God&#8217;s dispensation.<h2 class=head3>4. Vain Talking</h2><p>The myths and the unending genealogies give rise to vain talking and cause people to misaim from the goal of the charge of love. In verses 5 and 6 Paul says, &#8220;But the goal of the charge is love out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and unfeigned faith; from which things some, having misaimed, have turned aside to vain talking.&#8221; The charge in verse 5 refers to the charge mentioned in verse 3. The differing teachings of the dissenting ones in verse 3 caused envy and discord among the believers. Such envy and discord were contrary to love, the goal of the apostle&#8217;s charge. To carry out the apostle&#8217;s charge, love, which is out of a pure heart, a good conscience, and unfeigned faith, is needed.<p>A pure heart is a single heart without mixture, seeking the Lord only and taking the Lord as the unique goal. A good conscience is a conscience without offense (Acts 24:16). Unfeigned faith, connected with faith in verse 4, is faith without pretense or hypocrisy, that purifies the heart (Acts 15:9) and works through love (Gal. 5:6). In order to deal with the differing teachings when the trend of the church is toward decline, all these attributes are required. They are necessary if we are to have a pure, true, and genuine love.<h2 class=head3>5. The Law</h2><p>In verse 7 Paul refers to law teachers: &#8220;Desiring to be law teachers, understanding neither what they are saying, nor concerning what they confidently affirm.&#8221; Law teachers, teaching people what to do and what not to do, are different from the minister of Christ (4:6), who ministers His riches to others. According to this verse, those who desire to be law teachers confidently affirm certain things. The Greek for confidently can also be rendered strongly or emphatically. The same word is used in Titus 3:8.<p>According to verses 8 through 10, the law is good if used lawfully. Paul says that the &#8220;law is not enacted for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for smiters of fathers and smiters of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and if there be any other thing opposed to healthy teaching.&#8221;<p>The words &#8220;healthy teaching&#8221; imply the matter of life. Anything that is healthy refers to the health of life. The sound teaching of the apostles, which is according to the gospel of the glory of God, ministers healthy teaching as the supply of life to people, either nourishing them or healing them. In contrast, the differing teachings of the dissenting ones in verse 3 sow the seeds of death and poison into others. Any teaching that distracts people from the center and goal of God&#8217;s New Testament economy is not healthy.<h2 class=head2>B. God&#8217;s Dispensation</h2><p>In Greek the words &#8220;God&#8217;s dispensation&#8221; in 1:4 also mean God&#8217;s household economy (Eph. 1:10; 3:9). This is God&#8217;s household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people, that He may have a house, a household, to express Himself, which household is the church, the Body of Christ (1 Tim. 3:15). The apostle&#8217;s ministry was centered upon this economy of God (Col. 1:25; 1 Cor. 9:17), whereas the differing teachings of the dissenting ones were used by God&#8217;s enemy to distract His people from this. This divine economy must be made fully clear to the saints in the administration and shepherding of a local church.<p>My burden is altogether centered on God&#8217;s economy. This has been my burden for more than forty years. During the years I have been in this country, I have not taught anything other than God&#8217;s dispensation.<h2 class=head3>1. God&#8217;s Household Economy</h2><p>God&#8217;s dispensation is His household economy. According to the Bible, God does not first want to have a kingdom. Rather, He first wants a house, a family. Once He has a family, His family will spontaneously become His kingdom. If He is not able to secure a family, a household, a house, He will not be able to have a kingdom. Thus, God&#8217;s dispensation is first a matter of His household economy, or family economy.<h2 class=head3>2. God&#8217;s Household Administration</h2><p>Second, God&#8217;s dispensation is His household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He might have a house, a household, the church, the Body of Christ, to express Himself.<h2 class=head3>3. The Focus of the Apostle Paul&#8217;s Ministry</h2><p>God&#8217;s dispensation was the focus of the Apostle Paul&#8217;s ministry (Col. 1:25; 1 Cor. 9:17).<h2 class=head3>4. In Faith</h2><p>In verse 4 Paul tells us that God&#8217;s dispensation is in faith. The dispensing of God into us is altogether by faith. The dispensation of God is a matter in faith, that is, in the sphere and element of faith, in God through Christ. Faith may be in contrast to questionings. God&#8217;s economy to dispense Himself into His chosen people is not in the natural realm, nor in the work of law, but in the spiritual sphere of the new creation through regeneration by faith in Christ (Gal. 3:23-26). By faith we are born of God to be His sons, partaking of His life and nature to express Him. By faith we are put into Christ to become the members of His Body, sharing all that He is for His expression. This is God&#8217;s dispensation according to His New Testament economy, carried out in faith.<p>We need to be deeply impressed with the meaning of faith in the New Testament. We have spoken much about this in our Life-studies of Romans, Hebrews, and Galatians. Faith is firstly God being the Word spoken to us. We have God and then God as the Word spoken. Through the Word of God and by the Spirit of God we are infused with God in Christ. As a result, something rises up within us. This is faith. Faith then works in us to bring us into an organic union with the Triune God. Through this organic union, God is continually transfused and infused into us. As a result, we have the divine life and the divine nature to become God&#8217;s sons, members of Christ, and parts of the new man. As a totality we become the house of God, the Body of Christ, and the new man. This is God&#8217;s dispensation in faith.<h2 class=head3>5. According to the Gospel of the Glory of the Blessed God</h2><p>God&#8217;s dispensation is &#8220;according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God&#8221; (v. 11). Have you heard this expression before? Many have heard of the gospel of grace, the gospel of forgiveness, the gospel of justification, and the gospel of regeneration, but not the gospel of glory. This gospel not only brings good news concerning forgiveness of sins and justification by faith; the gospel of glory is the gospel of God&#8217;s dispensation. Glory is God expressed. Thus, the gospel of glory is the gospel of the expressed God; it is a gospel which expresses God&#8217;s glory.<p>The &#8220;gospel of the glory of the blessed God&#8221; is an excellent expression. It refers to God&#8217;s dispensation mentioned in verse 4. The gospel with which Paul was entrusted is the effulgence of the glory of the blessed God. This gospel, by dispensing God&#8217;s life and nature in Christ into His chosen people, shines forth His glory, in which He is blessed among His people. This is the commission and ministry the apostle received of the Lord (v. 12). This should be commonly taught and preached in a local church.<p>In verse 12 Paul says, &#8220;I give thanks to Him Who empowers me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because He has counted me faithful, appointing me to the ministry.&#8221; The Lord not only appointed the apostle to the ministry and commissioned him with the dispensation of God outwardly, but also empowered him inwardly to carry out His ministry and fulfill His commission. This is altogether a matter of life in the Spirit.<h2 class=head3>6. A Pattern under God&#8217;s Dispensation</h2><p>In 1:13-17 we see a pattern under God&#8217;s dispensation.<h2 class=head4>a. The Foremost Sinner</h2><p>Paul says that he was a foremost sinner (vv. 15-16). He was a blasphemer of God, a persecutor of man, and an insulting, destructive person with respect to the church. In verse 13 he says of himself, &#8220;Who formerly was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insulting destructive person; but I obtained mercy because being ignorant I acted in unbelief.&#8221; A blasphemer is one who blasphemes God, and a persecutor is one who persecutes man. Saul of Tarsus, a strict Pharisee (Acts 22:3; Phil. 3:4-5), could never have blasphemed God. But he had spoken evil of the Lord Jesus. Now he confesses that this was blaspheming. This indicates that he believed in the deity of Christ.<p>Saul of Tarsus persecuted the church in an insulting, destructive way (Acts 22:4; Gal. 1:13, 23), just as the insulting Jews persecuted the Lord Jesus.<p>Paul also says that he was ignorant and acted in unbelief. To be ignorant means to be in darkness, and unbelief comes from blindness. Saul of Tarsus was in darkness and acted in blindness when he opposed God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<h2 class=head4>b. Having Obtained Mercy</h2><p>In verse 13 Paul testifies that he obtained mercy. Saul, a blasphemer and persecutor, first obtained mercy and then received grace (v. 14). Mercy reaches farther to the unworthy one than grace. Because Paul was a blasphemer of God and a persecutor of man, God&#8217;s mercy reached him first rather than the Lord&#8217;s grace.<h2 class=head4>c. Favored with the Lord&#8217;s Grace</h2><p>Verse 14 continues, &#8220;And the grace of our Lord superabounded with faith and love in Christ Jesus.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s grace, following God&#8217;s mercy, visited Saul of Tarsus and not only abounded, but superabounded in him with faith and love in Christ. Faith and love are the product of the Lord&#8217;s grace. Mercy and grace come to us from the Lord; faith and love return to the Lord from us. This is a spiritual traffic between the Lord and us. Faith is for us to receive the Lord (John 1:12), and love is for us to enjoy the Lord whom we have received (John 14:21, 23; 21:15-17).<h2 class=head4>d. Saved by Christ Jesus</h2><p>In verse 15 Paul declares, &#8220;Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.&#8221; Christ came into the world to be our Savior by incarnation (John 1:14). He was God incarnated that He may save us through His death and resurrection in His human body. This should be constantly announced as the gospel, the glad tidings, in a local church.<h2 class=head4>e. Believing on Christ unto Eternal Life</h2><p>In verse 16 Paul speaks of believing on Christ unto eternal life. The uncreated life of God is the ultimate gift and topmost blessing given by God to those who believe on Christ.<h2 class=head4>f. To Display All the Longsuffering of Christ and to Be a Pattern to All the Believers</h2><p>In verse 16 Paul says, &#8220;But because of this I obtained mercy, that in me, the foremost, Jesus Christ might display all His longsuffering for a pattern to them who are about to believe on Him unto eternal life.&#8221; Saul of Tarsus as the foremost among sinners became a pattern to sinners, who can be visited by God&#8217;s mercy and saved by the Lord&#8217;s grace.<h2 class=head3>7. Honor and Glory to the King of the Ages</h2><p>In verse 17 Paul says, &#8220;Now to the King of the ages, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory unto the ages of the ages, Amen!&#8221; This word needs to be understood in relation to the decline of the church. When Paul was in prison, the churches began to decline, and the situation was very disappointing. Many were discouraged. Even some of Paul&#8217;s co-workers left him. But he had a strong faith with an absolute assurance that the very God in whom he believed, the One who had entrusted him with the gospel of glory, is the King of the ages. He never changes. No earthly king can be called the King of the ages. Caesar was a temporary ruler, but how different is our God! The God whom Paul served truly is the King of the ages. This means that He is King of eternity. He never changes; He always remains the same.<p>Everything except God is corruptible. The church may decline, deteriorate, and become degraded, but God is incorruptible. Paul also says that God is invisible. God is powerful, everlasting, incorruptible, and also invisible. We cannot see Him. Certain terms ascribed to God in this verse are used only in this book. With Paul, we need to use these words to praise God. I would encourage someone to write a suitable melody for the singing of this verse. In a living, released way, we need to declare, &#8220;Now to the King of the ages, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory unto the ages of the ages, Amen!&#8221;<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO</h1><h1 class=title>FAITH AND A GOOD CONSCIENCE NEEDED FOR THE KEEPING OF THE FAITH</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 1:18-20</h1><p>In the foregoing message we saw from 1:1-17 that God&#8217;s dispensation is versus differing teachings. In this message we shall consider 1:18-20, verses which indicate that faith and a good conscience are needed for the keeping of the faith.<h2 class=head1>I. A CHARGE COMMITTED BY THE APOSTLE TO HIS CHILD TIMOTHY</h2><p>In 1:18 Paul says, &#8220;This charge I commit to you, child Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that in them you might war the good warfare.&#8221; To what charge is Paul referring here? In answering this question we must observe the principle that in understanding a sentence, a phrase, or even a word of the Bible, we need to consider the context, not only of the paragraph in which the verse is found, but sometimes of the entire book or even of the whole Bible. With this principle as our basis, we need to consider Paul&#8217;s use of the word charge in verse 18 in the context of the chapter as a whole. The charge here covers the main points presented in the previous seventeen verses. On the positive side, the main point of these verses is God&#8217;s dispensation; on the negative side, it is the differing teachings. Hence, the charge given by the apostle to his spiritual son concerns the dispensation of God positively and the differing teachings negatively.<h2 class=head2>A. According to the Prophecies Previously Made concerning Timothy</h2><p>In verse 18 Paul says that he committed the charge to Timothy &#8220;according to the prophecies previously made&#8221; concerning him. It may be that some prophetic intimations were made concerning Timothy when he was admitted into the ministry (Acts 16:1-3). Perhaps the elders in the church which recommended Timothy to Paul laid hands on him. At that time prophecies might have been spoken concerning him.<h2 class=head2>B. To War the Good Warfare</h2><p>Speaking of these prophecies, Paul tells Timothy, &#8220;In them you might war the good warfare.&#8221; To war the good warfare is to war against the differing teachings of the dissenters and to carry out God&#8217;s dispensation (v. 4) according to the apostle&#8217;s ministry concerning the gospel of grace and eternal life for the glory of the blessed God (vv. 11-16).<h2 class=head2>C. In the Prophecies</h2><p>Paul charged Timothy to war the good warfare in the prophecies. This means in the sphere, support, and confirmation of the prophecies.<p>At this point we need to see something concerning the grouping and the timing of Paul&#8217;s Epistles. Although Philemon is grouped with 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, it was actually written earlier, during Paul&#8217;s first imprisonment. Paul was imprisoned the first time because of the Jews, not because of persecution carried out by the Roman Empire. We know from Acts that Paul appealed to Caesar and this caused him to be sent to Rome, where he was imprisoned. During his first imprisonment, Paul wrote four books: Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon. Thus, according to the time it was written, Philemon should be grouped with Colossians, Philippians, and Ephesians; however, in content it should be grouped, not with these Epistles, but with 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus. Philemon was written not long before Paul&#8217;s release from prison. In the book of Philippians he expressed his expectation that soon he would be released and visit the churches. Not long afterward, Paul&#8217;s expectation was fulfilled. Having been released, he traveled to Ephesus, where Timothy was, and from Ephesus he went into Macedonia. From Macedonia Paul wrote the first Epistle to Timothy. Then from Macedonia he went to Nicopolis, where he wrote the Epistle to Titus. First Timothy and Titus, therefore, were written after Paul&#8217;s release from his first imprisonment. After approximately a year, Caesar Nero suddenly began to persecute Christians. At that time, Paul was accused of being the outstanding leader among the Christians. He was arrested and imprisoned again, this time due to Nero&#8217;s persecution. From prison, he wrote the second Epistle to Timothy. In chapter four he indicates to his dear child Timothy that he was ready to depart, to be martyred, to be poured out as a drink offering.<p>During Paul&#8217;s first imprisonment, the churches were tested. This test showed that decline and degradation had set in. This decline was altogether due to differing teachings, teachings that were different from the ministry. This was the reason Paul charged Timothy to war a good warfare.<p>Throughout the centuries, the degradation and decline of the church has had one source: teachings which differ from the ministry of the apostles. In Acts 2:42 we see that at the beginning of the church life, the believers continued in the teachings of the apostles. These teachings were the ministry. What the apostles taught and preached was nothing other than Christ and the church. They preached a Christ who had been incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended in order that, as resurrection life, He might be imparted into His believers to produce the church. This is the focal point of the teaching of the apostles, and it is crucial for us to see it. No doubt, in the Bible there are teachings concerning many things. However, the focus of the ministry of the apostles was the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, ascended, and glorified Christ to be our Savior, our life, and everything to us so that we may become His Body, the church. This is the vital focus of the New Testament revelation, and this is God&#8217;s economy.<p>We need to contact the Word and receive God by the Spirit through the Word. Then we shall have faith. By coming to the Word, we are infused with God, and spontaneously faith operates within us to bring us into an organic union with God. The more we enjoy God&#8217;s infusion, the more we become one with Him. However, this vital matter has been lost for centuries. Knowing the importance of this, Paul charged Timothy to fight a good fight, to war a good warfare.<p>On the one hand, Timothy was to war against the differing teachings of the dissenters. On the other hand, he was to carry out God&#8217;s dispensation according to the apostle&#8217;s ministry. If we wish to carry out God&#8217;s dispensation, we must do it not according to the teachings of traditional Christianity nor according to systematic theology, but according to the apostle&#8217;s ministry.<p>Furthermore, God&#8217;s dispensation concerns the gospel of grace and eternal life. These are two basic elements in the gospel. This gospel is for the glory of the blessed God; it is for the expression, the manifestation, of the blessed God.<p>When Paul was in prison the first time, dissenters rose up to teach differently. These differing teachings were the seed of the church&#8217;s decline. Paul realized the situation even while he was in prison. We know this by the contents of books such as Colossians and Philippians. Especially in Colossians we see that certain isms-Judaism, Gnosticism, asceticism- had crept into the church life. These differing teachings caused dissension and decline. Thus, Paul charged his faithful co-worker to fight the good fight against the differing teachings and fight for God&#8217;s dispensation.<p>Today we also must be on the alert for differing teachings. Throughout the centuries, the church has been poisoned and corrupted by such teachings. If we are not on guard, differing teachings may also cause damage to the Lord&#8217;s recovery. In the past we have seen the damage caused by differing teachings propagated in a subtle, hidden way. This has helped the leading ones in many churches to learn the important lesson of being watchful for differing teachings. We must not allow any differing teachings to come into the Lord&#8217;s recovery. The recovery is strictly for the carrying on of the ministry. By this I do not mean my ministry, but the ministry of the apostles, which began with Peter and is still being carried on today. All true apostles teach and preach the same thing, even the one thing-God&#8217;s New Testament economy. The focus of our preaching and teaching is Christ and the church. To teach and preach God&#8217;s economy concerning Christ and the church is to war a good warfare.<h2 class=head1>II. HOLDING FAITH AND A GOOD CONSCIENCE</h2><p>In verse 19 Paul continues, &#8220;Holding faith and a good conscience, which some thrusting away have become shipwrecked regarding the faith.&#8221; This verse tells us how to war the good warfare. In order to war a good warfare, we must hold faith and a good conscience.<h2 class=head2>A. Faith, Our Believing Act</h2><p>The word faith in the expression &#8220;holding faith&#8221; refers to our believing act; hence, it denotes subjective faith. As we have indicated, this faith rises up in us when we come to the Word and are infused with God through the Word and by the Spirit. The subjective faith moves within us to bring about an organic union between us and the Triune God. In this union we receive the divine life and nature to become God&#8217;s many sons and the many members of the Body of Christ, the new man, to be the corporate expression of the Triune God for eternity. We must war the good warfare by this kind of faith, not by trying to keep the law.<h2 class=head2>B. A Good Conscience</h2><p>Along with faith, we also need a good conscience, a conscience without offense (Acts 24:16). A good conscience is a safeguard of Christian faith and life. Faith and a good conscience go together. Whenever there is an offense in our conscience, there will be a leakage, and our faith will leak away. A good conscience accompanying faith is needed for warring the good warfare against the dissenting teachings in a troubled local church.<h2 class=head2>C. Shipwrecked</h2><p>It is difficult to say whether the relative pronoun &#8220;which&#8221; in verse 19 refers just to conscience or to both faith and conscience. It may refer to both, since subjective faith is closely related to the conscience. As we have pointed out, if we do not have a good conscience, we cannot have living faith. Likewise, if we do not have a living faith, we cannot have a good conscience. Faith and a good conscience can be compared to a married couple: faith is like a husband, and conscience is like a wife. Since subjective faith and a good conscience go together, I prefer to regard the relative pronoun here as having both faith and conscience as the antecedent. Faith comes from our contact with God and brings us into the organic union with God; conscience is the organ touched by God after we contact Him by faith.<p>By thrusting away faith and a good conscience, some &#8220;have become shipwrecked regarding the faith.&#8221; This shows us the seriousness of thrusting away a good conscience. To keep faith and a good conscience is a safeguard for our Christian faith and life. The word shipwrecked implies that the Christian life and the church life are like a ship sailing on a stormy sea, needing to be safeguarded by faith and a good conscience.<p>Those who thrust away faith and a good conscience become shipwrecked regarding the faith. In this verse Paul speaks both of subjective faith, our act of believing, and of objective faith, those things in which we believe. In speaking of those who are shipwrecked regarding the faith, Paul has in mind the objective faith, the contents of the complete gospel according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<p>In verse 20 Paul goes on to name two of those who have become shipwrecked regarding the faith: &#8220;Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan that they may be disciplined not to blaspheme.&#8221; Hymenaeus was a heretical teacher (2 Tim. 2:17), and Alexander was an opposer, an attacker, of the apostle (2 Tim. 4:14-15).<p>It is worthy of note that here Paul mentions names. Being more careful or &#8220;spiritual&#8221; or &#8220;heavenly&#8221; than Paul, we may not be willing to mention names under any circumstances. God took the lead to mention the name of His enemy- Satan. God has never said, &#8220;My people, I have an enemy. But because I am so merciful, patient, and all-embracing, I don&#8217;t want to expose him or mention his name, in hope that one day he will repent.&#8221; As God has singled out the name of His enemy, Paul mentioned the names of Hymenaeus and Alexander.<p>Furthermore, Paul does not tell us in verse 20 that he has been praying for Hymenaeus and Alexander. He does not charge Timothy, &#8220;Timothy, learn of me to pray for those who injure you as I have been praying for Hymenaeus and Alexander.&#8221; On the contrary, in 2 Timothy 4:14 Paul says, &#8220;Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to me; the Lord will repay him according to his works.&#8221;<p>Paul tells Timothy that he has delivered Hymenaeus and Alexander to Satan &#8220;that they may be disciplined not to blaspheme.&#8221; How utterly different this is from saying that he committed them to the Lord&#8217;s gracious hand that they may receive His mercy. Paul expected Satan to work for him to discipline Hymenaeus and Alexander.<p>First Timothy 1:20 is a most unusual verse dealing with a negative matter. Two people are named not by a backslidden brother but by the leading apostle. Furthermore, they are delivered not to God, nor to the church, nor to a spiritual person, but to Satan.<p>Paul delivered Hymenaeus and Alexander to Satan &#8220;that they may be disciplined not to blaspheme.&#8221; Paul does not say &#8220;punished&#8221;; rather, he speaks of being disciplined. Discipline is somewhat different from punishment. When parents deal with their children, they may tell them that they are punishing them. However, that is not actually punishment; it is loving discipline. The discipline in verse 20 may refer to the destruction of the physical body (see 1 Cor. 5:5).<p>Through the carrying out of a certain discipline Hymenaeus and Alexander would learn not to blaspheme God, slander God&#8217;s economy, nor damage the apostle&#8217;s ministry. To deliver persons like Hymenaeus and Alexander to Satan is to exercise the authority that the Lord has given to the apostle and the church (Matt. 16:19; 18:18) for the administration of the church against Satan&#8217;s evil plot.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE THREE</h1><h1 class=title>PRAYER TO CARRY OUT GOD&#8217;S DESIRE FOR MAN&#8217;S SALVATION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 2:1-7</h1><h2 class=head1>A PROPER PRAYER LIFE FOR A PROPER CHURCH LIFE</h2><p>In the first chapter of 1 Timothy Paul lays a good foundation to speak of the church life in a positive way. In 2:1 he goes on to say, &#8220;I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men.&#8221; If we would have a proper church life, we must first have a prayer life. The leading ones, those who minister the Word in the church, should take the lead to have such a prayer life. A prayer ministry is the prerequisite for the administration and shepherding of a local church. Thus, Paul exhorts Timothy that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men. This is the first word concerning the positive aspect of the church life Paul gives after speaking of God&#8217;s economy and after charging Timothy to war the good warfare for God&#8217;s economy. Timothy had to take the lead to have a prayer life.<p>A prerequisite for having a proper church life in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today is to have a prayer life. A proper church is a praying church. A church that is without prayer is pitiful. Prayerlessness is a sin. All in the Lord&#8217;s recovery must be prayerful and stand against the sin of prayerlessness. The elders in the churches must take up Paul&#8217;s charge to &#8220;first of all&#8221; pray.<p>Of the fourteen Epistles written by Paul, ten were written to churches and four to individuals. Romans was written to all the believers in Rome, and Hebrews was written not to individuals, but to believing Hebrews addressed corporately. Ephesians, Philippians, Galatians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and 1 and 2 Thessalonians were all written to churches. However, the four Epistles of 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon were written to individuals. Some may think that these Epistles are not related to us because they were written to individuals. However, we should be today&#8217;s Timothy, Titus, and Philemon. In particular, each individual saint needs to be a Timothy.<p>If we would be a Timothy, we must take the lead not to argue, gossip, or criticize, but to pray. Whenever we hear some news, good or bad, concerning a particular church, we should pray. Do not discuss the situation, do not gossip about it, and do not criticize. Just pray! Likewise, if you hear something about a saint or about an elder, pray for that one. The first requirement to have a proper church life is to pray. Oh, we all need to practice this! If we exercise ourselves to have a prayer life, the church will be living and uplifted. If some would be today&#8217;s Timothys to take the lead to pray, the others will follow. This can be illustrated by the way a flock of sheep follows the few who take the lead. If you, as a Timothy, take the lead to pray, the congregation in your locality will follow.<p>Instead of talking so much and even instead of working so much, we should pray more. Should you hear that a saint is weak or backsliding, do not talk about that person, and do not criticize him. Moreover, do not immediately go to visit him. Instead, pray for him. Whether or not you should visit him depends on the Lord&#8217;s leading. After you pray about the matter, if the Lord leads you to visit that one, simply follow the Lord and visit him. But do not do anything presumptuously. If the Lord does not lead you to visit a backsliding saint, you should not visit him on your own. It is possible that even in visiting the saints we may be presumptuous. Yes, visiting a backsliding saint is a presumptuous sin if it is done in ourselves apart from prayer and the Lord&#8217;s leading. But if through our prayer the Lord definitely leads us to visit a certain one, that visitation will be effective.<p>We should also pray whenever we hear of problems among the saints. We should not presume that we are experienced and qualified to solve problems. Such an attitude is not only presumptuous; it is also blasphemous, for it is to consider ourselves as God. If we learn about a problem between brothers, we should bring this matter to the Lord in our prayer.<p>The first thing the elders should do in caring for the church is pray. Do not make decisions without praying. Do not either criticize someone or praise him without first praying for him. Before doing anything, we need to pray. Furthermore, our prayers should not be light or superficial; they must be thorough. Only after we have prayed for a matter thoroughly should we make a decision concerning it, not by ourselves independently, but in oneness with the Lord and according to His leading. If the elders practice in this way the church life in our locality will be uplifted and proper.<p>Brother Nee often told us that in reading the Bible we need to touch the spirit of the writer. The Bible in black and white letters can be likened to a human body, and the writer&#8217;s spirit can be likened to the life, or to the spirit, in the body. Within the &#8220;body&#8221; of the Bible, there is the writer&#8217;s spirit. If we touch Paul&#8217;s spirit in 2:1-7, we shall sense his burden that those who take the lead in the church life must have a prayer life. In these verses Paul seems to be telling Timothy, &#8220;I have shown you a clear picture of God&#8217;s economy and how it is versus different teachings. I have also pointed out to you that, in His mercy, the Lord has made me a pattern of His economy. I have also charged you solemnly to war the good warfare on behalf of God&#8217;s economy. Now deep in my spirit is the burden to exhort you to pray. I exhort that petitions, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men. Do not think that teaching comes before prayer. No, prayer must be first, and teaching, second.&#8221;<p>In 2:1 Paul mentions petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings. Prayer is general, with the essence of worship and fellowship. Petitions are special and are for particular needs. The Greek word rendered &#8220;intercessions&#8221; means approach to God in a personal and confiding manner, that is, intervening, interfering, before God in others&#8217; affairs for their benefit. In addition, we must offer thanksgiving. Often when we hear good news about certain churches, elders, or saints, we praise them instead of giving thanks to God for them. If the situation in a certain church is good, it is because of God, not because of the church. Likewise, if a particular elder or saint is doing well, it also is because of God&#8217;s grace. Therefore, instead of praising a church or a person, we should give thanks to God.<p>In mentioning petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings, Paul&#8217;s spirit was very burdened concerning the importance of prayer. He wanted his dear spiritual children to pray. Again and again I would emphasize the fact that we can have a proper church life only if we have a prayer life. I can testify that I have never prayed more than I have during the past several years. I can also testify that I have seen definite answers to my prayers. Recently, my activity was limited for a time so that I could rest and care for my health. When I heard about certain needs, I prayed for them. Perhaps the Lord limited me that He might impress me with the fact that prayer is more important than work. May we all learn the lesson that the way to have a good church life is to pray. This is crucial. If our talking is turned into praying, the church in our locality will be transformed.<h2 class=head1>GODLINESS AND GRAVITY</h2><p>After pointing out that we should pray on behalf of all men, Paul goes on to say that we should pray &#8220;on behalf of kings and all who are in high position, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity.&#8221; A tranquil and quiet life is one that is peaceable, still, and without disturbance, not only outwardly in circumstances, but also inwardly in our heart and spirit, that we may have an enjoyable church life in godliness and gravity. Godliness is God-likeness; it is to be like God and to express Him. The Christian life should be a life which expresses God and bears God&#8217;s likeness in all things. Gravity is a qualification of human character which is worthy of utmost respect; it implies dignity and inspires and invites honor. Godliness is the expression of God; gravity is toward man. Our Christian life should express God toward man with an honorable character that invites man&#8217;s utmost respect.<h2 class=head1>OUR SAVIOR GOD</h2><p>Verse 3 says, &#8220;This is good and acceptable in the sight of our Savior God.&#8221; In this Epistle Paul emphasizes the Savior God. Hence, in this verse he speaks not of the God of grace, nor of the God of mercy, but of the Savior God, the God who saves us.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S DESIRE</h2><p>In verse 4 Paul says that God desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth. We should pray on behalf of all men because God our Savior desires all men to be saved and know the truth. Our prayer is required for the carrying out of God&#8217;s desire.<p>God desires all men not only to be saved, but also to have the full knowledge of the truth. Truth means reality, denoting all the real things revealed in God&#8217;s Word, which are mainly Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the Body of Christ. Every saved person should have a full knowledge, a complete realization, of these things.<p>The object of the two Epistles to Timothy is to deal with the church&#8217;s decline. In the first Epistle the decline crept in subtly through differing teachings (1:3), and in the second, it developed openly and became worse through the heresies (2:16-18). To deal with such a decline the truth must be maintained. The first Epistle emphasizes that God desires all His saved ones to have the full knowledge of the truth and that the church is the pillar and base of the truth (3:15). The second Epistle stresses that the word of the truth should be rightly unfolded (2 Tim. 2:15), and that the deviated ones should return to the truth (2 Tim. 2:25).<h2 class=head1>ONE MEDIATOR</h2><p>In 1 Timothy 2:5 Paul continues, &#8220;For there is one God and one Mediator of God and men, the Man, Christ Jesus.&#8221; In this verse Paul explicitly says that there is one God. Although God is Triune-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-He is still the one God, not three Gods, as mistakenly realized and believed by many Christians.<p>In this verse Paul also tells us that there is one Mediator of God and men. A mediator is a go-between. The one Mediator is the Man, Christ Jesus. The Lord Jesus was God from eternity (John 1:1). In time He became a man through incarnation (John 1:14). While He was living on earth as a man, He was also God (1 Tim. 3:16). After resurrection He was still man as well as God (Acts 7:56; John 20:28). Hence, He is the only One qualified to be the Mediator, the go-between, of God and men.<h2 class=head1>THE TESTIMONY BORNE IN ITS OWN TIMES</h2><p>Verse 6 says, &#8220;Who gave Himself a ransom on behalf of all, the testimony to be borne in its own times.&#8221; Christ gave Himself a ransom for the accomplishment of redemption for all men. This was necessary in order for Christ to be our Mediator. The Greek word for ransom means payment in recompense. He is qualified to be the Mediator between God and man, not only in His divine and human Person, but also in His redemptive work. Both His Person and work are unique.<p>In this verse Paul speaks of &#8220;the testimony to be borne in its own times.&#8221; This is in apposition to the preceding clause; that is, the fact that Christ gave Himself a ransom for all men becomes the testimony to be rendered in its own times. Whenever this fact is proclaimed, it is a testimony to be rendered to men in its own times. For example, when this fact was preached in Africa, that automatically became a testimony rendered to men in Africa in its own times. The preaching of the fact is always spontaneously a testimony of the fact. When Paul preached in Asia Minor, that was the testimony borne in its own times. The same was true when he received the Macedonian call and began to preach in eastern Europe. That was the proper time for the testimony to be declared there. Whenever the facts of Christ&#8217;s incarnation and death on behalf of all are proclaimed, that is the preaching, the testimony, borne in its own times.<h2 class=head1>PAUL&#8217;S TRIPLE STATUS</h2><p>In verse 7 Paul concludes, &#8220;For which I was appointed a herald and an apostle (I speak the truth, I do not lie), a teacher of the nations in faith and truth.&#8221; A herald is a proclaimer of the gospel of Christ, an official reporter of God&#8217;s New Testament economy; an apostle is one sent by God with a divine commission to set up churches for God, an ambassador from God to the world for the carrying out of His purpose; and a teacher is a tutor who defines, explains, and teaches the contents of God&#8217;s eternal purpose and His New Testament economy. Paul had such a triple status and commission for the nations, the Gentiles.<h2 class=head1>FAITH AND TRUTH</h2><p>Paul had such a status in faith and truth. Faith here refers to the faith in Christ (Gal. 3:23-26), and truth refers to the reality of all the things revealed in the New Testament. This corresponds to 4:3, those who believe and &#8220;have fully known the truth.&#8221; It is in the sphere and element of this faith and truth, not of the law, types, and prophecies of the Old Testament, that Paul was appointed a herald, an apostle, and a teacher of the New Testament.<h2 class=head1>THE PRINCIPLE OF INCARNATION</h2><p>The title of this message is &#8220;Prayer to Carry Out God&#8217;s Desire for Man&#8217;s Salvation.&#8221; Although God has such a desire, a heart, to save people, He can fulfill His desire only through the principle of incarnation. This means that He cannot save people directly; He must do it through us. Not even the angels have been appointed by God with such a commission for the carrying out of God&#8217;s desire. This commission has been entrusted only to man. For the carrying out of this commission, we need to pray. According to Acts 10, both Peter and Cornelius were praying. Peter was praying on the housetop, and Cornelius was praying in his house. From both sides, prayer ascended to the throne of God for the carrying out of God&#8217;s desire. By means of this prayer, God could accomplish His desire to save the Gentiles. The first Gentile household to be saved was that of Cornelius. This one example shows that our prayer is crucial for the carrying out of God&#8217;s desire for man&#8217;s salvation.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>THE NORMAL LIFE OF THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 2:8-15</h1><p>In this message we shall consider from 2:8-15 the normal life of the brothers and sisters in the church. After Paul charges Timothy to take the lead to have a prayerful life, he goes on to speak of this matter. In 2:8-15 Paul devotes one verse (v. 8) to the brothers and seven verses to the sisters (vv. 9-15). This indicates that if we are to have a proper church life, the sisters must bear a sevenfold burden, a sevenfold responsibility.<h2 class=head1>I. THE BROTHERS</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Praying in Every Place</h2><p>Concerning the brothers, Paul says in verse 8, &#8220;I will therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and reasoning.&#8221; In a local church the leading ones must have a prayer life, as they were charged in verses 1 and 2, to set an example of prayer for all the members to follow by praying always in every place. In Ephesians 6 Paul tells us to pray at every time, but here he says to pray in every place. Although it is possible for us to pray at every time, morning, afternoon, evening, and night, it may not be possible for us to pray in every place. The requirement to pray in every place is more demanding than that to pray at every time. If we can pray in every place, we can surely pray at every time. But even if we are able to pray at every time, it still may not be possible for us to pray in every place. For example, it is not possible to pray in certain worldly places. Since you cannot pray in those places, you should not go there. If you can pray in a particular place, it is permissible for you to be there. But if you cannot pray in a certain place, you should not be there. According to verse 8, the brothers must bear the unique burden to pray in every place. Pray at work, at home, and in your car. As men, we should be those who pray.<p>It is significant that Paul opens verse 8 with the words, &#8220;I will.&#8221; This expression is stronger than &#8220;I wish&#8221; or &#8220;I exhort.&#8221; Paul&#8217;s use of the word &#8220;therefore&#8221; indicates, as we pointed out in the previous message, that the elders, the leading ones, are to take the lead in prayer and pave the way for others to follow them to have a prayerful life. In the first message of this Life-study we covered some very important matters related to God&#8217;s dispensation. But no matter how important these matters are, they cannot be carried out without the prayer of the brothers. Knowing this, Paul said, &#8220;I will therefore that men pray in every place.&#8221;<p>As I am speaking about this matter of praying in every place, I am deeply burdened. I would beg you all, especially the leading ones, from now on to have another kind of life- a life of praying in every place. If you pray in every place, your living will be transformed, and the church in your locality will be transformed also. Some brothers may not be entirely satisfied with the church in their locality. The only way for the church in your locality to be satisfying to you is for you to pray at every time and in every place. Instead of discussing the situation of the church, pray for the church. The normal life of the brothers in the church is to pray in every place.<h2 class=head2>B. Lifting Up Holy Hands</h2><p>When we pray in every place, we should lift up holy hands. Hands are a symbol of our doings. Hence, holy hands signify a holy living, a living sanctified and separated unto God. Such a holy life strengthens our prayer life. When our hands are not holy, our living is not separated unto God. We then have no supporting strength to pray, no holy hands to lift up in prayer.<p>In prayer, we should not lift up our eyes to observe others, but lift up holy hands. If you are watchful over the elders and the saints in a critical way, your prayer life will be killed. But if you lift up holy hands, your prayer will be strengthened.<h2 class=head2>C. Without Wrath and Reasoning</h2><p>In verse 8 Paul also urges the brothers to pray &#8220;without wrath and reasoning.&#8221; Wrath and reasoning kill our prayer. Wrath is of our emotion, and reasoning is of our mind. To have a prayer life and pray unceasingly, our emotion and mind must be regulated to a normal condition under the control of the Spirit in our spirit.<p>The Greek word for reasoning means disputatious reasoning. What Paul is speaking of here is not normal or ordinary reasoning, but a reasoning filled with disputation. We must avoid this if we are to pray properly.<p>Paul&#8217;s word about not having disputatious reasonings is related to his admonition to lift up holy hands. If we close our eyes and lift up our hands, we shall be able to pray. But if we open our eyes to consider others and reason about their situation, we shall not be able to pray. Instead of lifting up our hands, we may clasp them behind our back. Who can pray with his hands clasped behind his back? But if we lift up our hands and refrain from disputatious reasoning, we shall be able to pray in a proper way.<p>From experience I have learned that our prayer life can be affected by our mood. If I do not keep myself in a proper mood, my prayer life is put to death. Anger always destroys our prayer life for a period of time. If a brother loses his temper with his wife, he may find that he cannot pray properly for a few days. If we are to have a prayer life, we must learn not to be moody or angry with others. By the Lord&#8217;s grace that is with our spirit, we must exercise a strict control over our emotion.<h2 class=head1>II. THE SISTERS</h2><p>In verse 9, Paul turns to the sisters. He begins this verse with the word &#8220;similarly.&#8221; This refers to &#8220;I will&#8221; in verse 8. It may also indicate that Paul&#8217;s word about praying in every place applies to the sisters as well as to the brothers.<h2 class=head2>A. Adorning Themselves</h2><p>Verse 9 says, &#8220;Similarly, that women adorn themselves in proper clothing with modesty and sobriety, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly clothing.&#8221; Proper clothing denotes what is fitting to the sisters&#8217; nature and position as saints of God. Clothing in Greek implies deportment, demeanor. Clothing is the main sign of a sister&#8217;s demeanor, and it must befit her saintly position.<p>The Greek word rendered modesty literally is shamefastness, that is, bound or made fast by an honorable shame (Vincent), implying not forward or overbold, but moderate, observing the proprieties of a woman.<p>Sobriety denotes sober-mindedness, self-restraint. It means to restrict oneself soberly and discreetly. The sisters in a local assembly should clothe themselves with these two virtues-shamefastness and self-restraint-as their demeanor.<p>In verse 10 Paul continues, &#8220;But, what befits women professing godly reverence, by good works.&#8221; Godly reverence is reverence toward God; it is the revering and honoring of God as those who worship Him should.<h2 class=head2>B. Learning</h2><p>In verse 11 Paul says, &#8220;Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection.&#8221; Quietness means silence. For a sister to learn in silence and in all subjection is to realize her position as a woman. This safeguards the sisters from the presumption of overstepping their position in the local assembly.<p>Verse 12 continues, &#8220;But I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness.&#8221; To teach here means to teach with authority, to define and decide the meaning of doctrines concerning divine truth. For a woman to teach in this way or to exercise authority over a man is to leave her position. In God&#8217;s creation man was ordained to be the head, and woman was to be in subjection to man (1 Cor. 11:3). This ordination should be kept in the church. The word quietness in verse 12 refers to silence from speaking.<p>In verse 13 Paul offers a word of explanation, &#8220;For Adam was formed first, then Eve.&#8221; This brings us to the beginning. God always wants to bring us back to His beginning (Matt. 19:8).<p>In verse 14 Paul goes on, &#8220;And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being quite deceived was in transgression.&#8221; Verse 13 gives the first reason that a woman should subject herself to man. Here is the second. Eve was deceived by the serpent (Gen. 3:1-6) because she did not remain in subjection under the headship of Adam, but overstepped her position to contact the evil tempter directly without her head being covered. This is the strong ground for the apostle not to permit the sisters in a local assembly to teach with authority or to exercise authority over men, but to learn in silence and remain in all subjection. Man&#8217;s headship is woman&#8217;s protection.<h2 class=head2>C. Their Salvation</h2><p>In verse 15 Paul concludes, &#8220;But she shall be saved through childbearing, if they remain in faith and love and holiness with sobriety.&#8221; Childbearing is a suffering. Suffering restricts and protects the fallen one from transgression.<p>The grammar in verse 15 is rather unusual. At the beginning of the verse Paul says, &#8220;She shall be saved&#8221;; then he goes on to say, &#8220;if they remain in faith and love and holiness with sobriety.&#8221; The pronoun &#8220;she&#8221; refers to Eve in verse 13. The reason Paul changes from a singular to a plural pronoun was that in referring to Eve he was including all women. Not all women are included in the pronoun &#8220;she,&#8221; but none can deny that they are included in the pronoun &#8220;they.&#8221; Paul&#8217;s use of pronouns in this verse makes it clear that in speaking of Eve he is speaking of all women.<p>In verse 15 Paul mentions faith, love, and holiness. Faith is to receive the Lord (John 1:12), love is to enjoy Him (John 14:21, 23), and holiness is to express Him through sanctification. By faith we please God (Heb. 11:6), by love we keep the Lord&#8217;s word (John 14:23), and by holiness we see Him. (Heb. 12:14).<p>In this message I am especially burdened concerning modesty, the leading female virtue. In some families there is not adequate stress on modesty. Rather, both boys and girls are brought up and instructed in the same way. Modesty is a virtue which emphasizes the difference between male and female. As we have pointed out, the Greek word rendered &#8220;modesty&#8221; in 2:9 is literally shamefastness, that is, bound and made fast by an honorable shame.<p>A word related to the virtue of modesty is shamefacedness. To be shamefaced is to be modest and have a sense of shame and know how to show shame. When a sister speaks in a church meeting, she should do so with modesty, with a certain amount of shamefacedness.<p>Modesty is a great safeguard and protection to a female. It is a mistake to teach girls in the same way as boys. Boys may expose themselves in certain situations; girls, however, should not. Otherwise, they will be without protection. This lack of protection can open the way for fornication. If the women working in an office have the virtue of modesty, they will be free from any improper involvement with the men who work there. A woman working in an office may easily become involved with a man if she does not have the proper covering, the necessary modesty, shamefacedness, which causes her to keep a proper distance.<p>All the sisters in the church life should have the virtue of modesty. The sisters should dress according to the principle of modesty. This principle does not allow the exposure of one&#8217;s body. For a woman to expose her body is to go against the principle of modesty. A sister needs to have a head covering, not only physically, but also psychologically, ethically, morally, and spiritually. This is the modesty spoken of in the Bible. To be modest simply means that a female is fully covered in every way.<p>In the church life the brothers and sisters have quite a lot of contact with one another in fellowship. In such fellowship it is necessary for the sisters to wear a moral, ethical, and spiritual covering known as modesty. In all their contact with the brothers, the sisters should be covered with an &#8220;overcoat&#8221; of modesty. This is a great safeguard and protection.<p>The sisters should never forget that they are females. This must be true especially of young unmarried sisters. They should be careful not to allow any evil thing to defile their holy body, which has been separated unto God and which is the temple of the Holy Spirit. For a young woman to preserve her body in this way requires modesty. I advise all the young sisters to wear a heavenly cloak to cover themselves from the influence of this evil age. Then they will be preserved for God&#8217;s purpose. At the time appointed by God, He will arrange for the right brother to marry a young sister as a virgin. Again and again I would remind the sisters to wear a cloak of modesty. The sisters must always remember that they are females. As females it is necessary for them to be covered. This is modesty.<p>Along with modesty, the sisters need sobriety (2:9). As a sister is practicing modesty, she needs to be sober. Far from being foolish, she should be sober-minded and discreet. She should be clear about things and have a keen discernment. A sister should be quiet, but she should not be without sobriety and discernment. A sister should be quiet soberly, not foolishly. As a sister exercises herself to be quiet and not to overstep her position, she needs a keen discernment within. Her spiritual sky should be clear, without clouds or smog. Then she will be clear, careful, and discreet.<p>The two virtues of modesty and sobriety are of great importance in the church life. The sisters should attend the church meetings in order to gain the full knowledge of the truth. This knowledge will cause them to be sober in their understanding. Then, along with their modesty, they will have what Paul calls &#8220;holiness with sobriety&#8221; (2:15). They will not be holy in a foolish way, in a way devoid of knowledge. On the contrary, they will be holy in a way that is full of knowledge, understanding, and discernment.<p>In the first two chapters of 1 Timothy Paul gives practical instructions to have a proper local church: (1) terminate the distraction of differing teachings (1:3-11); (2) emphasize God&#8217;s dispensation, making it the central line and goal of the Christian life (1:4-6); (3) preach Christ to save sinners (1:12-17); (4) war a good warfare for God&#8217;s New Testament economy by holding faith and a good conscience (1:18-19); (5) deal with the heretical teachers and the opposers of the apostle (1:20); (6) let the leading ones take the lead to have a prayer life, interceding for all men that Christ&#8217;s redemption may be testified in due time (2:1-7); (7) let the brothers follow the pattern of prayer, praying all the time (2:8); and (8) let the sisters adorn themselves in proper deportment and subject themselves to the brothers, remaining in quietness, faith, love, and holiness with sobriety.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>OVERSEERS AND DEACONS FOR THE CHURCH&#8217;S ADMINISTRATION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:1-13</h1><p>In 3:1-13 Paul speaks of overseers and deacons for the church&#8217;s administration. In verses 1 through 7 he covers the overseers, and in verses 8 through 13, the deacons.<h2 class=head1>I. OVERSEERS</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Aspiration for Oversight</h2><p>In verse 1 Paul says, &#8220;Faithful is the word: If anyone aspires to oversight, he desires a good work.&#8221; Paul begins with the expression, &#8220;Faithful is the word.&#8221; This expression indicates that what he is about to say is very important.<p>In verse 1 Paul speaks of oversight, and in verse 2, of overseers. The Greek word rendered oversight is episkope, from epi meaning over and skope meaning sight; hence, oversight, denoting the function of an overseer. The Greek word translated overseer is episkopos from epi and skopos meaning seer; hence, overseer (bishop, from Latin episcopus). An overseer in a local church is an elder (Acts 20:17, 28). The two titles refer to the same person: elder, denoting a person of maturity; and overseer, denoting the function of an elder. It was Ignatius in the second century who taught that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder. From this erroneous teaching came the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope. This teaching is also the source of the episcopal system of ecclesiastical government. Both the hierarchy and the system are abominable in the eyes of God.<p>In verse 1 Paul tells us that if anyone aspires to oversight, he desires a good work. Aspiration with a pure motive differs from ambition with an impure motive. It is the Lord&#8217;s desire that many brothers have the aspiration spoken of here. For the Lord&#8217;s recovery and for the building up of the local churches, there is the need of the proper leading ones. Hence, aspiration for oversight is not only justifiable, but even admirable. On the one hand, we condemn ambition; on the other hand, we appreciate the fact that many brothers have the aspiration for oversight. A brother with this kind of aspiration truly desires a good work.<h2 class=head2>B. Qualifications of an Overseer</h2><h2 class=head3>1. Without Reproach</h2><p>In verse 2 Paul says, &#8220;The overseer then must be without reproach, husband of one wife, temperate, of a sober mind, orderly, hospitable, apt to teach.&#8221; Paul first mentions the qualification of being without reproach. This does not denote perfection in the eyes of God, but an irreproachable condition in the eyes of man. An overseer must be one with a good reputation. There should be no ground for others to speak evil of him.<h2 class=head3>2. Husband of One Wife</h2><p>An overseer should be the husband of one wife. This implies the restraint of the flesh, which is necessary for an elder. It keeps an elder in a simple and pure married life, free from the tangle of a complicated and confused marriage.<h2 class=head3>3. Temperate</h2><p>An overseer should be temperate. Temperate here means self-controlled, moderate.<h2 class=head3>4. Of a Sober Mind</h2><p>To be of a sober mind is not only to be sensible, but also to be discreet in understanding. In 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus Paul uses the words sober and sobriety a number of times. All the saints in the church life need to be sober in their understanding. All must have the virtue of sobriety. If we have the Christian virtue of sobriety, we shall be very discerning and full of insight. However, we shall be quiet, not talkative. A talkative person is not a sober person. One who is sober is keen in his understanding, but slow to speak.<p>In our fellowship as Christians, it is very important that we understand others. Should someone come to you for fellowship, you should not say very much. Instead, listen while the other party does the talking. However, many have the habit of interrupting the other party and speaking too quickly. If we are to have the proper fellowship with others, we need to be inwardly like a calm lake. Talkativeness, however, stirs up the water and causes the lake to become muddy.<p>The elders should take the lead in all positive aspects of the church life. They should take the lead in prayer and in exhibiting the virtue of sobriety. If a brother is able to be silent for fifteen minutes while someone is having fellowship with him, he is able to meet this qualification to be an elder. When anyone is speaking to him, the elder should be a calm, tranquil lake, clear and transparent. This is one of the qualifications of an overseer. Talkativeness disqualifies a brother from being an elder. A proper elder is one who is quiet, calm, keen in understanding, and very discerning.<h2 class=head3>5. Orderly</h2><p>The Greek word rendered orderly in 3:2 also means decorous. To be orderly, decorous, is to have behavior that always fits the situation. It is to be neither too fast nor too slow, neither too bold nor too timid. A decorous person is one who always does what is fitting. One who is decorous talks when talk is necessary and is silent when silence is required. He can also laugh when laughter is appropriate.<p>This one qualification shows how difficult it is to be an elder. It is not too much to say that being an elder is the most difficult task on earth. How difficult it is to meet even the one qualification of being orderly or decorous! Even in the way he uses the telephone an elder should be decorous. On the one hand, he should not talk too long; on the other hand, if his conversation is too brief, he may offend others. It is possible to go to an extreme even in the matter of the way we use the telephone. One extreme is that a brother takes the telephone off the hook, refusing to talk to anyone. Another extreme is that his telephone conversations are too long. Neither is orderly.<p>Elders should also be orderly in the way they speak to others. Sometimes they need to speak loudly; at other times, they should speak softly.<p>Furthermore, they should be orderly in the way they have their hair cut. To have hair that is either too long or too short is not orderly. By these few examples we can see that the requirements of eldership are virtually without limit.<p>Because the requirements of an elder are so many and so difficult, it is surely vain for anyone to be ambitious for eldership. Those who have this ambition simply do not know how difficult it is to be an elder. If a brother does not have a genuine aspiration with a pure motive for the Lord&#8217;s recovery, he should not desire to be an elder. He should seek to fulfill his ambition outside the church, not in pursuing the eldership. The church is not an arena for a brother to satisfy his ambition.<p>The eldership is very demanding, and the requirements are extremely high. For this reason, I sympathize with the elders. From experience I know that they will receive telephone calls even in the middle of the night. They have no choice but to answer the telephone and take care of the situation of the one who calls.<p>At this point I would like to speak a word of comfort and encouragement to those who are children of elders. An elder&#8217;s children may be troubled by the fact that their father gives so much of his time to the church. If an elder fails to give adequate time to the church life, he cannot fulfill his responsibility properly. However, because the church takes so much of his time, he has relatively little time to devote to his children. I would encourage the children of elders to realize that for their father to give his time to the church is very acceptable to God. Temporarily the children may have some hardship. But the Lord will reward them. Instead of being disappointed by their situation, they should be glad that their father has consecrated his life and time to the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Eventually, the children of an elder will enjoy the Lord&#8217;s reward.<p>To be an elder is a great blessing to one&#8217;s family and to the church. It is surely worthwhile for a brother to aspire to oversight. Although being an elder is a most difficult job, it is a great blessing.<p>Those who are elders in the churches in the Lord&#8217;s recovery are burdened by the Lord and chosen according to the insight, oversight, and foresight of the spiritual eyes of the church. They are not elected, and they are very different from those who may be called elders in different denominations.<h2 class=head3>6. Hospitable</h2><p>Another qualification of an overseer is that he must be hospitable. Hospitality requires love, care for people, and endurance. All these virtues are required if one is to qualify to be an elder.<p>Nothing is more bothersome than giving hospitality. Hospitality tests the qualifications of elders. The principle of hospitality is giving without receiving; it is suffering without requiring anything in return. Hospitality means sacrifice with joy, but without recompense. An elder must have a heart and a spirit for such hospitality.<h2 class=head3>7. Apt to Teach</h2><p>In verse 2 Paul says that an elder should be apt to teach. To teach here is similar to parents teaching their children. An elder must be apt to render this kind of home teaching to the members of the local church.<p>If a parent has not received a proper education, it will be difficult for him to teach his children. Likewise, if the elders would be apt to teach, they need to be knowledgeable. For example, an elder should be able to explain what the mystery of Christ is. If a brother is not knowledgeable concerning the truth, he is disqualified from the eldership. An elder should be able to teach the saints like a parent helps a child with his homework. However, this does not mean that every elder should be a teacher. It is not necessary for parents to be teachers in order to help their children with homework. Similarly, not all elders are teachers, but they all should be apt to teach.<h2 class=head3>8. Not an Excessive Drinker</h2><p>In verse 3 Paul lists other qualifications: &#8220;Not an excessive drinker, not a striker, but forbearing, not contentious, not fond of money.&#8221; When Paul says that an elder should not be an excessive drinker, he, of course, has in mind not an excessive drinker of wine. However, the principle here is that an elder should not be excessive in anything. This requires strong self-control. In the matters of food and clothing, for example, an elder should not be excessive. This tests his ability to exercise self-control.<h2 class=head3>9. Not a Striker</h2><p>The next requirement, &#8220;not a striker,&#8221; is related to the control of one&#8217;s temper. This implies a strong restraint of the temper. An elder should be one who does not lose his temper.<h2 class=head3>10. Forbearing</h2><p>To be forbearing is to be yielding, gentle, mild, reasonable, and considerate in dealing with others. It is to deal with people without strictness.<h2 class=head3>11. Not Contentious</h2><p>An elder should not be contentious. He should not be quarrelsome; rather, he should be peaceable and not debate with others or contend with them. Even if someone comes to fight with him, he should not fight back, but should learn not to be contentious.<h2 class=head3>12. Not Fond of Money</h2><p>An elder should not be fond of money. Money is a test to all men. An elder must be pure in money matters, especially since the church fund is under the elders&#8217; management (Acts 11:30). An elder must realize that the money which passes through his hands is not for his personal gain. He should not have even the thought of monetary gain.<h2 class=head3>13. Managing Well His Own Household</h2><p>In verses 4 and 5 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;One who manages well his own household, having his children in subjection with all gravity; (but if anyone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?)&#8221; Managing well his own household is a proof that one is qualified to take the oversight of a local church. An elder should exercise to manage his household well and maintain it in good order. It is clear that anyone who does not know how to manage his own household cannot take care of the church of God.<h2 class=head3>14. Not a New Convert</h2><p>Verse 6 says, &#8220;Not a new convert, lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment of the Devil.&#8221; The Greek word rendered blinded literally means beclouded with smoke. Pride here is likened to smoke that beclouds the mind, making it blind, besotted with the self-conceit of pride. One who is blinded with pride may fall into the judgment of the Devil. This judgment refers to that to which Satan was sentenced due to his pride in his high position (Ezek. 28:13-17). The Devil was judged because of his rebellion which came from pride. The Devil was proud, blind, and rebellious. For this, he received God&#8217;s judgment.<h2 class=head3>15. Having a Good Testimony from Those Outside</h2><p>In verse 7 Paul concludes, &#8220;And he also must have a good testimony from those outside, that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil.&#8221; An elder must be right with himself, with his family, with the church, and with those outside-the society. And, according to the context, an elder must be right in intention, in motive, in character, in attitude, in words, and in deeds.<p>To fall into the judgment of the Devil is due to the pride of the elder himself; to fall into the snare of the Devil is occasioned by the reproach of outsiders. An elder should be alert not to be proud on the one hand, and not to be reproachable on the other, that he may avoid the Devil&#8217;s entanglement.<h2 class=head1>II. DEACONS</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Qualifications of a Deacon</h2><p>In verse 8 Paul says, &#8220;Deacons must similarly be grave, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not seeking gain by base means.&#8221; Deacons are serving ones. The overseers take care of the church; the deacons serve the church under the direction of the elders. These are the only two offices in a local church.<h2 class=head3>1. Grave</h2><p>Deacons are to be grave. This virtue inspires and invites honor and respect. A person who is grave is neither loose nor light.<h2 class=head3>2. Not Double-tongued</h2><p>A serpent is double-tongued. A deacon in a local church rendering service to all the saints may easily be double-tongued in contacting them. In that case, he practices the nature of the Devil and brings death into the church life.<p>Today we often use the expression two-faced instead of double-tongued. A two-faced person is hypocritical. He may speak one way to a brother in his presence and another way about the brother in his absence. Deacons should be neither double-tongued nor two-faced. If you do not have the Lord&#8217;s leading to speak frankly to a brother about his situation, simply be quiet. Do not say anything to please him. Furthermore, you should not speak negatively about him behind his back.<p>The deacons should fulfill their duty without talking too much. However, there is a great temptation to talk excessively. In their contact with the elders, the deacons may acquire information about certain matters. It is tempting to pass on this information. When a deacon behaves in this way, he becomes the information center of the church. The deacons should not be informers. Restricting the circulation of needless information will kill the germs of death in the church life.<h2 class=head3>3. Not Addicted to Much Wine</h2><p>Deacons should not be addicted to much wine. Being addicted to much wine is a sign of being unable to control oneself. A deacon in the service of a local church must exercise self-control in a full way.<h2 class=head3>4. Not Seeking Gain by Base Means</h2><p>A deacon also should not seek gain by base means. He should not seek gain from rendering service to the saints. This is seeking gain by base means (see 6:5b). A deacon, therefore, should not be fond of money.<h2 class=head3>5. Holding the Mystery of the Faith in a Pure Conscience</h2><p>Verse 9 says, &#8220;Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.&#8221; The faith here, as in 1:19 and 2 Timothy 4:7, is objective. It refers to the things we believe in, the things which constitute the gospel. The mystery of the faith is mainly Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4). A deacon in a local church should hold this mystery with full understanding in a pure conscience for the Lord&#8217;s testimony.<p>If the deacons know the mystery of the faith, the standard of their service will be uplifted. Whenever the deacons are asked by the elders to do a certain thing or to help others in a particular way, they should realize that they are serving the saints in the mystery of the faith. This will uplift their service. It makes a tremendous difference if the deacons&#8217; contact with others is based on God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<p>Years ago, I visited the royal palace in London. I noticed that every aspect of the service of the palace, from the changing of the guard to the work of the janitors, was done with a high standard and with dignity. Even the janitors conducted themselves with dignity and gravity, in a way which invited others&#8217; respect. How much more true this should be of the service of the deacons in a local church! Even the cleaning of the rest rooms should be done with gravity. Those who serve in this way should realize that they are not cleaning in a worldly place. Rather, they are serving the church, the house of God.<p>In verse 9 Paul speaks of a pure conscience. A pure conscience is a conscience purified from any mixture. To hold the mystery of the faith for the Lord&#8217;s testimony, we need such a purified conscience.<p>In order to have a pure conscience, the deacons need to behave according to their knowledge of the mystery of the faith. We may know this mystery, but not live according to it. As a result, instead of having a pure conscience, we have a conscience that condemns us. A deacon should consider how he deals with his wife, his children, and the other saints. He then may realize his shortage, that he does not live according to the mystery of the faith. A deacon must be justified in the first place by his own conscience. He should have a conscience which testifies even to the demons that he lives according to the standard of the mystery of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. Then he will truly hold the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.<h2 class=head3>6. Unreprovable</h2><p>In verse 10 Paul continues, &#8220;And let these also first be proved; then let them minister, being Unreprovable.&#8221; Unreprovable here means blameless. The word that the deacons should first be proved may imply a period of apprenticeship. The word minister in this verse means to serve. This is the function of a deacon.<h2 class=head3>7. Husband of One Wife</h2><p>Verse 12 says, &#8220;Let deacons be husbands of one wife.&#8221; The requirement here is the same as that of the overseers, as mentioned in verse 2.<h2 class=head3>8. Managing His Children and His Own Household Well</h2><p>In verse 12 Paul also says that deacons should manage &#8220;their children and their own households well.&#8221; Managing the children and the household well proves the capability of a brother to serve the church.<h2 class=head2>B. Blessing on a Good Deacon</h2><h2 class=head3>1. Obtaining a Good Standing</h2><p>In verse 13 Paul mentions the blessing on a good deacon: &#8220;For those who have ministered well obtain for themselves a good standing and much boldness in faith which is in Christ Jesus.&#8221; The word ministered here means served. The expression &#8220;a good standing&#8221; refers to a firm and steadfast standing as a believer and a saint before God and man. To serve the church well as a deacon strengthens one&#8217;s Christian standing.<h2 class=head3>2. Obtaining Much Boldness in Faith Which Is in Christ Jesus</h2><p>By serving well, a deacon will also be blessed with much boldness in faith which is in Christ Jesus. The word boldness also means confidence. To serve the church well strengthens the boldness, the confidence, of the Christian faith. Faith here is subjective and refers to our act of believing.<h2 class=head1>III. DEACONESSES</h2><p>Verse 11 says, &#8220;Women similarly must be grave, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.&#8221; The word women in this verse refers to deaconesses (Rom. 16:1), not to the wives of the deacons. Sisters who are serving ones in the church are deaconesses. Such ones must be grave. Furthermore, they should not be slanderers. This corresponds to &#8220;not double-tongued&#8221; in verse 8. The Devil is a slanderer (Rev. 12:10). To slander is to practice the nature of the evil slanderer. A sister who is a deaconess, a serving one in a local church among many other sisters, should flee slander, the evil act of the Devil.<p>Deaconesses must also be temperate and faithful in all things. We have pointed out that to be temperate is to be self-controlled, moderate. The charge to be &#8220;faithful in all things&#8221; corresponds to &#8220;not seeking gain by base means&#8221; in verse 8. A sister as a deaconess needs to be faithful, trustworthy in all things, especially in things concerning gain.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIX</h1><h1 class=title>THE FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:14-16</h1><p>First Timothy 3:14-16 is the most crucial portion in the four books of 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon. Paul has covered the matters of the differing teachings, the dispensation of God, the need for the leading ones to have a prayer life so that all the other brothers may follow, and the charge to the sisters to remain in faith, love, and holiness with sobriety. Furthermore, the elders have been established and the deacons have been appointed. A church that has all these characteristics is certainly wonderful. Now in verse 15 Paul tells us that the church is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. Then in verse 16 he goes on to declare: &#8220;And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness, Who was manifested in the flesh, vindicated in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.&#8221; In these verses Paul presents an extremely high standard for the church.<p>Among Christians today the standard of the church is far below God&#8217;s standard revealed in 3:15 and 16. In order to reach this standard, the church must have all the characteristics described in the first two and a half chapters of 1 Timothy. There must be no differing teachings, and God&#8217;s economy must be practiced continually. The leading ones must have a prayer life, and all the other brothers must follow them to pray in every place. Furthermore, the sisters should remain in faith, love, and holiness with sobriety. Then the government of the church must be established with the two offices of elders and deacons. It is our expectation to practice this kind of church life. We praise the Lord that in His recovery we have seen such a church life at least to a certain extent. Whenever God&#8217;s standard for the church is attained as outlined in 1 Timothy, the church will function as the house of the living God and the pillar and base upholding the truth. This is also the great mystery of godliness, the manifestation of God in the flesh. Not only was the Lord Jesus the manifestation of God in the past; the church today should also be the manifestation of God. This is the goal, the aim, of these four Epistles written by Paul.<p>Even though Paul witnessed the beginning of the decline of the church, he was not disappointed or discouraged. Because he had both insight and foresight, he could be encouraged. He knew that some day and somehow the church would reach God&#8217;s standard. The majority of the believers may decline, but a small number at least would be chosen, preserved, and established to practice the church life according to the divine standard.<p>We in the Lord&#8217;s recovery can testify of the great difference between the recovery and today&#8217;s organized Christianity. Reconciliation between the two is impossible. All the saints should be encouraged that the situation in the Lord&#8217;s recovery is heading toward God&#8217;s standard. This standard is that the church should function as the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, and as the great mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh. The church life today must be the manifestation of God in the flesh. When visitors, including those who have not yet believed in the Lord, come to the meetings and behold such a manifestation, they will no doubt be greatly surprised. They may say, &#8220;What is this? It is different from anything we have seen elsewhere. It is even different from the church services in religion.&#8221; Yes, the church is different; it is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, and the manifestation of God in the flesh. Every local church must reach this standard and continue according to it. There should be no decline; rather, we should maintain God&#8217;s standard until the glorious appearing of our Head, the Savior, Jesus Christ.<p>In 3:14 Paul says, &#8220;These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly.&#8221; By &#8220;these things&#8221; Paul means all he has covered thus far in this Epistle. When he wrote this book, he was hoping to come shortly to see Timothy.<h2 class=head1>I. THE HOUSE OF THE LIVING GOD</h2><p>Verse 15 continues, &#8220;But if I delay, that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.&#8221; The words &#8220;know how one ought to conduct himself&#8221; indicate that in this book Paul gives instructions concerning how to take care of a local church.<p>According to Paul&#8217;s word in verse 15, the church is the house of God. The Greek word rendered house may also be translated household. The same word is used in 3:4, 5, and 12. The household, the family, of God is the house of God. The house and the household are one thing-the assembly of the believers (Eph. 2:19; Heb. 3:6). The reality of this house as the dwelling place of the living God is in our spirit (Eph. 2:22). We must live and act in our spirit so that God can be manifested in this house as the living God.<p>As God&#8217;s dwelling place, the church is both God&#8217;s house and His household, His family. In the Old Testament, the temple and God&#8217;s people, His family, were two separate things. But in the fulfillment in the New Testament, the dwelling place and the family are one. The family is God&#8217;s dwelling place, and God&#8217;s dwelling place is His family. As we have indicated, the Greek word for house may be translated either as house or household. According to God&#8217;s New Testament economy, God&#8217;s family is His house. These are not two separate things; they are actually one. We are God&#8217;s family and also His temple, His dwelling place.<p>In speaking of the church as the house of God, Paul specifically refers to God as the living God. The living God who lives in the church must be subjective to the church rather than merely objective. An idol in a heathen temple is lifeless. The God who not only lives but also acts, moves, and works in His living temple, the church, is living. Because He is living, the church is also living in Him, by Him, and with Him. A living God and a living church live, move, and work together. The living church is the house and the household of the living God. Hence, it becomes the manifestation of God in the flesh.<h2 class=head1>II. THE PILLAR AND BASE OF THE TRUTH</h2><p>Speaking metaphorically, Paul goes on to say that the church is &#8220;the pillar and base of the truth.&#8221; The pillar supports the building, and the base holds the pillar. The church is such a supporting pillar and holding base of the truth.<p>The truth here refers to the real things which are revealed in the New Testament concerning Christ and the church according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy. The church is the supporting pillar and holding base of all these realities. A local church should be such a building that holds, bears, and testifies the truth, the reality, of Christ and the church.<p>The church as the house of the living God is both the pillar which bears the truth and the base which upholds the pillar. As we have pointed out, the truth is the reality and the contents of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. This economy is composed of two mysteries: Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4). Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, are the contents of the reality of God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<h2 class=head1>III. THE MYSTERY OF GODLINESS</h2><p>Verse 16 begins with the words, &#8220;And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness.&#8221; The conjunction &#8220;and&#8221; in verse 16 indicates that Paul has not finished speaking about the church in verse 15. Oh, the church is a great matter! It is the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth. Paul&#8217;s use of the conjunction at the beginning of verse 16 indicates that the church is something even more than the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth. The church is also the mystery of godliness. The church is the house, the pillar and the base, and the mystery of godliness.<p>According to the context, godliness in verse 16 refers not only to piety, but to the living of God in the church, that is, God as life lived out in the church. This is the great mystery confessed universally by believers in Christ.<p>The church as the house of the living God and as the pillar and base of the truth is not so mysterious. But the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh certainly is a mystery. A mystery always goes beyond our understanding. It refers to something which cannot be explained. If we are able to explain a certain matter, it is not a mystery.<p>The church is not only the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth, but also the mystery of godliness. Godliness refers to God expressed. What are we doing in the church life? We are expressing God. Human beings may not realize this adequately, but the angels recognize it and appreciate it. On the one hand, the good angels rejoice when they behold the expression of God in the church. On the other hand, the evil angels and the demons tremble in fear. They realize that eventually those in the church life will condemn them to the lake of fire.<p>When the Lord Jesus was born, a host of angels praised God (Luke 2:10-14). If the angels rejoiced at the birth of the Lord Jesus in Bethlehem, the city of David, will they not also rejoice to see God manifested in the church, which is Christ&#8217;s increase and enlargement? Furthermore, when the Lord Jesus, living out God and manifesting Him on earth, confronted the demons, the demons cried out. In at least one case they begged the Lord Jesus not to send them into the abyss (Luke 8:31). If the demons trembled at the presence of the Lord Jesus, will they not also tremble at the manifestation of the living God in the church? No doubt when the church is living out God and manifesting Him, the demons and the evil angels will be terrified. Every local church must be a place where Christ is born anew in the saints. Furthermore, every local church must live out God in such a way that the Devil&#8217;s time is shortened. On the one hand, when the churches come up to God&#8217;s standard, the angels will sing and rejoice; on the other hand, the demons and the evil angels will tremble.<p>It may come as a surprise that in verse 16 Paul suddenly uses the relative pronoun &#8220;who,&#8221; when he says, &#8220;Who was manifested in the flesh.&#8221; In Greek the antecedent of this relative pronoun is omitted, but easily recognized, that is, Christ who was God manifested in the flesh as the mystery of godliness. The transition from &#8220;the mystery...&#8221; to &#8220;Who&#8221; implies that Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh is the mystery of godliness (Col. 1:27; Gal. 2:20). This mystery of godliness is the living of a proper church, and such a living is also the manifestation of God in the flesh. The portion of verse 16 from &#8220;Who was manifested&#8221; to &#8220;taken up in glory&#8221; may have been a church song in the early days.<p>The first part of verse 16 speaks of a matter-the mystery of godliness. Hence, we would expect Paul to use the relative pronoun &#8220;which&#8221; to refer to the mystery of godliness as a matter. However, the fact that he uses the relative pronoun &#8220;Who&#8221; implies that the mystery of godliness is a person and not merely a matter. As we shall see, this person is Christ as the Head with His Body.<p>Through incarnation and human living (John 1:1, 14), God was manifested in the flesh. &#8220;In the flesh&#8221; means in the likeness, in the fashion, of man (Rom. 8:3; Phil. 2:7-8). In the form of man Christ appeared to people (2 Cor. 5:16), yet He was God manifested in a man.<p>Christ was also &#8220;vindicated in the Spirit.&#8221; The Greek word also means justified. The incarnated Christ in His human living was not only vindicated as the Son of God by the Spirit (Matt. 3:16-17; Rom. 1:3-4), but was also justified, proved, and approved as right and righteous by the Spirit (Matt. 3:15-16; 4:1). He was manifested in the flesh, but vindicated and justified in the Spirit. He appeared in the flesh, but He lived in the Spirit (Luke 4:1, 14; Matt. 12:28) and offered Himself to God through the Spirit (Heb. 9:14). His transfiguration (Matt. 17:2) and His resurrection are all vindications of the Spirit. Furthermore, in resurrection He even became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17) to dwell and live in us (Rom. 8:9-10) for the manifestation of God in the flesh as the mystery of godliness. Hence, now we know Him and His members no longer according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit (2 Cor. 5:16). Since the manifestation of God in the flesh is vindicated in the Spirit, and the Spirit is one with our spirit (Rom. 8:16), we must live and behave in our spirit that this vindication may be accomplished.<p>Paul also says &#8220;seen by angels.&#8221; Angels saw the incarnation, human living, and ascension of Christ (Luke 2:9-14; Matt. 4:11; Acts 1:10-11; Rev. 5:6, 11-12).<p>Christ was also preached among the nations. Christ as God&#8217;s manifestation in the flesh has been preached as the gospel among the nations, including the nation of Israel, from the day of Pentecost (Rom. 16:26; Eph. 3:8).<p>Furthermore, Christ has been &#8220;believed on in the world.&#8221; Christ as the embodiment of God in the flesh has been believed on, received as Savior and life, by people in the world (Acts 13:48).<p>Paul concludes verse 16 with the phrase &#8220;taken up in glory.&#8221; This refers to Christ&#8217;s ascension into glory (Mark 16:19; Acts 1:9-11; 2:33; Phil. 2:9). According to the sequence of historical events, Christ&#8217;s ascension preceded His being preached among the nations. However, it is listed here as the last event of Christ being the manifestation of God in the flesh. This seems to indicate the church taken up in glory. Hence, it implies that not only Christ Himself as the Head, but also the church as the Body, is the manifestation of God in the flesh. When a church is well taken care of according to the instructions given in the first two chapters, with the oversight of the elders and the service of the deacons fully established, as revealed in chapter three, the church will function as the house and household of the living God for His move on the earth and as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world. Then the church becomes the continuation of Christ&#8217;s manifestation of God in the flesh. This is the great mystery of godliness-Christ lived out of the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh!<p>I wish to emphasize the fact that although Christ was taken up in glory (Acts 1) before the preaching of Him began in Acts 2, Paul mentions this last, not only after the preaching, but even after being believed on in the world. This indicates that &#8220;taken up in glory&#8221; may include not only the ascension of Christ, but also the rapture of the church. The Head, Christ, was taken up before the preaching of Him began; however, the Body, the church, will be taken up only after Christ has been preached and believed on in the world. Therefore, in verse 16 there is a definite indication that this verse refers not only to the Head as the manifestation of God in the flesh, but also to the Body as the continuation of this manifestation. This is indeed logical, for how can a person&#8217;s head function in isolation from his body? The Head, Christ, has been taken up in glory, and the Body, the church, will also be taken up in glory. Both the Head and the Body are the mystery of godliness. This is the manifestation of God in the flesh.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE PREDICTION OF THE DECLINE OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 4:1-5</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the prediction of the decline of the church as presented in 4:1-5.<h2 class=head1>I. THE SPIRIT&#8217;S PREDICTION</h2><p>In 4:1 Paul says, &#8220;But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons.&#8221; The fact that this verse begins with the word &#8220;but&#8221; indicates that what follows is in contrast to what is mentioned in 3:15 and 16. At the end of chapter three, Paul reached the high point of the four Epistles of 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon, presenting a glorious picture of the church. However, in 4:1-5, he describes something very dark, something much in contrast to the situation in 3:15 and 16.<p>In 4:1 Paul uses the expression &#8220;the Spirit says expressly.&#8221; This is the Spirit who dwells in our spirit and speaks to us there (Rom. 8:9-11, 16). We need to exercise our spirit that it may become keen and clear to listen to the Spirit&#8217;s speaking and be kept from the deceiving spirits and teachings of demons.<p>Many in today&#8217;s Pentecostal movement follow the Old Testament way of prophesying and say, &#8220;Thus saith the Lord.&#8221; This expression cannot be found in the New Testament. In the New Testament we see the principle of incarnation. According to this principle, God does not speak directly. Rather, He speaks through man. First, in Jesus Christ God became incarnated and mingled with man. Now after the death and resurrection of Christ, it is possible for Him to be one spirit with those who believe in Christ. In 1 Corinthians 6:17 Paul declares, &#8220;He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.&#8221; This refers to the mingled spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with the regenerated human spirit. In the New Testament it is this mingled spirit which does the speaking. For this reason, 4:1 does not say, &#8220;The Spirit of God says,&#8221; nor, &#8220;The Holy Spirit says.&#8221; Instead, this verse reads, &#8220;The Spirit says....&#8221; According to the principle of incarnation revealed in the New Testament, this implies our spirit. We have seen that the principle of incarnation means that divinity is brought into humanity and works with humanity. Hence, when the Spirit speaks, He speaks within our spirit, through our spirit, and out from our spirit. If there were no one who was truly one spirit with the speaking God, there would be no way, according to the New Testament principle, for God to speak.<p>Paul took the lead to be one spirit with the Lord. Because he was one with Him in this way, Paul was able to speak a great deal for the Lord. In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul says definitely that concerning a particular matter he does not have a word from the Lord, but that he gives his opinion, his judgment, as one who has received the mercy of the Lord to be faithful (v. 25). But as we read this portion of the Bible today, we see that Paul&#8217;s word is in fact the word of the Lord. When Paul spoke, the Triune God, who has been processed to become the Spirit and who was mingled with Paul&#8217;s regenerated spirit, spoke from within him. We also have such a mingled spirit within us today. It is in and through this mingled spirit that the Spirit speaks expressly.<p>First Timothy 4:1 is a continuation of 3:15 and 16. No doubt, these latter verses were Paul&#8217;s words. Now in 4:1 Paul says that the Spirit speaks expressly. Where was the Spirit speaking? There can be no doubt that the Spirit was speaking from within Paul. As Paul was writing to Timothy about the church as the house of God, the pillar and base of the truth, and the great mystery of godliness, the Spirit was speaking in his spirit. This is not the Spirit who suddenly descends upon us and causes us to prophesy, &#8220;Thus saith the Lord.&#8221; The speaking of the Spirit in 4:1 is according to the way of incarnation. The Spirit spoke from within Paul&#8217;s spirit.<p>If we would hear the speaking of the Spirit, we need to exercise our spirit. Only our spirit can listen to the speaking of the Spirit. The mind is not qualified for this; it lacks the ability to listen to the Spirit&#8217;s speaking. The Spirit speaks to our spirit, and our spirit responds to the Spirit. Therefore, as we read 1 Timothy, we must exercise our spirit to listen to the Spirit speaking from within the spirit of the Apostle Paul.<h2 class=head1>II. DEPARTING FROM THE FAITH</h2><p>According to 4:1, the Spirit says that in later times some will depart from the faith. The later times, or after times, refer to times after the writing of this book. This differs from the last days in 2 Timothy 3:1, which denote the closing period of this age.<p>As he was writing this Epistle, Paul realized that in time to come some would depart from the faith. In this verse the faith is objective and refers to the contents of our belief. On the one hand, Paul was bold and encouraged, not in the least disappointed. He believed that the church was the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, and even the mystery of godliness. On the other hand, deep within his spirit, he knew that certain so-called believers would depart from the faith, from God&#8217;s New Testament economy. Paul could know this because the Spirit who was mingled with his spirit revealed it to him. This departure from God&#8217;s New Testament economy would be the beginning of the decline of the church life.<p>Paul says that those who depart from the faith will give heed to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons. Many Christians do not realize that, according to the Bible, there are two categories of evil spirits. The deceiving spirits in 4:1 are in contrast to the Spirit, as mentioned in 1 John 4:1, 3, and 6. These are the fallen angels who followed Satan in his rebellion and became his subordinates, who work for his kingdom of darkness (Matt. 25:41; Eph. 6:12). Demons are the unclean and evil spirits (Matt. 12:22, 43; Luke 8:2) of the living creatures on earth in the pre-adamic age who joined Satan&#8217;s rebellion and were judged by God (see Life-study of Genesis, Message Two). After being judged, they became demons, working on earth for Satan&#8217;s kingdom. The demons differ from the deceiving spirits, the fallen angels. The fallen angels are in the air, whereas the demons are active on earth.<p>In verse 1 Paul speaks of both the deceiving spirits in the air and the demons on earth. Among Christians today there are deceptive doctrines which come from the deceiving spirits in the air and also teachings which originate with demons. The history of the church has proved that Paul was right in saying that such teachings and doctrines would come in and that those who depart from the faith would give heed to them.<p>In verse 2 Paul continues, &#8220;In the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;in the hypocrisy of men who speak lies&#8221; modifies teachings of demons in verse 1. The teachings of demons are carried out in the hypocrisy of those who lie. This indicates that demons and lying speakers collaborate to deceive people. These hypocrites work together with evil spirits and demons to bring in deceitful teachings and demonic doctrines.<p>The conscience of hypocritical liars has lost its sense as if seared with a hot branding iron, an iron used to brand the slaves and cattle of a certain owner. This book strongly stresses the conscience. In the church life the love which is contrary to envy and discord is of a good conscience (1:5). Those who thrust away a good conscience become shipwrecked regarding the faith (1:19). The serving ones in the church must hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience (3:9). To keep a good and pure conscience is to keep the conscience sensitive in its function. This will safeguard us from the demonic and hypocritical teachings of deceiving liars.<p>When I was young, I had confidence in anyone who testified that he was a Christian. One day, Brother Nee pointed out the fact that some Christians lie. I wondered how a Christian could be a liar. The Bible says that Satan is the father of lies (John 8:44). Eventually I learned from experience that Christians can lie. In the case of these lying Christians, it seems as if their conscience has been seared and has lost its function. Today many lies have been spread about us by Christians. Some have even gone so far as to put these lies into print. But our conscience testifies that we in the Lord&#8217;s recovery surely believe the truth revealed in the Bible, perhaps more than other Christians.<p>We in the Lord&#8217;s recovery should not only know God&#8217;s dispensation, but should also know Satan&#8217;s evil plot. We must see the sharp contrast between the situation at the end of chapter three and that described at the beginning of chapter four. We need to be discerning, sober-minded, and clear concerning the difference between today&#8217;s Christianity and the Lord&#8217;s recovery. We must also know what the Devil is doing through evil spirits, demons, and those who speak lies in hypocrisy.<p>Verse 3 says, &#8220;Forbidding to marry, commanding to abstain from foods which God has created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who believe and have fully known the truth.&#8221; Marriage and eating were ordained by God. Eating is for the existence of mankind, and marriage for the continuation and multiplication of mankind. Satan, on the one hand, causes men to abuse these two things in the indulgence of their lustful flesh; on the other hand, he causes men to be unbalanced in the way of asceticism by forbidding marriage and the eating of certain foods. This is a demonic teaching!<p>Marriage was ordained by God for the carrying out of God&#8217;s purpose with man. Food is necessary to sustain mankind to exist on earth for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s purpose. But Satan, through the deceiving spirits and the teachings of demons with the collaboration of hypocrites and liars, seeks to destroy these things, either causing people to abuse them through indulgence or to practice asceticism.<h2 class=head1>III. THE TRUTH CONCERNING FOOD</h2><p>In verse 3 Paul speaks of &#8220;foods which God has created to be partaken of with thanksgiving.&#8221; All edible things were created by God for men to live on. We should partake of them with thanksgiving to God out of a grateful heart.<p>Because all food is God&#8217;s gift to us, we should receive it with thanksgiving. As we partake of our food, we should say, &#8220;Lord, thank You.&#8221; However, we do not have to follow the traditional ritual of saying a so-called word of grace. On the one hand, I do not agree with the practice of such a ritual; on the other hand, I do not agree with neglecting to thank the Lord for the food He has given us. I can testify that I thank the Lord again and again for my food. I even thank Him for a glass of water and say, &#8220;Lord, this water is a gift from You, and I thank You for it.&#8221; Those who practice saying &#8220;grace&#8221; usually do so before they start eating. But we should thank the Lord for our food not only before we eat it, but also while we are partaking of it and when we have finished our meal. Furthermore, we may express our thanks for each particular item we eat.<p>The foods God has created should be partaken of with thanksgiving &#8220;by those who believe and have fully known the truth.&#8221; To believe is to be saved and thus begin in the spiritual life. To have fully known the truth is to realize God&#8217;s purpose in His economy and to grow unto maturity in the spiritual life. God desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth (2:4). The truth here is God&#8217;s New Testament economy. As those who are saved by believing in the Lord Jesus for salvation and who know the content, the reality, of God&#8217;s economy concerning Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ, we should be thankful for all the food we eat. Those who believe and who know the truth are qualified to receive their food with thanksgiving. We know that we are living on earth for God and for His purpose. Thus, we receive what He has prepared for our sustenance, and we thank Him for it all.<p>In verses 4 and 5 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, being received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified through the word of God and intercession.&#8221; The statement that &#8220;every creature of God is good&#8221; is contrary both to Gnosticism, which teaches that some created things are evil, and to ascetic teachings that command men to abstain from certain foods. Some insist that we should eat only vegetables and not meat. But according to Paul&#8217;s word, every creature of God is good.<p>Furthermore, Paul says that &#8220;nothing is to be rejected.&#8221; In the past, I politely said, &#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; when I was served certain foods at Cantonese feasts. In particular, I declined to eat turtle, snake, or frogs. I simply was unable to eat those things. But according to Paul&#8217;s word, we should not reject anything created by Him, but receive all things with thanksgiving.<p>In verse 5 Paul concludes, &#8220;For it is sanctified through the word of God and intercession.&#8221; All the food we eat can be sanctified, separated unto God for His purpose, through the word of God and intercession. Here the word of God refers to the word of our prayer addressed to God, of which part may be quotations from the Scriptures, or part, messages we hear and read. In this verse intercession refers to our prayer to God for the food we eat. Such prayer separates our food from being common and sanctifies it unto God for His purpose, that is, to nourish us that we may live for Him.<p>Many versions do not have the boldness to use the word intercession, even though this is the meaning of the Greek word. Instead, they render the Greek word as prayer. But here Paul is definitely saying that we should make intercession for our food. We may pray for ourselves, but we intercede either for someone else or for something. According to Paul&#8217;s word in this verse, we need to intercede for our food and ask the Lord to sanctify it. Whenever we sit down to eat, we should pray for the food and make intercession for it, saying, &#8220;Lord, sanctify this food for Your purpose that it may nourish Your servant. Lord, I believe, and I know the truth. I am here on earth for You and for Your economy. I need this food, and I ask that it be sanctified, separated, to Yourself for the fulfillment of Your economy.&#8221; In the eyes of God, after intercession has been made for our food in this way, the food becomes holy. This is the proper way to receive our God-given food with thanksgiving.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>A GOOD MINISTER OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 4:6-16</h1><p>In 4:6 Paul uses the expression &#8220;a good minister of Christ Jesus.&#8221; A minister of Christ is one who serves others with Christ, ministering Christ as Savior, life, life supply, and every positive thing. He differs from a teacher of the law and of other things (1:7, 3).<h2 class=head1>I. LAYING THESE THINGS BEFORE THE BROTHERS</h2><p>A minister of Christ does not mainly denote a minister who belongs to Christ, but a person who ministers Christ to others. He is one who serves people with Christ. For example, if we say that a man is a serving one of a particular meal, we do not mean, of course, that he belongs to the meal. We mean that he serves others with that meal. In like manner, although it is true that a minister of Christ belongs to Christ, the main thought here is that he serves others with Christ, ministering Christ to them. Not only does he belong to Christ, but he serves Christ to others.<p>In today&#8217;s Christianity there are a great many ministers who belong to Christ, but very few of them minister Christ to others. To be a minister of Christ does not primarily mean to preach Christ, teach Christ, or tell others about Christ. The main significance of this term is ministering Christ to others.<p>Verse 6 confirms this understanding of the expression &#8220;a good minister of Christ.&#8221; Here Paul says, &#8220;Laying these things before the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, being nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which you have closely followed.&#8221; By &#8220;these things&#8221; Paul means all he has covered thus far in this Epistle. Just as a steward lays different courses of food before guests at a dinner, so a good minister of Christ should lay &#8220;these things&#8221; before the believers. Furthermore, Paul&#8217;s use of the term &#8220;being nourished&#8221; indicates that his concept is that of supplying life to others. It is significant that here Paul does not say &#8220;being taught,&#8221; but &#8220;being nourished&#8221; with the words of the faith. If we would minister Christ to others, we ourselves must first be nourished. Being nourished with Christ, we shall have Christ as food, as life supply, to minister to others. The words &#8220;being nourished&#8221; give us the ground to say that a good minister of Christ does not merely teach others about Christ, but ministers Christ into others as food. Others should be able to testify of us that we have nourished them with Christ.<p>Throughout the years, my aim in the ministry has been to nourish the saints. No doubt I have passed on a good deal of knowledge. But I can testify that in every message, I exercise my spirit not just to pass on knowledge, but, while I am giving forth a certain kind of knowledge, to supply something nourishing to the Lord&#8217;s people. My desire is to minister the riches of Christ as food that the saints may be nourished. Recently, many have written me letters telling how they have been richly fed with Christ through the messages.<p>If you have a heart to care for others in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, you should not give them mere teaching. Whenever you fellowship with others concerning Christ, you may give them some knowledge. But while you are teaching them, you need to exercise your spirit to minister spiritual food that they may be nourished. If you do this, you will be a good minister of Christ.<p>With Paul and Timothy we see an excellent pattern. As we have pointed out, Paul told Timothy to lay &#8220;these things before the brothers,&#8221; referring to the things which he was writing in this Epistle. However, before Timothy could lay these things before others, he first had to feed on them himself. He had to digest them, assimilate them, and allow them to saturate his inner being. Then he would be able to lay them before the brothers. Today we should follow Timothy&#8217;s example and lay before the saints the things with which we have been nourished by the Lord through the ministry. How wonderful the church life would be if we all did this! However, if we turn from the ministry and seek to produce something different, we may give place to differing teachings. It was not Timothy&#8217;s intention to teach anything different from what Paul taught. Rather, he would lay before the brothers what he had received from Paul.<p>At this point, I would like to say a word concerning my burden in putting out the Life-study Messages. The aim of these messages is to produce groceries for the local churches. My burden is not mainly to &#8220;cook&#8221; these spiritual groceries; it is to produce them and supply them to the churches that every local church may be a well-stocked supermarket, filled with a variety of nourishing foods. If the leading ones in a local church lay before the saints the riches contained in the Life-studies, the saints will be abundantly nourished. I have received many letters testifying that this has happened.<p>It is a fact of history in the Lord&#8217;s recovery that any church which follows the ministry is strong and blessed. But those churches which neglect the ministry and try instead to do something on their own have become a failure. However, in saying these things, I wish to make it very clear that I by no means insist that the churches or the saints read the Life-study Messages. To repeat, my burden is to produce groceries. The churches and the saints are free either to use them or to disregard them. But if the saints cast away the nourishment found in these messages, I wonder what they will feed on. We are what we eat. If we eat the &#8220;groceries&#8221; produced in today&#8217;s religion, we shall be part of religion. Let me say in frankness and honesty that the leading ones need to take &#8220;these things&#8221; and lay them before the saints that they may be nourished.<p>Paul&#8217;s expression &#8220;laying these things before the brothers&#8221; is very significant. We need to be impressed with the fact that this also is part of the Bible, the Word of God. I do not charge anyone to lay my words before the saints. It is not my practice to charge the churches to do anything. Representatives of hundreds of churches can testify that I do not charge them to do things. I do not even know many of the things that take place in the church in Anaheim, where I live. I am very glad that the elders take action regarding many things without letting me know. This is a strong proof that I am not a pope. Very much to the contrary, I am a little servant of the Lord, a farmer burdened to produce groceries for the saints. Far from charging the churches to do anything, I simply long that they feed on the spiritual riches the Lord has given us. Do not lay Witness Lee&#8217;s teaching before the brothers. Instead, present them the riches, the groceries, the Lord has shown us from the Word.<p>I am deeply burdened by the fact that many who love the Lord Jesus and seek Him have been deceived and frustrated. We must find a way to share with them the spiritual riches the Lord has provided us. Many who truly love the Lord are starving. We must take up the burden to supply them with food. We all need to be good ministers of Christ, serving others with His riches. Let us first be nourished ourselves and then minister this nourishment to all the people of God.<p>We would emphasize that being nourished is for the growth in life. This is a matter of life and it differs from merely being taught, which is a matter of knowledge. To minister Christ to others requires that we ourselves first be nourished with the words of life concerning Christ.<h2 class=head1>II. BEING NOURISHED</h2><p>In verse 6 Paul specifically speaks of &#8220;being nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching.&#8221; The words of the faith are the words of the full gospel concerning God&#8217;s New Testament economy. The focus of God&#8217;s economy is not the image in Daniel 2 or the four beasts in Daniel 7. If you want to see the focal point of God&#8217;s economy, study the book of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. We need to be nourished with the words of the faith, God&#8217;s economy, found in these books.<p>According to verse 6, we should also be nourished with the good teaching which we have closely followed. The words of the good teaching are the sweet words that contain and convey the riches of Christ to nourish, edify, and strengthen His believers. Actually, the words of the faith and the words of the good teaching refer to the same thing. If we would teach others, we ourselves must first follow these words closely. Following them closely and being nourished with them, we shall then be able to feed others. For example, if a mother does not know how to nourish herself properly, she will not know how to feed healthy food to her children. Through her own experience of being nourished, she will know what food is best for her children. This illustrates the fact that as good ministers of Christ, we must first be nourished ourselves with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which we have closely followed, and then we shall be able to nourish others.<h2 class=head1>III. REFUSING PROFANE AND OLD-WOMANISH TALES</h2><p>In verse 7 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;But the profane and old-womanish tales refuse, and exercise yourself unto godliness.&#8221; The Greek word for profane means touching and being touched by worldliness, contrary to being holy. If we would exercise ourselves unto godliness, we must refuse profane and old-womanish tales. Much of the teaching and preaching in Christianity today falls in the category of old-womanish tales. We should forget these tales and come back to the pure word of the Bible. In the so-called services among Christians today, there is a great deal of profane, secular, and worldly talk. People discuss politics and how to be successful in business. All this is profane talk, comparable to old-womanish tales.<h2 class=head1>IV. EXERCISING UNTO GODLINESS</h2><p>Refusing the profane and old-womanish tales, we should exercise unto godliness. Such exercise is like gymnastics. The words &#8220;unto godliness&#8221; mean with a view to godliness. Godliness is Christ lived out of us as the manifestation of God. This very Christ is today the Spirit dwelling in our spirit (2 Cor. 3:17; Rom. 8:9-10; 2 Tim. 4:22). Hence, to exercise ourselves unto godliness is to exercise our spirit to live Christ in our daily life.<p>In verse 7 Paul uses a Greek term referring to gymnastic exercise with respect to exercise unto godliness. We know from 3:16 that the mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh, is great. By our spirit with the indwelling Spirit we must exercise ourselves unto this goal, unto the expression of God.<p>In verse 8 Paul continues, &#8220;For bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the present life and of the life which is coming.&#8221; The words &#8220;a little&#8221; denote a few things to a small extent of our being, in contrast with all things. &#8220;All things&#8221; refer not only to one part of our being, but to all parts- physical, psychological, and spiritual-both temporal and eternal. The promise of the present life which is in this age is like that in Matthew 6:33; John 16:33; Philippians 4:6-7; and 1 Peter 5:8-10. The promise of the coming life which is in the next age and in eternity is like that in 2 Peter 1:10-11; 2 Timothy 2:12; Revelation 2:7, 17; 21:6-7. A promise like that in Mark 10:29-30 is both of the present life and of the coming life.<p>Once again, I would urge you to refuse all profane and old-womanish tales. Even talk about doctrines such as eternal security can be nothing more than an old-womanish tale. People may come to us after a meeting and say, &#8220;I have been to the meetings of the church a number of times. But I have not yet heard a message on eternal security. What do you think about this?&#8221; Others may want to discuss the seventh-day Sabbath. This also is to talk of old-womanish tales.<p>In applying the matter of old-womanish tales to the talk common among today&#8217;s Christians, I am following the principle established by Paul. Here in 1 Timothy the old-womanish tales probably refer to Jewish tales. Those with a background in Judaism were familiar with many tales. In the same principle, those who have spent years in Christianity also know many tales. Some come to us and ask about healing, speaking in tongues, prophesying, and even the lengthening of legs. I have known many persons who spoke in tongues but who did not exhibit godliness in their daily living. We must be a living testimony of those who refuse the old-womanish tales and who continually exercise themselves unto godliness.<p>It is of crucial importance that we exercise unto godliness. Inwardly we need nourishment, and outwardly, we should have godliness. From within we should be nourished with Christ, and then we should have a living which is the expression of God.<h2 class=head1>V. A PATTERN TO THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>In verse 10 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;For to this end we labor and strive, because we have set our hope on the living God, Who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.&#8221; Because our God is living, we can set our hope on Him.<p>In verse 12 Paul says to Timothy, &#8220;Let no one despise your youth, but be a pattern to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.&#8221; Although Timothy was young, he was charged by the apostle to bear the responsibility of caring for the building up of a local church and appointing elders and deacons. For such a responsibility, he was charged not to be childish, but to be a pattern to the believers. He was to be an example in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity. He was to be pure, without mixture, in motive and act.<p>Verse 13 says, &#8220;Until I come, attend to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.&#8221; Here Paul does not refer to reading in the sense of study, but to reading aloud in public. According to the context, this kind of public reading may be for exhortation and teaching.<h2 class=head1>VI. NOT NEGLECTING THE GIFT</h2><p>Verse 14 continues, &#8220;Do not neglect the gift which is in you, which was given to you by means of prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the elders.&#8221; Here Paul speaks not of the gift which was upon Timothy, but of the gift which was in him. This was probably a teaching gift, according to the context of verses 11, 13, and 16. This may also be confirmed by 1 Timothy 1:3; 4:6; 5:7; 6:2, 12, 20; 2 Timothy 1:13-14; 2:2, 14-15, 24-25; 4:2, 5.<p>Paul&#8217;s word about the gift being &#8220;in you&#8221; indicates that the gift mentioned here is not an outward endowment, but the inward ability of life to minister to others. It is not a miraculous gift, such as speaking in tongues or healing (1 Cor. 12:28), but the gift of grace, such as teaching and exhorting (Rom. 12:7-8).<p>This gift was given by means of prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the elders. Laying on of hands has two functions: one for identification, as in Leviticus 1:4, and the other for impartation, as here. Through the laying on of the hands of the elders and the Apostle Paul (2 Tim. 1:6), the gift of grace was imparted to Timothy.<p>Literally the Greek word for elders should be rendered presbytery, meaning the body of elders, the eldership. The elders, who are the overseers (3:2), represent a local church, which is the expression of the Body of Christ. The laying on of the hands of the elders signifies that the Body of Christ participated with God in imparting the gift of grace to Timothy. This was not a personal matter; it was a Body matter.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE NINE</h1><h1 class=title>DEALING WITH THE SAINTS OF DIFFERENT AGES</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 5:1-16</h1><h2 class=head1>THE DIVINE STANDARD AND THE HUMAN LEVEL</h2><p>At the end of chapter three Paul comes to the high point of God&#8217;s economy. In 3:15 and 16 we see the divine standard. But in 5:1-16 Paul comes down to the human level. On the one hand, in the church life we must have the divine standard; on the other hand, we must care for matters on the human level. In 5:8, for example, Paul speaks of providing for our own relatives. All the instructions in this chapter are very human, normal, and ordinary. Nothing is special, miraculous, or supernatural. The whole book is written in the same principle. This is necessary for the church life.<p>The principle of presenting both the divine standard and the human level is found not only in 1 Timothy, but also in the Epistles of Ephesians and Colossians. In Ephesians Paul first writes concerning the church according to the divine standard. Afterward, on the human level, he writes about husbands, wives, parents, children, slaves, and masters. In like manner, in Colossians Paul first writes about Christ according to the divine standard. Then he speaks on a human level about family matters. In 1 Timothy Paul does not come to the human level directly. Rather, he comes to this level by giving instructions to Timothy. In 5:1-16 Paul tells Timothy how to deal with the saints of different ages. My burden in this message is to cover four points from 5:1-16.<h2 class=head1>LIVING A NORMAL HUMAN LIFE</h2><p>First, all the instructions given here are presented in a very human way. We should never think that if we reach God&#8217;s standard, we no longer need to be human. Some believers have been influenced by the false teaching that Christians should be like angels, that it is no longer necessary for them to lead a normal human life. Many monks and priests in Catholicism have a living that is abnormal. Furthermore, the requirement that priests and nuns not be married not only is contrary to humanity, but has its source in demons. According to Paul&#8217;s word in 4:1-3, forbidding others to marry is a demonic teaching.<p>We all need to learn to be human. In fact, the more spiritual we are, the more human we shall be. If we would live Christ, we must learn to be human in a genuine way. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was very human.<p>To damage humanity is to ruin both the means and the channel created by God for His economy. The reason demons and fallen angels forbid marriage and command people to abstain from foods is that their intention is to destroy mankind. Thus, we in the church must be human and follow the standards of normal human living. Some have falsely accused us of not being human. We utterly repudiate these allegations. In the church life we definitely emphasize the proper humanity. I can testify that I myself live in a normal human way. If you examine my living, you will find me to be very human. I am not a &#8220;saint&#8221; or an angel; I am simply a human being. Furthermore, I encourage all the elders to be human. The elders should not help the saints in their locality to be like angels. We appreciate the angels, but we do not want to imitate them. Instead, we prefer to be human.<p>We should be human Christians. On the one hand, we have the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4); on the other hand, we are normal human beings. The fact that we have the divine nature with the divine life does not mean that we shall ever be deified. Rather, we are to live a genuinely human life by the divine life and nature. In this way we shall be able to live the highest human life, a life like that of the Lord Jesus. When He was on earth, He lived a human life by means of the divine life and the divine nature. The Lord&#8217;s human living was by the divine life. Our human living should be the same. Thus, we all must learn to be human.<p>In 5:1-16 we see that Paul instructed his young co-worker Timothy to contact the saints in a human way. Verse 1 says, &#8220;Do not upbraid an elderly man, but entreat him as a father.&#8221; To entreat an elderly man as a father is surely to behave in a very human manner. In relation to brothers who are a generation older than they, the younger brothers should deal with them as fathers.<p>Paul also tells Timothy to entreat &#8220;younger men as brothers; elderly women as mothers; younger women as sisters.&#8221; Timothy was not to assume an elevated position as a bishop, regarding himself as superior to others. On the contrary, he was to behave as a brother to younger brothers and sisters, as a son to a father, and as a son to a mother. In the church life there are many fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters. To deal with the saints as such is to behave humanly.<p>Our contact with the saints must be in a proper atmosphere and with the right attitude and spirit. The atmosphere, attitude, and spirit in our contact with others mean a great deal. If a young brother assumes some kind of elevated position in relation to an elderly man, the relationship between them will be damaged. But if he would contact him as a son speaking to a father, their fellowship will be intimate, loving, touching, and even inspiring.<p>Suppose that in my relationship with the saints I conduct myself as a teacher and treat the saints as my pupils. If this is my attitude, my contact with the saints will be quite poor. But if I am very human in my relationships with the saints and regard myself as a brother among brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, the contact will be loving and intimate. What a difference it makes when we are truly human in our relationships to one another! I repeat, in the church life we all must be human.<h2 class=head1>EXERCISING WISDOM</h2><p>In 5:1-16 we see in the second place that Paul instructed Timothy to exercise wisdom. His word not to upbraid an elderly man, but to entreat him as a father is a word of wisdom. It is a matter of wisdom not to rebuke sharply an elderly man. In dealing with saints of different ages, we need not only love, but also wisdom. We need to realize whom we are contacting. Are we speaking to an elderly brother or sister? Then we must speak to them as a son to a father or mother. Are we contacting a younger brother or sister? Then we must speak to them as a brother to a brother or a brother to a sister. Furthermore, we should speak one way to a father, another way to a mother, and in other ways to brothers and sisters. For example, in our human family we do not speak in the same way to all members of the family. We do not talk to our father in the same way as we do to our mother. If we speak the same way to all members of our family, we are indeed foolish. In all our relationships with saints of different ages we need wisdom.<p>If we exercise wisdom, we shall speak differently to saints of different ages. The brothers will talk to brothers in a way appropriate to brothers, but they will speak to sisters in a way appropriate to sisters. This is wisdom. We must not speak to a young sister in the same way as we do to an elderly man. Furthermore, one sister may embrace another. But a young sister should not show her love for a brother, young or old, by embracing him. Do not love the saints in a foolish way. Instead, always exercise wisdom, realizing whom you are contacting.<h2 class=head1>IN ALL PURITY</h2><p>Third, all our dealings with the saints must be &#8220;in all purity&#8221; (5:2). Every contact with the brothers and sisters in the church life must be pure in every way. We need to be pure in our motive and intention.<p>In the contact between brothers and sisters there is especially the need for all purity. For this reason, a brother and sister who are close to the same age should not talk privately in a closed room. Either another brother or another sister should be present. Consider the example of the Lord Jesus. He spoke to Nicodemus in a house alone at night, but He talked to the Samaritan woman out in the open during the day. This indicates that the contact between brothers and sisters must be in all purity.<p>In the church life the traffic in fellowship between brothers and sisters cannot be avoided. If we do not exercise all purity, we may fall into some kind of snare. Many have fallen into a snare because they were careless and failed to exercise purity in their contact with others. Therefore, we would emphasize again and again that the contact between brothers and sisters must be in all purity.<p>As we have indicated, our contact with all the saints, brothers and sisters, elderly and young, must be pure in every way. In speaking to an elderly sister as a mother, you need to be pure in your motive. It is evil to have impure motives. To have an impure motive means to seek gain for ourselves, to seek some kind of advantage or promotion. In our contact with all the saints in the church life we should have just one motive-to minister Christ to them that they may grow in the Lord.<h2 class=head1>DOING OUR DUTY</h2><p>The fourth point I would bring out in this message is the matter of our duty. We need to be human, we need to exercise wisdom, we need to have all purity, and we need to do our duty. In the church life everyone must have certain duties to perform. No one should be idle or a busybody. In 5:4 Paul says, &#8220;But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show godliness toward their own household and to render a return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God.&#8221; Return here denotes requital, recompense. To render such a return is to show gratitude to one&#8217;s parents.<p>In verse 13 Paul speaks of those who &#8220;learn to be idle, going around from house to house; and not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.&#8221; Some are idle, seemingly having nothing to do. But their idleness causes them to become busybodies. They go around from house to house gossiping and &#8220;speaking things which they ought not.&#8221; No one in the church should be idle, and no one should be a gossip or a busybody. Instead, everyone should have something to do, some proper duty to perform.<p>Realizing the need for all the saints to do their duty, Paul tells Timothy not to allow a widow to be enrolled who is under sixty years old (v. 9). He then tells Timothy to refuse younger widows, for they may set aside their first pledge, or faith (vv. 11-12). Setting aside &#8220;their first pledge&#8221; means to break a pledge or promise. This indicates that some younger widows promised, pledged, to devote themselves in their widowhood to some service of the church.<p>In verse 14 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;I will therefore that younger widows marry, bear children, rule the house, give no occasion to the opposer for reproach.&#8221; Childbearing and house affairs are a rescue and safeguard to idle busybodies. This is God&#8217;s ordination to restrict and protect women since the fall (Gen. 3:16).<p>Paul&#8217;s word in verse 14 about younger widows marrying is somewhat of a contrast to what he says in 1 Corinthians 7:8. The word in 1 Corinthians was Paul&#8217;s wish in his earlier ministry. In 5:14 we have his advice in his later ministry, according to his experiences concerning young widows. The difference here indicates that even in his God-inspired teachings, Paul was not legal. On the contrary, he could be very flexible. This indicates that, in the New Testament, concerning some matters there is no legality. In certain cases, the way we take may vary according to the actual situation.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TEN</h1><h1 class=title>DEALING WITH THE ELDERS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 5:17-25</h1><p>In 5:17-25 Paul instructs Timothy concerning how to deal with the elders. The elders are the authority, or the government, of a local church. Thus, to deal with the elders is to deal with the authority, the government, the administration, of the church. For centuries there has been a debate among Christians over the kind of administration there should be in the church. In 5:17-25 Paul touches the crucial matter of the church&#8217;s administration.<h2 class=head1>I. ELDERS COUNTED WORTHY OF DOUBLE HONOR</h2><p>Verses 17 and 18 say, &#8220;Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching. For the Scripture says, You shall not muzzle a threshing ox, and, The workman is worthy of his pay.&#8221; According to verse 18, the expression &#8220;double honor&#8221; includes material supply. Especially those who labor in word and teaching should receive this necessary supply. All the elders should be able to take the lead in a local church, but some, not all, have a special capacity in teaching. The word in verse 17 denotes the general speaking of doctrines, and teaching denotes instructions concerning particular things. Those who labor in word and teaching may be fully occupied, devoting all their time to this. Therefore, the church and the saints should care for their living. For this reason, in verse 18 Paul refers to what the Scripture says about not muzzling a threshing ox and about the workman being worthy of his pay.<h2 class=head1>II. AN ACCUSATION AGAINST AN ELDER</h2><p>In verse 19 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;Against an elder do not receive an accusation, except on the word of two or three witnesses.&#8221; According to the Greek here, the accusation made against an elder should not merely be verbal; rather, it should be put in writing. To make an accusation against an elder is a very serious matter. For the sake of accuracy, it should be put in writing and not merely be spoken. Furthermore, it should not be received except on the word of two or three witnesses.<p>Verse 19 is simple, but it implies something very important. The fact that Timothy was charged by Paul to receive an accusation against an elder indicates that the apostles have authority to deal with the elders after they have been appointed by the apostles to be elders. There is no doubt that the written accusation against an elder was to be presented to Timothy. Who, then, was Timothy? According to those who are in favor of a hierarchical system in which the bishops are over the elders, Timothy is regarded as a bishop. But as we have previously pointed out, according to the New Testament, bishops are elders, and elders are bishops. These terms are synonymous and refer to the same people. We know from 1 Thessalonians 1:1 and 2:6 that Timothy was an apostle. Furthermore, in the book of 1 Timothy we see that Timothy was the representative of the Apostle Paul. Therefore, for an accusation to come to Timothy was for it to come to an apostle. We would expect such an accusation to come to the apostles because they were the ones who had appointed the elders.<p>Some have had the concept from reading Brother Nee&#8217;s book The Normal Christian Church Life that once apostles have appointed elders in a particular local church, the apostles do not under any circumstances have the right to interfere with the affairs of that church. This, however, is a misunderstanding of Brother Nee&#8217;s word. In another book, Church Affairs, Brother Nee points out that after the elders have been appointed by the apostles, they should take the lead in the church according to the apostles&#8217; teaching. If the elders lead others astray or if they are wrong in some way, accusation against them can be made by the saints to the apostles.<p>However, an apostle is not a pope. If we read the New Testament carefully, we shall see that the elders are not appointed by anyone who is a dictator or who exercises autonomous authority. On the contrary, elders are appointed in the way of life. As the saints in a particular locality meet together to worship God and to serve the Lord, it will be manifested that certain brothers have a greater degree of maturity than others. Although no one will be fully mature, some will be comparatively mature. Not even in Philippians 3 did Paul regard himself as matured in full. Because maturity is relative, the qualifications of an elder are not absolute. In other words, an elder&#8217;s qualifications are comparative. Among all the saints in a local church, certain brothers, by comparison, are more qualified and mature than others. These brothers are manifested as such before the eyes of the church, and all the saints clearly realize that these are the ones who should be appointed elders. This appointment does not come either by a vote of the congregation or by the exercise of autonomous authority. Instead, elders are selected according to the insight and foresight of the saints. Based upon the saints&#8217; insight and foresight, the apostles then appoint certain ones to be elders. The apostles minister the Word, bring others to the Lord&#8217;s salvation, and edify them after they are saved; they also establish these believers as a local church. Therefore, they have the standing and the position to say that those who have been manifested as relatively more mature than others should be appointed elders.<p>In verse 20 Paul continues, &#8220;Those who sin reprove before all that the rest also may be in fear.&#8221; The fact that apostles can rebuke elders who sin indicates that the apostles have authority over the elders. The expression &#8220;before all&#8221; refers to the whole church. A sinning elder should receive public reproof because of his public position. If an elder is reproved publicly, the rest of the elders will be &#8220;in fear.&#8221;<p>Verse 21 says, &#8220;I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels that you guard these things without prejudice, doing nothing by way of partiality.&#8221; The elders in a local church are God&#8217;s deputy authority. Dealing with them is a solemn thing before God. Hence, the apostle solemnly charged Timothy before God, Christ, and the angels to do it in such a way that the chosen angels, the good angels with God&#8217;s authority, may see that His authority is established and maintained among His redeemed people on earth.<p>Paul&#8217;s use of the term &#8220;chosen angels&#8221; indicates that here he is dealing with administration, government, authority. The book of Daniel indicates that the chosen angels are authorities, representatives of God&#8217;s administration. Paul deliberately uses the term &#8220;chosen angels&#8221; to indicate that here his instructions are related to administration, government, and authority in the church. Paul not only charged Timothy before God and Christ Jesus, but also charged him before the chosen angels.<p>Paul&#8217;s charge to Timothy in verse 21 was to &#8220;guard these things without prejudice, doing nothing by way of partiality.&#8221; To guard is to observe and keep. Prejudice refers to prejudgment, condemnation, before hearing the case, and partiality refers to inclination, favor, or bias. The words &#8220;without prejudice&#8221; imply without prejudgment to the credit of the accuser, whereas &#8220;doing nothing by way of partiality&#8221; implies no perverted favor to the accused elder. On the one hand, Timothy was not to take sides with those who made an accusation against an elder. To give them credit in a hasty way would be to show prejudice. On the other hand, Timothy was not to be partial, not to show perverted favor, to the elder against whom the accusation was made. Therefore, in handling an accusation against an elder, three matters should be observed: first, there must be the word of two or three witnesses; second, there should be no prejudice; and third, nothing should be done by partiality. No credit should be given privately to the accusers, and there should not be any perverted favor toward the one accused.<h2 class=head1>III. LAYING HANDS ON ELDERS</h2><p>In order to follow these instructions, Timothy was charged not to act in haste. Verse 22 says, &#8220;Lay hands quickly on no man, nor participate in others&#8217; sins; keep yourself pure.&#8221; We have seen that laying on of hands has two functions, identification and impartation. According to the context of the previous verses, here the laying on of hands refers primarily to laying hands on the elders. This should not be done hastily.<p>In verse 23 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;No longer drink water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent weaknesses.&#8221; According to the context, this verse implies that the condition of one&#8217;s physical health may affect his spiritual dealing with others.<p>In verses 24 and 25 Paul says, &#8220;The sins of some men are manifest beforehand, going before to judgment, and some also they follow after. Likewise also, the good works are manifest beforehand, and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden.&#8221; The word sins in verse 24 indicates that this verse continues verse 22. It explains that some people&#8217;s sins are manifest earlier and others&#8217;, later. Hence, we should not lay hands on anyone in haste. What is mentioned here concerning the judging of sins is a principle applicable both to man&#8217;s judgment and God&#8217;s. The words &#8220;some also they follow after&#8221; refer to the sins of others now being hidden, but later manifest, going to judgment later.<p>The implication of the apostle&#8217;s charge in these two verses is that Timothy should not approve a person hastily because sins have not been manifested, nor condemn a person in haste because good works have not been manifested. Often a person&#8217;s wrongdoings are concealed. It takes time for them to be exposed. However, sometimes a person&#8217;s good deeds are also hidden, possibly covered by false accusations and rumors. Time is also necessary for the falsehood to be dispelled and the real situation to be brought to light. Thus, we should not make a quick decision whether an elder is right or wrong. Instead, we should wait and allow time to expose the situation.<p>It is easy for us to make quick decisions and hasty judgments. But even though it is difficult to take time in matters such as these, we need to learn not to be hasty. The elders should follow this principle in caring for the church. They should not judge anything or anyone hastily. What they do should be with witnesses and without prejudice, partiality, or haste.<p>A number of times saints have come to me with accusations against an elder. My response always has been to say, &#8220;Let me pray and then have fellowship with some co-workers about this situation.&#8221; Because an accuser sometimes wanted a hasty judgment, he rebuked me and claimed that I took sides with the one accused. However, I did not take sides with anyone. Instead, I wanted to pray and have fellowship with others in order not to act in haste.<p>The church is very different from any worldly organization and also different from organized Christianity. The church is according to the Lord&#8217;s mercy and grace and under His authority. In dealing with the administration of the church, we must observe the four points of having witnesses and of acting without prejudice, partiality, or haste. Do not show prejudice in receiving an accusation, and do not show partiality in defending anyone against accusation. Instead, take time, pray, have fellowship with those who possess spiritual insight, and wait for the Lord&#8217;s leading.<p>Often elders have told me of the need for more elders in their locality. Usually they would recommend someone to be appointed to the eldership. Then I would ask how long the brother has been saved, how long he has been in the church life, and how much he has grown in the Lord. Then I would encourage the brothers to wait for another period of time and also to pray. As a result, many have learned that my practice is always to tell others to wait and pray. Actually, this is not my policy; it is the instruction of the Apostle Paul. After a period of time has passed and the leading ones in a certain place still feel that a brother should be appointed to the eldership and that, comparatively speaking, there is no one more qualified than he, I may recommend that he serve as an apprentice in order to be proved. This means that he will share the responsibility of an elder, but yet not occupy the position of an elder.<p>In dealing with the administration of a local church, we follow neither the way of dictatorship nor democracy. Elders are not appointed by a dictator; neither are they elected by a vote of the congregation. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery there is no such thing as an autonomous dictator. We do not practice dictatorship, but we do recognize the divine authority, the divine life, and the divine light. The administration of a local church is not according to the way of worldly government or organization. But in the church we have the Lord&#8217;s headship with the divine nature, life, light, wisdom, and grace. Therefore, we pray and wait on Him as we watch and observe the growth of the saints. In those very rare cases where there is ground for accusation against an elder, we do not act in haste. On the contrary, we wait and pray. We know from verses 24 and 25 that eventually a person&#8217;s sins or good works will be manifest. As the snow melts and exposes the rocks hidden beneath it, so either a person&#8217;s sins or his good deeds will eventually be brought to light. For this reason, we neither receive an accusation against an elder nor justify an elder in a hasty way. Rather, we would make sure that the accusation is substantiated by two or three witnesses and then we would act without prejudice, partiality, or haste. Furthermore, we acknowledge the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty and wait for Him to make the situation clear.<p>Many have accused me of being a pope and of acting like an autonomous dictator to control the local churches. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery today, there are approximately four hundred churches in addition to those in mainland China. About three hundred seventy of these churches have been established directly by the ministry in the past thirty-one years. I certainly do not control all these churches. Some people, however, may ask why the churches and the saints pay attention to what I say in the ministry. They listen simply because I feed them and minister Christ to them. We thank the Lord that, in His mercy, He has opened His Word to us and established the ministry of the Word among us so that all the churches may be supplied and that all the saints may be nourished. The Lord&#8217;s way to care for the churches is the way of supply and nourishment.<p>Very rarely is there any exercise of authority among us in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. I avoid the exercise of authority whenever possible. Even though I may have the standing in the Lord to say something, my practice is not to exercise authority. In like manner, rarely do the elders in the local churches exercise authority. Our desire is to care for the saints, to love them, feed them, comfort them, and encourage them. This is the proper way for elders to function, for we are not an organization, but we are an organic entity, the Body of Christ.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ELEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>DEALING WITH SLAVES AND MONEY LOVERS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 6:1-10</h1><p>In 6:1-10 Paul deals with slaves and with money lovers. In verses 1 and 2 he speaks concerning slaves. Then in verse 3 he suddenly refers to teaching differently and not consenting to healthy words. Then in verse 7 he begins to talk about the love of money. Apparently the dealing with slaves has nothing to do with different teachings, and the different teachings are not related to the love of money. Nevertheless, in 6:1-10 Paul put these things together. This is indicated by the word &#8220;if&#8221; at the beginning of verse 3 and the word &#8220;for&#8221; at the beginning of verse 7. The use of these words at the beginning of these verses indicates that they are a continuation of the foregoing verses.<p>In studying the Bible we should not be careless. Even little words such as &#8220;if&#8221; and &#8220;for&#8221; deserve our attention. Paying attention to words such as these often can bring in light. These words not only enable us to see the continuation in thought; they also afford a way for light to come in. Because by the Lord&#8217;s mercy we have received so much light from the Word, we can say that in the recovery we know the Bible in the way of life, light, and spirit.<p>In the United States today there are different kinds of theology. Certain seminaries teach modernistic theology, which denies the authority of the Bible and teaches that Jesus was merely a man, that His death on the cross was not for redemption but was merely an act of martyrdom, and that He did not rise from the dead. In the theology departments of some secular colleges and universities, religion and theology are regarded merely as part of man&#8217;s culture. However, in other seminaries fundamental theology is taught. Nevertheless, the standard concerning the truth is not very high. The highest standard of theology found among Christians today in the United States is that which has its source in the teachings of the Brethren, especially as those teachings were made popular by Dr. C. I. Scofield and his famous Reference Bible and correspondence courses. Although Scofield adopted nearly all the teachings of the Brethren, he rejected the Brethren way to practice the church life. The leading teacher among the Brethren was J. N. Darby. Anyone who calls himself a theologian but who is not familiar with the writings of Darby is not a theologian of the highest caliber.<p>In 1925 I wrote to Brother Nee asking him which book, according to his knowledge, would be the best to help me understand the Bible verse by verse. As a young believer, I was eager to obtain a thorough knowledge of the Word of God. I wanted to understand every verse of the Bible, from the first verse in Genesis to the last verse in Revelation. Brother Nee told me that the best help in knowing the Bible in this way was Darby&#8217;s Synopsis of the Books of the Bible. Eight years later he gave me a copy of this five volume work.<p>J. N. Darby and his contemporaries were great teachers of the Bible. According to history, the Bible was opened more to the Brethren teachers than to anyone who had gone before them. These Brethren teachers did not know the Word merely according to tradition or according to letters in black and white; they knew the Bible according to fresh light which came directly from the Lord. Having been enlightened by the Lord, they received the vision and the revelation of many truths in the Word.<p>Christians today often talk about the Bible in dead letters. Some are familiar with Bible geography and history; they also know certain elementary teachings. However, they may not have any light or revelation.<p>We have pointed out that it is possible for Christians to speak of certain Bible doctrines as if they were nothing more than old-womanish tales. For some, even the doctrine of justification by faith is a &#8220;tale.&#8221; For example, a particular Lutheran pastor in China fifty years ago taught justification by faith. Nevertheless, he himself was an opium smuggler. As far as he was concerned, justification by faith was nothing more than a &#8220;tale.&#8221; Concerning this matter, he was altogether without light or revelation. One day an elderly lady evangelist from Norway, who was very prevailing in the preaching of regeneration, stopped this Lutheran pastor after a meeting and asked him if he had been regenerated. When he tried to tell her that he had been regenerated, she said that simply by looking at his face, she knew that he had not been regenerated. This Lutheran pastor was insulted and so much filled with hatred for this lady evangelist that he plotted that night to murder her. But at that very hour the Holy Spirit enlightened him and rebuked him, and he repented and cried to the Lord. The next morning when this lady evangelist saw him, she looked at his face and said, &#8220;Praise the Lord, you have been regenerated!&#8221; Then in the meeting this pastor gave his testimony with great impact. This influenced hundreds of young people to be saved. The case of this Lutheran pastor illustrates the difference between knowing the Bible merely according to the black and white letters and knowing the Word according to the shining of the divine light.<p>Among Christians today there are many old-womanish tales. Not only are there &#8220;tales&#8221; about doctrine, but also &#8220;tales&#8221; having to do with so-called miracles. A certain Pentecostal pastor once told me about teeth that were supposedly filled miraculously with gold. Another Pentecostal minister claimed that in a certain meeting a person in the congregation miraculously spoke in Chinese. Both stories, however, were nothing more than &#8220;tales.&#8221;<p>The apostle&#8217;s teaching in 1 Timothy is far superior to old-womanish tales. Furthermore, in this Epistle there is no mention of miraculous things. On the contrary, in 5:23 Paul tells Timothy, &#8220;No longer drink water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent weaknesses.&#8221; Here Paul does not exercise a miraculous gift to heal his co-worker. Instead, he encourages Timothy to be human, not religious, and to care for his health in a human way.<p>Many of those who teach the Bible do not have any light or revelation. They merely teach the Word according to the black and white letters, perhaps also giving out information about geography or history. Where can you hear a message from 1 Timothy 1:4 on the subject of God&#8217;s dispensation in the New Testament? By the Lord&#8217;s mercy, He has shined upon us and made known His truth. For this reason, I hope that reputable theologians and professors will study the Recovery Version and the Life-study Messages, even study them in a critical way. I believe that if they study our writings, they will receive light.<h2 class=head1>I. WITH SLAVES UNDER THE YOKE</h2><p>Let us now consider the logical connection between 6:2 and 3 and between 6:6 and 7. In 6:1 and 2 Paul charges those who are slaves under the yoke to count their masters worthy of all honor so that &#8220;the name of God and the teaching be not blasphemed.&#8221; The word blasphemed means ill spoken of, reproached. Furthermore, Paul charges the slaves who have believing masters to serve them in a proper way. Paul concludes verse 2 with the words, &#8220;These things teach and exhort.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>II. WITH MONEY LOVERS</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Teaching Differently</h2><p>Then in verses 3 and 4 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;If anyone teaches differently and does not consent to healthy words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching which is according to godliness, he is blinded with pride.&#8221; To teach differently is to teach things that differ from the apostles&#8217; teaching centered on Christ and the church. The &#8220;healthy words&#8221; here refer to the health of life. The sound teaching of the apostles ministers healthy teaching as the supply of life to people. The words of our Lord Jesus Christ are words of life (John 6:63); hence, they are healthy words. The healthy words of the Lord are the source of the teaching according to godliness. When the Lord&#8217;s words of life are taught, particularly in certain aspects, they become the teaching according to godliness. The living words of the Lord always bring forth godliness-a life that lives Christ and expresses God in Christ.<p>Paul&#8217;s word in 6:3 concerning teaching differently indicates that even his teaching concerning slaves was according to the healthy words of the Lord Jesus. Paul&#8217;s teaching was according to godliness. However, because some did not consent to healthy words, they taught differently. They did not teach according to godliness. Thus, there is definitely a connection between verses 2 and 3.<p>All our teaching must be according to the healthy words of God&#8217;s economy. Even those who care for the children in the children&#8217;s meeting should teach the children in principle according to the healthy words of the Lord Jesus. This means that the children should receive teaching which is according to godliness.<h2 class=head2>B. Blinded with Pride</h2><p>In 6:4 and 5 Paul says that the one who teaches differently and who does not consent to healthy words is &#8220;blinded with pride, understanding nothing, but is sick with questionings and contentions of words, out of which come envy, strife, revilings, evil suspicions, perpetual wranglings of men corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth, supposing godliness to be a means of gain.&#8221; Teachings differing from the healthy words of the Lord always issue from people&#8217;s pride with self-conceit which blinds them. Paul and his co-workers taught in a certain way. But some who were blinded with pride deliberately taught differently. To them, it was humiliating to teach the same as others. I can testify that when I was in China, I was very happy to teach the same thing as Brother Nee. As much as possible, I even used the same terms Brother Nee used, for I realized that in this way I was carrying out the Lord&#8217;s ministry.<p>In verse 4 Paul uses the expression &#8220;sick with questionings.&#8221; To question and contend about words is a sickness. &#8220;Sick&#8221; here is in contrast to &#8220;healthy&#8221; in verse 3.<p>The word revilings in 6:4 literally means blasphemies. As in Colossians 3:8, it refers here to revilings, railings toward man, not blasphemies toward God.<p>We have seen that in verse 5 Paul speaks of &#8220;perpetual wranglings of men corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth, supposing godliness to be a means of gain.&#8221; The Greek for &#8220;perpetual wranglings&#8221; can also be rendered &#8220;incessant quarrels.&#8221; These wranglings are carried on by men corrupted and depraved in mind and deprived, bereft, destitute, of the truth. The Greek word for &#8220;deprived&#8221; implies that these are ones who once possessed the truth, but now it has been put away from them. Hence, they are destitute of the truth.<p>In verse 5 Paul refers to those who suppose &#8220;godliness to be a means of gain.&#8221; They make godliness a way of gain- material profit, a gain-making trade. The desire for material gain is another reason certain ones teach differently. Thus, because of pride and the desire for profit, for riches, some today are teaching differently. Pride is related to wanting a name and a good reputation, and gain is related to money and material profit.<h2 class=head2>C. Godliness with Contentment</h2><p>In verse 6 Paul says, &#8220;But godliness with contentment is great gain.&#8221; Concerning the expression &#8220;contentment,&#8221; Vincent says, &#8220;An inward self-sufficiency, as opposed to the lack or the desire of outward things. It was a favourite Stoic word.&#8221; The expression &#8220;great gain&#8221; means great means of gain. It mainly denotes the blessings in this age-godliness plus self-sufficiency and the ability to be free from greediness and the cares of this age.<p>Paul&#8217;s mention of gain in verses 5 and 6 brings him to the matter of dealing with money lovers in verses 7 through 10. For this reason, he uses the conjunction &#8220;for&#8221; to join verses 6 and 7.<p>Once again I would point out that because we pay attention to these details, we have come to know the Bible in the way of life, light, and spirit. We do not claim to know the Bible more than others do in geography or history. Neither do we claim the ability to recite more verses. But we can testify that by the Lord&#8217;s mercy and through the help of great Bible teachers who have gone before us, the Lord has shown us much light. The Lord has given us light, life, and spirit through the Word. The Psalmist once declared, &#8220;The entrance of thy words giveth light&#8221; (119:130). Furthermore, the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life&#8221; (John 6:63). We praise the Lord for giving us light, life, and spirit!<p>The Lord Jesus was raised in a carpenter&#8217;s home in Nazareth and was regarded as one who was unlearned. But there can be no doubt that He had tremendous light, life, and spirit. To have light, life, and spirit does not depend on one&#8217;s scholarship or degrees. On the contrary, our confidence in our education can hinder us from receiving light, life, and spirit through the Word.<p>In 6:7 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;For we have brought nothing into the world; it is evident that neither can we carry anything out.&#8221; This has been wisely ordained by God that we may trust in Him for our needs and live by Him in order to express Him without preoccupation or distraction.<p>Verse 8 continues, &#8220;But having food and covering, with these we shall be satisfied.&#8221; Although the word covering refers to clothing, it may include dwelling. To be satisfied is to have sufficient provision for our needs.<h2 class=head2>D. The Desire to Be Rich</h2><p>In verse 9 Paul says, &#8220;But those who resolve to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge men into ruin and destruction.&#8221; The resolve mentioned here is related to the strong desire to be rich. This is the love of riches, not the possession of them, that leads the avaricious into temptation. Some are actually rich; others have only a strong desire for riches. This evil desire ruins and destroys them. Ruin here implies destruction, and destruction implies perdition, both temporal and eternal. Those who resolve to be rich fall into a snare, as into a net, and also into many foolish and harmful lustful desires, which cause men to drown or sink into ruin and destruction.<p>In verse 10 Paul concludes, &#8220;For the love of money is a root of all evils, which some having aspired after have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.&#8221; Paul says that the love of money is a root of all evils. He does not say that it is the only root. The Greek word rendered aspired after means craved for, longed for. Those with this craving have wandered away from the faith; they have been led astray from the contents of our belief, from the truth of God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWELVE</h1><h1 class=title>A MAN OF GOD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 6:11-21</h1><p>In 1:4 we read of God&#8217;s dispensation, and in 6:11 Paul uses the expression &#8220;man of God.&#8221; Hence, this book begins with God&#8217;s dispensation and concludes with the charge to a man of God. God&#8217;s desire is to produce men of God by dispensing Himself into those who believe in Christ. A man of God is one who partakes of God&#8217;s life and nature (John 1:13; 2 Pet. 1:4) and thus becomes one with Him in His life and nature (1 Cor. 6:17) and thereby expresses Him. This corresponds to the mystery of godliness, which is God manifest in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16).<h2 class=head1>FLEEING AND PURSUING</h2><p>First Timothy 6:11 says, &#8220;But you, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, meekness.&#8221; On the one hand, Paul charges Timothy to flee certain things and, on the other hand, to pursue certain other things. Timothy must flee the negative things previously mentioned in this Epistle. He should pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and meekness. It is significant that Paul does not tell Timothy to pursue power, gifts, miracles, and theological training. Furthermore, as we shall see, in verse 12 Paul does not charge him to fight for his theology or to lay hold on the doctrinal knowledge he has accumulated. However, many Christians today pursue power, fight for doctrines, and lay hold on theological knowledge, and they charge the younger generation to do the same. They also promote natural gifts, talents, and abilities. But in 1 Timothy very little is said of man&#8217;s ability. Concerning the eldership, Paul tells Timothy that an elder should be apt to teach. This refers to the ability to instruct others like a parent helping a child with homework. Paul&#8217;s emphasis in 1 Timothy definitely is not on power, gifts, or natural ability.<p>Paul charges Timothy to pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and meekness. Righteousness is a matter of being right with people before God according to God&#8217;s righteous and strict requirements. If we would be those who carry out God&#8217;s dispensation for the building up of local churches as the expression of Christ, we must pursue righteousness. We must seek to be right with God and man.<p>In the second place, we should pursue godliness, the expression of God. In 4:7 Paul told Timothy to exercise himself unto godliness. A man of God should not pursue power or miraculous gifts. Instead, he should pursue righteousness and godliness; he should seek to be right with God and man in order to be a living expression of God in every way. This is to live a daily life which manifests God.<p>In verse 11 Paul lists faith after godliness. Faith is to believe in God and His word and to trust in Him and His word. As we have pointed out, faith involves an organic union by contacting God through the Word and in the Spirit. Faith, therefore, denotes a living union. Instead of pursuing a great work, we should pursue the organic union with the Triune God.<p>In 6:11 Paul goes on to mention love. We should be those who love others by the love of God (1 John 4:7-8, 19-21).<p>Paul also speaks of endurance and meekness. We should pursue endurance, the ability to bear sufferings and persecutions, and also meekness, which is a proper attitude in facing opposition. It is certain that if we live a godly life, we shall suffer. The world opposes God. If we live God and also live out God, expressing Him, we shall be opposed and attacked by the godless world. Thus, we should pursue endurance, and we should also pursue meekness.<h2 class=head1>FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT OF THE FAITH</h2><p>In verse 12 Paul continues his charge: &#8220;Fight the good fight of the faith.&#8221; To fight for the faith means to fight for God&#8217;s New Testament economy. In particular, it is to fight for Christ as the embodiment of God and for the church as the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>LAYING HOLD ON ETERNAL LIFE</h2><p>In verse 12 Paul also says, &#8220;Lay hold on the eternal life to which you were called and have confessed the good confession before many witnesses.&#8221; The eternal life here is the divine life, the uncreated life of God, which is eternal. Eternal denotes the nature more than the time element of the divine life. To fight the good fight of the faith in the Christian life, especially in the Christian ministry, we need to lay hold on this divine life and not trust in our human life. Hence, in 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, the eternal life is stressed again and again (1 Tim. 1:16; 6:19; 2 Tim. 1:1, 10; Titus 1:2; 3:7). To bring forth God&#8217;s dispensation concerning the church in 1 Timothy, to confront the process of the church&#8217;s decline in 2 Timothy, and to maintain good order in the church life in Titus, this life is a prerequisite.<p>We have been called to the eternal life of God. We were born of the human natural life, but we were reborn of the divine eternal life when we were called by God in Christ.<p>The words &#8220;confessed the good confession before many witnesses&#8221; may refer to Timothy&#8217;s confession of the faith at his baptism. At that time Timothy probably confessed a good confession of the eternal life before many witnesses, as we all should do, believing and being assured that he had received the life of God.<p>Verses 11 and 12 are a marvelous summary of nearly the whole New Testament. A man of God should pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and meekness; he should fight for God&#8217;s New Testament economy and lay hold on eternal life. All these matters are essential aspects of the New Testament. In contrast, the beasts in Revelation 13 and the lake of fire in Revelation 20 cannot compare with these essential aspects. We today must fight the good fight of the faith. This means that we must fight for Christ as the embodiment of God and for the church as the Body of Christ. Furthermore, we must not merely fight objectively, but fight subjectively by laying hold on eternal life. We should not do anything apart from this life. We should speak to our husband or wife and to our children not by the natural life, but by the eternal life. Even in the matter of buying a pair of shoes, we should live according to the eternal life to which we have been called. As today&#8217;s Timothys, we need to lay hold on eternal life.<p>In verse 12 Paul specifically says that we have been called to eternal life. No other book in the New Testament speaks of &#8220;the eternal life to which you were called.&#8221; This is a particular characteristic of 1 Timothy. Do you realize that you have been called to eternal life? This eternal life does not mainly refer to blessings in the future. To be called to eternal life does not mean that we have been called to enjoy blessings in heaven. Eternal life should be our life today, a life for our present daily living. By our first birth, the physical birth, we received the Adamic life. But because we have been called to eternal life, we should no longer live the Adamic life, the natural life. Yes, we must be truly human, even Jesusly human, but not in our natural life. On the contrary, we need to live a human life by the eternal life. We have been called to this life, and now we need to live it.<p>I am deeply burdened concerning this matter of being called to the eternal life. I am especially concerned for those dear saints who have been distracted from the eternal life to which we have been called and who have become preoccupied with other things. We have been called uniquely to eternal life. This life, the divine life, is actually the Triune God Himself. Having been called to eternal life, we now should lay hold on this life, live this life, and have our whole being according to this life.<h2 class=head1>THE CHARGE TO A MAN OF GOD</h2><p>In verse 13 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;I charge you before God, Who gives life to all things, and Christ Jesus, Who witnessed before Pontius Pilate the good confession.&#8221; Here Paul describes God as the One who gives life to all things. This indicates that we must focus our attention on life. Every aspect of our Christian walk must be something to which God can give life.<p>Paul&#8217;s concept in verse 13 is that God gives life and that when Christ was on earth, He lived the eternal life. He lived by the very God who gives life to all things. Then at the end of His journey on earth, He stood before Pontius Pilate and made a good confession. The Lord&#8217;s confession before Pilate was related to His living by the divine life. Now we can understand why Paul charges Timothy before God and before Christ Jesus. He charges Timothy before God because God gives life to all things, and he charges him before Christ Jesus because He lived the eternal life and confessed it before Pontius Pilate. Therefore, Paul indicates that Timothy must be such a person; that is, he must be a man of God. Christ was truly a man of God, living righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and meekness. Now Paul charges Timothy to be the same kind of person, a man of God living by the divine life.<p>In verse 14 Paul continues, &#8220;That you keep the commandment spotless, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; The commandment must refer to the charge in verses 11 and 12. The word appearing refers to the Lord&#8217;s second coming. Paul charges Timothy to live the life of a man of God until the coming of the Lord Jesus. Then the Lord could speak well of Timothy as one who lived on earth as the continuation of Himself. I hope that at the time of the Lord&#8217;s appearing, He will be able to say to us, &#8220;Faithful child, you have been part of My continuation. I lived on earth as a man of God. You were My continuation because you also lived the life of a man of God. You did not live by the natural life, but you lived by the eternal life.&#8221;<p>In verses 15 and 16 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;Which in its own times He will show, the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of those who reign as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords, Who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, Whom no man has seen nor can see, to Whom be honor and eternal might. Amen.&#8221; The relative pronoun &#8220;which&#8221; refers to &#8220;appearing&#8221; in verse 14. The personal pronoun &#8220;He&#8221; in verse 15 refers to God the Father, according to Acts 1:7. Although the Father dwells in unapproachable light, we not only can approach Him in Christ, but we also can have fellowship with Him. We can approach the Father because we are no longer in darkness. He is in the light, and we are in the light also (1 John 1:5, 7).<h2 class=head1>A CHARGE TO THE RICH</h2><p>In a very real sense, 1 Timothy concludes with 6:16. However, in verses 17 through 19 Paul gives an additional charge to the rich. Verse 17 says, &#8220;Charge those who are rich in the present age not to be high-minded, nor to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God Who affords us all things richly for our enjoyment.&#8221; This word may be regarded as a supplement to 6:7-10.<p>The rich are often a source of trouble to the church. However, many Christian leaders today like to have rich people in their congregations. But we should not have any preference for the rich. The poor may burden the church somewhat, but they do not damage the church or ruin it. Rich people damage God&#8217;s economy much more than do the poor. The New Testament even says that those who are poor, either spiritually or materially, are blessed (Matt. 5:3; Luke 6:20). Because Paul deals with God&#8217;s dispensation concerning the church, he cannot avoid speaking about the problems of rich people. He charges them not to be high-minded, nor to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches.<p>In their fund-raising activities, many Christian leaders give glory to those rich people who donate large sums of money. But they often neglect those who give only a small amount. The leading ones in the churches and the co-workers should not have this appreciation of rich people. Brother Nee even had the practice of not spending time with the wealthy. He preferred to be invited to the home of a poor brother. In this matter Brother Nee&#8217;s attitude no doubt was right.<p>Verses 18 and 19 continue, &#8220;To do good, to be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate, laying away for themselves as a treasure a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold on that which is really life.&#8221; Doing good here refers to the ready distribution of material things to the needy and the willing communication with such needs. To be rich in good works is to be rich according to God&#8217;s pleasure (Eph. 2:10), not only in material things. The expression &#8220;a good foundation for the future&#8221; refers to the next age (compared with the present age in verse 17), the kingdom age, when the overcoming saints will enjoy the Lord&#8217;s reward. For this we all need to lay a good foundation in the present age as a treasure for us to enjoy in the future. Those who are rich in this age should use their riches in such a way that they lay away as a treasure a good foundation for the future.<p>In verse 19 Paul charges Timothy to encourage the rich to &#8220;lay hold on that which is really life.&#8221; This life is the eternal life referred to in verse 12. Material riches are for the human natural life in this age, which is temporal and hence not real. If we do good with material things, we accomplish something for the real life, laying away a treasure for our enjoyment in the eternal life in the next age. This requires us to lay hold on God&#8217;s eternal life, which is the real life. Otherwise, we shall lay hold on our human natural life in laying away a treasure of material riches for a life in this age, a life that is not real. We should care for the eternal life rather than for the natural life.<p>Both verse 12 and verse 19 stress the eternal life of God. This indicates that the divine life is the vital and crucial factor in our Christian life.<h2 class=head1>GUARDING THE DEPOSIT</h2><p>Verses 20 and 21 say, &#8220;O Timothy, guard the deposit, turning away from profane, vain babblings and oppositions of what is falsely called knowledge, which some professing have misaimed concerning the faith.&#8221; The deposit was that which was committed to Timothy and entrusted to him: the healthy words which he received from Paul not only for himself, but also for others. By &#8220;what is falsely called knowledge&#8221; Paul means the teachings of the false teachers, teachings which were called knowledge (probably referring to Gnostic knowledge). This false knowledge replaced the genuine knowledge of the healthy word of God which was entrusted to Timothy. Those who profess what is falsely called knowledge have misaimed concerning the faith. Concerning the objective contents of our belief, they have missed the mark, as in shooting. They have misaimed concerning God&#8217;s New Testament economy. After giving this further word, Paul concludes by saying, &#8220;Grace be with you.&#8221;<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE</h1><h1 class=title>THE DIVINE PROVISIONS FOR THE INOCULATION AGAINST THE DECLINE OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 1:1-14</h1><p>Second Timothy, the last Epistle written by Paul, opens with the words, &#8220;Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus, to Timothy, beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.&#8221; This book was written at a time when the churches established through the apostle&#8217;s ministry in the Gentile world were in a trend of degradation, and the apostle himself was confined in a remote prison. Many had turned away from him and forsaken him (1:15; 4:16), including even some of his co-workers (4:10). It was a discouraging and disappointing scene, especially to his  young fellow-worker and spiritual child, Timothy. Due to this, in the opening of this encouraging, strengthening, and establishing Epistle, he confirmed to Timothy that he was an apostle of Christ, not only through the will of God, but also according to the promise of life which is in Christ. This implies that the churches may become degraded, and many of the saints may backslide in unfaithfulness, but the eternal life, the divine life, the uncreated life of God, promised by God in His holy writings and given to the apostle and all the believers, remains forever the same. With and upon this unchanging life the firm foundation of God has been laid and stands unshaken through all the tide of degradation (2:19). By such a life those who seek the Lord out of a pure heart are able to stand the trial of the church&#8217;s decline. This life, on which the apostle in his first Epistle charged Timothy and others to lay hold (6:12, 19), should be an encouragement and strengthening to him in perilous times.<p>Only in the two Timothys did the apostle include God&#8217;s mercy in the opening greeting of his Epistles. God&#8217;s mercy reaches farther than His grace. In the degraded situation of the churches, God&#8217;s mercy is needed.<h2 class=head1>I. THE SUBJECT OF THE BOOK: INOCULATION AGAINST THE DECLINE OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>When Paul was writing this Epistle, he was fully aware that the churches were declining. However, because he was one who laid hold on the promise of eternal life, he was not discouraged or disappointed. He had something within him which never changed-the eternal, uncreated, incorruptible life of God. No matter how the environment may change, this eternal life remains the same. Because he himself was encouraged in the life of God and not disappointed by the situation, Paul wrote the Second Epistle to Timothy not only as an encouragement and strengthening to a younger co-worker, but also as an inoculation for the entire Body of Christ against the decline of the church.<p>We should not regard 2 Timothy merely as a so-called pastoral book. If we have the proper insight, we shall realize that the divine thought within Paul was to inoculate the believers against the decline of the church. Paul foresaw this decline. However, deep within he was encouraged, not because he could understand matters according to logic, but because he laid hold of the eternal life promised by God in His holy writings. The very life promised by God in the Scriptures dwelt within Paul. Paul&#8217;s burden in writing this Epistle was both to encourage and to strengthen Timothy and also to inject a divine substance into the church in order to inoculate the church against the germ of decline. We praise the Lord that this inoculation has been effective. Yes, the church throughout the centuries has been ruined to a certain extent, but it has not been exterminated. Paul had the foresight to inoculate the church against decline. Even today we in the Lord&#8217;s recovery are enjoying the benefit of this inoculation.<p>My burden in this message is to consider eight basic elements of this inoculation. These divine provisions for the inoculation include a pure conscience, unfeigned faith, the divine gift, a strong spirit, eternal grace, incorruptible life, healthy words, and the indwelling Spirit. These ingredients of the marvelous dose administered by Paul are found in 1:1-14.<h2 class=head1>II. INTRODUCTION</h2><p>Verses 1 and 2 are an introductory word. In verse 1 Paul says that he was an apostle not only through the will of God, but also according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus. The expression &#8220;the promise of life&#8221; does not mean that we have only the promise and not the life. It means that we have received the promised life. A similar term, &#8220;the promise of the Spirit,&#8221; is used in Galatians 3:14. This term does not mean that we have received only the promise and have not received the Spirit. It means that we have received the Spirit who has been promised. In the same principle, the words &#8220;the promise of life&#8221; denote the promised life. Paul was an apostle according to the life which God had promised, which Paul had received, and which dwelt within him. Paul became an apostle by this life.<p>The eternal life according to which Paul became an apostle is incorruptible and unchanging, for this life is actually the processed Triune God Himself. Because Paul was indwelt by this life, not even the whole Roman Empire was able to prevail over him in its dealings with him. Paul was strengthened by the processed Triune God as life.<p>Nowhere else but in the opening of this Epistle does Paul say that he was an apostle according to the promise of life. Elsewhere he tells us that he was an apostle through the will of God (Eph. 1:1). Not many Christian teachers emphasize the fact that Paul&#8217;s apostleship was not only through the will of God, but also by the promise of eternal life. The reason Christians emphasize the will of God but not the promise of life is that they themselves do not see this matter of life. Whatever we do and whatever we are in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today must be according to eternal life and by this life. Praise the Lord that we are in His recovery by this life!<h2 class=head1>III. THE DIVINE PROVISIONS FOR THE INOCULATION</h2><p>The life mentioned in verse 1 includes all the eight basic elements of the inoculation. This means that eternal life includes a pure conscience, unfeigned faith, the divine gift, a strong spirit, eternal grace, the element of incorruption, healthy words, and the indwelling Spirit. If we have this life, which is actually the processed Triune God, we have a pure conscience, unfeigned faith, and all the other provisions of the divine inoculation. Let us now consider these provisions one by one.<h2 class=head2>A. A Pure Conscience</h2><p>In verse 3 Paul says, &#8220;I thank God, Whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasingly I have remembrance concerning you in my petitions night and day.&#8221; To serve here is to serve God in His worship (Acts 24:14; Phil. 3:3). Paul followed in the footsteps of his forefathers to serve God in a pure conscience. In a time of degradation, a pure conscience, a conscience purified from any mixture, is needed if we are to serve God.<p>I have the assurance that all the saints who are so honest, truthful, and faithful to the Lord in His recovery have not only a good conscience, but also a pure conscience. In this matter we should not accept the lie of the enemy. The more we doubt that we have a pure conscience, the more we shall feel that our conscience is not pure. We need to declare, &#8220;Satan, get away from me! I have a pure conscience. Satan, don&#8217;t you know that I am for the Lord and not for anything else? I am for the Lord, for His recovery, for His church, and for His interests.&#8221; The more we testify in an honest way that we have a pure conscience, the stronger will be our realization that our conscience is in fact pure. The way for us to have a pure conscience is to declare by faith, honestly, truthfully, and steadfastly, that we have a pure conscience toward the Lord. Do not listen to your doubts, and do not believe the lies of the enemy. The Lord&#8217;s blood prevails against him. Do not believe the enemy when he says that you are weak, or when he accuses you of being impure and not having a good conscience. Do you not love the Lord? Are you not for the Lord and His church? Learn to tell the enemy, &#8220;Satan, you have been cheating me long enough. I will not believe you any longer, and I will not allow you to hold me back. I am for the Lord, and I have a pure conscience.&#8221;<p>It is the eternal life which strengthens us to make such a declaration to the enemy. This is why I say that a conscience that is pure and good is included in eternal life. Because we have eternal life within us, we can be strengthened to declare that we have a pure conscience.<h2 class=head2>B. Unfeigned Faith</h2><p>Verse 5 says, &#8220;Having been reminded of the unfeigned faith in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded dwells also in you.&#8221; Here Paul reminds Timothy of the unfeigned faith which is in him. This faith first indwelt Timothy&#8217;s grandmother and then his mother. Now it dwells in him. We today may praise the Lord that this faith is also in us. Because we have eternal life, we have unfeigned faith.<p>Faith refers to the organic union with the Triune God in which we receive God&#8217;s infusion through His Word and in His Spirit. The more we touch the Word by exercising our spirit, the more we shall contact the Lord and be infused with Him. As a result, our faith will be strengthened. This faith is actually the reflection of the eternal life we have received. Therefore, to repeat, faith refers to the organic union between us and the Triune God in which we contact the living God through His Word and by His Spirit to receive His infusion.<h2 class=head2>C. The Divine Gift</h2><p>In verse 6 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.&#8221; This word was written to encourage and strengthen Timothy in his ministry for the Lord, that his ministry not be weakened by Paul&#8217;s imprisonment and the degraded situation of the churches. Here Paul seems to be saying to Timothy, &#8220;Timothy, I charge you to fan into flame the gift of God which is in you. Something in you is burning. However, it is not sufficient for it just to be burning-you need to fan this gift into flame. You have something in you which is a gift of God. Since you have unfeigned faith, I remind you to fan this gift into flame.&#8221;<p>It is rather difficult to define what Paul means by the gift of God in verse 6. It may refer to a particular spiritual function or ability, something burning within Timothy that enabled him to function in a particular way.<p>All the saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery need to fan into flame the gift of God which is in them. However, in the meetings many saints seem to throw away the fan. Especially in the meetings of the church, we need to fan into flame the gift which is in us. Then the flame will grow higher and brighter, and the riches of Christ will be manifest. All the saints need to be encouraged with the fact that they have eternal life, a pure conscience, and unfeigned faith. For this cause, they should fan into flame the gift of God.<h2 class=head2>D. A Strong Spirit</h2><p>In verse 7 Paul continues, &#8220;For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind.&#8221; The spirit here denotes our human spirit, regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit (John 3:5-6; Rom. 8:16). Fanning into flame the gift of God is related to our regenerated spirit.<p>Paul says that we have a spirit of power, of love, and of a sober mind. Power refers to our will, love to our emotion, and a sober mind to our mind. This indicates that a strong will, a loving emotion, and a sober mind have very much to do with a strong spirit for the exercise of the gift of God which is in us.<p>We need to believe that God has given us such a spirit, and we should praise Him for it. We should not say that we do not feel as if we have a spirit of love, power, and a sound mind. In our physical body we usually do not have any feeling with respect to our internal organs unless there is something wrong with them. Under normal circumstances, are you aware of the fact that you have a liver? I may not be conscious of my liver, but I know that I have this organ and that it is functioning. In like manner, we may not feel as if we have the kind of spirit described in verse 7. Nevertheless, we need to believe Paul&#8217;s word and exercise our spirit.<p>In verse 8 Paul says, &#8220;Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; but suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God.&#8221; Here we have the reason Paul charged Timothy in the two preceding verses to fan into flame the gift of God which was in him. We need to do this in order not to be ashamed of the testimony of the Lord. Not to be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord is to stand against its downward current in the declining churches. We should also be ready to suffer evil with the gospel. The gospel, which is personified here, was suffering persecution. Therefore, Timothy should expect to suffer evil along with the gospel. Our suffering of persecution along with the gospel must be to the extent of what the power of God can endure, not limited by the endurance of our natural strength.<h2 class=head2>E. Eternal Grace</h2><p>In 1:9-10a Paul says, speaking of God, &#8220;Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, but now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus.&#8221; God has not only saved us to enjoy His blessing, but also called us with a holy calling, a calling for a particular cause, to fulfill His purpose. The purpose here is God&#8217;s plan according to His will to place us into Christ, making us one with Him to share His life and position that we may be His testimony. Grace is God&#8217;s provision in life for us to live out His purpose.<p>The grace given to us in Christ was bestowed upon us before the world began. The phrase &#8220;before times eternal&#8221; means before the world began. This is a sure and unshakable foundation, standing firmly against the waves of the downward current and exposing the total powerlessness of the enemy&#8217;s efforts to counter the eternal purpose of God. In order to strengthen Timothy, the apostle identifies their ministry with this eternal grace, the sure foundation.<p>In verse 9 Paul says that God&#8217;s grace was given to us before times eternal; in verse 10 he says that this grace has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus. God&#8217;s grace was given to us in eternity, but was manifested and applied to us through our Lord&#8217;s first coming to nullify death and bring life to us. Because this grace was manifested through the appearing of Christ, Old Testament saints like Abraham and David did not experience it. The grace destined to be given to us came with the appearing of the Lord Jesus. This grace is not merely a blessing; it is a Person, the Triune God Himself given to us to be our enjoyment. This grace came when the Lord Jesus appeared, and now it is with us today.<h2 class=head2>F. The Incorruptible Life</h2><p>The last part of verse 10 says of Christ, &#8220;Who nullified death, and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel.&#8221; Christ nullified death, making it of none effect, through His Devil-destroying death (Heb. 2:14) and death-swallowing resurrection (1 Cor. 15:52-54).<p>The eternal life of God is given to all believers in Christ (1 Tim. 1:16) and is the main element of the divine grace given to us (Rom. 5:17, 21). This life has conquered death (Acts 2:24) and will swallow up death (2 Cor. 5:4). It was according to the promise of such a life that Paul was an apostle (2 Tim. 1:1). This life and its consequent incorruption have been brought to light and made visible to men through the preaching of the gospel.<p>Life is the divine element, even God Himself, imparted into our spirit. Incorruption is the consequence of life saturating our body (Rom. 8:11). This life and incorruption are able to counter the death and corruption of the decline among the churches.<p>Second Timothy 1:11 says, &#8220;For which I was appointed a herald, and an apostle, and a teacher.&#8221; The relative pronoun &#8220;which&#8221; refers to the gospel of divine grace and eternal life. This corresponds to the gospel presented in grace and life by the Apostle John (John 1:4, 15-17). For such a gospel Paul was appointed a herald, an apostle, and a teacher. A herald announces and proclaims the gospel, an apostle sets up and establishes the churches for God&#8217;s administration, and a teacher gives instructions to the churches with all the saints.<p>In verse 12 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;For which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not ashamed, for I know Whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day.&#8221; The apostle had a cause for his sufferings, a cause on the highest plane-to proclaim the glad tidings of the gospel of grace and life, to establish the churches, and to instruct the saints. Such a cause should also be an encouragement and strengthening to Timothy in facing the deterioration of the declining churches. Since Paul was not ashamed, Timothy should not be ashamed either.<p>In verse 12 Paul says, &#8220;I know Whom I have believed.&#8221; What the apostle believed was not a thing or a matter, but a living Person, Christ, the Son of the living God, who is the embodiment of divine grace and eternal life. The eternal life in Him is powerful; it is more than able to sustain to the end the one who suffers for His sake and also to preserve him for the inheritance of the coming glory. The grace in Him is more than sufficient to provide His sent one with all he needs for finishing the course of his ministry unto a reward in glory (4:7-8). Hence, He is able to guard that which the apostle has committed unto Him for the day of His return. Such an assurance should also be an encouragement and strengthening to the weakened and sorrowful Timothy.<p>The words &#8220;my deposit&#8221; refer to that which Paul had committed to the Lord. The apostle had committed his entire being with his glorious future unto the One who is able, through His life and grace, to guard his deposit unto &#8220;that day,&#8221; the day of Christ&#8217;s second appearing.<h2 class=head2>G. The Healthy Words</h2><p>In verse 13 Paul continues, &#8220;Hold a pattern of healthy words which you heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.&#8221; The preceding word in verse 12 is a pattern, an example, of healthy words. The words of our Lord Jesus Christ are words of life (John 6:63); hence, they are healthy words. The word healthy here refers to the health of life.<h2 class=head2>H. The Indwelling Spirit</h2><p>In verse 14 Paul concludes, &#8220;Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit Who dwells in us.&#8221; The Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit (Rom. 8:16). Hence, to guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit requires us to exercise our spirit.<p>We have pointed out that the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God&#8217;s contact with man. Praise the Lord that today this Spirit dwells in our spirit!<p>We thank the Lord for all the divine provisions for the inoculation against the decline of the church. The more we experience these provisions, the more we shall be inoculated against any kind of decline. Having such a marvelous inoculation, we should be able to declare that in the Lord&#8217;s recovery there is no decline.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO</h1><h1 class=title>THE BASIC FACTOR OF THE DECLINE- FORSAKING THE APOSTLE AND HIS MINISTRY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 1:15-18</h1><p>In this message we shall consider 1:15-18, verses which show that the basic factor of the decline consists in forsaking the apostle and his ministry. Although this portion of 2 Timothy is short, Paul must have had strong feelings when he wrote these words.<p>In 1:1-14 Paul covered many positive, encouraging, and strengthening matters. Based on his charge to Timothy in verses 1 through 7, Paul says in verse 8, &#8220;Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; but suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God.&#8221; Here the gospel is personified; it is regarded as a living person that is suffering persecution. Paul encouraged Timothy to suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God.<p>In verse 9 Paul goes on to speak of God who &#8220;saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal.&#8221; The purpose here refers to God&#8217;s goal, and grace refers to the means of reaching this goal. The grace to reach God&#8217;s goal was given to us in Christ Jesus &#8220;before times eternal,&#8221; that is, before the world began. Grace &#8220;has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus&#8221; (v. 10). Hence, grace did not come until the Lord Jesus came. John 1:17 indicates this: &#8220;The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.&#8221; The grace which came through Jesus Christ is nothing less than the Triune God dispensed into us for our enjoyment. This grace carries out God&#8217;s purpose and enables us to reach His goal.<p>Grace works in two ways. It works negatively to nullify death, and it works positively to bring in life and incorruption. This work of grace is still taking place within us. Today, in the church life grace is nullifying death and bringing life and incorruption to light through the gospel. Although we heard the gospel preached in the past, we probably did not hear that the gospel of grace nullifies death and brings in life and incorruption.<p>On behalf of such a gospel, Paul was &#8220;appointed a herald, and an apostle, and a teacher&#8221; (v. 11). Paul was a herald to proclaim the gospel, an apostle to establish churches, and a teacher to instruct the churches and the saints in the details of the gospel. For the sake of this gospel, Paul suffered &#8220;these things.&#8221; However, he was not ashamed, for he knew the One whom he had believed and was persuaded that He was able to guard his deposit, to guard what he had committed unto Him (v. 12).<p>In verse 13 Paul charges Timothy, &#8220;Hold a pattern of healthy words which you heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.&#8221; Paul&#8217;s foregoing words to Timothy are a pattern of the healthy words which Timothy was to hold. We should hold such a pattern in faith, in the organic union with the Triune God, and in the divine love. Furthermore, according to verse 14, we should &#8220;guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit Who dwells in us.&#8221; The good deposit here is equal to the healthy words. We should guard this deposit through the indwelling Holy Spirit. The more we consider all the matters covered in verses 1 through 14, the more we realize what riches these verses contain.<h2 class=head1>I. THE APOSTASY</h2><p>In 1:15 Paul says, &#8220;This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.&#8221; Asia here refers to the province of Asia. In this verse Paul indicates that believers in Asia who had formerly received the apostle&#8217;s ministry now forsook him. In spite of such desertion, the apostle grew stronger in the grace that was in Christ, who was the same and would never change. Without being discouraged, he exhorted his son in faith to persevere steadily in the ministry in the midst of failure and ruin of the churches.<p>It is difficult to say to whom the words &#8220;all who are in Asia&#8221; refer. Does it mean that every believer in Asia turned away from Paul? Paul specifically names Phygelus and Hermogenes, two who must have taken the lead to desert the apostle because of his imprisonment. But what about all the other believers in Asia? We cannot say that every one deserted Paul, for Paul mentions Onesiphorus as one who often refreshed him and who sought him out diligently in Rome and found him (vv. 16-17).<p>A number of expositors say that these verses point to an apostasy, a departure from the truth. But what was the extent of the apostasy? I believe that &#8220;all who are in Asia&#8221; points to the general situation among the believers in Asia without including every particular believer. Generally speaking, there was apostasy in Asia.<h2 class=head1>II. THE FAITHFULNESS</h2><p>Second Timothy 1:15-18 indicates that we cannot be neutral. We are either a Phygelus or Hermogenes, or we are an Onesiphorus. Onesiphorus was an overcomer who resisted the general trend and stood against the down current to refresh the Lord&#8217;s ambassador in spirit, soul, and body, one who was not ashamed of Paul&#8217;s imprisonment for the Lord&#8217;s commission. Concerning him Paul says, &#8220;May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord in that day! And in how many things he served in Ephesus, you know very well.&#8221; The words &#8220;that day&#8221; refer to the day of the Lord&#8217;s victorious appearing to reward His overcomers (4:8; Rev. 22:12).<p>The principle here is nearly the same as that at the time of Elijah. Elijah said to the Lord, &#8220;I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away&#8221; (1 Kings 19:14). The Lord replied, &#8220;Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal&#8221; (v. 18). The principle here is that even during a period of decline, a downward trend when most of God&#8217;s people are carried away, there are always a number who remain faithful. There will always be an Onesiphorus to stand against the downward trend. Yes, Phygelus, Hermogenes, and others in Asia turned away from Paul. But Onesiphorus, an overcomer, stood against the decline, against the down current.<p>I am certain that both Phygelus and Hermogenes were believers. Otherwise, Paul would not have said that they turned away from him. Phygelus and Hermogenes were with Paul at one time. Probably they were not ordinary believers; they must have been either co-workers or leading ones among the saints. To be sure, they took the lead to turn away from Paul.<p>Those who turned away from Paul turned away not only from his person, but also from his ministry. Actually, it is not the person himself who is important; it is the ministry carried on by a person which is of extreme importance. When Paul said that certain ones turned away from him, he did not mean that they merely turned away from him as a person, but that they turned away from his ministry. In perilous times, genuine believers, even leading ones and co-workers, may turn away.<p>In relation to this matter, I would like to relate certain aspects of the history of the Lord&#8217;s recovery. During the years I was with Brother Nee in mainland China, I saw many who accepted Brother Nee&#8217;s ministry for a time and later turned away. Although the number of saints was not large, it happened again and again that some, perhaps just two or three, turned away from Brother Nee&#8217;s ministry.<p>We have also had many similar experiences from the time we were sent from mainland China to Taiwan in 1949. In the short period of six years, the number of saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery in Taiwan increased from approximately five hundred to more than twenty-five thousand. One year we invited a very spiritual and experienced brother from England to minister to us. His first visit was profitable, for he ministered to us without touching the practice of the church life. But when, at our invitation, he came the second time, he did so with the intention of correcting us with respect to the practice of the church life. Actually, he wanted to convince us to forsake the ground of the church. According to his concept, whenever two or three believers meet in the name of the Lord Jesus, there is the reality of the church. He taught that during the era of what he called organized Christianity there could be in any city a number of groups meeting in the Lord&#8217;s name and that each would possess the reality of the church to a certain degree. Due to this brother&#8217;s influence, a small number of young people turned from the practice of the church life, declaring that they had seen a vision of what they called &#8220;the full Christ.&#8221; It is not clear what they meant by this expression. The Bible speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ and refers to the fullness of Christ, but there is no mention of a &#8220;full Christ.&#8221;<p>Even though these young people began to undermine the work in Taiwan, I simply waited and prayed. Seven years went by before the issue was settled. At one point I told them frankly that I would follow the way of Christ and the church for eternity. I asked them to consider seriously what would happen if they would only take Christ, but neglect the church life. Furthermore, I told them that as children of light we should conduct ourselves in the light. I declared again that I would forever follow the way of Christ and the church as recovered through Brother Nee. Concerning this, I assured them that I would never change. I went on to tell them that if they preferred to leave the church life and follow their vision of &#8220;the full Christ,&#8221; I would not hinder them. On the contrary, they were certainly free to follow a way which they regarded as better. However, I told them that they should not remain with us pretending to be the same as we are when actually they were undermining the work. They claimed that they had no problem with the ground of the church, and they continued among us for seven years. All that time they were undermining the work in Taiwan.<p>In His sovereignty, the Lord brought me to this country and burdened me to start the ministry here. Certain of the leading ones in Taiwan wrote me regularly about the situation with the young brothers who were constantly undermining the work there. I answered them by referring to the words of the Lord Jesus in John 2:19: &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up,&#8221; a reminder of a message I had given. In that message I said, &#8220;If this work on the island of Taiwan is something of man, it should be torn down. But if it is of the Lord, once it has been destroyed, the Lord will raise it up again in resurrection.&#8221; I encouraged the leading ones to be at peace. Eventually, the dissenting ones left the church life and the work in Taiwan. Shortly thereafter they were divided among themselves. They did not succeed in their attempt to destroy the church life.<p>Let me now relate several experiences through which we have passed in the Lord&#8217;s recovery in the United States. At one time a group of Christians who emphasize speaking in tongues wanted to join with us for the practice of the church life. On the one hand, we did not oppose tongues-speaking; on the other hand, we did not encourage it, and we were not willing for the meetings to be dominated by it. After a short period of time, this group left the church.<p>Others who were once among us recognized that the way of the church is true. However, their preference was for a native American apostle. When I learned of this, I said to myself, &#8220;Only the first group of apostles were native apostles, Jews who were apostles to Jews. But Paul became a foreign apostle, an apostle to the Gentiles.&#8221; To reject a foreigner and to accept only so-called native apostles violates the principle of the Body. The Body of Christ is universal. Nevertheless, we assured those who desired a native apostle that they were free to look for one and find one if they could. Hence, those who desired a native apostle also turned from the church life.<p>Another case involves a brother who was gifted in speaking. On one occasion he testified publicly that the Lord had told him to commit himself to the way of the recovery. After a certain time, he was distracted from the church life and came to believe that the church ground is too narrow. He had the concept that the recovery was merely something transplanted from China. Therefore, this brother also left the church life.<p>Yet another case concerns a certain brother who considered the denominations to be the field for our work. He claimed that if we offend those in the denominations, we shall lose the field of our work. This brother admitted that we were the church; however, he counselled us not to make such a statement. We replied that this can be compared to a woman not saying that she is the wife of a certain man. This brother&#8217;s goal was to bring believers into a halfway shelter for Christians who had left the denominations, but who had not come into the church life. Actually, this is to compromise the truth, to share the teachings about the Christian life but, out of fear, to hold back the truth concerning the church. This brother promotes the books by Brother Nee that do not concern the church, but neglects those books which are related to the church life. He also has turned away.<p>One brother was in the church life for several years. Then he declared that he had seen a so-called third line. He claimed that Brother Nee had seen the line of Jerusalem and the line of Antioch, but that he had come to see the line of Ephesus. Thus, he turned from the church life to practice this &#8220;third line.&#8221;<p>Another brother claimed that he knew the best way to practice the church life. According to him, the way to build a local church is with the children both from families in the church and of families in the neighborhood. I visited a Lord&#8217;s table meeting deliberately to see the situation in his locality. Even though very young children were allowed to partake of the bread, I did not say a critical word. However, I did tell the brother, &#8220;As the church, we are all-inclusive; we are not sectarian. Even if you wish to practice the church life according to your way, we do not oppose you. But please do not insist that you have found the best way or the unique way to build the church. Such insistence will be a cause of problems.&#8221; Eventually, this brother also turned away.<p>In recent years certain ambitious ones looked upon the Lord&#8217;s recovery as an opportunity for them to gain power. They realized that in the &#8220;field&#8221; of the recovery there were no &#8220;lions&#8221; or &#8220;tigers.&#8221; On the contrary, all the saints were &#8220;doves&#8221; and &#8220;lambs.&#8221; In other words, the saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery seemed to be naive. Although these ambitious ones tried to gain power for themselves, they failed. They came to realize that the naive &#8220;doves&#8221; and &#8220;lambs&#8221; had someone standing with them, that it is God Himself who guards His glory in His recovery. Unable to do what they desired, these also left the church life.<p>My point in relating these facts of history is to say that we should not think that everyone who comes into the Lord&#8217;s recovery will remain. Because the church life is a test to all, a certain number eventually will turn away. However, we should not be disappointed by this. We should be encouraged just as Timothy was encouraged by Paul&#8217;s word. Yes, the way of the Lord&#8217;s recovery is a test and an exposure. But the recovery also proves that, although some turn away like Phygelus and Hermogenes, others like Onesiphorus stand firm. Today in His recovery the Lord has hundreds, even thousands, of such ones.<p>Paul&#8217;s desire was that the Lord would grant mercy to Onesiphorus both in the present and on &#8220;that day.&#8221; This indicates a double blessing: a blessing to the whole house of Onesiphorus in this age and blessing to Onesiphorus himself on the day of the Lord&#8217;s victorious appearing. Do you want to receive this double blessing of the Lord&#8217;s mercy? If so, then do not be a Phygelus or Hermogenes, but an Onesiphorus. When others turn away, stay with the apostle and his ministry.<p>After we went to Taipei from mainland China, we built a meeting hall that could accommodate about five hundred people. The first Lord&#8217;s Day after the building was completed, the new hall was filled, mainly with Christians who had fled the mainland. Realizing the situation of those in the audience, I spoke a frank word. I said, &#8220;In Christianity today there are different kinds of churches. Some of these churches will marry you; others will assist you with your medical problems; and still others will help you find employment. Some churches will give opportunities for those who are talented or wealthy. If you have certain abilities, they will give you a position. However, the church here does not afford you this kind of help. Furthermore, there are no positions to satisfy your ambition. If you want such things, you are in the wrong place. As the church here, we care only to preach the pure gospel, to teach the Bible, and to help people receive Christ, love Him, and grow in Him. We are not here for any earthly concern. We care for heavenly things. All those who are truly seeking these heavenly things please continue to meet with us. All the rest should go elsewhere to find the help you are seeking.&#8221; The next Lord&#8217;s Day more than half did not return. We realized that those who came back cared for the things of the Lord. Most of them have been gained for the Lord and are in the church life.<p>Once again I would say that in the Lord&#8217;s recovery we care only for Christ and the church. This is our battle cry. Our goal is not to help people with earthly pursuits, much less to satisfy their ambition for position. We are here to minister Christ for the church according to God&#8217;s eternal purpose. If you are seeking Christ and the church, then the church life is the place for you. Those who are seeking something other than Christ and the church will eventually realize that the church life is not the place for what they are seeking, and they will turn away.<p><p><h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE THREE</h1><h1 class=title>THE INOCULATOR</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 2:1-15</h1><p>We have pointed out that the subject of 2 Timothy is inoculation against the decline of the church. In this message we shall consider five specific titles given to the inoculator in 2:1-15. These titles are a teacher, a soldier, a contender (an athlete), a husbandman, and a workman. If we read these verses carefully, we shall see that Paul regarded Timothy and his other co-workers as those who should be teachers, soldiers, contenders, husbandmen, and workmen.<h2 class=head1>I. A TEACHER</h2><p>In 2:1 Paul says, &#8220;You therefore, my child, be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.&#8221; The word &#8220;therefore&#8221; refers to chapter one. Paul&#8217;s exhortation in 2:1 is in view of what has been mentioned in the preceding chapter. Based upon what he has just written to Timothy, Paul now goes on to encourage him to be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus. Paul did not charge Timothy here to be empowered in knowledge or in gifts. He charged him to be empowered in grace. The apostle himself had experienced the empowering of grace in life (1:9-12). Now he exhorts Timothy to be empowered in the same grace. This grace is God&#8217;s provision in life for us to live out His purpose. Instead of being discouraged, Paul was empowered in grace, even though he was in prison. He realized that grace is nothing less than the processed Triune God-the Father embodied in the Son and the Son realized as the indwelling Spirit. Second Corinthians 13:14 indicates that grace is the very Triune God Himself: &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all&#8221; (lit.). Grace is not a thing; it is a unique Person, the living, divine Person of the Triune God processed to be the all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling Spirit. This Spirit now dwells in us as our grace. We all can be empowered in this grace in the indwelling Triune God processed to be our enjoyment.<p>The more we are empowered in this grace, the more able we shall be to teach others. Thus, in verse 2 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;And the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.&#8221; The things to which Paul refers here are the healthy words in 1:13. The healthy words, after being committed to faithful men, become the good deposit in them (1:14). This word indicates that if someone in a local church has a deposit of the Lord&#8217;s healthy words, he should train the faithful ones, the trustworthy ones, that they also may have a good deposit from the Lord, thus making them competent to teach others.<p>Paul realized that Timothy had received a good deposit, that he had been taught and nourished with the riches of grace. Therefore, he charged Timothy to commit these things to others who would be faithful and competent to carry on the same ministry. This indicates that more than one person is needed to carry on the riches of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. My hope is that through all these Life-study Messages thousands of saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery will receive a good deposit of the riches of grace concerning God&#8217;s New Testament economy. Then those who have received these riches will be able to commit these things to others. Imagine what the situation would be if the Lord had ten thousand saints filled with His good deposit, spreading the riches of His economy throughout the earth. No doubt, this would hasten the time of His glorious appearing.<p>There is one God, one Christ, one Spirit, and one church. Because God is one, His way must also be one. Is this way to be found in Catholicism or in the denominations or in the charismatic movement? Certainly not! Neither is God&#8217;s unique way found among the independent Christian groups. God&#8217;s way is in His recovery. Actually, the recovery is the recovery of the unique way. Many saints can testify with a pure conscience from the depths of their being that if they do not take the way of the recovery today, they have no other way. The Lord&#8217;s recovery is the way. I say this, not because I have been used of the Lord in His recovery, but simply because it is a fact. Some who became dissenting and left discovered that they had no way to go back to the denominations. In certain cases the denominations might not even be willing to accept them. This shows that if we touch the recovery and then leave it, we commit spiritual suicide, for we turn away from God&#8217;s unique way.<p>In 2:1 and 2 Paul is burdened to charge Timothy, one who had received such a good deposit, to pass on the riches of grace to others. Then there would be many teachers, many ministers of Christ, to spread the riches of God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<h2 class=head1>II. A SOLDIER</h2><p>In verse 3 Paul continues, &#8220;Take your share in suffering evil as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.&#8221; The apostles considered their ministry a warfare for Christ, just as the priestly service was considered a military service, a warfare, in Numbers 4:23, 30, 35 (lit.). Whenever we minister Christ to others, we find ourselves in a battle. Hence, we should not only be teachers committing the deposit to others, but we should also be soldiers fighting for God&#8217;s interests.<p>Verse 4 says, &#8220;No one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life, that he may please the one who enlisted him.&#8221; The word for life here in Greek is bios, indicating the physical life in this age. To fight a good fight (4:7) for the Lord&#8217;s interests on this earth we must be cleared of any earthly entanglement. The matters of our material, physical life should not entangle us as we are endeavoring to minister Christ to others. This ministry is a fighting, and the fighting requires that we be free from entanglement. On the one hand, the priestly service is a ministry to God; on the other hand, it is a warfare against God&#8217;s enemies. As the priests were bearing the ark of testimony, they had to be prepared to fight against those who might attack this testimony.<h2 class=head1>III. A CONTENDER</h2><p>In verse 5 Paul likens Timothy to an athlete contending in the games: &#8220;And if also anyone contends in the games, he is not crowned unless he contends lawfully.&#8221; At the same time Timothy was to be a teacher and a soldier, he was also to be an athlete. A soldier must fight to win the victory, whereas an athlete must contend lawfully to receive the crown.<p>It is important for a runner in a race to run fast. That is not the time for him to exercise patience. In a foregoing message I encouraged you to wait and pray. But when it comes to running the race to win the crown, we should not wait. On the contrary, we should run to reach the goal.<h2 class=head1>IV. A HUSBANDMAN</h2><p>Verse 6 continues, &#8220;The laboring husbandman must be the first to partake of the fruits.&#8221; Here Paul likens Timothy to a husbandman, a farmer. Just as a soldier must win the victory and an athlete must receive the crown, so a husbandman must partake of the fruits, the food. This requires patience. As athletes we should be quick, but as farmers we need to be patient. If out of impatience a farmer would pluck up the tiny sprouts, his crop would be ruined. Likewise, if he drives his cattle too much, he may hurt them. With both crops and livestock, farmers must learn to have patience.<p>Verses 7 through 14 are related to Paul&#8217;s charge to Timothy that he be a husbandman. After telling Timothy to consider what he says and that the Lord will give him understanding in all things (v. 7), Paul goes on to say, &#8220;Remember Jesus Christ, raised from among the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel.&#8221; The word &#8220;raised&#8221; in verse 8 indicates Christ&#8217;s victory over death by His divine life with its resurrection power. The expression &#8220;seed of David&#8221; indicates Christ&#8217;s dignified human nature exalted and glorified along with His divine nature. The words &#8220;my gospel&#8221; indicate that Paul&#8217;s gospel was the glad tidings of the living Person of Christ, who possesses both the divine and human nature, who was incarnated to be the Son of Man and resurrected to be the Son of God, as indicated in the parallel portion, Romans 1:1-4.<p>Paul says that he suffered evil &#8220;unto bonds as a criminal,&#8221; but that &#8220;the word of God is not bound&#8221; (v. 9). In spite of all the opposition by human efforts that were instigated by the enemy, Satan, the bonds of the apostle released the word of God, giving it free course and making it more prevailing.<p>In verse 10 Paul continues, &#8220;Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the chosen ones, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.&#8221; The &#8220;chosen ones&#8221; denotes the believers in Christ, who were chosen by God the Father before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4) and selected from mankind for salvation. The apostle endured all sufferings for our sake that we also may obtain salvation as he did.<p>In verse 10 Paul does not speak of salvation and eternal glory, but of salvation with eternal glory. Eternal glory is the ultimate goal of God&#8217;s salvation (Rom. 8:21). God&#8217;s salvation leads us into His glory (Heb. 2:10). This encourages us to endure sufferings for the gospel (Rom. 8:17).<p>Immediately after charging Timothy to be a husbandman, Paul speaks of suffering. This indicates that a husbandman must be one who is able to suffer and endure. As a farmer, he must learn not only to suffer, but also to die.<p>In these verses Paul not only speaks of his own sufferings, but he also presents the Lord Jesus as a pattern of one who suffered, died, and was resurrected. Verses 11 through 13 may have been a hymn. This passage corresponds to Romans 6:8 and 8:17. Verse 11 says, &#8220;Faithful is the word: For if we died with Him, we shall also live with Him.&#8221; The expression &#8220;died with Him&#8221; is related to Christ&#8217;s crucifixion, as symbolized by baptism (Rom. 6:3-8). Likewise, the words &#8220;live with Him&#8221; mean to live Christ in His resurrection (Rom. 6:5, 8; John 14:19).<p>Verse 12 says, &#8220;If we endure, we shall also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us.&#8221; Enduring is related to life in this age, and reigning with Christ, to the coming age. If we deny Him, He will deny us; that is, He will not acknowledge us (Matt. 10:33; Luke 9:26).<p>Verse 13 continues, &#8220;If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.&#8221; The word faithful in this verse refers to the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness to His own word. If we are faithless, the Lord will remain faithful, for He is not able to deny Himself. If we become faithless to Him, although He remains faithful, He cannot accept us as faithful by making Himself unfaithful, that is, by denying Himself, by denying His nature and His being.<p>In verse 14 Paul says, &#8220;Remind them of these things, solemnly charging them before the Lord not to have contentions of words, which are profitable for nothing, to the ruin of those who hear.&#8221; By &#8220;these things&#8221; Paul refers to the charge that faithful, competent men, to whom the good deposit has been committed, should be not only teachers, but also soldiers, athletes, and husbandmen. Like the Lord Jesus during His life on earth, they need to be patient and have endurance. The Lord suffered with patience, and He endured. After He was put to death, He was resurrected. Based on this, Paul says that if we die with Him, we shall live and that if we suffer with Him, we shall reign with Him.<h2 class=head1>V. A WORKMAN</h2><p>In verse 15 Paul says, &#8220;Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth.&#8221; Here Paul indicates that the inoculator is to be a workman. As a carpenter, this workman must cut straight the word of the truth. This means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion. Just as a carpenter has the skill to cut wood in a straight way, so the Lord&#8217;s workman needs the skill to cut straight the word of truth. This is necessary because in the decline of the church so many truths are twisted and presented in a warped, biased form.<p>&#8220;Contentions of words&#8221; (2:14), &#8220;profane babblings&#8221; (v. 16), the eating word of gangrene (v. 17), and &#8220;foolish and ignorant questionings&#8221; (v. 23) are often very much used by the Devil (v. 26) in the down current among the churches to produce contentions (v. 23), to ruin the hearers (v. 14), to promote ungodliness (v. 16), and to overthrow people&#8217;s faith (v. 18). Hence, there is the need of the word of the truth rightly unfolded to enlighten the darkened ones, inoculate against the poison, swallow up the death, and bring the distracted back to the right track.<p>Among Christians today, only the superficial aspects of the truth are not twisted. Virtually all the deeper things of the truth have been distorted. Concerning these things, many have not cut the word of truth straightly, but cut it in a way that is curved and biased. Therefore, we should be not only teachers, soldiers, contenders, and farmers, but also workmen, carpenters, cutting straight the word of the truth. The truth here does not merely denote biblical doctrine; it refers to the contents and the reality of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. The main elements of this truth are Christ as the mystery of God and the embodiment of God and the church as the mystery of Christ and the Body of Christ. We all need to learn to cut straight the word of truth with respect to Christ and the church.<p>Certain of the Brethren teachers interpret Paul&#8217;s word about cutting straight the word of truth to mean dividing the Bible into various dispensations: innocence, conscience, human government, promise, law, grace, and kingdom. The Bible can be understood according to these dispensations. However, arranging the Word into dispensations is not what Paul means in 2:15 about cutting straight the word of the truth. As used in the three books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, the word truth has a specific significance: it denotes the contents of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. Not realizing this, many readers of the Bible think that in 2:15 Paul is speaking of truth in a general way. But we need to understand the word truth in this verse according to its usage in the three books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus. First Timothy 3:15 says that the church is &#8220;the pillar and base of the truth.&#8221; This truth is the mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh. The church should bear, uphold, this truth, this reality. Numerous times in these three Epistles Paul speaks of the truth. For example, in 1 Timothy 2:4 he says that God &#8220;desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth.&#8221; The word of the truth in 2 Timothy 2:15 refers to the healthy words of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. As workmen, we should learn not merely to divide the Bible into dispensations. This is too superficial. We must learn to unfold the word of the truth concerning God&#8217;s economy. If we would do this, we need to consider carefully Paul&#8217;s use of the word truth in these three Epistles. If we consider these books carefully, we shall see that truth here denotes the reality of the contents of the New Testament economy of God. Therefore, to cut straight the word of the truth is to unfold without bias or distortion the reality of God&#8217;s economy revealed in the New Testament.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPREAD OF THE DECLINE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 2:16-26</h1><p>Second Timothy 2:16 is a contrast to Paul&#8217;s word in verse 15, where he says, &#8220;Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth.&#8221; The good workman is one who cuts straight not the word of knowledge or doctrine, but the word of truth. Many Christians think that truth in such verses as 2:15 means doctrine or teaching. However, in the New Testament truth does not denote mere doctrine. Concerning Christ in His incarnation, John 1:14 says, &#8220;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and truth.&#8221; It certainly would be nonsensical to interpret truth here as doctrine. How could we say that the Word became flesh and was full of doctrine? In New Testament usage truth refers to the reality of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. When Christ came through incarnation, grace and reality also came. Both grace and reality are God Himself. Grace is God in the Son as our enjoyment; reality is God realized by us in the Son. Therefore, grace and reality both refer to God incarnate. When we receive grace, we also receive reality. Then we have God as our reality. This reality is the truth in 2 Timothy 2:15. As we have pointed out, this truth is the reality of the contents of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. These contents include Christ as the Head and the church as the Body. To cut straight the word of the truth is not simply to divide the Bible into various sections. Rather, it is to cut the healthy word of the reality of the contents of God&#8217;s economy.<h2 class=head1>I. AVOIDING PROFANE, VAIN BABBLINGS</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Advancing to More Ungodliness</h2><p>As a contrast to verse 15, Paul goes on to say in verse 16, &#8220;But avoid profane, vain babblings, for they will advance to more ungodliness.&#8221; The word profane denotes that which touches worldliness and is touched by it; it refers to what is contrary to being holy. The profane, vain babblings Paul charged Timothy to avoid advance to more ungodliness, to a situation which is contrary to godliness, contrary to the manifestation of God in our daily life and in the church life.<h2 class=head2>B. Spreading as Gangrene</h2><p>In verse 17 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;And their word will spread as gangrene, of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus.&#8221; The Greek word rendered spread may also be rendered feed or eat. Literally it means &#8220;will find pasture,&#8221; as in John 10:9. The word for pasture in Greek is the medical term for the consuming progress of a mortifying disease (Alford). Hence, its meaning in this verse is to spread.<p>The word gangrene denotes an eating sore, a cancer. Paul uses such a strong word to describe those who teach differently. He tells us that their word not only advances unto more ungodliness, but that it spreads as gangrene which consumes the flesh and causes part of one&#8217;s body to die. According to our observation, this has been the situation among certain dissenting ones.<h2 class=head2>C. Hymenaeus and Philetus</h2><h2 class=head3>1. Having Misaimed concerning the Truth</h2><p>Speaking of Hymenaeus and Philetus, Paul says in verse 18 that concerning the truth they &#8220;have misaimed, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and overthrow the faith of some.&#8221; The word misaimed means to miss the mark, swerve, deviate. Paul does not say that Hymenaeus and Philetus misaimed concerning doctrine or teaching; he says that they misaimed concerning the truth, concerning the reality of the New Testament economy. They swerved from the truth by saying that the resurrection had already taken place. This is to claim that there will be no resurrection. This is a serious heresy, for it denies the divine power in life (1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes. 4:16; Rev. 20:4, 6).<h2 class=head3>2. Overthrowing the Faith of Some</h2><p>In verse 18 Paul also says that by having misaimed concerning the truth Hymenaeus and Philetus overthrew the faith of some. Faith here is subjective and refers to the act of believing. This subjective faith, our believing act, is very much related to the resurrection of Christ (Rom. 10:9). As we have pointed out, this subjective faith involves an organic union between us and the Triune God. For one&#8217;s faith to be overthrown is to have this inward organic union damaged in some way. Some among us can testify of having had this organic union temporarily cut off by hearing the words of those who taught differently. Inwardly these ones realized that the organic union within them had ceased. That was the overthrowing of their faith.<h2 class=head1>II. THE FIRM FOUNDATION OF GOD AND ITS SEAL</h2><p>In verse 19 Paul declares, &#8220;However, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those who are His, and, Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.&#8221; Many Christian teachers claim that the foundation here refers to Christ. It is true that in 1 Corinthians 3:11 Paul says that Christ is the unique foundation. Apart from Him, we do not have any other foundation. Nevertheless, if we consider verse 19 according to the context of the chapter, we shall see that the foundation here does not refer to Christ as the foundation of the church, but refers to the church as the foundation, or base, of the truth. Verses 14 through 18 give instruction concerning how to deal with heresies on the negative side and how to handle the truth on the positive side. According to the context of verses 15, 18, and 25, the foundation here does not refer to Christ as the foundation of the church, but to the church as the foundation of the truth. This corresponds to &#8220;the base of the truth,&#8221; which holds the truth (1 Tim. 3:15), especially the truth of the resurrection of Christ (Acts 4:33).<p>The church is built with the divine life in Christ, a life which is indestructible, unconquerable (Heb. 7:16; Acts 2:24), and able to withstand decline into death from any source. Hence, the church is the firm foundation of God that stands forever against any heresy. No matter what kind of heresies may come in or how extensively the gangrene may spread, this firm foundation stands.<p>Certain of those who left the Lord&#8217;s recovery expected that soon afterwards the recovery would collapse. However, because it is built upon a firm foundation, the recovery did not collapse and it will never collapse. Had the Lord&#8217;s recovery been founded on something other than the divine life, the eternal life, it would have collapsed long ago. But because the recovery has the firm foundation of the truth, it is not hurt by attack. On the contrary, those who seek to damage the recovery actually damage themselves, and at the same time they strengthen the recovery and expose the firmness of its foundation. The recovery is built on something eternal and divine-God&#8217;s life with His nature. For this reason, not even the gates of Hades can conquer it. Because it is built on the indestructible and unconquerable eternal life, the firm foundation of the truth stands. In recent years, it has not been necessary for us to protect the Lord&#8217;s recovery. It has been protected by the unconquerable divine life. Hence, the church is the firm foundation of God standing in the eternal life.<p>Paul says that this firm foundation has &#8220;this seal.&#8221; The seal has two sides. On the Lord&#8217;s side it is: &#8220;The Lord knows those who are His.&#8221; This is based on the Lord&#8217;s divine life, which He has given to all His believers and which has brought them into an organic union with Him, making them one with Him and causing them to become His. On our side it is: &#8220;Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.&#8221; This is the issue of the divine life: it enables us to depart from unrighteousness and keeps us blameless in His holy name. The church as the firm foundation in the divine life bears such a two-sided seal, testifying that the Lord&#8217;s divine life has made us His and has kept us from things which are contrary to His righteous way.<h2 class=head1>III. A GREAT HOUSE</h2><p>Verse 19 indicates definitely that the ones exposed in verses 16 through 18 are not the Lord&#8217;s. Their evil doings are a strong proof of this.<p>In verse 20 Paul continues, &#8220;But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthen, and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor.&#8221; The word &#8220;but&#8221; at the beginning of this verse indicates that it stands in contrast to the definition in the preceding verse concerning genuine believers.<p>What does Paul mean by the expression &#8220;a great house&#8221;? In this great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthen ones, and some unto honor and others unto dishonor. I have spent a great deal of time considering this matter before the Lord. The house of God defined in 1 Timothy 3:15 and 16 is the genuine church in its divine nature and essential character as the foundation of the truth, whereas the great house here refers to the deteriorated church in its mixed character, as illustrated by the abnormally big tree in Matthew 13:31 and 32. In this great house there are not only precious vessels, but also base ones. Thus, we cannot believe that the great house in this verse refers to the church as the house of the living God in 1 Timothy 3:15. The great house is certainly not the house of the living God. The house of the living God is the great mystery of godliness and also God manifest in the flesh. How could such a house contain vessels unto dishonor? Therefore, the great house no doubt refers to Christendom, to Christianity. Furthermore, this great house is equal to the big tree in Matthew 13. The genuine church today is the house of the living God, whereas abnormal Christianity is the great house. How great today is this abnormal house! Just as many unclean birds lodge in the big tree, so in the great house there are vessels unto dishonor, wooden and earthen vessels. In the genuine church, however, there are only gold and silver vessels.<h2 class=head2>A. Vessels unto Honor and unto Dishonor</h2><p>Honorable vessels are of both the divine nature (gold) and the redeemed and regenerated human nature (silver). These, like Timothy and other genuine believers, constitute the sure foundation to hold the truth. Dishonorable vessels are of the fallen human nature (wood and earth). Hymenaeus, Philetus, and other false believers are of these.<h2 class=head2>B. Cleansed from the Dishonorable Vessels</h2><p>In verse 21 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master, prepared unto every good work.&#8221; To cleanse ourselves is to &#8220;depart from unrighteousness&#8221; (v. 19), as an outward evidence of the inward divine nature. The word &#8220;these&#8221; in verse 21 denotes the vessels unto dishonor, including those mentioned in verses 16 through 18. We should not only cleanse ourselves from anything unrighteous, but also from the dishonorable vessels. This means that we must stay away from them. Hence, we must cleanse ourselves from the unrighteous things and from the dishonorable vessels of wood and earth. If we cleanse ourselves from these negative things and negative persons, we shall be vessels unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master, and prepared unto every good work. Unto honor is a matter of nature, sanctified is a matter of position, useful is a matter of practice, and prepared is a matter of training.<h2 class=head1>IV. PAUL&#8217;S CHARGE TO TIMOTHY</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Fleeing and Pursuing</h2><p>Verse 22 continues, &#8220;But flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&#8221; Timothy should beware not only of outward corruption among the churches, but also of inward lusts within himself. He must avoid the outward corruption and flee the inward lusts. Furthermore, he should pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. Righteousness is toward self, faith is toward God, and love is toward others. Peace is the consequence of these three virtues.<h2 class=head2>B. Calling On the Lord</h2><p>To call on the Lord out of a pure heart is to &#8220;name the name of the Lord&#8221; in our prayer and praise to Him. The Lord&#8217;s seekers must be those who call on His name. Today those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart are found in His recovery. Thank the Lord that we are with those who call on Him out of a pure heart. With such believers we may pursue the virtues of righteousness, faith, love, and peace.<h2 class=head2>C. Refusing Foolish and Ignorant Questionings</h2><p>In verse 23 Paul says, &#8220;But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they produce contentions.&#8221; The Greek word rendered foolish may also be rendered stupid. The word ignorant denotes that which is uninstructed, undisciplined, untrained, that is, not subject to God, but following one&#8217;s own mind and will (Darby). The word produce means to engender, to beget. We must refuse such foolish questionings, for they have their source in Satan, the serpent. Many years ago I read that someone suggested that the serpent may have stood up in the form of a question mark when he talked with Eve. He questioned her with the words, &#8220;Hath God said?&#8221; (Gen. 3:1). All foolish questionings originate with the serpent. Thus, we should refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, questionings which beget contentions. These questionings always arise from an evil, serpentine source.<h2 class=head2>D. Not Contending</h2><p>In verse 24 Paul goes on, &#8220;And a slave of the Lord must not contend, but be gentle toward all; apt to teach, bearing with wrong.&#8221; When people wrong you, you should not be troubled. Instead, as a slave of the Lord, you should be gentle and bear with the wrong.<h2 class=head2>E. Correcting Those Who Oppose</h2><p>In verse 25 Paul continues, &#8220;In meekness correcting those who oppose, if perhaps God may give them repentance unto the full knowledge of the truth.&#8221; Paul&#8217;s use of the word repentance indicates that with the opposers of the truth it is the heart and conscience which are in question. The truth is the revelation of the living God and His economy-His heart&#8217;s desire. To receive the divine revelation, the heart and conscience need to be rightly exercised toward God. The heart should be turned to Him, directed solely to Him, and the conscience must be pure and void of offense before Him. Otherwise, one might be carried away as a captive by the Devil and fall into his snare (v. 26).<p>In verse 25 Paul again refers to the full knowledge of the truth. Paul does not speak here of the full knowledge of the Bible or the full knowledge of doctrine and teaching. He emphasizes repentance unto the full knowledge of the truth. The inoculator must bear the burden to correct with meekness those who oppose in the hope that they may be enlightened, repent, and return to the full knowledge of the truth.<p>It is possible that those who repent &#8220;may return to soberness out of the snare of the Devil, having been caught by him, unto His will&#8221; (v. 26). According to Vincent, to return to soberness means to become sober again, to awake out of a drunken stupor. Paul&#8217;s use of the expression &#8220;the snare of the Devil&#8221; indicates that the opposers of the truth, being short of the adequate knowledge of the divine revelation, have been captured and kept in a snare by the Devil. The enemy of God occupies their reprobate mind with error and shuts God out, just as he did with the Pharisees (John 8:42-45). They need to return to God in their heart and have a thorough dealing in their conscience.<p>The pronoun &#8220;him&#8221; in the phrase &#8220;having been caught by him&#8221; refers to the Devil. However, &#8220;unto His will,&#8221; literally translated &#8220;unto the will of that One,&#8221; refers to God, mentioned in verse 25. Hence, it means toward God&#8217;s will, for God&#8217;s will, to do God&#8217;s will.<p>Suppose some approach you with the intention of arguing about a certain doctrine or practice. Instead of entering into an argument with them, present God&#8217;s dispensation to them. In order to do this, you need to be familiar with the contents of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. All the saints should be trained, perhaps by the leading ones in their locality, to present the full knowledge of the truth, to share with others the reality of the contents of God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<p>Often we are asked why we say that we are the church. The first time I heard this question in the United States was in 1963. During a time of fellowship, a brother asked me, &#8220;Why does your group call itself the church in Los Angeles?&#8221; In answer to this very good question I pointed out that in the Bible the saints in a particular locality, such as Jerusalem or Antioch, were regarded simply as the church in that locality. Acts 8:1 speaks of the church in Jerusalem, and 13:1, of the church in Antioch. I went on to point out that in Jerusalem there was just one church. Peter, James, and John were all for the building up of the one church in Jerusalem. However, today&#8217;s Christians have gone astray and meet in many different denominations. For this reason, in the city of Los Angeles there are different kinds of so-called churches. There are even groups which say they are a Chinese church or a Korean church. Then I asked which of these different kinds of churches we should join. The one who raised the question about the church in Los Angeles admitted that we should not join any of those so-called churches. Then I proceeded to say that if we in Los Angeles do not call ourselves the church in Los Angeles, we shall be another sect. If we are not the church in Los Angeles, then what are we? We have no choice but to call ourselves the church in Los Angeles.<p>Realizing that some may say that the church in Los Angeles should include all the saints in that city, I went on to say, &#8220;It is true that the church in Los Angeles includes all the believers in Los Angeles. However, most of them are not willing to meet simply as the church. This is their responsibility, not ours. For example, the Jones family may have many members. Suppose the majority of the members move away from home and only three remain. Are these three not the Jones family? Are they wrong to put a sign on their house saying &#8216;The Jones Family&#8217;? Certainly not. If they are not called Jones, then what should they be called? It certainly would be wrong for them to take the name of Smith or any other name. It is right for them to say that they are the Jones family, even though many of the members of the family have gone away and live elsewhere. Likewise, many of those who are truly members of the church in Los Angeles do not meet as the church. Nevertheless, those who do stand as the church have the right to describe themselves as the church in Los Angeles.&#8221;<p>On this occasion I asked, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t those in the denominations call themselves the church? They are bothered by the fact that we claim to be the church in Los Angeles. They need to ask themselves why they take such names as Presbyterian and Lutheran. I hope that they would be willing to drop these names and simply be the local church in their city. To those who are willing to do this in this city I would say, &#8216;Since we are all the same church, the church in Los Angeles, why don&#8217;t we simply come together and be the church? Let us all meet together for the church life.&#8217; &#8221; This is one illustration of how we need to learn the full knowledge of the truth and then learn how to present the truth to others, especially to opposers. It is our hope that others may be enlightened and also come to the full knowledge of the truth.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>THE WORSENING OF THE DECLINE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 3:1-13</h1><p>The subject of 2 Timothy is inoculation against the decline of the church. After a word of introduction (1:1-2), Paul speaks of the divine provisions for the inoculation: a pure conscience, unfeigned faith, the divine gift, a strong spirit, eternal grace, incorruptible life, the healthy word, and the indwelling Spirit (1:3-14). Then he goes on to point out that the basic factor of the decline is the forsaking of the apostle and his ministry (1:15-18). In 2:1-15 Paul speaks of the inoculator, indicating that he must be a teacher, soldier, contender, husbandman, and workman. In the second half of chapter two he tells us of the spread of the decline, a spreading likened to that of gangrene (2:16-26). In chapter three Paul first speaks of the worsening of the decline, showing that it will become grievous times of deceiving (3:1-13), and then speaks of the antidote of the inoculation-the divine word (3:14-17). In chapter four there are three sections: the incentive to the inoculator-the coming reward (4:1-8); the issue of the decline-loving the present age and doing many evil things (4:9-18); and the conclusion (4:19-22). If we consider the outline of 2 Timothy, we shall see that it is not merely a pastoral book, a book for so-called pastors. On the contrary, it is a book written for inoculators, those who would inoculate others against the decline of the church.<h2 class=head1>I. THE DIFFICULT TIMES</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Coming in the Last Days</h2><p>Chapter three opens with the words, &#8220;But know this, that in the last days difficult times shall come.&#8221; Once again Paul uses the word &#8220;but&#8221; to point out a contrast. The contrast here is with the hope just expressed at the end of the preceding chapter. Toward the end of chapter two Paul declared that &#8220;the firm foundation of God stands&#8221; (v. 19), and that we should &#8220;flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart&#8221; (v. 22). Furthermore, if in meekness we correct those who oppose, &#8220;God may give them repentance unto the full knowledge of the truth, and they may return to soberness out of the snare of the Devil&#8221; (vv. 25-26). Paul realized that even though the decline would spread, the firm foundation of God still stands unshakable, bearing a seal which says, &#8220;The Lord knows those who are His,&#8221; and, &#8220;Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.&#8221; At least God would have a remnant of those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace. Furthermore, such ones may even dispense the inoculation against the church&#8217;s decline. Yes, the decline is spreading, but we have a firm standing, we can enjoy the riches of the Lord, and we can do the work of inoculation, even convincing those who oppose to come back to the full knowledge of the truth. This is to bring back those who have been caught by the Devil, and snared by him, to God&#8217;s will. All this indicates that Paul was not discouraged. Even though the decline is spreading, we can do something positively to inoculate others against it.<p>Then in contrast to all this Paul says in 3:1, &#8220;But know this, that in the last days difficult times shall come.&#8221; Paul had the foresight and the insight to realize that difficult times would come in the last days. The expression &#8220;the last days&#8221; denotes the closing period of the present age (2 Pet. 3:3; Jude 18). It began from the end of the so-called apostolic age, in the latter part of the first century, and will last until Christ&#8217;s second appearing. The long duration of this period was not revealed to the apostles (Matt. 24:36); they expected the Lord to return in their generation.<p>Many Christians identify &#8220;the last days&#8221; in 3:1 with the &#8220;later times&#8221; in 1 Timothy 4:1. This is a mistake. In the Bible there is a dividing line between the Old Testament and the New Testament. The ancient Jews regarded the times of the Old Testament as the early times or early days. With the coming of Christ the period of the Mosaic law was over. Christ&#8217;s coming began a new period, regarded as the last days, which will continue until Christ&#8217;s second coming. Concerning Christ&#8217;s second coming, there is a secret period of time, which was not known by the apostles. They were eager to know the time of the Lord&#8217;s second coming. But in Mark 13:32 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;But of that day or that hour knoweth no one, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.&#8221; Later, after the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, the disciples asked Him, &#8220;Dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?&#8221; (Acts 1:6). To this the Lord replied, &#8220;It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father hath set within his own authority&#8221; (v. 7). It is not easy to explain how the Lord could say that only the Father, not the Son, knows the time of the end. Perhaps in refusing to answer the question about the time of His coming, the Lord Jesus was maintaining the proper position under the headship of the Father. Therefore, He told them that this was something which &#8220;the Father hath set within his own authority.&#8221;<p>The early disciples thought that the Lord Jesus would come back in their generation. This was Paul&#8217;s concept when he wrote 1 and 2 Thessalonians. This shows that the length of the last days was a secret unknown by the apostles. We simply do not know the duration of time the Father has set in His administration between the Lord&#8217;s ascension and His second coming.<p>In 3:1 Paul says that in the last days &#8220;difficult times shall come.&#8221; The Greek for &#8220;difficult times&#8221; also means hard times, grievous times, perilous times. This means that these times will be extremely difficult for Christians. In verse 12 Paul says, &#8220;All who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.&#8221; For those who pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace and who call on the name of the Lord out of a pure heart, this time will indeed be difficult, grievous, perilous. Here Paul seems to be saying, &#8220;Timothy, I am encouraged by the fact that the firm foundation of God stands and that, with others, you can pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace and call on the Lord out of a pure heart. You can stand together and dispense the inoculation against the decline of the church. Some may even be recovered to the full knowledge of the truth and to the will of God. Nevertheless, I want you to know that the time which is coming will be very difficult for you. This time will be grievous, perilous, for all those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart and who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<h2 class=head2>B. What Men Shall Be</h2><p>In verse 2 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy.&#8221; The prophetic picture presented in verses 2 through 5 portrays not the evil condition of non-Christian society, but the corrupted situation of the &#8220;great house&#8221; mentioned in 2:20, degraded Christianity. This is proved by the phrase, &#8220;having a form of godliness&#8221; (v. 5). Unbelievers do not have even the form of godliness. Those who have such a form are those who are called Christians. Thus, the men in verse 2 are Christians.<p>The first thing Paul says about these men is that they will be &#8220;lovers of self.&#8221; Many Christians today are self-lovers. Not only those who indulge in worldly entertainments are selfish; even those who attend the chapels and cathedrals may be selfish.<p>In the three Epistles of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus seven kinds of lovers are mentioned: lovers of self, lovers of money (2 Tim. 3:2; 1 Tim. 6:10), lovers of pleasure, lovers of God (2 Tim 3:4), lovers of good (Titus 1:8), lovers of husbands, and lovers of children (Titus 2:4). There are also two kinds of nonlovers: nonlovers of good and nonlovers of God (2 Tim. 3:3-4). Of whatever one is a lover, that is what his whole heart, even his entire being, is set on, occupied, and possessed by. This is crucial! Whether there could be a day of glory in the church&#8217;s victory or grievous days of the church&#8217;s decline depends altogether upon what we set our heart upon, what it is we love. History tells us that the root of the church&#8217;s decline was the loss of her first love toward the Lord (Rev. 2:4). To maintain the victorious standard of the church, we must be lovers of God and lovers of the good which pertains to God&#8217;s economy.<p>In verse 2 Paul speaks of those who are boasters, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, and unholy. The Greek word for arrogant also means haughty, and the word rendered revilers is literally blasphemers, as in 1 Timothy 1:13. Here, however, it does not refer to blasphemers of God, but to revilers or railers, those who speak evilly and injuriously of men. How much we have been reviled by those who call themselves Christians!<p>In a foregoing message I mentioned that some brothers in Taiwan who had been under my training for years became dissenting. Some even reviled God&#8217;s government. They were not only rebellious, but they were also unthankful, ungrateful. It is significant that in verse 2 Paul puts together unthankfulness with disobedience to parents. This may indicate that here unthankful mainly refers to being unthankful to one&#8217;s parents. We should be thankful to those who have raised us both physically and spiritually, thankful both to our natural parents and to our spiritual parents.<p>In the 1940s Brother Nee suffered intense opposition and was forced to be out of function for six years. Some of those who were dissenting with him still felt positive toward me because they had received help from me. One day one of them asked me, &#8220;Do you believe that Brother Nee has never been wrong?&#8221; I answered, &#8220;Whether or not Brother Nee has ever been wrong is not my business. I only know that I am indebted to him just as a child to his parents. If it were not for this servant of the Lord, I could not have the life I now have as a Christian. I have learned the lesson of Ham, the son of Noah, and I dare not say anything negative about him. In a real sense, he has been a spiritual father to me. He has raised me up in the Lord. Therefore, I do not dare say anything negative concerning him.&#8221; I can testify that throughout the years I have seen the blessing which has come from maintaining such an attitude toward my spiritual father. Both to our parents in the flesh and in the spirit we must learn to be thankful. It is a very serious matter to be ungrateful toward our parents. One aspect of today&#8217;s trend is unthankfulness. This trend, this current, has even swept into Christianity.<p>In verses 3 and 4 Paul continues, &#8220;Without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, savage, nonlovers of good, traitors, reckless, blinded with pride, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.&#8221; To be implacable is to be irreconcilable, to be a traitor is to be a betrayer, and to be reckless is to be headstrong. In the picture presented here there are three kinds of lovers-lovers of self, lovers of money, and lovers of pleasure-and two kinds of nonlovers-nonlovers of good and nonlovers of God.<p>Verse 5 says, &#8220;Having a form of godliness, but having denied its power; from these also turn away.&#8221; A form of godliness is a mere outward semblance without the essential reality. The power of godliness is the real and practical virtue of a living influence to express God.<p>In these verses we have a dreadful picture of today&#8217;s degraded Christianity. By the Lord&#8217;s mercy and grace, we in His recovery must reject the situation portrayed here and be the very opposite of it.<p>Verses 6 and 7 speak of those who are &#8220;always learning and never able to come to the full knowledge of the truth.&#8221; This word has been fulfilled among many Christians today. They hear sermon after sermon and study the Bible, but they do not know the reality of the contents of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. They do not know Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God or the church as the mystery of Christ.<p>Verse 8 says, &#8220;And just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind, disapproved concerning the faith.&#8221; According to Jewish tradition, Jannes and Jambres were the Egyptian magicians who opposed Moses, as mentioned in Exodus 7:11 and 22.<p>In the decline among the churches, truth is the target of the enemy&#8217;s attack. Hence, truth is also the remedy and rescue from the diseased and ruined situation. In verse 8 disapproved means reprobate, and the faith denotes the contents of our belief.<p>In verse 9 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;They shall not advance farther, for their folly shall be completely manifest to all, as also the folly of those became.&#8221; The word folly refers to the lack of intelligence and the senselessness of their doing. The &#8220;folly of those&#8221; refers to the folly of Jannes and Jambres, who were defeated and brought to nothing (Exo. 8:18; 9:11).<h2 class=head1>II. THE INOCULATOR STANDING AGAINST THE TIDE OF THE DECLINE</h2><p>In verse 10 Paul reminds Timothy, &#8220;But you have closely followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, endurance.&#8221; Conduct refers to manner of life, and the Greek word for purpose is used in Paul&#8217;s Epistles in relation to the purpose of God.<p>In verse 11 Paul speaks of the persecution and sufferings which he endured in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. Lystra was the city where Timothy lived (Acts 16:1-2), near Iconium and Antioch in Pisidia.<p>Verse 12 says, &#8220;And indeed, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.&#8221; The Greek word rendered desire can also mean determine. To live godly is to live a life of godliness. All those who desire, determine, to live a life of godliness in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. For this reason we should not expect good treatment from today&#8217;s Christianity. Instead, we should expect persecution for living a godly life in an ungodly situation. As long as we stand for the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we shall be condemned, opposed, and attacked. Rumors will be spread concerning us, and our names will be smeared and defiled. Such persecution comes not from the worldly people, but from so-called Christians. In John 16:2 the Lord Jesus said that the time is coming when those who kill the disciples will think they are serving God. Out of their zeal for God, they will kill the followers of the Lord, simply because these do not follow the traditional way.<h2 class=head1>III. THE WORSENING OF THE DECLINE</h2><p>In verse 13 Paul concludes, &#8220;But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.&#8221; The word impostors means juggling impostors. This verse indicates that the decline of the church will become worse. Evil men and impostors, those who deceive others by their skill in juggling, will become worse and worse. Being deceived themselves, they will also deceive others.<p>We thank the Lord that, in His mercy, He has brought us into the recovery where we can hear honest and healthy words.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIX</h1><h1 class=title>THE ANTIDOTE OF THE INOCULATION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 3:14-17</h1><p>We have seen that the subject of 2 Timothy is the inoculation against the decline of the church. In this message we shall consider the antidote of the inoculation, which is the divine Word. In 2:16-26 we have the spread of the decline and in 3:1-13, the worsening of the decline. We praise the Lord that in 3:14-17 we have a wonderful, heavenly, divine, spiritual, and rich antidote. As we shall see, this antidote is the divine word of the Old Testament and the New Testament, the God-breathed Scripture which is profitable for teaching, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness and which completes the man of God and fully equips him for every good work.<h2 class=head1>I. THE DIVINE WORD</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Of the New Testament</h2><p>Second Timothy 3:14 says, &#8220;But you, continue in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned.&#8221; The things which Timothy learned of the apostle and was assured of were the vital portion of the content of the New Testament, which completed the divine revelation (Col. 1:25). Hence, he had the practical understanding of a great part of the New Testament. These were the things he had learned from Paul and which he had been assured of by him.<p>The word ministered by Paul was the completing word of God&#8217;s revelation, the main part of the New Testament. Verse 14 indicates that from Paul Timothy received the proper knowledge of the New Testament and became assured of it, even though at that time the New Testament was not complete as a written volume. Timothy was granted the central revelation of the New Testament.<h2 class=head2>B. Of the Old Testament</h2><p>In verse 15 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;And that from a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.&#8221; In addition to the knowledge of the New Testament, Timothy also had, from his childhood, a good foundation in the knowledge of the Old Testament. He was one who was fully perfected and equipped to minister the word of God, not only in caring for a local church, but also in confronting the increasing decline of the church.<p>Together verses 14 and 15 refer to both the Old Testament and the New Testament. By knowing the sacred writings from childhood, Timothy was familiar with the Old Testament, and from Paul he gained a proper knowledge of the central part of the New Testament. Therefore, Timothy had a proper understanding of the Bible as a whole. Today all the saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, especially the young people, need the understanding of the Word of God, an understanding of both the Old Testament and the New Testament.<h2 class=head1>II. THE SCRIPTURE</h2><h2 class=head2>A. All God-breathed</h2><p>Verse 16 says, &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.&#8221; The Greek words rendered, &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable,&#8221; may also be translated &#8220;Every Scripture God-breathed is also profitable.&#8221;<p>To confront the death, corruption, and confusion in the church&#8217;s decline, the eternal life upon which chapter one is based (vv. 1, 10), the divine truth emphasized in chapter two (vv. 15, 18, 25), and the holy Scripture highly regarded in chapter three (vv. 14-17) are all needed. The eternal life not only swallows up death, but also renders the life supply; the divine truth replaces the vanity of corruption with the reality of all the divine riches; and the holy Scripture not only dispels confusion, but also furnishes divine light and revelation. Hence, in this book the apostle stresses these three things.<p>The expression &#8220;God-breathed&#8221; indicates that the Scripture, the Word of God, is the breath of God. God&#8217;s speaking is God&#8217;s breathing. Hence, His word is spirit (John 6:63), pneuma, or breath. Thus, the Scripture is the embodiment of God as the Spirit. The Spirit is therefore the very essence, the substance, of the Scripture, just as phosphorus is the essential substance in matches. We must &#8220;strike&#8221; the Spirit of the Scripture with our spirit to kindle the divine fire.<p>As the embodiment of God the Spirit, the Scripture is also the embodiment of Christ. Christ is God&#8217;s living Word (Rev. 19:13), and the Scripture is God&#8217;s written word (Matt. 4:4).<h2 class=head2>B. Profitable</h2><p>According to verse 16, all Scripture is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness. Reproof here means conviction or confutation. Correction denotes setting right what is wrong, turning someone to the right way, or restoring a person to an upright state. Instruction refers to discipline or chastisement in righteousness. This means to discipline or chastise in the element and condition of righteousness.<h2 class=head2>C. To Complete the Man of God</h2><p>In verse 17 Paul says, &#8220;That the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.&#8221; We have seen that a man of God is one who partakes of God&#8217;s life and nature (John 1:13; 2 Pet. 1:4) and thus becomes one with Him in His life and nature (1 Cor. 6:17) and thereby expresses Him. This corresponds to the mystery of godliness, which is God manifest in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16). Through the God-breathed Scripture, the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work. Complete here means complete and perfect in qualifications, and equipped denotes being fitted out, furnished, made ready.<p>We need to know the Bible not merely according to letters in black and white, but also according to the divine revelation and heavenly wisdom. Do not think that having an advanced degree qualifies anyone to understand a book such as Ephesians. If we study this Epistle only in letters, we shall not be able to understand it. For a proper understanding of this book, and for the Bible as a whole, we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation. This was the reason Paul prayed, &#8220;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, the eyes of your heart having been enlightened&#8221; (Eph. 1:17-18). We thank the Lord that for more than fifty years we have been receiving such a spirit of wisdom and revelation. As a result, the messages put out in the Lord&#8217;s recovery always contain something fresh and new. These messages are given not merely according to the black and white letters of the Scripture, but according to the spirit of wisdom and revelation.<p>We in the Lord&#8217;s recovery do not treasure theology, tradition, or the councils. We honor, respect, and treasure the holy Word under the shining of the heavenly light which comes by a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Because we depend on God&#8217;s enlightenment, His Word is opened to us.<p>Many Christians misuse 3:16 and 17. They point out that the holy Scripture is for teaching, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness and that it enables the man of God to be equipped, completed, and perfected. Although all this is true, it neglects the element of life in the Word. Those who regard the Bible as a book of teaching, reproof, correction, and instruction often ignore the life essence of the Word. As human beings we have a physical body outwardly, but inwardly we have a spirit and a soul. Our person is composed not mainly of the outward part, the body, but of the inward parts, the spirit and the soul. The principle is the same with the Bible. The Bible has not only a &#8220;body&#8221; of letters in black and white; it also has a spirit, because it is God-breathed. If in reading the Bible we exercise only our mind to study it, we shall not receive the life supply.<p>Most Christians neglect the spirit and take the Bible as a book of letters. The Lord Jesus once said, &#8220;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life&#8221; (John 6:63). Furthermore, we have pointed out that every word of the Bible is part of God&#8217;s breath. Thus, we should not only study the Word, but also breathe in the divine breath embodied in the Word. If we do not breathe the divine breath by exercising our spirit, we shall not receive life from our study of the Bible. But when we breathe in God&#8217;s breath, we are enlivened by a divine, heavenly, and spiritual element.<p>I wish to emphasize the fact that to study the Bible in order to follow its instructions is not sufficient. Often during a wedding ceremony a minister will instruct the bride and groom according to Paul&#8217;s word in Ephesians 5. The minister will then remind the wife to submit to the husband and the husband to love his wife. Although they may promise to fulfill these requirements, they will not be able to do so unless they receive the divine breath in the Word. The instructions in righteousness given according to the Bible do not work if we do not receive the breath of God, for then, in practice, we shall make these instructions the same as the ethical teachings of Confucius.<p>We thank the Lord for showing us that in reading the Word we need to exercise our eyes, our mind, and our spirit. We may say that with the eyes we contact the body of the Word, that with our mind we contact the soul of the Word, and through the exercise of our spirit to pray the Word, we contact the spirit of the Word. Then we not only understand the meaning of a certain portion of Scripture; we also inhale the divine breath to receive the life supply.<p>Many of us can testify that a certain verse of the Bible may be very precious to us as we read it. However, disciples of Confucius may also regard certain statements made by him as precious. But with the teachings of Confucius there is no divine breath. God&#8217;s Word contains His breath. Within the letters of the Bible there is the Spirit who gives life. This is the reason that in reading the Word we must exercise our spirit in addition to our mind. Then the verses we read will be not only precious to us, but they will nourish, refresh, and water us.<p>Actually, the function of the Word in teaching, reproof, correction, and instruction is all related to transformation. The Bible corrects us not primarily outwardly, but inwardly in the way of transformation. This means that the word of Scripture works within us in a metabolic way. Just as the food we eat and digest nourishes us from within, metabolically changing and transforming us, so the Word of God transforms us by inwardly teaching, reproving, correcting, and instructing us.<p>If we would be nourished by the Word, we should not only pray it, but also psalm it and sing it. In Colossians 3:16 Paul says, &#8220;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.&#8221; By praying, psalming, and singing the Word we shall fan our spirit into flame. Furthermore, when we pray, psalm, and sing the Word, we inhale the divine breath and receive more of the element of God. In this way God dispenses Himself into us and infuses us with His element.<p>We cannot deny the fact that the Lord has shown us much light from His Word. For example, much light has been shed on the Gospel of John. If you read the outline of the Gospel of John printed in the Recovery Version, you will realize that the Lord indeed has opened the Word to us. Many may know the Bible in black and white letters, but, by the Lord&#8217;s mercy and grace, we know the Bible in life, light, and spirit.<p>Allow me to testify concerning the light we have received on John 16:8-11. One day in my reading of these verses I saw that sin, righteousness, and judgment are related to the three persons of Adam, Christ, and Satan. Sometime later I was asked to give the message for a gospel meeting in the church in Shanghai. I spoke on these verses and told the people, &#8220;As human beings, you were born in Adam. In Adam you have sinned and you have been condemned. But there is another person-Christ-and there is a way for you to get out of Adam and into Christ that you may be justified by God. If you believe in Christ, you will be transferred into Him. But if you do not believe into Christ, you will remain in Adam, the first person, and eventually your destiny will be that of Satan, the third person. Judgment has been prepared for Satan. Do you intend to help Satan suffer judgment for eternity? Will you remain in Adam with sin and eventually share the judgment with Satan, or will you believe in Christ and be transferred into Him in order to receive the gift of righteousness?&#8221; That message was very good, full of light. After delivering that message, I was fully nourished. Brother Nee spoke to me sometime later concerning that message and said, &#8220;Witness, hardly anyone has seen that in John 16:8-11 sin is related to Adam, righteousness to Christ, and judgment to Satan. I encourage you to continue to teach the Bible in this way.&#8221; I could never forget Brother Nee&#8217;s word to me. Today I am still being encouraged, strengthened, and confirmed by that word.<p>We thank the Lord that over the years the light has been shining upon us, even pouring out upon us. Apart from the Lord&#8217;s enlightening, we may read 2 Timothy a dozen times without seeing anything related to the inoculation. To see this we need a light. Under the light we can realize that the divine word, the Scripture, is the antidote of the inoculation.<p>We should not read the Bible in the way the religionists did at the time of the Lord Jesus and Paul. They did not realize that the title of God-the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob-implied resurrection. Probably Gamaliel instructed Paul according to Genesis 12 and 15, but it was not until Paul was enlightened of the Lord and received revelation that he realized that Abraham&#8217;s wife and his concubine typified two covenants. This shows that it is one thing to be a Bible scholar; it is quite another thing to have the light of God&#8217;s revelation.<p>We should not merely study the Word in letter. We need to pray that the Lord would give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation. If we do not have such a spirit but read only the black and white letters of the Bible, we shall not experience life, light, or spirit. There is a great difference between the way the Bible is used among most Christians today and the way it is used among us in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. The majority of believers use the Word in the way of letters, but we use it in the way of life, light, and spirit. This is the reason we constantly humble ourselves before the Lord, open to Him, and look to Him for light, vision, wisdom, and revelation. May we all learn to come to the Word of God in this way.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE INCENTIVE TO THE INOCULATOR</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 4:1-8</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the incentive to the inoculator (4:1-8). As we shall see, this incentive is the coming reward.<h2 class=head1>I. THE APOSTLE&#8217;S CHARGE</h2><p>In 4:1 Paul says to Timothy, &#8220;I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, Who is about to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom.&#8221; God has given all judgment to Christ because He is a man (John 5:22, 27; Acts 10:42; 17:31; Rom. 2:16). As the righteous Judge (2 Tim. 4:8), He will judge the living from His throne of glory at His second appearing (Matt. 25:31-46), and He will judge the dead at the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15).<p>In 4:1 Paul speaks of Christ&#8217;s appearing and His kingdom. Christ&#8217;s appearing will be for judgment, to reward each one of us (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12), and His kingdom will be for His reigning with His overcomers (Rev. 20:4, 6). By these two events the apostle charges Timothy to fulfill his ministry of the word faithfully. Here it seems that Paul is saying, &#8220;Timothy, you must realize that your life and work today have much to do with the Lord&#8217;s appearing and His kingdom. At His appearing will you be praised by the Lord, or will you receive a rebuke from Him? Will you receive a reward or chastisement? Will you be considered qualified to participate in the divine kingship and reign with Christ for a thousand years, or will you be disqualified from reigning with Him? Timothy, you need to think seriously about these things. Thus, I charge you by the Lord&#8217;s appearing and kingdom.&#8221;<p>It is a matter of great significance to be charged by the Lord&#8217;s appearing and kingdom. As genuine Christians we are saved for eternity, but how are we living our Christian life, and how well are we fulfilling our Christian duty? Are we taking care of God&#8217;s New Testament economy? Do we practice the proper church life, the Body life, to express God in Christ through the Spirit? These questions deserve our attention, for the way we answer them may determine our future as far as the Lord&#8217;s appearing and coming kingdom are concerned. Do not listen to the superstitious and superficial teachings which tell you that as long as you are saved you cannot have any problems with the Lord at His coming. You may have great problems when you meet Him at the judgment seat. Every believer in Christ, every genuinely saved person, must stand before the judgment seat of Christ and be judged by Him not concerning salvation or perdition, but concerning reward or punishment. Because this is a solemn matter, Paul charged Timothy before God and Christ Jesus and by the Lord&#8217;s appearing and kingdom.<p>In verse 2 Paul continues his charge: &#8220;Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.&#8221; The word Timothy was to preach included what he had learned both of Paul and of the Old Testament (3:14-15). This proves that verses 1 and 2 are a continuation of 3:14-17. In caring for a local church, especially in a time of the church&#8217;s decline, the preaching of the Word is vital.<p>Timothy was not merely to preach a word about salvation from hell to heaven. He was to speak a completing word regarding God&#8217;s revelation concerning Christ and the church. Such a healthy word is the truth, the reality of the contents of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. Timothy was charged to be ready to preach this word in season and out of season. To preach in season and out of season means to preach whether the situation is opportune or inopportune, whether it is convenient or inconvenient, whether you are welcome or unwelcome. Furthermore, Timothy was to reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all longsuffering and teaching. Reprove here means to convict. The adjective all modifies both longsuffering and teaching. It speaks of teaching in many aspects and directions. The carrying out of such teaching requires longsuffering.<h2 class=head1>II. THE TIME OF APOSTASY</h2><p>Verses 3 and 4 say, &#8220;For the time will come when they will not tolerate healthy teaching, but according to their own lusts they will heap up to themselves teachers tickling the ear, and they will turn away their ear from the truth, and will be turned aside to fables.&#8221; The time mentioned in verse 3 refers to the time when the decline of the church becomes worse. At that time many will not tolerate healthy teaching, teaching which is healthy in life and which ministers the supply of life. Instead, they will prefer teachers who tickle the ear. This indicates that those who do not tolerate healthy teaching have an itching ear, an ear which seeks pleasing speaking for its own pleasure. Furthermore, such persons will turn away their ear from the truth and will be turned aside to fables. The itching ear that is turned away is the main factor of the worsening decline in the churches.<p>Many Christians today do not tolerate the healthy teachings related to God&#8217;s economy. When we teach that Christ is the God-man, the One who is the embodiment of God as His expression, some accuse us of blasphemy or heresy. Some have even gone so far as to twist our words concerning Christ as the God-man and, in print, to falsely accuse us of teaching that Christ was neither quite God nor quite man. In The Four Major Steps of Christ I say, &#8220;We know that Christ is God incarnated as a man. Christ is the God-man. He is not only a man of God, He is also a God-man. Therefore, the incarnation of Christ simply means the mingling of God with humanity&#8221; (p. 6). Twisting our words and grossly misrepresenting us, certain of our opposers have written, &#8220;This incarnate deity was neither quite God nor quite man; He was a third thing, a mingled God-man.&#8221; We believe that because Christ is true God and true man, He is the God-man. He is the perfect God and a complete man as well. Both His divine nature and His human nature, each being complete, concur in His one Person-without separation, without confusion, and without being changed into a third nature. Our Lord Jesus Christ, the God-man, one Person with two natures, is worthy to receive our worship and praise forever.<p>Because many Christians today will not tolerate healthy teaching, they heap up teachers to tickle their itching ears. The teachings in the Lord&#8217;s recovery are altogether different. Our teachings do not tickle the ear. Instead, they may operate on the ears of those who hear. Unable to bear such an operation, some turn their ears away from the truth.<p>We have pointed out again and again that in 1 and 2 Timothy truth refers to the reality of the contents of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. This reality consists primarily of Christ as the embodiment of God and of the church as the Body of Christ. Instead of listening to proper teachings concerning Christ and the church, many Christians have turned aside to other things.<h2 class=head1>III. TIMOTHY, THE INOCULATOR</h2><p>In verse 5 Paul says to Timothy, &#8220;But you, be sober in all things, suffer evil, do the work of an evangelist, fully accomplish your ministry.&#8221; For Timothy to fully accomplish his ministry was for him to fill up the full measure of his ministry. This ministry denotes the ministry of the Word to minister Christ in all His riches (Eph. 3:8) to both sinners and believers for the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-12). Such a ministry is desperately needed to counter the declining trend, as prophesied in verses 3 and 4.<h2 class=head1>IV. PAUL, THE PATTERN</h2><p>In verses 6 and 7 Paul testifies concerning himself: &#8220;For I am already being poured out, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith.&#8221; In verse 6 Paul indicates that he was already being poured out as a drink offering. The drink offering was additional to the basic offerings revealed in Leviticus 1 through 7 (Num. 15:1-10; 28:7-10). The basic offerings were types of various aspects of Christ. The drink offering was a type of Christ as enjoyed by His offerer, an enjoyment that filled him with Christ as the heavenly wine and even made him wine to God. The Apostle Paul became such a drink offering by so enjoying Christ that he could be poured out by the actual shedding of his blood. To be poured out here means to shed one&#8217;s blood. &#8220;Already being poured out&#8221; indicates that the process of being offered as a drink offering had begun.<p>Paul could say that the time of his departure was at hand. This refers to his departure from the world to be with the Lord (Phil. 1:23) through martyrdom. Paul was imprisoned in Rome twice. The first imprisonment, about A.D. 62-64, was due to the Jews&#8217; accusation (Acts 28:17-20). During that time he wrote the Epistles to Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Philemon. After his release (which he expected in Philippians 1:25; 2:24; and Philemon 22) from the first imprisonment, he must have visited Ephesus and Macedonia (1 Tim. 1:3), where he probably wrote the first Epistle to Timothy. Then he visited Crete (Titus 1:5); Nicopolis (Titus 3:12), where he wrote the Epistle to Titus; Troas; and Miletus (2 Tim. 4:13, 20), where he probably wrote the Epistle to the Hebrews. Due to Caesar Nero&#8217;s sudden persecution, Paul was imprisoned a second time, about A.D. 65. At that time he wrote the second Epistle to Timothy while expecting his imminent martyrdom for his Master.<p>In verse 7 Paul mentions three items: fighting the good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. A proper Christian life is threefold. It involves fighting the good fight against Satan and his kingdom of darkness for the interests of God&#8217;s kingdom (1 Tim. 6:12), running the course for the carrying out of God&#8217;s economy according to His eternal purpose (Heb. 12:1), and keeping the faith for participation in the divine riches in God&#8217;s dispensation (Gal. 3:22). In this Paul set up an adequate pattern for us.<p>Paul began to run the course of the heavenly race after he was taken possession of by the Lord, and he continually ran (1 Cor. 9:24-26; Phil. 3:12-14) that he might finish it (Acts 20:24). Now at the end he triumphantly proclaimed, &#8220;I have finished the course.&#8221; For this he will receive from the Lord a reward-the crown of righteousness (v. 8).<p>Paul could testify that he had kept the faith. This means that he kept God&#8217;s New Testament economy. To keep the faith is to keep the entire New Testament economy of God- the faith concerning Christ as the embodiment of God and the mystery of God and the church as the Body of Christ and the mystery of Christ.<h2 class=head1>V. THE REWARD-THE INCENTIVE</h2><p>Verse 8 says, &#8220;Henceforth, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me in that day; and not only to me, but also to all those who have loved His appearing.&#8221; The crown is a symbol of glory given as a prize, in addition to the Lord&#8217;s salvation, to the triumphant runner of the race (1 Cor. 9:25). This prize is neither of grace nor by faith as salvation is (Eph. 2:5, 8-9), but of righteousness through works (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 2 Cor. 5:10). Such a reward will be awarded the believers not according to the grace of the Lord, but according to His righteousness. Hence, it is the crown of righteousness. The One who awards it is the Lord as the righteous Judge, not as the merciful God or the gracious Redeemer. Paul was assured that such a prize was reserved, laid up, for him and would be awarded to him at the day of the Lord&#8217;s second appearing.<p>Paul says that such an award will be given to all who love the Lord&#8217;s appearing. The Lord&#8217;s appearing, His coming back, is a warning, an encouragement, and an incentive to us. We should love it and look forward to it with earnest expectation and joy. By it, the apostle charged Timothy to fulfill his ministry (vv. 1-2, 5).<p>The crown of righteousness of which Paul was assured is the incentive to the inoculator. If we are faithful to the healthy word of the truth and if we are faithful inoculators to dispense the ingredients of the divine inoculation into Christians today that they may return to the full knowledge of the truth, this reward will be given to us at the time of the Lord&#8217;s appearing. This means that if we are faithful to the Lord&#8217;s ministry, we shall receive the crown of righteousness as our reward.<p>There is a great deal of talk among Christians today concerning the Lord&#8217;s second coming. But not many believers realize that when the Lord Jesus comes back, He will not come as the merciful God or as the gracious Savior, but as the righteous Judge. Christians should be warned and encouraged to prepare themselves to stand before this Judge. I hope that many among us will take up the burden in this dark age to bring such a solemn charge to the Lord&#8217;s people. We all need to receive this charge before God and before the Lord Jesus, the One who will judge the living and the dead. We must declare the fact that when the Lord comes back, He will be the Judge of all, both believers and unbelievers. According to Matthew 25, all of the Lord&#8217;s servants will have to give an account to Him. The Lord will either say, &#8220;Well done, good and faithful slave&#8221; (v. 21), or, &#8220;Evil and slothful slave&#8221; (v. 26). In His righteousness the Lord will decide whether or not we receive a reward.<p>Because the Lord&#8217;s coming and His kingdom are solemn matters, Paul gave a serious charge to Timothy in 4:1-8. We should not think that the Lord&#8217;s appearing will merely be a time of rapture and excitement. It will also be a time of great solemnity for every believer in Christ. This was the reason Paul charged Timothy by the Lord&#8217;s appearing and His kingdom. May we all give heed to this solemn warning.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND TIMOTHY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>THE ISSUE OF THE DECLINE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 4:9-22</h1><p>In this message we shall consider from 4:9-22 the issue of the decline of the church.<h2 class=head1>I. LOVING THE PRESENT AGE</h2><p>In 4:9 Paul says to Timothy, &#8220;Be diligent to come to me quickly.&#8221; This is a loving and intimate word. Paul could write such a word only to one who was very close to him. Timothy was close to Paul and intimate with him.<p>In verse 10 we find the reason Paul charged Timothy to come to him quickly: &#8220;For Demas has forsaken me, having loved the present age, and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.&#8221; Loving the present age, the world now before our eyes, is in contrast to loving  the Lord&#8217;s appearing, mentioned in verse 8. The world, the cosmos, is composed of many ages. It seems that every decade is a different age. The present age is the world which surrounds us, attracts us, and tempts us. Demas was one who loved the present age.<p>Some believe that Demas came from Thessalonica and that this was the reason he went to Thessalonica after forsaking Paul. But whether or not he was a native of that city, it is certain that he went there because he loved the world and forsook the apostle.<p>Verse 10 is difficult to understand because the predicate &#8220;has gone&#8221; governs not only Demas, but also Crescens and Titus. This means that Demas had gone to Thessalonica, Crescens had gone to Galatia, and Titus had gone to Dalmatia. Does this indicate that Titus, like Demas, left Paul in a negative way? If it were not for the fact that the name of Titus is presented positively in the New Testament, I would understand this verse to say that Demas, Crescens, and Titus all left Paul in a negative way. At least, I would take it to mean that Crescens and Titus took their own way. However, I find it difficult to believe that Titus would leave Paul in a negative way, especially after he had received from Paul an epistle addressed to him. After Paul had been arrested and imprisoned the second time, Titus visited him. Although I find it hard to believe that he forsook Paul, it is nonetheless a fact that he is categorized with Demas in verse 10. Did Paul send Crescens to Galatia and Titus to Dalmatia? We do not know for sure if they were sent by Paul or if they went on their own initiative.<p>In verse 11 Paul says, &#8220;Luke alone is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for the ministry.&#8221; The fact that Paul says that Luke alone is with him may indicate that Titus left either in a negative way or in a neutral way. Demas forsook Paul because he loved the present age; Titus may have left him for some other reason. Because Paul was suffering as a prisoner in Rome, none of his co-workers should have left him for any reason unless they were sent by Paul. They should have remained there with Paul to strengthen him. Paul&#8217;s word about bringing Mark also indicates that he needed helpers to strengthen him. Ultimately we must leave to the Lord the question of whether Titus was sent by Paul to Dalmatia or went there on his own.<p>Verse 12 says, &#8220;Now Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.&#8221; It is difficult to decide how to translate the first word in this sentence. We could use now, but, yet, or and. I prefer to use either but or yet. It seems that Paul is saying, &#8220;Although I need helpers and although I need you to come quickly and bring Mark with you, yet I have still sent Tychicus to Ephesus.&#8221; Although we may have difficulty deciding how to render the Greek word at the beginning of this sentence, we can still praise the Lord that there was a church in Ephesus, that Paul could send a brother there, and that there was a brother willing to be sent. Thank the Lord for such a sending!<p>I treasure verses 9 through 12 because they reveal that the relationship among Paul and his co-workers was divinely arranged; it was not based on human organization. Paul&#8217;s co-workers had the freedom to act on their own. Paul did not say, &#8220;Titus, don&#8217;t go to Dalmatia. I need you to stay here with me. If you leave, I shall fire you from the work.&#8221; But although there was no human organization, there was a divine arrangement in which the leading apostle was the authority. Therefore, Paul could charge Timothy to come to him quickly.<p>During the years I was with Brother Nee, many co-workers came to him for advice, wanting him to tell them what to do regarding certain matters. Very rarely, if ever, would Brother Nee say anything. However, along with others who knew the situation, I can testify that whenever I asked Brother Nee about something, he always gave me a direct answer. Sometimes when I was in a distant city, he would send me a cable telling me either to come to him or to go to a certain place.<p>If we compare the books of 2 Timothy and Titus, we shall see that there was greater intimacy between Paul and Timothy than between Paul and Titus. Yes, Paul wrote an epistle to Titus. But he could not say as much to Titus as he could to Timothy. To such an intimate co-worker as Timothy, Paul could issue a command for him to come quickly.<p>Paul and his co-workers were not related to one another in the way of organization. This means that Paul did not regard himself as a boss who could hire or fire co-workers at his discretion. Likewise, because there is no organization in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today, there is no hiring or firing.<p>We have seen that, due to the attraction of the present age, Demas forsook the apostle. In verses 8 and 10 we have a contrast between loving the Lord&#8217;s appearing and loving the present age. If we love the Lord&#8217;s appearing, we shall take sides with Him and fight with Him for His interests. But if we love the present age, we shall take sides with the world. Even though Demas loved the present age and forsook Paul, Paul does not say that he dismissed him from the work. Furthermore, Crescens and Titus may have left Paul without having been sent by him. Perhaps, deep within, Paul wanted Titus to stay with him to help and support him. Whatever the situation may have been, these verses make it clear that Paul did not use his authority according to the way of human organization.<p>Many of those who have been co-workers for more than thirty years can testify that in the Lord&#8217;s recovery we do not have a human organization with a boss who exercises authority to hire or fire co-workers. Instead of organization, we have God&#8217;s coordination with His deputy authority. Because there was also such coordination and authority among Paul and his co-workers, he could tell Timothy to come to him quickly, and he could send Tychicus to Ephesus.<p>According to Philippians 2, Timothy was one with Paul in a very intimate way. He was one soul with him and was even willing to risk his soul for the work of Christ. Because of this oneness, this intimacy, Paul could command Timothy to come to him. He could also send Tychicus to Ephesus. This, however, is not organization. On the contrary, it is according to the spiritual situation among those in God&#8217;s coordination. How much the leading ones in God&#8217;s coordination can say to you depends on the extent to which you are one with the ministry. This is not a matter of organization, but of the degree of oneness.<p>In verse 13 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;The cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, bring when you come, and the scrolls, especially the parchments.&#8221; This word also reveals the intimacy between Paul and Timothy. Troas was a seaport in northwest Asia Minor, where Paul received the Macedonian call (Acts 16:8-11). The scrolls and the parchments were materials used for writing in ancient times. The cloak was probably a traveling cloak or traveling case.<h2 class=head1>II. DOING MANY EVILS</h2><p>Verse 14 says, &#8220;Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to me; the Lord will repay him according to his works.&#8221; Paul did not curse Alexander, but he did utter a word of righteousness, saying that the Lord would repay him according to his works.<p>In verses 10 and 14 we see two aspects of the issue of the decline. On the one hand, certain of those affected by the decline loved the present age; on the other hand, certain ones did evil things against the apostle. In times of degradation these things occur again and again.<p>In 1 Timothy 1:20 Paul speaks of Hymenaeus and Alexander. In 2 Timothy 2:17 he again refers to Hymenaeus, and in 4:14, to Alexander. Were Hymenaeus and Alexander genuine believers, or were they impostors? This raises the question concerning the boundary line between the great house (2 Tim. 2:20) and the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15). Only the Lord is able to draw the line with finality. Only He has the full knowledge concerning who is genuine and who is false.<p>Those who have conducted a scientific study of the difference between the wheat and tares in Matthew 13 point out that in every respect of their appearance, in size, color, and shape, the tares and the wheat are the same until the fruit is brought forth. At that time, the wheat brings forth golden ears and the tares bring forth black ears. Prior to that time, no one can differentiate between the wheat and the tares. This does not mean, however, that we should make no distinction between true believers and false ones. As long as we know that a certain person is not wheat, we should not receive him or accept him as wheat. But if in a particular situation we are not certain, we should receive the person. Such an action is not contrary to our conscience. It is possible that some of those whom we receive may not be genuine believers. It may have been that Hymenaeus was a true believer who became shipwrecked concerning the faith. Some may think that Hymenaeus was not a genuine believer, whereas others may think that he was a genuine believer who later became heretical. Because only the Lord knows for sure, we should not devote too much attention to the case of Hymenaeus.<p>Concerning ourselves as believers, there should not be any gray areas. This means that it should be easy for others to discern whether we are &#8220;black&#8221; or &#8220;white.&#8221; Certainly no one doubts that Timothy was a genuine believer. Timothy was not only white, but was white in a bright, shining way. It should also be clearly evident that we are true believers in the Lord.<p>We have pointed out that it is difficult for us to draw the boundary line between the great house and the house of God. (In the eyes of the world, we are considered part of organized Christianity.) Certain things in the great house may be used by God. However, we should not be used by God in this way. In the great house there are vessels not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and earth. Do you want to be used by God as a wooden or earthen vessel, or as a golden or silver vessel? I want to be used by Him as a golden and silver vessel in the house of God.<p>Do not spend too much time trying to discern whether or not Alexander was a true believer. Instead, concentrate on those matters which are positive, clear, and nourishing. Whether Alexander was genuine or false, a wheat or a tare, will be decided by the Lord. One thing, however is certain: we should not follow his example. We should be a Timothy, not an Alexander.<p>Concerning Alexander the coppersmith, Paul advised Timothy, &#8220;You also guard against him, for he greatly opposed our words&#8221; (v. 15). No doubt, the words opposed by Alexander were the healthy words of God&#8217;s economy. Today we are facing similar opposition from those who oppose the words of God&#8217;s economy.<p>Verse 16 continues, &#8220;At my first defense no one came with me, but all forsook me; may it not be counted against them.&#8221; We do not know whether Demas left Paul before the time of his first defense or after. We know only that all forsook him, that no one came with him.<p>In verse 17 Paul testifies, &#8220;But the Lord stood with me and empowered me, that through me the proclamation might be fully accomplished, and all the nations might hear; and I was delivered out of the lion&#8217;s mouth.&#8221; The expression &#8220;the lion&#8217;s mouth&#8221; is a figure of speech referring to an evil matter (v. 18) or an evil person (1 Cor. 15:32). Perhaps at the time of Paul&#8217;s trial a certain person dealt with him in an extremely cruel manner. Paul may have such a person in mind when he speaks of &#8220;the lion&#8217;s mouth.&#8221;<p>In verse 18 Paul says, &#8220;The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto His heavenly kingdom, to Whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.&#8221; The heavenly kingdom is the kingdom of our Father (Matt. 13:43), the kingdom of the Father (Matt. 26:29), the kingdom of Christ and of God (Eph. 5:5), and the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (2 Pet. 1:11), which will be a reward to the overcoming saints. It equals the crown of righteousness in verse 8, and it is an incentive to the believers to run the heavenly course. Paul had the assurance to make the triumphant declaration that he would be saved into this heavenly kingdom.<h2 class=head1>III. THE CONCLUSION</h2><p>After greeting Prisca and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus (v. 19), Paul says, &#8220;Erastus remained in Corinth, but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.&#8221; Miletus is a city in Asia Minor near Ephesus (Acts 20:15, 17). Why did the apostle leave such an intimate one in sickness without exercising healing prayer for him? Why did he not also execute his healing gift (Acts 19:11-12) to cure Timothy of his stomach illness rather than instruct him to take the natural way for healing (1 Tim. 5:23)? The answer to both questions is that both Paul and his co-workers were under the discipline of the inner life in this time of suffering rather than under the power of the outward gift. The former is of grace in life; the latter of gift in power-miraculous power. In the decline of the church and in suffering for the church, the gift of power is not as much needed as the grace in life.<p>According to the New Testament, miraculous gifts may have a place when the church is first raised up. But for the church to withstand decline or persecution, miraculous gifts or powers are not very helpful. Only the eternal life on which we are to lay hold is prevailing. By this life we can withstand decline and persecution.<p>It may appear to some that in caring for Timothy&#8217;s ailment and Trophimus&#8217; sickness in a human way Paul acted as if he were an unbeliever. There is no record that he prayed for healing, and he certainly did not exercise the gift of healing. Instead, he encouraged Timothy to take a little wine, and he left Trophimus at Miletus. Paul cared for his co-workers in a very human way. He did not do anything spectacular to make a display. In like manner, in the Lord&#8217;s recovery we should not seek to make a show. Our emphasis must be on the eternal life by which we can withstand tests, trials, persecution, attack, and opposition. The firm foundation stands. This standing depends not on miracles, but on the eternal life which is the grace within us.<p>After charging Timothy to be diligent to come before winter and after sending him the greetings of all the brothers with him, Paul concludes, &#8220;The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you&#8221; (v. 22). Here we see that Paul concludes with two of the main elements of his composition of 2 Timothy: a strong spirit and the grace of God. The book of 2 Timothy, which gives instructions concerning how to confront the degradation of the church, strongly stresses our spirit. In the beginning it emphasizes that a strong, loving, and sound spirit has been given to us by which we can fan the gift of God into flame and suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God and the Lord&#8217;s life-imparting grace (1:6-10). In the conclusion this book blesses us with the emphasis on the Lord&#8217;s being with our spirit that we may enjoy Him as grace to stand against the down current of the church&#8217;s decline and carry out God&#8217;s economy through His indwelling Spirit (1:14) and equipping word (3:16-17).<p>In the grievous days during the worsening degradation of the church, what is needed is the eternal grace of God, which was given to us in eternity (1:9) and is appropriated by us in this age. This grace, which is in the indestructible life, is nothing less than Christ the Son of God, who is the embodiment of the divine life, dwelling and living in our spirit. We need to exercise this spirit to enjoy the riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8) as the sufficient grace (2 Cor. 12:9). Thus, we may live Him as our godliness (1 Tim. 4:7-8) for the building up of the church as a testimony of Christ, bearing all the divine realities according to God&#8217;s economy.<p>As the saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we all must know how to contact the Lord in our spirit, realizing that the grace with us is nothing less than the Triune God processed to be the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound, indwelling Spirit. Now our human spirit is one with the Spirit, one with the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. Day by day, we may enjoy such a Spirit in our spirit. As long as we know that the Lord is with our spirit and that the processed Triune God is our grace, and as long as we exercise our spirit to enjoy this grace, we shall have the reality of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. Then in the midst of the degradation of today&#8217;s Christianity, there will be the testimony of the reality of God&#8217;s economy.<p>According to John 1:14, the Word, which is God Himself, became flesh, full of grace and reality. This indicates that as long as we have grace, we shall also have reality. If we exercise our spirit and enjoy this grace, we shall have reality. Then we shall carry out God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF TITUS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE</h1><h1 class=title>ESTABLISHING THE AUTHORITY IN THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Titus 1:1-9</h1><p>It is helpful to know the sequence in which the four books of 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon were written. Philemon was written first, during Paul&#8217;s first Roman imprisonment. After his release from prison, Paul wrote 1 Timothy and the Epistle to Titus. Finally, during his second imprisonment, at the time of Nero&#8217;s persecution, he wrote his last epistle, the Epistle of 2 Timothy.<h2 class=head1>I. THE SUBJECT OF THE BOOK: THE MAINTENANCE OF THE ORDER OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>The subject of the book of Titus is the maintenance of the order of the church. During Paul&#8217;s first imprisonment in Rome, the churches were subject to testing. During this time of testing, certain churches proved not to be so orderly. Thus, after his release from prison, Paul visited various places, including the city of Ephesus and the island of Crete. Realizing the situation of the churches, Paul became burdened to write an epistle to Titus telling him how to maintain the proper order of a local assembly. This was the background and also the reason for the writing of this book. If the order of the church is to be maintained, the authority in the church needs to be established. Therefore, in this message we shall consider from 1:1-9 the establishing of the authority in the church. As we shall see, this has much to do with appointing elders in each city (v. 5).<h2 class=head1>II. INTRODUCTION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Paul, a Slave of God and an Apostle of Jesus Christ</h2><p>Let us first consider 1:1-9 verse by verse and then consider in more detail certain crucial points.<p>Titus 1:1 says, &#8220;Paul, a slave of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God&#8217;s chosen ones, and the full knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness.&#8221; Paul was an apostle according to four things: the command of God (1 Tim. 1:1), the faith of God&#8217;s chosen ones, the promise of life (2 Tim. 1:1), and the full knowledge of the truth. Command is on God&#8217;s side, speaking for Him and requiring something of us for Him. Faith is on our side, responding to God&#8217;s requirements and receiving His grace. It is a proclamation that we are unable to fulfill God&#8217;s requirements, but that God has done everything for us and that we receive what He has done. The life promised by God is what we have received of Him for the carrying out of His demand. It was in this way that Paul was an apostle to administrate God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<p>In 1:1 Paul refers to God&#8217;s chosen ones. This denotes the believers in Christ, who were chosen by God the Father before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4) and selected from mankind for salvation.<p>Paul was an apostle not only according to the faith of God&#8217;s chosen ones, but also according to the full knowledge of the truth. Faith is to receive all God has planned for us, all God has done for us, and all God has given to us. Full knowledge of the truth is a thorough apprehension of the truth, a full acknowledgment and appreciation of the reality of all the spiritual and divine things which we have received through faith. Apostleship is according to such an apprehension and appreciation of the reality of God&#8217;s eternal economy.<p>In 1:1 Paul indicates that the truth is according to godliness. The truth, the reality, of God&#8217;s eternal economy is according to godliness, which is God manifested in man. Apostleship is the dispensing of this reality to God&#8217;s believing elect and the carrying out of such a godliness among them through preaching, teaching, and administration in the Word and in the Spirit (1 Tim. 6:3).<p>In verse 2 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;In the hope of eternal life, which God, Who cannot lie, promised before times eternal.&#8221; Paul was an apostle not only according to the faith and the knowledge of the truth, but also in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised in eternity. This corresponds to &#8220;according to the promise of life&#8221; in 2 Timothy 1:1. In the hope of eternal life means on the basis of, on the condition of, relying upon the hope of, eternal life. Eternal life, the uncreated life of God, is not only for us to partake of and enjoy today, but also for us to inherit (Matt. 19:29) in its full extent for eternity. Today&#8217;s experience of eternal life qualifies us to inherit it in the future. Its enjoyment today is a foretaste; the full taste will be the inheritance of it in the coming age and in eternity, which is the hope of eternal life. This is the blessed hope revealed in 2:13, which is comprised of the freedom of the glory of full sonship, the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:21-25), the salvation to be revealed in the last time (1 Pet. 1:5), and the living hope of the incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading inheritance reserved in heaven (1 Pet. 1:3-4). This is the full, spiritual, divine, and heavenly blessing and enjoyment of eternal life, both in the millennium and in the new heaven and new earth (2 Pet. 1:11; 3:13; Rev. 21:6-7), referred to in 1 Timothy 4:8. Paul assumed his apostleship and accomplished his apostolic ministry, not based upon the benefit of the present life, nor on the condition of the privilege of the law, but based upon the condition of this hope, indicating that for his apostleship he relied upon and trusted in the divine life with all its hope, which God promised in eternity and which was brought to us through the gospel (2 Tim. 1:10).<p>The Epistle to Titus is occupied with the maintenance of order in the churches. For this, the faith of God&#8217;s chosen ones, the truth according to godliness, and eternal life are indispensable. Hence, in the very opening word these three things are set forth.<p>Eternal life is the divine life, the uncreated life of God. It is not only everlasting, lasting forever, with respect to time, but in its nature it is also eternal and divine. The eternal life of God is given to all believers in Christ (1 Tim. 1:16) and is the main element of the divine grace given to us (Rom. 5:17, 21). This life has conquered death (Acts 2:24) and will swallow up death (2 Cor. 5:4). It was according to the promise of such a life that Paul was an apostle (2 Tim. 1:1). This life and its consequent incorruption have been brought to light and made visible to men through the preaching of the gospel.<p>Eternal life was &#8220;promised before times eternal.&#8221; This must be the promise of the Father to the Son in eternity. The Father chose us in the Son and predestinated us unto sonship through Him (Eph. 1:5) before the foundation of the world. It must have been in that eternal epoch that the Father promised the Son that He would give His eternal life to His believers. By receiving this life the believers, who were given to Him in eternity (John 17:2), would become His brothers (Heb. 2:11).<p>In verse 3 Paul continues, &#8220;But in its own times has manifested His word in the proclamation with which I was entrusted, according to the command of our Savior God.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;its own times&#8221; refers to the times (not times eternal) of the eternal life mentioned in verse 2. It denotes the proper time for the eternal life to be manifested.<p>The phrase &#8220;His word&#8221; in verse 3 is equal to eternal life in verse 2. This corresponds to 1 John 1:1 and 2.<h2 class=head2>B. To Titus, a Genuine Child according to the Common Faith</h2><p>In verse 4 Paul says, &#8220;To Titus, genuine child according to the common faith: grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.&#8221; Titus, like Timothy (1 Tim. 1:2), was Paul&#8217;s genuine child not by natural birth, but in faith. He was Paul&#8217;s child spiritually in the sphere and element of faith. The common faith in this verse is the general faith, which is common to all believers, the like precious faith (2 Pet. 1:1).<h2 class=head1>III. TO ESTABLISH THE AUTHORITY IN THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Apostle&#8217;s Charge</h2><p>Titus 1:5 says, &#8220;For this cause I left you in Crete, that you might set in order the things that are lacking, and appoint elders in each city, as I charged you.&#8221; The words &#8220;each city,&#8221; compared with &#8220;in every church&#8221; in Acts 14:23, indicate not only that the jurisdiction of a local church is that of the city in which it is located, but also that in one city there should be only one church. The eldership of a local church should cover the entire city where that church is. Such a unique eldership in a city preserves the unique oneness of the Body of Christ from damage. One city should have only one church with one eldership. This practice is illustrated, beyond any question and doubt, by the clear pattern in the New Testament (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rom. 16:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; Rev. 1:11), and is an absolute prerequisite for the maintenance of proper order in a local church. Because of this, the first thing the apostle charged Titus to do in setting things in order was to appoint elders in each city.<h2 class=head2>B. The Qualifications of the Elders</h2><p>In verses 6 through 9 Paul lists many of the qualifications of the elders: unreprovable, the husband of one wife, having believing children, not accused of dissipation, not unruly, being the overseer as a steward of God, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not an excessive drinker, not a striker, not seeking gain by base means, hospitable, a lover of good, one with a sober mind, righteous, holy, and self-controlled. We have considered many of these qualifications in detail in the message entitled &#8220;Overseers and Deacons for the Church&#8217;s Administration,&#8221; Message 5 in the Life-study of 1 Timothy.<p>In verse 9 Paul says, &#8220;Holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able both to exhort by the healthy teaching and to convict those who contradict.&#8221; The elders are appointed to administrate God&#8217;s government in a local church that good order may be maintained in the church. To accomplish this, the elders need to hold to the faithful word, which is according to the apostles&#8217; teaching, that they may be able to stop troublesome talkers and calm a tumultuous situation (vv. 9-14).<p>The &#8220;faithful word&#8221; is the trustworthy, reliable, and true word which was taught in the churches according to the apostles&#8217; teaching. The elders in a local church should hold to this kind of healthy word that they may fulfill their duty in teaching (1 Tim. 3:2; 5:17).<p>The teaching referred to here is the apostles&#8217; teaching (Acts 2:42), which eventually became the New Testament. This indicates that the churches were established according to the apostles&#8217; teaching and followed their teaching. It also indicates that the order of the churches was maintained by the faithful word, which was given according to the apostles&#8217; teaching. The disorder of the church was mainly due to deviation from the apostles&#8217; teaching. To counter this, we must hold to the faithful word taught in the churches according to the apostles&#8217; teaching. In a darkened and confused situation, we must cleave to the enlightening and ordering word in the New Testament-the apostles&#8217; teaching. To maintain the order of the church, the word according to God&#8217;s revelation is needed in addition to the eldership.<p>We have seen that &#8220;healthy teaching&#8221; implies life. Anything that is healthy refers to the health of life. The teaching of the apostles ministers healthy teaching as the supply of life to people, either nourishing them or healing them.<p>By holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, elders can &#8220;convict those who contradict.&#8221; To convict here is to disclose the true character of anything so as to convict and hence reprove by exposing one&#8217;s fault. The Greek word is translated expose in Ephesians 5:11 and 13.<p>Let us now go back to verses 1 through 3 and consider certain important points in more detail.<p>In verse 1 Paul says that he is an apostle of Jesus Christ &#8220;according to the faith of God&#8217;s chosen ones, and the full knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness.&#8221; Here we see that Paul&#8217;s apostleship was according to the faith of God&#8217;s chosen ones and according to the full knowledge of the truth, and that this truth is according to godliness. Three crucial words here are faith, truth, and godliness. Paul was an apostle not directly according to godliness, but according to the faith and to the full knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness. In verse 2 we see that Paul was an apostle also &#8220;in the hope of eternal life.&#8221; The relative pronoun &#8220;which&#8221; in this verse refers to eternal life. Eternal life implies hope. With temporal life there is no true hope, but with eternal life there is hope. Because eternal life is forever and cannot be terminated, it gives us hope.<p>The hope of eternal life was &#8220;promised before times eternal&#8221; by God, who cannot lie. The expression &#8220;times eternal&#8221; is a special term denoting eternity. In eternity God promised eternal life with its hope. When we go on to verse 3, we see that God not only promised eternal life, but &#8220;in its own times has manifested His word in the proclamation&#8221; with which Paul was entrusted. In these verses we see that God has done two things: promised eternal life and manifested His word.<p>In 1 Timothy 1:1 Paul says that he became &#8220;an apostle of Christ Jesus, according to the command of God our Savior.&#8221; However, in 2 Timothy 1:1 he says that he was an apostle &#8220;according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus.&#8221; Paul was appointed an apostle by God&#8217;s command with His requirement. A command requires something of us, but life supplies something to us. Apart from eternal life, Paul would not have had the supply to fulfill God&#8217;s requirement. In order for Paul to carry out God&#8217;s command with its extremely high requirements, he needed another life. This life is actually the life of God, the One who issues the command. Furthermore, this life is the very commanding and requiring God Himself. First, God makes a requirement, and then He comes in to supply what is needed to fulfill His own requirement. He requires by command, and He supplies by being life. When Paul received God&#8217;s command to carry out His New Testament economy, perhaps he said, &#8220;Lord, who am I to carry out such a command? I am not able to fulfill this requirement.&#8221; To this the Lord may have said, &#8220;Foolish child, I&#8217;ll come into you to supply you. If you submit to My requirement, I&#8217;ll come into you to fulfill it. I will be in you the life which is able to carry out My own requirement.&#8221;<p>At this juncture it is worthwhile to compare 1 Corinthians 15:10 with Galatians 2:20. In the former verse Paul says, &#8220;But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.&#8221; In the latter verse Paul says, &#8220;It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.&#8221; The grace which was with Paul and which enabled him to labor more than others was actually God Himself. God in Paul was eternal life as his supply and support for the carrying out of His New Testament economy. Therefore, the God who commanded is also the God who supplies.<p>In Titus 1:1 Paul again speaks of his apostleship, but he adds something to what is written in 1 Timothy 1:1 and 2 Timothy 1:1. As we have pointed out, in 1:1 and 2 Paul mentions the faith of God&#8217;s chosen ones, the truth which is according to godliness, and the hope of eternal life. Although it is wonderful to see that Paul was an apostle according to the command of God and according to the promise of eternal life, we need to ask, in a thoughtful manner, how this eternal life can come into us. It comes into us through faith, through the organic union between us and the Triune God. Therefore, in 1:1 Paul says that he became an apostle not only according to the command of God and not only according to the life of God, but also according to the faith of God&#8217;s chosen ones, the faith which brought him into an organic union with God. This was the way Paul obtained the life supply and support to fulfill God&#8217;s command.<p>In 1:1 Paul is careful to point out that this faith is the faith of &#8220;God&#8217;s chosen ones.&#8221; We did not choose God; He chose us. Hence, the matter of our believing in Christ depends on God&#8217;s choice, not on ours. God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world. We should praise Him and worship Him for choosing us. Today we are in the Lord&#8217;s recovery because God has chosen us. He was the One who took the initiative. How can you explain the fact that you believe in the Lord Jesus when others, perhaps members of your family, refuse to believe in Him? The only explanation is that God has chosen us. I can testify that I simply must believe in Christ. If I did not believe in Him, I would not have peace. If I did not believe in Christ, I would have no purpose for living. I would not be able to eat or sleep properly. No matter how others may treat me and no matter what my circumstances may be, I have no choice but to believe in the Lord.<p>In Acts 13 Paul and Barnabas turned to the Gentiles after the Jews rejected the gospel. Verse 46 says, &#8220;It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles&#8221; (lit.). Verse 48 says, &#8220;And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.&#8221; The reason these Gentiles could receive the word of the Lord and believe is that they were destined, even predestinated, to believe in Christ. Likewise, we who believe in Christ today are God&#8217;s chosen ones.<p>In Titus 1:1 Paul does not speak of the faith of the believers, but of the faith of God&#8217;s chosen ones. By so doing he indicates that the initiative for believing in Christ comes from God, not from us. Because God has chosen us to believe in Christ, we have come to believe in Him. Paul was an apostle according to the faith of God&#8217;s chosen ones. He had this faith, and we have it also. Through faith Paul was brought into the organic union with the Triune God, and in this way he could receive the supply of eternal life.<p>Paul could stand against the Roman Empire not because he was strong or capable in himself, but because he had received eternal life. He was an apostle according to this eternal life, the eternal life which he received through the faith which brought him into an organic union with the Triune God.<p>We have pointed out that Paul also says that he became an apostle according to the full knowledge of the truth. Again and again we have seen that the truth in 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus denotes the reality of the contents of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. We should have not only the faith of God&#8217;s chosen ones, but also the full knowledge of the truth. We have the faith to bring us into the organic union, and we have the full knowledge of the truth of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. This means that we know Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the Body of Christ.<p>Actually Paul&#8217;s apostleship involved four factors: God&#8217;s command, eternal life, faith, and the full knowledge of the truth. Because of these four elements, Paul was one who troubled religion. He was even called a pestilent fellow, a troublemaker. Of these four elements, two are on God&#8217;s side-the command and the eternal life-and two are on our side-faith and the full knowledge of the truth. When we first believed in the Lord Jesus, we had faith, but we did not have the full knowledge of the truth. Praise the Lord that in His recovery we have the full knowledge of the truth!<p>Titus 1:2 says that eternal life was &#8220;promised before times eternal.&#8221; This indicates that the promise was not given directly to the chosen ones. Rather, the promise was made by the Father to the Son in eternity. John 17:2 seems to refer to this: &#8220;Even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him.&#8221; By receiving eternal life the believers, who were given to the Son in eternity, become His brothers. Hebrews 2:11 refers to the brothers of Christ: &#8220;For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers.&#8221; Because the promise of eternal life was made by the Father to the Lord Jesus in eternity, the Bible says that God chose us in Christ. God did not choose us directly; He chose us in Christ. In like manner, the promise of eternal life concerning us was given to Christ. Thus, in the Son we now receive this promise.<p>According to verse 3, God not only promised eternal life before times eternal, but &#8220;in its own times has manifested His word in the proclamation.&#8221; The eternal life was promised by the Father to the Son; however, what God the Father has manifested is not eternal life, but His word. By reading verses 2 and 3 carefully, we see that the word manifested is the equivalent of the eternal life promised. Paul does not say that God promised eternal life and then manifested this eternal life. He says that God promised eternal life and then manifested His word. Therefore, God&#8217;s word is eternal life. If His word is not the eternal life directly, it is at least the means of conveying eternal life. In our experience we have eternal life through the word.<p>The expression &#8220;its own times&#8221; refers to the times related to eternal life mentioned in verse 2. God promised eternal life through the Son concerning us in eternity, but the proclamation was made in different ages and at different times. God manifested His eternal life in His word by preaching, that is, by proclamation. This proclamation was made in Asia Minor at one time and in Europe at a different time.<p>Paul here does not say that eternal life was manifested by the preaching of the gospel. Instead, he speaks of times, the word, and the proclamation. The eternal life promised was manifested at different times by proclamation, by the preaching of the gospel. This manifestation first took place on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem. Later the proclamation went to Antioch, Asia Minor, and Europe. Centuries later this proclamation reached China. Therefore, &#8220;its own times&#8221; denotes the various times God&#8217;s word is manifested in the preaching of the gospel. Paul was entrusted with this proclamation according to the command of our Savior God.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF TITUS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO</h1><h1 class=title>DEALING WITH THE INFLUENCE OF JUDAISM AND GNOSTICISM</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Titus 1:10-16</h1><p>According to 1:10-16, at the time Titus was in Crete two isms were quite prevailing: Judaism and Gnosticism. In this message we shall consider from these verses how Titus was instructed to deal with the influence of Judaism and Gnosticism.<h2 class=head1>THE INFLUENCE OF JUDAISM</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Unruly Men, Vain Talkers and Deceivers</h2><p>In verses 10 and 11, Paul says, &#8220;For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, whose mouths must be stopped, who overthrow whole households, teaching things which they ought not for the sake of base gain.&#8221; Both Paul&#8217;s word about &#8220;those of the circumcision&#8221; in verse 10 and his reference to &#8220;Jewish myths&#8221; in verse 14 point to the influence of Judaism. Those of the circumcision were Jewish believers who were seducers within the church. Paul says that such ones must be stopped. The way to stop them is by severe reproof (v. 13) with the faithful word according to the apostles&#8217; teaching (v. 9). These vain talkers and deceivers overthrow whole households, &#8220;teaching things which they ought not for the sake of base gain.&#8221; What they did was similar to what was done by the reprobate prophet, Balaam (2 Pet. 2:15-16; Jude 11).<p>I would call your attention to the little word &#8220;for,&#8221; at the beginning of verse 10, indicating that this verse is related to the foregoing verse. In verse 9 Paul says that an overseer must hold to &#8220;the faithful word which is according to the teaching that he may be able both to exhort by the healthy teaching and to convict those who contradict.&#8221; Then Paul goes on to explain that there are many unruly men, especially of the circumcision, whose mouths must be stopped. These verses indicate that Paul&#8217;s charge to Titus concerning the establishment of the eldership is related to the disturbances caused by the influence of Judaism. There was the urgent need for the eldership to be set in order so that those who taught differently could be dealt with. Certain Jewish believers brought their Judaism into the church life and this, with its different teachings, caused a disturbance. Here we have a basic principle related to the eldership: every elder must be a watchman who is on the alert lest some teaching different from that of the apostles&#8217; ministry is brought into the church.<h2 class=head2>B. The True Testimony of a Cretan Prophet</h2><p>In verses 12 and 13 Paul declares, &#8220;One of them, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons. This testimony is true.&#8221; One of them refers to one of the Cretans. All those mentioned in verses 9b and 10 were such Cretans. The prophet of their own was a heathen prophet, probably Epimenides, a native of Crete who lived about 600 B.C., according to legend.<h2 class=head2>C. The Apostle&#8217;s Charge</h2><p>In verse 13 Paul charges Titus to &#8220;reprove them severely, that they may be healthy in the faith.&#8221; The Greek word rendered reprove here is the same word translated convict in verse 9. It means to disclose the true character of anything so as to convict and hence reprove by exposing one&#8217;s fault. The Greek word rendered severely may also be rendered sharply. The purpose of such severe reproof was that those receiving it might be healthy in the faith. The gainsayers (v. 9) and vain talkers (v. 10) were infected with doctrinal diseases and became unhealthy in the faith. They needed the inoculation of the healthy teaching and the healthy word (1 Tim. 1:10; 6:3), which the elders should provide for their healing.<p>As in 1 Timothy 1:19 and 3:9, the faith here is objective. It refers to the things in which we believe. This is to be distinguished from the subjective meaning of faith, which refers to the act of believing.<h2 class=head1>II. THE INFLUENCE OF GNOSTICISM</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Jewish Myths- the Seed of Gnostic Mythologies</h2><p>Verse 14 says, &#8220;Not paying attention to Jewish myths.&#8221; The Greek word for myths is rendered myths here and in 1 Timothy 1:4, tales in 1 Timothy 4:7, and fables in 2 Timothy 4:4. It refers to words, speeches, and conversations concerning such things as rumors, reports, stories, and fictions. It may include Jewish stories of miracles or rabbinical fabrications. These myths were the profane and old-womanish tales. The Jewish myths mentioned here may have been the seed of the Gnostic mythologies.<h2 class=head2>B. Commandments of Men Who Turn Away from the Truth</h2><p>In verse 14 Paul also mentions &#8220;commandments of men who turn away from the truth.&#8221; According to the following verse, these commandments of the heretics must have been precepts concerning abstinence from meats and other things ordained by God for man&#8217;s use (see 1 Tim. 4:3; Col. 2:20-22). These were the commandments of the earlier Gnostics, not the ascetics, who adopted their theosophy from Jewish sources, probably some derivation from the Mosaic law.<p>The men Paul refers to in this verse are probably those of the circumcision (v. 10). These men turn away from the truth. The truth here and the faith in the preceding verse prove that those who were dealt with here were not unbelievers. There were some in the church who had turned away from the truth concerning God&#8217;s economy. Most of them might have been Jewish Christians who still held their Jewish myths and traditions and thereby became a great disturbance to the church. They had to be stopped by the word of the truth according to the faith so that the order of the church might be maintained under the established eldership.<p>In verse 15 Paul continues, &#8220;All things are pure to the pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience have been defiled.&#8221; The statement, &#8220;All things are pure to the pure,&#8221; must have been a Christian maxim. The apostle quoted it to refute the commandments of men (v. 14), that is, the precepts of abstinence, which forbade certain actions and the eating of certain foods (1 Tim. 4:3-5; Rom. 14:20).<p>Paul says that to those who are defiled, or polluted, and unbelieving nothing is pure, but both their mind and conscience are defiled. The mind is the leading part of the soul, and the conscience is the main part of our spirit. If our mind is polluted, our soul is spontaneously polluted; and if our conscience is defiled, our spirit is unavoidably defiled. This is all due to unbelief. Our faith purifies us (Acts 15:9).<p>In verse 16 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;They profess to know God, but by their works they deny Him, being abominable and disobedient, and as to every good work disapproved.&#8221; The Greek word rendered disapproved can also be translated reprobate, worthless, disqualified. It means unable to stand the test.<h2 class=head2>C. The Apostle&#8217;s Charge</h2><p>Paul&#8217;s charge to Titus is simply not to pay attention to Jewish myths and commandments of men (v. 14).<p>Just as the elders in the churches in Crete were to watch out for the influence of Judaism and Gnosticism and not permit different teachings to creep into the church life, we also need to watch out for isms today, such as Catholicism and denominationalism. We should also be watchful concerning the hypocrisy and the superficial and superstitious tales circulated among many Christians. If these things are brought into the Lord&#8217;s recovery, they will cause trouble. The pure church life is built only upon the healthy teaching of the apostles. This is the reason Paul says that elders must hold to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, so that they may be able to exhort by healthy teaching. The teaching in verse 9 refers to that of the apostles (Acts 2:42), which eventually became the New Testament. The apostles&#8217; teaching was the healthy teaching. The churches were established according to the apostles&#8217; teaching and followed their teaching. Furthermore, the order of the church was maintained by the faithful word given according to this teaching. At the beginning of the church life, when the believers spoke about the teaching, everyone realized that this meant the teaching of the apostles. In Jerusalem those who received the Lord Jesus and were added to the church continued in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles.<p>In 1:9 Paul does not say &#8220;sound teaching&#8221; or even &#8220;pure teaching&#8221;; he speaks of &#8220;healthy teaching.&#8221; Certain teachings may be sound or pure without being healthy. Healthy teaching is always related to life and is able either to nourish us or to heal us. Only something living can be healthy. For example, we do not speak of a table or chair as being healthy. The teachings of the apostles were not only sound and pure, but were healthy, full of life.<p>The crucial point of the healthy teaching of the apostolic ministry concerns the Triune God processed to dispense Himself as the all-inclusive Spirit into His chosen ones so that they may be brought into an organic union to receive the divine transfusion and thereby become sons of God and members of Christ. As a result, they can be the Body to express Christ, the One in whom the fullness of God dwells. Almost all of this is neglected by Christians today. Even those teachings which are truly sound are for the most part superficial.<p>Some believers are told nothing more than that if they receive the Lord, they will be saved by grace. They do not even receive an adequate explanation concerning what it is this grace saves them from. According to Ephesians 2:8, a verse often quoted in pointing out that salvation is by grace, to be saved does not mean to be saved from hell. According to the context, to be saved is to be saved from death, or from a deadening situation, that we may be raised up and seated in the heavens in a living way. Furthermore, contrary to the common, superficial understanding, grace in Ephesians 2:8 is not simply unmerited favor. It is the Triune God as everything to us for our enjoyment. Christians who emphasize the preaching of the gospel often quote Ephesians 2:8. However, because they understand this verse very superficially, rarely does anyone touch the reality of it.<p>In the foregoing message we pointed out that Paul was an apostle according to the command of God, the promise of eternal life, the faith of God&#8217;s chosen ones, and the full knowledge of the truth. Can the majority of Christian teachers honestly say that they have the full knowledge of the truth? Certainly not. They may be familiar with particular doctrines and consider this doctrinal knowledge the full knowledge of the truth. Some may know all about the seven dispensations and yet not possess the full knowledge of the truth. The Lord Jesus once declared, &#8220;I am the truth&#8221; (John 14:6). If, as is the practice of many Christians, we interpret truth to mean doctrine, then the Lord Jesus would have been saying, &#8220;I am the doctrine.&#8221; How ridiculous! Many Christians, even Bible teachers, do not know the meaning of truth in the New Testament. Eventually, superficiality can lead to hypocrisy, and hypocrisy, to superstition.<p>There is a doctrine commonly held among Christians that as long as a person believes in the Lord Jesus, he is saved and he will have no problems at the time of the Lord&#8217;s coming. According to this view, when the believers are raptured, they will not have any problems with the Lord, and all will reign with Him in the kingdom. There is even a bumper sticker which makes light of the rapture by saying: &#8220;Warning-in case of rapture, this car will be unmanned.&#8221; Many Christians mistakenly believe that simply because they are saved they have a &#8220;ticket&#8221; which will admit them into the kingdom of the heavens. But as D. M. Panton has pointed out, many will be surprised to realize that this ticket is false and will not admit them into the heavenly kingdom. A great many of today&#8217;s Christians may have the shocking realization that the ticket which some minister told them would guarantee an entrance into the kingdom will not be accepted at the time of the Lord&#8217;s coming. Because such superficial and even superstitious teachings are prevalent today, we need to fight against them, just as Paul fought against the hypocrisies of Judaism and Gnosticism.<p>Another teaching we must oppose is the saying that as long as two or three meet in the name of the Lord, they are the church. According to this erroneous teaching, there can be many different churches in a locality. What falsehood! Two or three believers may meet in the name of the Lord, but that does not necessarily mean that they are the church in that locality.<p>Although we need to fight against superficial and superstitious teachings, this definitely does not mean that we deliberately cause trouble to our family, relatives, friends, or neighbors. Yes, we must fight for the truth of God. We must be the light of the world and the salt of the earth. However, it is absolutely necessary that we maintain the best relationship with others. The young people must honor their parents, and we all need to have a proper relationship with our family, relatives, and neighbors. We in the Lord&#8217;s recovery should be the best neighbors and the most peaceable of people. It is an evil rumor and slander to say that we are not human. We aspire to be the most human of people, those who are Jesusly human, divinely human. In all our contact with others, we need to display the highest humanity and the best conduct and behavior. We are not fighting against persons-we are fighting against isms.<p>Our burden is not simply to oppose superficiality, hypocrisy, and superstition. It is to minister Christ and the church for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s economy. God our Father certainly has an eternal purpose to fulfill. But Satan has come in with many distractions and falsehoods. Our burden must be to minister the all-inclusive Christ and the church as the Body of Christ to those who love God and seek Christ. We need to help all those who pursue the Lord to come to the full knowledge of the truth. We need to sound the trumpet that those who seek the Lord Jesus may come together as a living Body of Christ to fulfill God&#8217;s purpose and to hasten the coming of the Lord. Concerning this, we all must be desperate and give ourselves to prayer. On the one hand, we like to maintain a peaceful situation with others. On the other hand, for the sake of God&#8217;s purpose, we must stand firm for the full knowledge of God&#8217;s truth and fight the good fight against the evil powers of darkness.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF TITUS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE THREE</h1><h1 class=title>BRINGING THE SAINTS OF DIFFERENT AGES INTO AN ORDERLY LIFE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Titus 2:1-8</h1><p>In 2:1-8 the word healthy is used three times. In verse 1 Paul says, &#8220;But as for you, speak the things which are fitting to healthy teaching.&#8221; In verse 2 Paul speaks of being healthy in faith, love, and endurance. In verse 8 Paul refers to &#8220;healthy speech that cannot be condemned.&#8221; Titus was to speak the things which are fitting to healthy teaching and show himself a pattern of healthy words, and the elderly men were to be healthy in faith, love, and endurance. It is significant that in these verses, a portion of Titus in which the saints are charged to live an orderly life in the church, Paul uses the word healthy three times. If we study the verses where this word is used, and especially if we pray-read them, we shall be richly nourished. I would encourage you to pray over Paul&#8217;s word concerning healthy teaching, being healthy in faith, love, and endurance, and healthy speech. If you do this, you will enjoy an excellent spiritual meal.<h2 class=head1>I. TO SPEAK THE THINGS WHICH ARE FITTING TO HEALTHY TEACHING</h2><p>Titus 2:1 says, &#8220;But as for you, speak the things which are fitting to healthy teaching.&#8221; This verse opens with the word &#8220;but&#8221; to show that it is in contrast to 1:16. In contrast to those who profess to know God, but by their works deny Him, Titus was to speak the things which are fitting to healthy teaching.<p>The healthy teaching is always according to the truth (1:14) of the faith (1:13). It is the content of the apostles&#8217; teaching, the content of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. It not only ministers the life supply to the believers and heals the spiritual diseases, but in so doing also brings the church into a sound condition with a good order. Hence, it is very much stressed in these three books, 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, books dealing with the disorder and decline of the church. In 2:1 Paul charged Titus not to deviate from the healthy teaching, from the apostles&#8217; teaching. He should not be like the gainsayers, the vain talkers, those who teach differently and make the church subject to the influence of Judaism and Gnosticism.<p>We also should be reminded to speak the things which are fitting to healthy teaching. The word healthy points to that which is hygienic and which can both inoculate others against spiritual poison and also supply them with life. Our teachings should not merely pass on knowledge to others, but should supply them with life. Often when I have been tempted to speak about a certain subject, I was stopped. I had the sense that there was not much of the hygienic element in what I planned to say. We need to remind ourselves and be reminded by the Spirit to give forth healthy teaching.<p>Healthy teachings do not provoke debates or arguments. If we give adequate attention to feeding on the Lord, we shall not care to argue. A dining table is not a place for debate or argument; it is a place for feasting and nourishment. In the church life we should not exchange the dining table for a desk. We all need to learn how to put healthy &#8220;dishes&#8221; on the dining table to feed the saints.<h2 class=head1>II. CONCERNING THE AGED MEN</h2><p>In the foregoing message we pointed out that in fighting the battle for the truth, we need to maintain excellent relationships with others. Our behavior needs to be according to the highest standard and also very human. In every area of our daily life and family life we must be proper.<p>In the three Epistles of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus Paul emphasizes the importance of a proper humanity. In 2:2 Paul speaks to the aged men and says, &#8220;Aged men are to be temperate, grave, of a sober mind, healthy in faith, in love, in endurance.&#8221;<h2 class=head2>A. Temperate</h2><p>According to this verse, the aged men are to be temperate. To be temperate is to have self-control and to be moderate. It is often easier for an elderly person to be offended or angered than it is for a young person to be bothered in this way. As an elderly person myself, I can testify that in a family it is usually the older ones who become irritated or impatient. Today I can be bothered by certain irritations or nuisances that did not affect me in the least fifty years ago. This indicates that, as an elderly man, I need Paul&#8217;s charge to be temperate. Of course, temperateness is a virtue needed by everyone in the church life.<h2 class=head2>B. Grave</h2><p>Elderly men should also be grave. Gravity is a qualification of human character which is worthy of utmost respect. It implies dignity and it inspires honor and invites it. Gravity is a virtue which invites the respect of others.<h2 class=head2>C. Of a Sober Mind</h2><p>In verse 2 Paul charges the aged men to be of a sober mind. He says the same concerning young women (v. 5) and younger men (v. 6). In 1 Timothy 3:2 Paul lists this among the qualifications of an overseer. To be of a sober mind is to be sensible and also discreet in understanding. No matter what our age may be, we all need a sober mind. If we are of a sober mind, we shall avoid the extremes of being too hot or too cold. On the one hand, we need to be burning in spirit; on the other hand, we need to be of a sober mind. If we would be a proper human being, we need this quality.<h2 class=head2>D. Healthy</h2><h2 class=head3>1. In Faith</h2><p>If we would be healthy in faith, we need daily to be under the transfusion which comes through the organic union between us and the Triune God. The word faith in verse 2 does not refer to the objective faith, to the things we believe, but to our activity of believing. In our daily living we need a faith which keeps us in the organic union. In order to be healthy in faith, we need to come to the Word and contact the Lord by praying in a living way with our spirit. Then we shall have faith, the infusion of the living God into us through our contact with the Word in the spirit. Faith, therefore, is a living Person infused into us. The more we remain in the organic union with this divine Person, the more healthy we shall be in faith.<h2 class=head3>2. In Love</h2><p>If we are healthy in faith, we shall automatically be healthy in love. It is possible to love others too much or too little. In either case, our love is not healthy. Instead, we are somewhat sick in our love.<p>Why do you love a certain brother very much and another brother hardly at all? It is because you love others according to your own taste. In Philippians 2:2 Paul says that we should have the same love. This means that our love for all the saints should be on the same level. To have a different love for different saints is to be unhealthy in love. But to have the same love for all is to be healthy in love.<h2 class=head3>3. In Endurance</h2><p>According to Titus 2:2, aged men should also be healthy in endurance. If we have adequate endurance, we shall be able to bear the things which bother us and trouble us. We have pointed out that it is rather easy for an elderly person to be bothered. As one who has many children and grandchildren and who is involved with so many churches and co-workers, I can testify of the need for endurance. For example, I need endurance simply to care for all the mail I receive day by day. I receive so much mail that I have developed a filing system to categorize and arrange it. Even this takes endurance. If I were short of endurance, I would not know what to do with all this mail.<p>Especially those of us who are elderly need endurance. The older we become, the greater is our need of endurance. In particular, the elders in a church need endurance. For example, sometimes telephone calls come late at night. To take care of such a call in a proper way requires endurance.<p>Once again I wish to emphasize the fact that in the church life we aspire to live a proper human life, with all the human virtues. We do not want to be angelic. Our desire is to be genuinely human.<h2 class=head1>III. CONCERNING THE AGED WOMEN</h2><p>In verses 3 and 4 Paul speaks concerning aged women: &#8220;Aged women likewise are to be in demeanor as befits the sacred, not slanderers, nor enslaved by much wine, teachers of what is good, that they may train the young women to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children.&#8221; Paul&#8217;s use of the word &#8220;likewise&#8221; indicates that the behavior of the aged women should be similar to that of the aged men. In demeanor they should be as befits the sacred. Demeanor means deportment and includes gesture and habit. The word sacred refers to those who are engaged in sacred things. This may be a special term referring to our service in the church. Any service in the church is sacred, and our demeanor should match this sacred service. Demeanor includes everything we are in our attitude, appearance, and deportment. All this should befit that part of the church service in which we participate. Especially the elderly sisters should have a demeanor which befits the sacred things, the things related to the service of the church.<p>Paul also says that aged women should not be slanderers. The Devil is a slanderer (Rev. 12:10). To slander is to practice the nature of the evil slanderer. An elderly sister should flee slander, the evil act of the Devil.<p>In verse 3 Paul also mentions not &#8220;enslaved by much wine.&#8221; This word enslaved can be compared to the word addicted used in 1 Timothy 3:8. To be enslaved may be worse than to be addicted. The aged women certainly should not be slaves of wine.<p>Paul also says that the aged women should be &#8220;teachers of what is good&#8221; and train the young women. To be teachers of what is good is to give good instruction.<h2 class=head1>IV. CONCERNING THE YOUNG WOMEN</h2><p>In verses 4 and 5 we see that the young women are to be &#8220;lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children, of a sober mind, chaste, workers at home, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed.&#8221; The aged women should train the young women to love their husbands and their children. In the church life we strongly emphasize the need of a proper married life and family life. According to Paul&#8217;s word, we desire that the sisters love their husbands and children in an absolute way. Furthermore the young women should be sober, chaste, workers at home, kind, and subject to their own husbands so that the word of God may not be blasphemed. The word of God properly and adequately taught in a local church should be testified to by the sisters&#8217; submission to their own husbands. Otherwise, the word of God may be blasphemed, ill spoken of, reproached.<h2 class=head1>V. CONCERNING THE YOUNGER MEN</h2><p>Verse 6 says, &#8220;The younger men likewise exhort to be of a sober mind.&#8221; Paul&#8217;s use of the word likewise indicates that the charge to the younger men is similar to that given to the others. In particular, Paul tells Titus to exhort the younger men to be of a sober mind. We have pointed out that in 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus Paul emphasizes the need for all the saints, young and old, male and female, to be of a sober mind. Everyone in the church life needs a sober mind. This is especially needed during the decline of the church. To guard against any decline, all of us in the local churches need to be of a sober mind.<h2 class=head1>VI. THE APOSTLE&#8217;S CHARGE</h2><p>In verses 7 and 8 Paul issues a charge directly to Titus: &#8220;Concerning all things show yourself a pattern of good works: in teaching with uncorruptness, gravity, healthy speech that cannot be condemned, in order that the opposer may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us.&#8221; The apostle first charged Titus to speak things fitting to healthy teaching (v. 1). Now he further charges him to show himself a pattern of good works. In his teaching, which should be healthy, he should show three things: uncorruptness, nothing corrupted or corrupting, but everything pure, genuine, and sincere in content, presentation, and motive; gravity, dignity worthy of respect; and healthy speech, discourse given with healthy words (1 Tim. 6:3) to minister healthy things, speech which is uncensurable, irreprehensible (v. 8). Such speech will cause the opposers to be put to shame. The Greek word rendered opposer in verse 8 means the one of the opposite, contrary, side; that is, the heathen or Jewish opposer. The healthy teaching with the healthy speech of healthy words is the most effective antidote to the opposer&#8217;s evil speaking. Such light-shedding and life-imparting teaching of the word of the truth always stops the mouth of doctrinal opinion instigated by the old serpent.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF TITUS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>CHARGING SLAVES TO BEHAVE WELL IN THE SOCIAL SYSTEM OF SLAVERY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Titus 2:9-15</h1><p>In the book of Titus Paul gives instructions concerning the church life, the family life, the behavior of slaves in the social system of slavery, and the saints&#8217; relationship with the government. Chapter one mainly deals with the church life. Regarding the church life, Paul covers two main points in this chapter: the government of the church and the proper teaching in the church. The church&#8217;s government is built upon the proper eldership, and the teaching in the church is based on the healthy teaching of the apostles. This healthy teaching swallows up every kind of ism, in particular Judaism and Gnosticism, and every type of differing teaching. If we would have a church life which is healthy and in good order, there must be in the church the proper administration and healthy teaching according to the ministry of the apostles.<p>In 2:1-8 Paul speaks concerning an orderly human life. In particular, he speaks of the family life. These eight verses give us the foundation of a proper human life in the divine life. We in the Lord&#8217;s recovery should live such a human life. For the testimony of Jesus we need the highest human life, a life lived out according to the divine life given to us by God. By the divine life we need to have a human life that reaches the highest standard. In our living we should be Jesusly human. We should aspire to have a glorious testimony of the Christ in whom we believe and whom we serve and honor. Then we shall be a shining, golden lampstand. This is our declaration concerning human living.<p>After speaking of the church and of the family life, Paul goes on to charge the slaves to behave well in the social system of slavery (2:9-15). Certainly Paul did not agree with the system of slavery. However, as a teacher appointed by God and as one with spiritual insight, he did not touch the existing social system. If he had done so, he would have given others the impression that he was a social reformer and not a teacher of God&#8217;s economy, a herald of the good news. Paul did not involve himself with reformation of the social system. On the contrary, he gave instructions to slaves concerning the need to behave according to the highest standard of human character. The slaves were to have an excellent testimony of the life of Jesus in their human living.<p>If Paul had advocated the annulment of the system of slavery, he would have been regarded as a social reformer by those who read his Epistles. That would have obscured Paul&#8217;s teaching concerning the living out of Christ&#8217;s divine life in our human living in the midst of any kind of social system. In order to guarantee that the light would shine without hindrance, Paul did not say a word about the social system in the way of correcting it or reforming it.<p>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He did not touch the social system. Instead, He lived as a typical Jew in a country under the control of the Roman imperialists. The Lord Jesus was born during the time of Caesar Augustus. At the time of His trial, judgment was pronounced upon Him by Pontius Pilate, governor of Judea. The Lord Jesus said to Pilate, &#8220;My kingdom is not of this world&#8221; (John 18:36). The Lord&#8217;s kingdom was not earthly; it was heavenly in nature. For this reason, when He was on earth, the Lord Jesus did not deal with the social system or with any earthly government. Paul displayed the same attitude. He did not try to reform the Roman social system.<p>When the Epistle of Titus was written, a number of slaves had become believers in Christ. According to civil law. a slave had no rights. A master could brand a slave as if he were a horse or a mule. Furthermore, a master could legally put a slave to death. What a dreadful system! To be sure, God was utterly opposed to such a social system, for it was altogether contrary to the place of man in His creation. Paul certainly did not approve of this evil social system. But instead of trying to reform it, he charged the slaves to behave well in it, to live in it according to the standard of the humanity of the Lord Jesus. Even in the midst of such an unjust social system, Christians could live out a life with the highest standard of humanity. What a testimony this is!<p>No matter how bad certain social systems may be today, none are as bad as the system of slavery in the Roman Empire. For the saints to live a Jesusly human life in that kind of social system was a marvelous testimony of the divine life. It was God&#8217;s wisdom that a slave, bought and branded like an animal, could testify of the divine life according to the highest standard.<p>Some have criticized Paul for not trying to reform the social system. We realize, however, that Paul used the worst social system as an opportunity to charge the believers to live a Jesusly human life in the midst of it. If the saints could live such a human life in the worst social system imaginable, then we should be able to live such a life in any kind of circumstances today. Praise the Lord that by the divine life we can have the highest human living even in the worst social system!<h2 class=head1>I. THE CHARGE TO THE SLAVES</h2><p>In verses 9 and 10 Paul says, &#8220;Slaves are to be subject to their own masters in all things, to be well pleasing, not contradicting, not pilfering, but showing all good faith that they may adorn the teachings of our Savior God in all things.&#8221; The slaves here are not servants, but bondslaves bought in the market like oxen and horses. Paul charges them to be subject to their own masters in all things. They had no choice, and there was to be no argument. Moreover, the slaves were not to pilfer. On the contrary, they were to show all good faith. Faith here means fidelity, trustworthiness. In this way they would adorn the teachings of our Savior God. The faithfulness of a bondslave can be the ornament of the teaching of God our Savior. He would even accept adornment from bondslaves!<p>In 2:5 Paul charges the young women to live in such a way that &#8220;the word of God may not be blasphemed.&#8221; In 2:10 he speaks positively of adorning the teaching of our Savior God. Our daily living should be a beautiful adornment to the teaching we have received. If we live according to the healthy teaching of the apostles, we shall adorn these teachings by our living. If we have a bright testimony of a living which is Jesusly human, our neighbors will realize that we are genuine Christians. They will confess that our living is the adornment of the teachings we have received in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. We should live not only in a way that is different from that of others, but in a way that is higher and more respectable. Others may even desire to follow us, because they have observed the high standard of our daily life. They may seek to learn how they can have such a life themselves.<p>In 2:10 Paul speaks of &#8220;our Savior God.&#8221; Our Savior is not only Christ, but God Triune embodied in Christ, as indicated in verse 13. Our Savior God desires not only to save us, but also to teach us the full knowledge of the truth (1 Tim. 2:4). Hence, there is the teaching of our Savior God, which may be adorned, beautified, by the transformed character of the most vile persons saved by His grace.<h2 class=head1>II. THE GRACE OF GOD</h2><p>Verse 11 begins with the little word for, indicating that what is to follow explains how it is possible for slaves to have a human living according to God&#8217;s standard. Verses 11 through 14 give us a remarkable summary of the economy of God&#8217;s salvation. The apostle uses this as a reason for his exhortations in verses 1 through 10.<p>Verse 11 says, &#8220;For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men.&#8221; The grace of God is actually God Himself in Christ as everything to us for our enjoyment. This grace plays the most important role in the economy of God&#8217;s salvation. Grace came through Christ (John 1:17). It was given to us in eternity (2 Tim. 1:9), but was hidden in the Old Testament. It appeared in the New Testament through the first appearing of Christ (2 Tim. 1:10), bringing salvation to all men, both Jews and Gentiles.<p>The eternal grace of God, the saving grace, was destined in Christ to bring to us His salvation, the complete salvation which includes forgiveness, justification, reconciliation, redemption, regeneration, sanctification, transformation, and conformation. The eternal grace of God was also destined to redeem us back to God, to impart His life to us, and to bring us into an organic union with Him for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.<p>In verse 12 Paul says that the grace of God is training us that, &#8220;denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in the present age.&#8221; Worldly lusts are lusts that find their gratification in this world. Ungodliness is the failure to express God; worldly lusts are the expression of our flesh. Both of these should be denied that we may live a God-expressing and flesh-restricting life. To live soberly is to live discreetly, in a way of self-restriction. Soberly is in regard to ourselves; righteously, to others; and godly, to God.<p>By the grace of God we are being trained to live soberly, righteously, and godly. This requires that we deny ungodliness and worldly lusts. Ungodliness is a living which does not express God. We should not have anything to do with the life that fails to express God. Furthermore, we should abandon whatever attracts us to earthly things or draws us to them. Forsaking ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live a life which is sober toward ourselves, righteous toward others, and godly toward God.<p>In verse 13 Paul continues, &#8220;Awaiting the blessed hope, even the appearing of the glory of the great God and our Savior, Christ Jesus.&#8221; We are to await expectantly what is accepted in faith. According to verse 13, we are awaiting the blessed hope, which is the appearing of Christ in His glory. The appearing of Christ will bring us into full sonship, that is, the redemption of our body, that we may enjoy the freedom of the glory of the children of God for which we have been saved (Rom. 8:21-25). This is the hope of eternal life (Titus 1:2), a hope of eternal blessing, a blessed hope in the eternal life of the Triune God, based upon which Paul became an apostle.<p>In verse 13 Paul speaks of the glory of the great God; that is the glory of the Father (Matt. 16:27) which has been given to the Son (John 17:24) and into which we, as the many sons of God, will be brought (Heb. 2:10). Unto this glory God by His wisdom has ordained us before the ages (1 Cor. 2:7), and into this eternal glory the God of all grace has called us and saved us (1 Pet. 5:10; 2 Tim. 2:10). The weight of this glory is eternal (2 Cor. 4:17), and with it we shall be glorified (Rom. 8:17, 30). The appearing of this glory of Christ, our great God and Savior, is the blessed hope which we are awaiting.<p>In verse 13 Paul speaks of &#8220;the great God and our Savior, Christ Jesus.&#8221; Through the centuries there have been two schools of interpretation regarding this remarkable, marvelous, and excellent sacred and divine title. According to one school, two Persons are indicated, God and Christ. According to the other school, there is but one Person, Christ Jesus being the great God and our Savior, thus asserting the deity of Christ. We prefer the second, with a comma after Savior. This corresponds to the two sacred titles revealed at the birth of Christ: Jesus, Jehovah the Savior, and Emmanuel, God with us (Matt. 1:21-23). Our Lord is not only our Savior, but also God, and not merely God, but the great God, the God who is great in nature, in glory, in authority, in power, in deed, in love, in grace, and in every divine attribute. In 1 Timothy 2:5 our Lord is revealed as a man; here, as the great God. He is both man and God. His appearing in His divine glory will be not only for saving His people into the kingdom age, but also for the judgment of the entire world, that He may bring the kingdom of God to this earth. Hence, His appearing in His glory is the blessed hope.<p>Whether or not we shall be happy at the time of the Lord&#8217;s appearing depends on our living as Christians today. According to Matthew 25, all the Lord&#8217;s servants will give an account to Him at His coming. To some the Lord will say, &#8220;Well done, good and faithful slave; you were faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter into the joy of your Lord&#8221; (Matt. 25:21). But others the Lord will rebuke as evil and slothful slaves (v. 26). The evil and slothful slave is not an unbeliever or a false believer. How could someone who is not a genuine believer in the Lord receive a talent from Him, and how could a false believer meet the Lord at His judgment seat in the air? Such things are impossible. Only genuine believers are spoken of here.<p>Many of today&#8217;s Christians will find themselves in a sorrowful situation at the time of the Lord&#8217;s coming. Instead of being commended by the Lord, they will be rebuked by Him. Oh, the superficiality among Christians today! Many have been drugged by superficial teachings concerning the Lord&#8217;s coming. They do not have a heart for the healthy teachings regarding God&#8217;s economy. Because they have been drugged, they imagine that they will have no problems with the Lord at the time of His appearing. They do not seem to realize that, according to Paul&#8217;s word in 2 Timothy 4:8, the Lord will appear as the righteous Judge. At that time, a great many Christians will hear a very sobering word from the Lord. However, I prefer to hear a sobering word from Him today. In contrast to much of the preaching among Christians today, the ministry in the Lord&#8217;s recovery does not present sugar-coated teachings. On the contrary, sobering messages are given to the saints.<p>In verse 14 Paul says that Christ &#8220;gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify to Himself a people for His own possession, zealous of good works.&#8221; The words &#8220;for us&#8221; here mean on our behalf. They do not mean instead of us. To redeem means to buy with a price (1 Cor. 6:20; 1 Pet. 1:18-19; 1 Tim. 2:6). Christ gave Himself for us not only that He might redeem us from all lawlessness, but also purify to Himself a people for His own possession. A people for His possession are a peculiar people. This expression is borrowed from the Old Testament (Deut. 7:6; 14:2; 26:18) and denotes a people privately possessed by God as His peculiar treasure (Exo. 19:5), His own possession (1 Pet. 2:9).<h2 class=head1>III. THE APOSTLE&#8217;S CHARGE TO TITUS</h2><p>In verse 15 we have the apostle&#8217;s charge to Titus: &#8220;These things speak, and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one despise you.&#8221; By &#8220;these things&#8221; Paul means all the things in verses 1 through 14. Titus was charged to speak these things and to exhort and reprove with all authority. Authority here also means imperativeness. The literal meaning of the Greek word is command. With all authority modifies both exhort and reprove. To exhort and reprove with all authority is to advise and rebuke imperatively with words of authority in every way, as giving command.<p>Paul&#8217;s exhortation, &#8220;Let no one despise you,&#8221; is connected with the matter of authority in the preceding sentence. It is the conclusion of all the charges to Titus in this chapter. It mainly concerns his teaching (vv. 1, 7-8, 15). The healthy teaching with the healthy word according to godliness would keep him in gravity and invite the utmost respect.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF TITUS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>CHARGING THE SAINTS TO KEEP A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOVERNMENT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Titus 3:1-8</h1><p>When Paul was writing the Epistle of Titus, there were certain basic concepts within him. These concepts were the factors, the elements, of the composition of this book. In writing chapter one of Titus, Paul was deeply concerned for the church. Hence, in this chapter he takes care of the proper order in the church and speaks of establishing the eldership for the administration of a local church, of the termination of the various isms, and of holding to the healthy teaching of the apostles. Paul goes on in chapter two to speak of an orderly human life, which is primarily related to the family life. Then, as we have seen in the foregoing message, he speaks of society, or of the social system. In 3:1-8 Paul speaks of the rulers, that is, the government.<p>To have an orderly life, we need to take care of four units: the church, the family, the social system, and the government. If we care for these units properly, we shall have an orderly life in every way. When Paul was writing the book of Titus, he had within him a concern for these four units. Unbelievers, of course, care only for family, society, and government. Even the philosophers and thoughtful people throughout the centuries have considered only these three units among mankind. But among us in the Lord&#8217;s recovery the most important unit is the church. For us, the church is first. We give the church preeminence in our consideration, for the church is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. Furthermore, the church is the great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh. Paul covered the matter of the church first in this Epistle, and we follow him to give the church the first place among the four basic units covered in this book.<p>After the church, the most important unit is the family. Some opposers have tried to defame us by spreading the devilish lie that we do not care for the family life. Next to the church, the family is the most important unit in society. Without a proper family life, how could we have a healthy society or country? A nation is constituted of families as the basic factors. We fully realize that without a proper family life it is difficult to have an orderly church life. But we also realize that without a proper church life it is difficult to have a normal and proper family life. We are here for the church and also for the family. Furthermore, we care for society. We respect others, we honor our neighbors, and we care for the existing social system. We are not here as social reformers, and it is not our intention to change the social system. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery we are here to present to others healthy teachings concerning the all-inclusive Christ and the church as the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>A CHARGE TO THE SAINTS</h2><p>In this message we are concerned with Paul&#8217;s charge to the saints to maintain a good relationship with the government. According to the healthy teaching in the New Testament, we must respect the government.<p>In 3:1 and 2 Paul says, &#8220;Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work, to speak evil of no one, to be uncontentious, forbearing, showing all meekness toward all men.&#8221; To be subject to rulers is to recognize God&#8217;s authority and respect His government over men (Rom. 13:1-2). To be uncontentious (v. 2) is to be peaceable, not quarrelsome.<p>Before Paul could teach the saints to respect the government, he himself had to experience a certain amount of transformation. When he was Saul of Tarsus, he was a patriotic Jew and wanted to be free from the yoke of the Roman imperialists. But here he instructs the saints to subject themselves to rulers and to authorities. According to his word in Romans 13, government officials have been appointed by God. Paul recognized that even those officials appointed by Caesar are rulers appointed by God, His deputy authority. If Paul had not been transformed from a natural person into a spiritual person with spiritual understanding, it would have been difficult for him to give such instructions.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S SUPPLY</h2><p>To care for the church life, the family life, the social system, and the government, we need a specific supply. In speaking of these four units, Paul also tells us of the divine supply. We have seen that in chapter one Paul speaks concerning the church life. The supply for the church life consists of the faith of God&#8217;s chosen ones, the full knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, and the hope of eternal life (1:1-2). Eternal life in particular is the supply which enables us to have the church life. The word of proclamation (1:3) is another aspect of the supply for the proper church life.<p>Just as there is a supply for the church life, there is also a supply for the family life. The supply for the proper family life includes healthy teaching (2:1), healthy speech (2:8), and being healthy in faith, in love, and in endurance (2:2). For the family unit we need the supply of healthy teaching and healthy speech. The word speech in 2:8 refers to our ordinary daily conversation, such as conversation at the dinner table. If our speech is healthy, it will supply us that we may have a proper family life.<p>We have seen that in 2:9-15 Paul charges the slaves to behave well in the social system of slavery. This indicates that we need to have the proper attitude toward society. But what is the supply for living in the existing social system? This supply is the grace of God which has appeared, bringing salvation to all men and training us to live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age as we await the blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of the great God and our Savior, Christ Jesus (2:11-13). By means of this supply we can adorn the teaching of our Savior God in all things.<p>The supply which enables us to keep a good relationship with the government is wonderful. Paul speaks of this supply in 3:4-7. Prior to this, he says in verse 3, &#8220;For we also were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving as slaves various lusts and pleasures, spending our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.&#8221; We should remember that in nature we were once the same as others, living in the fallen condition; therefore, we should sympathize with their pitiful life and pray for their salvation (1 Tim. 2:1, 4). We also once served as slaves various lusts, various desires and gratifications. But now we have a marvelous supply to have a good relationship with the government.<h2 class=head1>KINDNESS, LOVE, AND MERCY</h2><p>Verse 4 says, &#8220;But when the kindness and love to man of our Savior God appeared.&#8221; It is the kindness and love of our Savior God that has saved us and made us different from others.<p>In verse 5 Paul continues, &#8220;Not by works in righteousness which we have done but according to His mercy, He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Titus 2:11 says that the grace of God brings salvation to man, and 3:7 says that we have been justified by the grace of the Lord. But verse 5 says that according to His mercy He saved us. God&#8217;s mercy reaches farther than His grace. Our pitiful condition created a wide gap between us and God&#8217;s grace. It was God&#8217;s mercy that has bridged this gap and brought us to His salvation of grace.<p>Notice that in 3:4-5 Paul does not speak of grace, but speaks of kindness, love, and mercy. Love is the source of grace. In the heart of God the Father there is love. But when this love is expressed through the Son, it becomes grace. For this reason, 2 Corinthians 13:14 speaks of the grace of Christ and the love of the Father. In John 1:16 and 17 we have grace; however, in 1 John we touch the love of God the Father as the source of this grace.<p>What, then, are mercy and kindness? We have pointed out that mercy always reaches farther than grace. When we are in a proper situation, God&#8217;s love will come to us as grace. However, we were all in a pitiful situation and may still be in such a situation today. Therefore, we need God&#8217;s mercy to reach us. The mercy of God can come to us even in our pitiful situation.<p>Kindness is God&#8217;s attitude in giving grace to us. It is possible to give a gift to a person without having a proper attitude. For example, I may give a valuable gift to a brother but give it in a rather crude, insensitive manner. On the other hand, I may give him a gift in a way that expresses an attitude of kindness. God&#8217;s attitude in giving us grace is the attitude of kindness.<p>When we have mercy, love, and kindness, we automatically have grace. Our God and Father has shown us love, mercy, and kindness. It is by this that He saves us.<h2 class=head1>WASHING AND RENEWING</h2><p>According to verse 5, God&#8217;s salvation is also through a certain action: the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit. In Greek, the word for regeneration in verse 5 is different from that for born again (1 Pet. 1:23). The only other place this word is used is in Matthew 19:28 for the restoration in the millennium. Here it refers to a change from one state of things to another. To be born again is the beginning of this change. The washing of regeneration begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit as the process of God&#8217;s new creation to make us a new man. It is a kind of reconditioning, remaking, remodeling with life. Baptism (Rom. 6:3-5), the putting off of the old man, the putting on of the new man (Eph. 4:22, 24; Col. 3:9-11), and transformation by the renewing of the mind (Rom 12:2; Eph. 4:23) are all related to this wonderful process. The washing of regeneration purges away all the things of the old nature of our old man, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit imparts something new-the divine essence of the new man-into our being. In this is a passage from the old state we were in into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of a new creation. Hence, both the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are a continual working in us throughout our whole life until the completion of the new creation.<p>In 1 Timothy the church is stressed (3:15-16), in 2 Timothy the Scripture (3:15-16), and in Titus the Holy Spirit. The church is the house of the living God, expressing God in the flesh, and the pillar and base of the truth, the divine reality of the great mystery-God manifested in the flesh. The Scripture is the breath of God, containing and conveying His divine essence for our nourishment and equipment to make us perfect and complete for His use. The Holy Spirit is the divine Person, washing and renewing us in the divine element to make us a new creation with the divine nature to be heirs of God in His eternal life, inheriting all the riches of the Triune God.<p>Verse 6 says that the Holy Spirit has been &#8220;poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior.&#8221; The Holy Spirit, Who is the Triune God reaching man, has not only been given to us, but poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior, to bring all the divine riches in Christ to us, including the eternal life of God and His divine nature, for our eternal portion.<h2 class=head1>HEIRS ACCORDING TO THE HOPE OF ETERNAL LIFE</h2><p>In verse 7 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;That, having been justified by the grace of that One, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.&#8221; This speaks forth the issue and goal of God&#8217;s salvation (v. 5) and justification, including the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit. The issue and goal is to make us heirs of God according to the hope of eternal life.<p>According to verse 7, the believers are not only sons, but also heirs who are qualified to inherit the Father&#8217;s estate (Rom. 4:14; 8:17; Gal. 3:29; 4:7). We are born of God (John 1:12-13) with His eternal life (John 3:16). This eternal life is for us not only to live and enjoy God in this age, but also to inherit all the riches of what He is to us in the coming age and in eternity. Hence, there is the hope of eternal life. God&#8217;s eternal life is our enjoyment today and our hope tomorrow. According to this hope we become heirs of God to inherit all His riches for eternity. This is the climax as the eternal goal of His eternal salvation with His eternal life given to us by grace in Christ.<h2 class=head1>A CHARGE TO TITUS</h2><p>In verse 8 Paul concludes this section of Titus: &#8220;Faithful is the word, and concerning these things I desire you to affirm confidently, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.&#8221; The faithful word here is given in verses 3 through 7, and these things are the things mentioned in verses 1 through 7. To affirm confidently is to affirm consistently, steadfastly, positively, with persistence and thoroughness. It is the same word used in 1 Timothy 1:7.<p>In speaking concerning the church life, the family life, the social system, and the government, Paul does not give empty instructions. Along with the instructions, he points us to the source of the supply. For the church life, we have the faith of God&#8217;s chosen ones, the full knowledge of the truth, eternal life with its hope, and the word of proclamation which causes eternal life to be manifested. For the family life, we have healthy words, healthy teaching, and healthy speech. For the social system, we have the grace of God which has saved us and which is now training us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age. For a good relationship with the government, we have the marvelous supply described in 3:1-8. Therefore, we have the divine supply for a proper church life, family life, social life, and relationship with the government. We have a proper relationship with all these units not by ethical teachings, philosophical instruction, or our natural life and ability. On the contrary, we have a heavenly, divine, and spiritual supply for the church, family, society, and government.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF TITUS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIX</h1><h1 class=title>DEALING WITH A FACTIOUS ONE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Titus 3:9-15</h1><p>Before we consider 3:9-15, we need a further word on verses 4 through 7. In verse 7 Paul says, &#8220;That, having been justified by the grace of that One, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.&#8221; Becoming heirs of God is the goal of His eternal salvation with His eternal life given to us by grace in Christ. In verses 4 through 6 we see some crucial matters needed to reach God&#8217;s goal. In verses 4 and 5 we read of certain divine attributes: kindness, love, and mercy. When these attributes are put together, we have grace. God has exercised His love, mercy, kindness, and grace in order to save us. Whenever we are about to do something of great importance, we exercise our whole being. Our mind, will, emotion, heart, and even our disposition are exercised. In like manner, God exercised His being in order to save us. He exercised His love, kindness, mercy, and grace. By means of these divine attributes God has saved us. These attributes, however, are the source; they are not the activity or the process.<p>In 3:5 and 6 we have activity, an action, constituting the process through which God saved us: &#8220;He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, Whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior.&#8221; God&#8217;s salvation is based upon the exercise of His attributes and through the process of the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit. The goal is that we become God&#8217;s heirs.<p>Paul certainly was an excellent writer. Knowing that in verses 4 through 6 he had not written anything concerning justification, he inserts the words &#8220;having been justified by the grace of that One.&#8221; Although justification is somewhat implied by the matters of salvation and washing, Paul mentions it explicitly in verse 7. We have been saved, washed, and justified. The grace by which we are justified is the totality of God&#8217;s kindness, love, and mercy. These attributes are of God. But when they become a totality in our experience, that is grace. Kindness, love, and mercy are of the Father, whereas grace is of Christ, of &#8220;that One.&#8221; For this reason, in 2 Corinthians 13:14 Paul speaks of the grace of Christ and of the love of God the Father.<p>In 3:7 Paul says that we become heirs according to the hope of eternal life, whereas in 1:1 and 2 he says that he became an apostle in the hope of eternal life. This eternal life meant a great deal to Paul. It also means a great deal to us as believers. Paul became an apostle in the hope of eternal life, and we become heirs of God according to the hope of eternal life. Why does Paul use the word &#8220;in&#8221; when speaking of himself and the word &#8220;according to&#8221; when speaking of us? The fact that he used the word &#8220;in&#8221; with respect to himself indicates that he was already experiencing the hope of eternal life. But because we have not yet entered into this experience to a very great extent, he says that we are heirs according to the hope of eternal life. As a very matured believer, Paul was experiencing the hope already. He was in it. But, for the most part, this experience lies ahead of us. Therefore, we are heirs according to this hope.<h2 class=head1>I. THE APOSTLE&#8217;S CHARGE</h2><p>In 3:9 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;But avoid foolish questionings and genealogies and strifes and contentions about the law, for they are unprofitable and vain.&#8221; The questionings here are those aroused by genealogies (1 Tim. 1:4), and the strifes issue out of the questionings and genealogies. Contentions refer to fightings, which are due to different opinions issuing from the deviant and mythological studies of the law. The law in this verse is the law of the Jews used for Gnostic Judaism, which stood in opposition to the simplicity of the gospel. These questionings, genealogies, strifes, and contentions are all vain; that is, they are aimless, without any positive result.<p>The positive things stressed in verses 4 through 8 should be affirmed strongly and consistently, positive things including our Savior God, Jesus Christ our Savior, the Holy Spirit, God&#8217;s kindness, love, mercy, grace, and eternal life, with His acts of justifying, saving, washing, regenerating, and renewing. These are the Triune God with His attributes and virtues, plus His divine actions in His eternal salvation: they are things of life, which belong to the tree of life (Gen. 2:9) and produce heirs to inherit all that He is for them. The negative things dealt with in verses 9 through 11 should be avoided. These things include foolish questionings, genealogies, strifes, contentions about the law, and factious, opinionated men. These matters are of the knowledge that is deadening, matters that belong to the tree of knowledge and kill their victims.<p>Paul&#8217;s word about avoiding foolish questionings, genealogies, strifes, and contentions corresponds to what he says about teaching differently in 1 Timothy 1. Differing teachings had begun to creep into the church, and Paul charges Titus to avoid them.<p>The Lord&#8217;s ministry is not the teaching of any individual. The ministry is the teaching of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. This means that the Lord&#8217;s ministry is the healthy teaching which conveys to us the New Testament economy. Unfortunately, most of today&#8217;s Christian teachers have missed the mark of God&#8217;s economy. God&#8217;s economy may be likened to a kernel or a grain. Most Christian teachers pay attention not to the kernel, but to the stem, the leaves, and even to the husks. They may argue and debate over husks and neglect the kernel.<p>In Colossians 1:25 Paul says, &#8220;I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God.&#8221; To complete the word of God means to complete the divine revelation. This completion of the word of God is the mystery of Christ. This expression refers both to Christ and to His mystery. The mystery of Christ is the church. The content of the teaching of the New Testament economy is the all-inclusive Christ and the church as the Body of Christ.<p>Any teaching which deviates from this central focus should be regarded as a differing teaching. For example, suppose a certain Christian teacher insists that we baptize people in the name of Jesus Christ, not in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit and not even in the name of Christ Jesus. Although such a teaching may be presented in a way which sounds fundamental and scriptural, it is actually a differing teaching because it emphasizes something other than the focus of God&#8217;s economy and distracts the saints from the proper church life. Yes, the Bible commands us to be baptized. But we should not be influenced by differing teachings related to the name in which the believers are baptized. To pay too much attention to such matters will cause us to be distracted from God&#8217;s economy.<p>It is not the goal of the Lord&#8217;s recovery to recover doctrinal truths. The goal of the recovery is to bring us back to God&#8217;s New Testament economy, which is Christ and the church. What the Lord desires of us, and what we ourselves need, is to have our entire being focused on God&#8217;s economy. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery we must pay our full attention to Christ and the church.<p>As we direct our attention to God&#8217;s economy concerning Christ and the church, we must avoid differing teachings. These teachings may be scriptural, and certain preachers may speak of them in an eloquent, attractive manner. However, we must discern whether or not such speaking is focused on Christ and the church, whether or not it strengthens the believers to live Christ and practice the church life. A person may deliver an excellent message on love from 1 Corinthians 13. However, if he has not seen the vision of the New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church, even his inspiring message on love may be a distraction. The more he expounds 1 Corinthians 13, the more those who listen to him are distracted from Christ and from the church life. Instead, they pay their attention to love.<p>Many seeking Christians have been distracted not by heresies, but by good teachings on certain favorite portions of the Bible. Many Christians are impressed by 1 Corinthians 13, and they appreciate messages on this chapter. But although they may talk a great deal about love and about the need to love one another, they neglect the church life.<p>Christians today appreciate the book of Psalms. For many, Psalms is their favorite book in the Bible. Paying our full attention to the Psalms, however, may distract us from living Christ and may encourage and strengthen us to be merely believers who emphasize the devotional life. Furthermore, some may be distracted from the church life and even completely neglect it. They may even criticize certain ones in the church for not emphasizing the devotional time the way they do.<p>How are we to discern which messages to receive and which to avoid? Although we must oppose heresy, we should not oppose teachings which are not heretical. But we should not pay attention to teachings that are not focused on God&#8217;s economy, even though they are sound. We need to avoid differing teachings and concentrate on God&#8217;s economy concerning Christ and the church.<h2 class=head1>II. DEALING WITH A FACTIOUS MAN</h2><p>Titus 3:10 and 11 say, &#8220;A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse, knowing that such a one has been perverted and sins, being self-condemned.&#8221; A factious man is a heretical, sectarian man who causes divisions by forming parties in the church according to his own opinions. The Gnostic Judaism referred to in the preceding verse must be related to this. The divisiveness is based on differing teachings. This is the reason that verse 10 comes after verse 9. Certain believers may have insisted on the teaching of the law and in so doing became divisive.<p>In verse 10 Paul charges Titus to refuse a factious man after a first and second admonition. In order to maintain good order in the church, a factious, divisive person, after a first and second admonition, should be refused, rejected. Because such divisiveness is contagious, this rejection is for the church&#8217;s profit that contact with the divisive one be stopped.<p>In verse 11 Paul speaks a severe word, saying that a factious man has been perverted, that he sins, and that he is self-condemned. Literally, the Greek words rendered &#8220;has been perverted&#8221; mean turned out of the way. It is more than being turned away from the right path (Titus 1:14). One who has been perverted in this way is spoiled, damaged, destroyed, with respect to God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<p>Paul tells us that factious persons are self-condemned. When a factious person is alone, deep within he may become conscious of a feeling of condemnation. He knows that he does not have genuine peace. With his tongue he may say that he is not condemned, but deep in his heart he has questions and a sense of uneasiness. Some of those who left the Lord&#8217;s recovery argued strongly about various things. But deep within they did not have true peace. Instead, they were self-condemned. If they did not have a feeling of condemnation within, they would not struggle to vindicate themselves and to convince others they are right. Their efforts at self-vindication are a sign of their self-condemnation.<h2 class=head1>III. THE CONCLUSION OF THE BOOK</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Apostle&#8217;s Fellowship</h2><p>In verses 12 and 13 Paul says, &#8220;When I send Artemas to you or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. Zenas the lawyer and Apollos send forward diligently that nothing may be lacking to them.&#8221; Nicopolis was a city in the southwestern corner of Macedonia, where this Epistle was written. Artemas and Tychicus were intimate fellow-workers of Paul; Zenas and Apollos worked independently of him. Yet Paul still charged Titus to care for them, showing there was no jealousy between the two groups of co-workers.<p>Paul&#8217;s word in verse 14 is related to what he says in verse 13: &#8220;And let those also who are ours learn to maintain good works for necessary needs, that they may not be unfruitful.&#8221; They were to take care of the needs of the Lord&#8217;s servants and to help them on their way.<h2 class=head2>B. Greetings</h2><p>In verse 15 Paul concludes, &#8220;All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all.&#8221; The faith here is subjective and denotes our believing act which brings us into organic union with the Lord (John 3:15; Gal. 3:26) and operates through love (Gal. 5:6). It is in the element and operation of this faith that the saints who were one with the Lord in His concern loved the suffering and faithful apostle.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILEMON</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE</h1><h1 class=title>A SLAVE REBORN TO BE A BROTHER</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Philem. 1-16</h1><h2 class=head1>I. THE SUBJECT OF THE BOOK</h2><p>The subject of the book of Philemon is an illustration of the believers&#8217; equal status in the new man. In the new man all the believers, whether masters such as Philemon or slaves such as Onesimus, have the same status.<h2 class=head1>II. INTRODUCTION</h2><p>The book of Philemon opens with the words, &#8220;Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy the brother, to Philemon the beloved and our fellow-worker.&#8221; In verse 2 Paul refers to Apphia the sister and to Archippus and to the church in Philemon&#8217;s house. According to the family nature of this Epistle, Apphia must be Philemon&#8217;s wife, and Archippus, his son. Philemon lived in Colosse (v. 2, see Col. 4:17; v. 10, see Col. 1:2; 4:9). According to history, he was an elder of the church in Colosse. It should be that the church in Colosse met in his house. Hence, it was the church in his house.<p>The introduction to this Epistle concludes with Paul&#8217;s word in verse 3: &#8220;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>III. A SLAVE REBORN TO BE A BROTHER</h2><p>In verses 4 and 5 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers, hearing of your love and the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and to all the saints.&#8221; Notice that in verse 5 Paul speaks first of love and then of faith. In the initial stage faith came first, and then love was produced by faith (Gal. 5:6; Eph. 1:15; Col. 1:4). But here love is referred to first and then faith, because what is dealt with in this Epistle concerning the equal status of believers is a matter of love, which comes out of faith. In the new man the members love one another in faith (Titus 3:15). The relationship is of love through faith. The apostle appreciates the fellowship of Philemon&#8217;s faith (v. 6) and is encouraged by his love (v. 7); thus he entreats him to receive Onesimus because of this love (v. 9). These two virtues are referred to in a combined way. Philemon has both of them, not only toward the Lord, but also toward all the saints.<p>In verse 6 Paul continues, &#8220;That the fellowship of your faith may become operative in the full knowledge of every good thing which is in us for Christ.&#8221; This verse is actually the continuation of verse 4. Full knowledge here means full acknowledgment, entire appreciation, and experiential recognition. By &#8220;every good thing&#8221; Paul does not mean natural things (see Rom. 7:18), but spiritual and divinely good things, such as eternal life, the divine nature, and spiritual gifts, which are in us, the regenerated believers, not in natural men.<p>The Greek word rendered &#8220;for&#8221; in the phrase &#8220;for Christ&#8221; literally means unto, toward. All the spiritual and divinely good things in us are unto Christ, toward Christ, for Christ. The apostle prays that the fellowship, the communication, the sharing, of Philemon&#8217;s faith toward all the saints may operate in them in the element and sphere of the full knowledge, the full realization, of all the good things in us for Christ, causing them to acknowledge, appreciate, and recognize all the spiritual and divinely good things which are in the believers for Christ.<p>In verse 7 Paul says, &#8220;For I had much joy and encouragement over your love, because the inward parts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.&#8221; The word &#8220;for&#8221; introduces the reason the apostle prays for Philemon&#8217;s faith to operate in the saints (v. 6). It is because his love has refreshed the inward parts of the saints and has hence rendered the apostle much joy and encouragement. The Greek word rendered refreshed also means soothed, cheered.<p>Verses 8 and 9 continue, &#8220;Wherefore, having much boldness in Christ to charge you what is fitting, because of love I rather entreat, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus.&#8221; The Greek word for aged here may also be translated an ambassador (Eph. 6:20). Prisoner here and in verse 23, and bonds in verse 13, indicate that this Epistle was written during imprisonment, the apostle&#8217;s first imprisonment in Rome.<p>In verses 10 and 11 Paul says, &#8220;I entreat you concerning my child whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus, who formerly was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to me.&#8221; During his imprisonment, Paul begot Onesimus through the Spirit with the eternal life of God (John 3:3; 1:13). In Greek the name Onesimus means profitable, useful, helpful; it was a common name for slaves. He was Philemon&#8217;s purchased bondslave, who, according to Roman law, had no human rights. He ran away from his master, committing a crime which could bring the death penalty. While he was in prison at Rome with the apostle, he was saved through him. Now the apostle sends him back with this Epistle to his master.<p>The word useless in verse 11 also means not of service, profitless. This refers to Onesimus&#8217;s running away from Philemon. The word useful also means of service, profitable. Onesimus became of service because he had been converted and was willing to return to Philemon.<p>Verse 12 continues, &#8220;Whom I have sent back to you-him, that is, my very heart.&#8221; Literally, the Greek word for heart means bowels, as in verses 7 and 20; Philippians 1:8; 2:1; and Colossians 3:12. It signifies inward affection, tenderheartedness, compassions. Paul&#8217;s inward affection and compassions went with Onesimus to Philemon.<p>Verses 13 and 14 say, &#8220;Whom I resolved to keep with myself, that on your behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the gospel, but without your mind I did not want to do anything, that your goodness should not be as of necessity, but voluntary.&#8221; Just as the Lord would not do anything without our consent, Paul would not keep Onesimus with him without Philemon&#8217;s consent.<p>In verses 15 and 16 Paul says, &#8220;For perhaps therefore he was separated from you for an hour that you might fully have him forever, no longer as a slave, but above a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, and how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.&#8221; The word &#8220;for&#8221; in verse 15 introduces the reason for the sending in verse 12. The word perhaps here is not only an expression of humility, but also one which shows no prejudice.<p>This short Epistle serves the special purpose of showing us the equality in eternal life and divine love of all the members in the Body of Christ. In the age of Paul the life of Christ had annulled, among the believers, the strong institution of slavery. Since the sentiment of the love of the Christian fellowship was so powerful and prevailing that the evil social order among fallen mankind was spontaneously ignored, any need for institutional emancipation was obviated. Because of the divine birth and living by the divine life, all the believers in Christ had equal status in the church, which was the new man in Christ, with no discrimination between free and bond (Col. 3:10-11). This is based on three facts. First, Christ&#8217;s death on the cross has abolished the ordinances of the different ways of life for the creation of the one new man (Eph. 2:15). Second, we all have been baptized into Christ and made one in Him without any difference (Gal. 3:27-28). Third, in the new man Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:11). Such a life with such a love in equal fellowship is well able to maintain good order in the church (in Titus), carry out God&#8217;s economy concerning the church (in 1 Timothy), and stand against the tide of the church&#8217;s decline (in 2 Timothy). It is of the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty that this Epistle was positioned after the three preceding books in the arrangement of the New Testament.<p>According to Paul&#8217;s word in verse 16, Onesimus was above a slave, or more than a slave. He was even more than a free man; he was a beloved brother.<p>There are a number of intimate terms in this Epistle: a beloved brother, the sister (v. 2), the beloved and our fellow-worker (v. 1), our fellow-soldier (v. 2), my fellow-workers (v. 24), my fellow-prisoner (v. 23), and a partner (v. 17). These terms indicate the intimate sentiment in the apostle concerning his relationship with the fellow members in the new man.<p>The expression &#8220;both in the flesh and in the Lord&#8221; means in the flesh as a slave and in the Lord as a brother; in the flesh a brother for a slave, and in the Lord a slave for a brother.<p>The title of this message is &#8220;A Slave Reborn to Be a Brother.&#8221; Only through the preaching of the gospel could a slave like Onesimus be reborn to be a brother. Paul did not preach the gospel to Onesimus in an ordinary way or in a careless, superficial way. Paul preached the gospel to him while he was a prisoner in Rome. This indicates that no matter what kind of situation Paul was in, he was always exercised to carry on the preaching of the gospel. He says, &#8220;Now I want you to know, brothers, that the things concerning me have turned out rather to the advancement of the gospel, so that my bonds have become manifest in Christ in the whole praetorium and to all the rest.&#8221; Nero&#8217;s royal guard heard Paul preaching the gospel and even saw him preaching the gospel. Philippians 4:22 indicates that certain members of Caesar&#8217;s household were saved: &#8220;All the saints greet you, and especially those of Caesar&#8217;s household.&#8221; Now we know from the Epistle to Philemon that the slave Onesimus was saved through Paul.<p>Paul did not preach the gospel to Onesimus in the way practiced by most Christians today. Paul regarded his gospel preaching as an act of begetting. For this reason, Paul refers to Onesimus as his child begotten in his bonds. Paul&#8217;s preaching involved a process of begetting and giving birth to a child. This indicates that in his preaching of the gospel Paul ministered the divine life into others. The eternal life of God imparted into Onesimus caused him to be reborn as Paul&#8217;s spiritual child and brother in Christ. When we preach the gospel today, we also must preach in the way of begetting, in the way of imparting Christ as the divine life into those to whom we preach the gospel.<p>Furthermore, after begetting this child, Paul did not neglect him or leave him as an orphan in the care of others. Because this child was so dear to him, Paul kept him and loved him. He even referred to him as &#8220;my very heart.&#8221; Mothers often feel this way toward their child. If the child were taken away from them, it would seem as if the mother&#8217;s heart had been snatched away. Do you have this kind of feeling concerning one whom you have brought to the Lord? Probably we do not have much of this kind of feeling. However, Paul considered Onesimus not only his child, but also his heart. For Paul to send his child to Philemon meant that he also sent his heart to him. What concern we see here!<p>There are some parents who do not regard their children in the flesh as their own heart. They may say within themselves, &#8220;God has given me this child, and it is my duty to take care of him. In this matter I have no choice.&#8221; Often Christians who bring others to the Lord have a similar attitude. In contrast to Paul, they lack a deep parental concern for the one saved through them.<p>Although Paul had such a loving concern for his child, he realized that he was not the right person to keep him. Because Onesimus was a slave who had escaped from his master, he had to return. It is possible that Onesimus had stolen something from Philemon. Verse 18 may indicate this: &#8220;And if he has wronged you in anything or owes anything, charge that to my account.&#8221; Onesimus may not merely have pilfered things from Philemon; he may have stolen something precious.<p>Here we see that Paul&#8217;s concern was that the human relationship between Onesimus and Philemon would be rectified. After we have brought a sinner to the Lord, we should first regard him as our spiritual child and then help him to rectify his relationships. For example, if one has wronged his parents, we should help him to be reconciled to his parents. If a wife is wrong with her husband, or a husband with his wife, we should help the wife or husband to restore the proper relationship with the spouse. This is an important principle.<p>In sending back this escaped slave to his master, Paul, an excellent writer, appealed to Philemon&#8217;s love. In verses 5 and 6 Paul says, &#8220;Hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and to all the saints, that the fellowship of your faith may become operative in the full knowledge of every good thing which is in us for Christ.&#8221; Because in this Epistle Paul is appealing to Philemon&#8217;s love, he puts love before faith in verse 5.<p>Verse 6 is difficult to understand. Here Paul seems to be saying, &#8220;When the brothers in different localities learn of what you did in love through faith and have fellowship regarding your faith, your faith will work in them. It will become operative in them in the full knowledge of every good thing which is in us for Christ, because all believers have the same good things within them.&#8221; These good things include the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine gifts. A full record of these things is found in the three books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus. All these good things in us are for Christ. The fellowship of Philemon&#8217;s faith may be likened to a fan with which we fan into flame for Christ all the good things within us (2 Tim. 1:6). When the saints hear what Philemon did in love, the good deposit within them will be stirred up. This is the operation of the faith of a certain saint through the fellowship among the believers.<p>In the book of Philemon we have an excellent pattern and example of bringing a sinner to the Lord through begetting him with the divine life; regarding him as a child, even as our heart; and helping him to rectify all the human relationships. In the churches in the Lord&#8217;s recovery it is our practice to send back the escaped one and the divorced or separated wife or husband. We want to help rectify all human relationships. In doing this, we must have a loving concern and appeal to the love of the other party. Finally, in keeping with Paul&#8217;s example in this Epistle, we must help the newly saved one to come into the church life. Paul&#8217;s desire was to bring Onesimus into the church life. Having been begotten by Paul, Onesimus was now a slave reborn to be a brother. As the one who had begotten him, Paul bore the responsibility to bring Onesimus into the church life, into the fellowship among the members of the Body.<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILEMON</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO</h1><h1 class=title>A BROTHER RECOMMENDED FOR THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEW MAN</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Philem. 17-25</h1><p>The subject of the book of Philemon is an illustration of the believers&#8217; equal status in the new man. Apparently this Epistle does not say anything concerning the status of the believers. Actually, this book touches the heart of this matter.<p>When Paul wrote to Philemon, Philemon was in Colosse and Paul was far away, a prisoner in Rome. One of his co-prisoners, Onesimus, was brought to the Lord and begotten by Paul in the Spirit to become not only a believer in Christ and a child of God, but also a dear child to Paul himself. Since there was a church in Rome, why did Paul not recommend this newly saved one to the local church there? Paul did not do this, because Onesimus was a runaway slave and his master, Philemon, lived in Colosse.<p>The fact that there were churches in Rome and in Colosse indicates that the churches as the expression of the Body of Christ are universal. This was true in ancient times just as it is true today. The first church, the church in Jerusalem, came into existence approximately A.D. 34 or 35. The Epistle to Philemon was written about thirty years later. Even during the comparatively short time of thirty years, churches had been established not only in Judea, but also in the Gentile world. Thus, the church was universal. This was according to the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty to carry out the commission He had given to Paul. It also was the fulfillment of Paul&#8217;s desire to see a new man on earth.<p>By the spreading of the Roman Empire the various nations and peoples around the Mediterranean Sea were brought into contact with one another and were even unified politically. There was a great deal of traffic and communication between people in various parts of the empire. This communication was altogether related to the old man. But at the time Paul wrote to Philemon, another man had come into existence on earth. In the midst of the old man, the new man had come into being. This is fully revealed in Colossians 3:10 and 11: &#8220;And having put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him Who created him; where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.&#8221; Philemon was an elder of the church in Colosse. In the Epistle to the Colossians Paul emphasized that all the believers are part of the new man. Furthermore, in the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew, slave and freeman. Philemon was a freeman, and Onesimus was his bondservant. But in the new man they were of equal status.<p>In Colossians 4 we have a record of the fellowship of the new man. Colossians 4:9 speaks of Onesimus, and verse 17, of Archippus, the son of Philemon. A freeman and a slave who were members of the same household were also part of the church as the new man.<p>The Epistle to Philemon should be regarded as a continuation of Colossians 4 and considered an illustration of how in the new man all social rank is put aside. In the previous message we pointed out that this short Epistle serves the special purpose of showing us the equality in eternal life and divine love of all the members in the Body of Christ. The distinction of social rank and status among the believers is nullified not by an outward legal act, but by an inward change of constitution. Ranks have been abolished because the believers have been constituted of Christ&#8217;s life. Christ&#8217;s life had been constituted into Philemon, and the same life with the same divine element had been constituted into his slave, Onesimus. According to the flesh, Philemon was a master and was free, and Onesimus was a slave and was not free. But according to the inner constitution, both were the same. Because of the divine birth and a living by the divine life, all the believers in Christ have equal status in the church, which is the new man in Christ, with no discrimination between free and bond.<p>In Titus 2:9-15 Paul charges the slaves to behave well in the social system of slavery. He instructed them to live a Jesusly human life in the midst of such a social system. But in the Epistle to Philemon he gives the churches an illustration of how slaves and masters alike have been reconstituted of the life of Christ. As a result, they all are part of the new man. In the old social system, which belongs to the living of the old man, the distinction between master and slave exists. Paul did not touch this social system in the way of trying to reform it. On the contrary, on the one hand he instructed the slaves to live a Jesusly human life under this social system; on the other hand, he illustrated how both slaves and masters are brothers in the Lord and, as members of the new man, share the same status.<p>Philemon 16 makes this relationship very clear. Concerning Onesimus Paul says, &#8220;No longer as a slave, but above a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, and how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.&#8221; Through regeneration Onesimus had become more than a slave and even more than a free man, for he had become a beloved brother. Now Onesimus had a relationship with Philemon &#8220;both in the flesh and in the Lord&#8221;: in the flesh as a slave and in the Lord as a brother. In the flesh Onesimus was a brother as a slave, and in the Lord he was a slave as a brother. Philemon, therefore, had to receive Onesimus and embrace him in a loving, intimate way. Of course, he was to receive him not in the old man, the old social system, but in Christ and in the new man. Although Onesimus was still Philemon&#8217;s slave, in Christ he had become Philemon&#8217;s brother. Now, in the new man, Philemon had to receive Onesimus as a brother and one of equal status. Here we see Paul&#8217;s recommendation of a brother for acceptance in the new man.<p>In the book of Philemon there is no mention of the expression &#8220;the new man.&#8221; But as we examine the situation portrayed in this book, we see that Paul was recommending a brother not to a local church in the city where he was at the time, but to a local church in a remote city. This indicates that Paul&#8217;s recommendation took place within the sphere of the new man. As we have already indicated, this can be proved by Colossians 3:11, where we are told that in the new man there is no bond or free. As Paul was writing to Philemon, he may have been thinking something like this: &#8220;Onesimus has become a dear brother in the Lord. Now I wish to recommend him, a slave, to a brother who is a free man. I want to help them both realize that as brothers they are equal. One should be received, and the other must be willing to receive him.&#8221; This is what I mean in saying that the Epistle to Philemon is an illustration of the equal status of the believers in the new man.<p>As long as we see that the believers have an equal status in the new man, there will be no problems among us concerning social rank, nationality, or race. We shall have no problems with different peoples. Those who discriminate among people in any way do not practice the proper church life. If we would have the genuine church life, we must receive all the saints regardless of race, nationality, or social rank. It is a fact that in many places believers are not willing to do this. As a result, they cannot have the proper church life.<p>We should never speak of a church according to race or color-there is no white church, yellow church, black church, or brown church. The church has only one color, and that color is heavenly blue. After you come into the church life, there must not be deep in your being any discrimination between believers on the basis of race or color. As long as such a discrimination exists within you, as far as you are concerned, you are nullifying the church life. The colors which represent the different races have already been nullified by the cross. Now we must be willing to pay the price to have them nullified in the real and genuine church life.<p>In society distinctions are still made on the basis of color, nationality, or social status. But no such distinctions can exist in the church, in the new man. The old man has been divided by these distinctions. But in the new man distinctions on the basis of color have been nullified. Paul strongly taught this, and we must consider it part of the full knowledge of the truth.<p>Again and again we have pointed out that in 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus the full knowledge of the truth concerns the content of God&#8217;s New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church. If we still make distinctions on the basis of color, race, or nationality, in this matter we are reprobate concerning the truth. We do not hold the full knowledge of the truth.<p>As a Jew, it was not easy for Paul to say that in the new man there cannot be any Jews. But because this was part of the full knowledge of the truth, he declared it plainly and taught it clearly. According to the full knowledge of the truth, in the universe there is one new man, one Body of Christ, and one church of God. Furthermore, there should be only one local church in a locality. We all need to realize this aspect of the truth.<p>According to the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty, the Epistle to Philemon was written before the Epistles to Timothy and Titus. But in the arrangement of the books in the New Testament, Philemon was placed at the end of this group of four books. These books reveal the practice of God&#8217;s New Testament economy, and Philemon shows us a particular aspect of that practice.<p>In the practice of the economy of God, it is crucial that all social ranks and differences among races and nations are swallowed up. If these ranks and distinctions are allowed to exist in the church life, the new man will be nullified, and the proper church life will be destroyed. How wonderful that in the New Testament there is a little book which tells us about a slave who was brought to the Lord and brought into the church life! If this book had told us that Caesar Nero had been saved, I would not appreciate it as much. But this book tells that a slave, one regarded by the Roman social system as little more than an animal with no legal rights, was saved. Some may think that it was not worthwhile for Paul to even write about him. Others may say that it is sufficient for a slave to be saved and to have the assurance of heaven. Paul, however, exercised great wisdom in writing this Epistle. Never has there been another letter written in this way.<p>Why did Paul exercise such a loving concern over a slave who had been saved? He did so because he was burdened to illustrate that among all the saints and all the local churches, the believers are equal in the new man. Onesimus and Philemon are a good illustration of this equality. Surely it was sovereign of God that Onesimus was saved in prison through Paul. It was the salvation of Onesimus that afforded Paul the opportunity to give such a marvelous illustration concerning the life of the new man. He could point out that a slave, then in Rome, and his master, far away in Colosse, were equal as believers in the new man.<p>Paul knew that, for the sake of his conscience, he had to care for Onesimus in a proper way. Paul knew Philemon and his family very well. Perhaps Paul said to himself, &#8220;Now Philemon&#8217;s slave has been saved through me. What shall I do with him? Shall I send him back to his master? And what shall I say to Philemon about Onesimus?&#8221; Actually, this was a very important matter, arranged sovereignly by the Lord. No other illustration could better portray the nullification of the difference of status in the new man. The case of Onesimus and Philemon illustrates to the uttermost that in the new man all the believers have an equal status. Oh, it is crucial that we see this! Praise the Lord for the salvation of Onesimus, and praise the Lord for this illustration of our equal status in the new man!<h2 class=head1>I. THE APOSTLE&#8217;S RECOMMENDATION</h2><p>In verse 17 Paul says to Philemon regarding Onesimus, &#8220;If then you hold me as a partner, receive him as myself.&#8221; The use of the word partner here indicates the deep relationship of fellowship in the Lord. Paul appealed to Philemon to receive Onesimus as if he were Paul himself. A local church with its elders is in partnership with the Lord, and the Lord entrusts the newly saved ones to them just as the good Samaritan entrusted the one he had rescued to the innkeeper (Luke 10:33-35).<h2 class=head1>II. THE APOSTLE&#8217;S PROMISE</h2><p>In verses 18 and 19 Paul continues, &#8220;And if he has wronged you in anything or owes anything, charge that to my account; I Paul have written with my own hand, I will repay; not to say to you that you owe me even your own self besides.&#8221; The phrase, &#8220;if he has wronged you in anything or owes anything,&#8221; indicates that Onesimus may have defrauded his master. Concerning this, Paul says, &#8220;Charge that to my account.&#8221; In caring for Onesimus, Paul did exactly what the Lord does for us. In verse 19 Paul says, &#8220;I will repay,&#8221; just as the Lord pays everything for His redeemed.<p>In verse 19 Paul also reminds Philemon, &#8220;You owe me even your own self besides.&#8221; This indicates that Philemon had been saved through Paul himself.<h2 class=head1>III. THE APOSTLE&#8217;S REQUEST AND CONFIDENCE</h2><p>In verse 20 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;Yes, brother, may I have profit from you in the Lord; refresh my inward parts in Christ.&#8221; The Greek word for profit here, onaimen, is an allusion to the name Onesimus. This is a play on words, implying that since Philemon owed Paul even himself, he was an Onesimus to Paul. Hence, Philemon should be profitable to Paul in the Lord.<p>In this verse Paul also asks Philemon to refresh his inward parts in Christ. The word for refresh means soothe, cheer. Literally, the Greek word rendered inward parts means bowels, as in verse 7. Since Philemon refreshed the inward parts of the saints, his partner asks him now to do the same for him in the Lord.<p>In verses 21 and 22 Paul says, &#8220;Having confidence in your obedience, I wrote to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say. And at the same time also prepare me a lodging; for I hope that through your prayers I shall be graciously given to you.&#8221; Paul&#8217;s expectation that he would be liberated from his imprisonment and visit the churches again is also expressed in Philippians 1:25 and 2:24. Paul considered his visit a gracious gift to the church.<h2 class=head1>IV. THE CONCLUSION</h2><p>In verses 23 through 25 we have the conclusion of this Epistle: &#8220;Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you; as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.&#8221; The apostle always greeted the recipients of his Epistles, both in the opening and in the conclusion, with the grace of the Lord. This shows that he trusted in the Lord&#8217;s grace for them, as well as for himself (1 Cor. 15:10), to accomplish what he wrote to them. No human effort avails for the accomplishment of such a high revelation as the completing revelation of the Apostle Paul.</body></html>
