   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LESSON SEVEN KNOWING THE TRUE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God is the foremost item revealed in the Bible because He is the beginning of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everything in the universe originated from Him and began with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is also the main content of the Bible from its first book to the last.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He created us and regenerated us and has everything to do with our life and our being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, we should know Him first.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I. ALL IDOLS BEING FALSE GODS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1 "Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not: they have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not: they have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat neither is there any breath in their mouths" Psa 115:4-7; 135:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to these verses, all idols are false and are not the true God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2 "We know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For if even there are so-called gods even as there are many gods and many lords, yet to us there is one God" 1 Cor 8:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These verses clearly state that since God is the true God, the one unique God, all the idols are nothing and the so-called gods are not God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>3 "Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of them that hate me" Exo 20:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse also tells us that the one and only true God is a jealous God who hates all the idols and will punish the sin of idol worship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE UNIQUE TRUE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>1 "I am Jehovah, and there is none else, there is no God beside me" Isa 45:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2 "Now to the King of the ages, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory unto the ages of the ages" 1 Tim 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3 "How you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God" 1 Thes 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These three verses clearly and emphatically reveal to us how God is the unique Jehovah, incorruptible, invisible, and existing unto eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Besides Him, there is not another true God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>ELOHIM THE FAITHFUL MIGHTY ONE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>1 "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" Gen 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here in Hebrew, the word for God is Elohim.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the first divine title used in the Bible to reveal God, and it means the faithful mighty One.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It shows that the true God, whom we worship according to the Bible, is not only mighty but also faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is the mighty One; so He could create the heavens, the earth, all things, and mankind, calling what is not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is faithful; therefore, He is dependable, ever unchanging, and immovable.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His works according to His faithfulness are as enduring as the sun and as established as the moon Psa 89:33-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>JEHOVAH THE SELF-EXISTING AND EVER-EXISTING I AM</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>1 "And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM THE SELF-EXISTING AND EVER-EXISTING ONE Jehovah God this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations" Exo 3:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here God told Moses in plain words that His name is Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The name Jehovah is the second main divine title used by the Bible in revealing God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It means the self-existing and ever-existing I Am, the I Am who was, who is, and who is to come.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It indicates that He is the I Am, and besides Him nothing is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only He is, and He is the self-existing and ever-existing I Am, who was, who is, and who is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, everything in the entire universe is vain and is not; only He is, only He exists forever, and only He is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is everything to the people whom He created and who belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whatever they need, He is.</S>
