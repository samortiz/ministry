   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE SERPENT AND THE BRIDE 2 Scripture Reading: John 3:9-16, 22-36</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is according to the Scriptures to speak of the serpent and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may say that, considered as a whole, the Bible unveils to us the matter of the serpent and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some Christians may say that they have never heard that the Bible tells us about the serpent and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They know that the Bible reveals God the Creator, and it also reveals Christ, our Redeemer, Savior, and Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is, of course, correct to say that the Bible reveals God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, this may be a rather superficial understanding of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is superficial to see merely that Jesus Christ is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we have a deeper understanding of the Word, we shall see that Christ was also a brass serpent 3:14 , a serpent in form but without the poisonous nature of a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, it is because Christ became a brass serpent that He could be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If He had not become such a brass serpent, He could not have been our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 1:29 speaks of Christ as the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if we go deeper into the Word, we shall see that the Lamb of God in 1:29 is the brass serpent in 3:14.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lamb satisfies the requirements of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory, for the Lamb is pure, perfect, and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The brass serpent represents us, for we are serpentine people, not lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the Lord was speaking to Nicodemus, He indicated to him that He Himself would be lifted up as the brass serpent to be Nicodemus' Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the Lamb of God satisfies God's requirements, and the brass serpent represents us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because we are serpentine and are not lambs, we need Christ as the brass serpent to be our Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This brass serpent is the real sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE IMPORTANCE OF EVE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The story of the Bible is a story of the serpent and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Genesis 2 we have the bride, and in Genesis 3 we have the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The serpent did not come to contact the man, but he contacted the woman, the bride in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God had indicated that it was not good for Adam to live alone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If Adam had remained alone, nothing could have been produced for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God needs a people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without a wife, Adam could not have produced this people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, God increased Adam with a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We know that Eve was not a separate creation, having nothing to do with Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, Eve was made from a part of Adam's being, from his rib.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At first Adam was alone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then God used Adam's rib to bring forth the increase of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The result was a couple to produce a people for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eve, therefore, is vital and crucial in fulfilling God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The sisters are very important in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In a sense, the sisters are more vital and necessary for the fulfillment of God's purpose than the brothers are.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the reason the old serpent often comes to visit the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are his special food.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Genesis 3 the serpent visited the bride and succeeded in capturing her.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then through the woman he also gained the man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But God is greater, higher, and wiser than the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In His judgment upon the serpent, God indicated that the woman would bring forth a seed to bruise the serpent's head: "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel" Gen 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, there is an indication in Genesis 3:21 that the seed of the woman would not only bruise the head of the serpent, but also become righteousness to the very ones who were poisoned by him: "Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These coats of skins typify Christ as righteousness for fallen man.</S>
