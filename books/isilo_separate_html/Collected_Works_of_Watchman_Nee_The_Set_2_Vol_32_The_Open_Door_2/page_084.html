My trip from Yunnan to Shanghai via Hong Kong was tiring. After arriving in Shanghai, many affairs were waiting to be handled. On top of this, we had ten days of meetings for the sisters. Moreover, I had to wait for news from the brothers and sisters in Hunan and Hankow before I could proceed with the next issue. Consequently, Issue No. 14 has been delayed again and again. Of course, this was not the main reason for the delay. Many times, as I was starting to edit, something within me urged me to wait a little. Today I know that this waiting has not been in vain. I thank the Lord for this!</p><p>(2) I have prayed again and again about which letters to publish and which not to publish. If there is any impurity in the heart and if the news is not accurate, we will not have God's blessing. Consequently, I have done this work in fear and trembling.</p><p>(3) Recently, we heard that some brothers and sisters have been called to serve the Lord full-time. Of course, we have to thank the Lord for this, but they have to be tested. A man should be clear himself as to whether or not he has been called and what ministry he has received from the Lord. As for us, we can only express what we feel (whether or not we are sympathetic) after we have observed and seen the fruit. This expression from us does not mean that we have any authority at all; it is merely an objective comment. The most important thing is each person's own relationship with the Lord.</p><p>(4) During these perilous end times, there are men who will not maintain respectable work, and there are men who will use godliness as a means for base gain. If we are not discerning and allow these men to come in or recommend them to others, the churches of God will suffer loss. I hope that the churches everywhere will learn of the church in Ephesus: "You cannot bear evil men; and you have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false." I hope they will also learn of the discerning ones in Smyrna, who knew of "the slander from those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan." A man is not something just because he calls himself such; we have to test such a one. If anyone wants to recommend anyone else, he must be very careful. "And we sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the churches, and not only this, but who has also been selected by the churches as our fellow traveler....And we sent with them our brother, whom we have proved to be diligent in many things many times..." (2 Cor. 8:18-19, 22). This is a good example of the way to recommend others. A genuinely good brother or an apostle used by the Lord will not become something that he is not just by moving to another place. The environment often only reveals man's real condition.</p><p>(5) During this critical period, it is right for all the churches to do their best to provide hospitality for the visiting believers and those who are fleeing from tribulation. But not everyone for whom we have provided hospitality can be recommended. In the past we have published the names of some people because we have received letters from the places where they come from or have passed through. We do this also to relieve the concern of many caring ones. Unfortunately, some have tried to use our publication for their own goal. This is too much of a shame to the testimony! Some do not know the flesh and engage in fleshly activities! How our heart aches over such things! We wish that God would use and bless those brothers and sisters who are pure and who fear the Lord. We are more than willing to testify for them. But if we see that some have other motives, not hating sin and not judging their flesh, how can our conscience allow us to recommend them? If we have offended anyone because of this, we do it out of compulsion. What else can we say except ask for them to excuse us?</p><p>(6) Since the time the co-workers have been paying attention to the work in the inland regions or frontier regions, we thank the Lord that much sympathy has been aroused. But we wish the co-workers in the inland regions or the frontier regions would take note of one thing: Some may write to you and tell you that they have the calling and the burden, and they may ostentatiously say that they have seen the truth of the church or that they are taking the way of the cross. You cannot consider them workers just by words in letters. If you do not know them, and no one has recommended them in a solid way, you have to pray and investigate much. Even if you have seen them face to face, you must still test them. As far as we know, two persons have written to the workers in Yunnan, indicating that they want to go to Yunnan. Fortunately, they did not go. One of these two has always been unruly and full of lies. The other one was excommunicated from being a preacher. Some have even said that the second one was accused of selling opium and had been in jail. It is a small thing to inflate numbers and reports, but it is a great thing when evil behavior ill-affects the work. Therefore, we have to point this out in a frank way.</p><p>(7) God has done more than what we ask or think in supplying the needs of the saints who became needy through the war. In Issue No. 13 we said in the "Letter on Behalf of the Editor" that the saints in Hunan and Szechuan province have mostly been taken care of. After that word was published, Yueh-Yang capitulated and Ch'ang-sha had a great fire. Reports of danger also came from Yi-Yang and Ch'ang-Teh. I was almost unable to sleep or eat, and I could only call on God. Thank the Lord that at such a critical juncture, one brother from Chefoo and a few co-workers in Chuenchow sent some money. According to their designation, not only was there enough money to relieve the brothers in Hunan province, but we were able to render help to other places as well. At that time I was in K'un-ming and did not know the whereabouts of the brothers in Ch'ang-sha, Yi-Yang, and Ch'ang-Teh. After much prayer I sent the money to Yi-Yang and asked a few trustworthy brothers to distribute it. I found out later that the brothers had left Yi-Yang, and I was condemned, thinking that the money was lost. Yet I recalled that this was what I felt should have been done in the first place, and then I felt peaceful about it. If you read Brother Kuo Jen-yung's letter in this issue, you will see that God demonstrated special grace in this matter, and I can only thank Him with all of my heart!</p><p>(8) Presently, the mail between Shanghai and Hankow is clear again. Recently some brothers arrived in Shanghai from Shu County. According to their report, everyone is safe with the exception of Brother Lee Teh-shiu, who left a while ago and has not sent back any news. There is no news yet from the brothers in Kuling. Although there have been bombings in Kuei-yang, Brother Liu Yu-chuan wrote to say that all the saints were safe. Thank the Lord. All the offerings that we have received from various places have been sent to their designated place if they have been so designated. If they have not been designated, we have sent them to places where the needs are the greatest. As far as we know, Hunan province is in more trouble than other places. Szechuan and Hankow provinces are tolerable. Many in Tai-Shan, Kwangtung, have lost their jobs. Kuei-yang already has a high cost of living. After the recent bombing, demand has exceeded supply, and the situation has become even more difficult. We have to investigate the situation thoroughly before we send them relief. In the past the amounts of money sent to the various places have not been large. In consideration of the practical situation in various places, we have always entrusted the distribution to reliable local brothers. We thank the Lord with all our heart for everything in the past, and we look to the Lord for everything in the future! On the one hand, we ask God to care for the brothers who are truly in need and to open up ways for them. On the other hand, we ask God to bless those who are offering in secret and giving in private! As for me, I receive with one hand and give out with the other. Yet I am always afraid that I do not do a good job or that my work will become unacceptable to the saints. May the Lord be merciful to me so that I would carry out the work faithfully through the prayers of many.</p><p>Ruth Lee in Shanghai, February 6, 1939</p><p>We have already run out of Issue Nos. 1, 8&mdash;10, and 12 of this magazine. We apologize for not being able to send back issues to those who have asked for them. There is still a limited number of the other issues. We will send them out until we run out.</p><h2 class="head1">OTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS<br />AND ADDRESSES OF CHURCHES</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_083.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_085.html">Next</a> </body></html>
