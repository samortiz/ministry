   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If we were writing this psalm, perhaps we would add a parentheses at this point: "How pitiful that man has fallen and sinned and been cast out of the garden of Eden!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>No more can man attain to this."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But thank God, in the heart of the psalmist there was not such a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In God's view the earth can still be restored, the position given to man by God still exists, and His commitment to man to destroy the work of the devil still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, starting from the third verse, the psalmist again narrates the same old story, completely ignoring the third chapter of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the outstanding feature of Psalm 8.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's purpose is for man to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Is man worthy?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But since God's purpose is for man to rule, man will surely rule.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 9 the psalmist again says,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>O Jehovah our Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How excellent is Your name</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In all the earth!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He continues to praise, as though he were not even aware of man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Though Adam had sinned and Eve had also sinned, they could never withstand God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man can fall and man can sin, but man cannot overthrow the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even after man fell, God's will toward man remained the same.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God still requires man to overthrow the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Oh, what an unchangeable God He is!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His way is unswerving and utterly straightforward.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must realize that God can never be overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this world there are some who receive many hard blows, but no one has been attacked daily and received continual blasts like God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet His will has never been overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What God was before man's fall, He is after man's fall and after sin entered into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The decision He affirmed aforetime is still His decision today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He has never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>HEBREWS 2</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Genesis 1 speaks of the will of God at creation, Psalm 8 speaks of God's will after man's fall, and Hebrews 2 speaks of God's will in redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let us look at Hebrews 2.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will see that in the victory of redemption God still desires man to obtain authority and deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verses 5 through 8a the writer says, "For it was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth, concerning which we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But one has solemnly testified somewhere, saying, What is man, that You bring him to mind?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Or the son of man, that You care for him?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You have made Him a little inferior to the angels; You have crowned Him with glory and honor and have set Him over the works of Your hands; You have subjected all things under His feet' quoted from Psalm 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For in subjecting all things to Him, He left nothing unsubject to Him."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All things must be subject to man; God purposed it from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But it has not yet turned out in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The writer continues, "But now we do not yet see all things subjected to Him, but we see Jesus, who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>8b-9a .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Jesus is the person who fits this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Psalm 8 said that God made man a little lower than the angels, but the apostle changed the word "man" into "Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He explained that "man" refers to Jesus; it was Jesus who became a little lower than the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Man's redemption is by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God originally purposed that man should be a little lower than the angels and that man should be crowned and rule over all His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He intended for man to exercise authority on His behalf to cast out His enemy from the earth and from the heaven related to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He wanted man to destroy all of Satan's power.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But man fell and did not take his place to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus came and took upon Him a body of flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He became the "last Adam" 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
