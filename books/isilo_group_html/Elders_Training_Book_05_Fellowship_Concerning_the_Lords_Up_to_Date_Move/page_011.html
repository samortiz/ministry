WITH THE MAJOR TRUTHS</h2>
<p>Let us now consider the practicality of being constituted with the truth. The highest truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the truth concerning the Trinity. This is the highest truth of the Bible. The first noun used as a subject in the Bible is God. &ldquo;In the beginning God created&rdquo; (Gen. 1:1). &ldquo;God&rdquo; in this verse indicates the Trinity since the Hebrew word for God (Elohim) is plural in number. In that same chapter God said to Himself, &ldquo;Let us (plural) make man in our image&rdquo; (v. 26). The Trinity is also here. Also, the structure of the entire New Testament is the Triune God. This is the highest truth. Because this truth is mysterious, however, it is hard for people to apprehend. For this reason, clever people try their best to avoid it. However, years ago in the recovery the Lord began to show us that the Trinity is not just a doctrinal matter. The Trinity is for us to enjoy our very God. &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all&rdquo; (2 Cor. 13:14). This is not a doctrine, but the very Trinity for you to enjoy&mdash;Christ, God, and the Spirit. This one verse involves these three divine Persons. Many Christians only have an objective Triune God far away from them. They do not care for the experience of the Triune God, yet they use 2 Corinthians 13:14 as a benediction given on Sunday mornings.</p>
<p>The Lord has shown us that the divine Trinity is not for doctrine. He is for our enjoyment, and He has begun to bring us into the enjoyment of Himself. Since the recovery came to this country and I began to minister, many messages have been given on this one thing. Some even consider that the divine Trinity is my hobby. Though I have spoken much and have printed many messages, I am a little concerned for you brothers. I doubt that many of you have entered into the complete truth of the divine Trinity.</p>
<p>As a young boy the first time I ever went to any kind of Christian chapel was on Christmas eve. The first thing I saw was Santa Claus and some &ldquo;big socks,&rdquo; Christmas stockings. My mother told me that was the celebration of Christmas concerning the Lord&rsquo;s birth. She had already told me how Jesus was born of a virgin and how He was put into a manger. In all of Christianity they celebrate the Lord&rsquo;s birth and they teach the Lord&rsquo;s birth, but nearly no one has ever studied what the conception is. In our training on Luke we defined how the conception was initiated by the divine element entering into the womb of the human virgin to be mingled with the human element. Eventually what was born was a God-man, born of two elements, the divine and the human. Things like this we have studied and have put in writing. Suppose you would be asked what the conception of Jesus Christ is. You may say, &ldquo;Well, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit in a virgin.&rdquo; Then some thoughtful person would ask, &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; You might answer, &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s hard to say.&rdquo; This is not the adequate answer. We are talking about the incarnation of the Triune God. We have to know how He was incarnated and we have to teach people. This has very much to do with the laying of a good foundation for the saints to enjoy the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>Even as a young boy, I was told by my mother that Jesus was so good, that He did a lot of miracles, and that He was so humble and meek. But nearly no one, according to my knowledge, ever studied the human living of Jesus. Was that a man&rsquo;s living or was that God&rsquo;s living? If you say that was God&rsquo;s living, then I would ask, &ldquo;What kind of God? Was that just the Son or the Father or the Spirit?&rdquo; By His mercy we have studied to such an extent that we can say that His living was the living of a God-man who is the Son of God with the Father by the Spirit. Just these two prepositional phrases, &ldquo;with the Father&rdquo; and &ldquo;by the Spirit&rdquo; require at least one week of study. You have to find the verses that prove that when Jesus was living on this earth, even as a carpenter in a poor house, He lived as the Son with the Father (John 8:16, 29; 16:32). You also have to be able to prove that He lived by the Spirit (Matt. 4:1; 12:28; Luke 4:18a). There is the need of such a thorough study of the holy Word.</p>
<p>Then, when He reached the age of thirty and before He began to minister, He was baptized. After being baptized in water He stood up, the Holy Spirit as a dove descended upon Him, and the Father spoke from the heavens (Matt. 3:16-17). Was Jesus not conceived of the Holy Spirit? Was He not born of the Holy Spirit? Then why at His baptism did the Holy Spirit descend upon Him and the Father speak from the heavens? It is not so easy to answer this question. But thank the Lord, in His mercy He showed us. In His light we have picked up two terms, the essential Trinity and the economical Trinity. The Lord Jesus was born of the Spirit essentially, but the Spirit&rsquo;s descending upon Him and the Father&rsquo;s speaking from above was something economical.</p>
<p>Then following this, He worked in the same way as He lived&mdash;with the Father by the Spirit. Then He went to the cross. Who went to the cross? Who died there? Who was crucified? Who was nailed on the cross? Could God be nailed there? On what basis could you have the boldness to tell people God was crucified there? Acts 20:28 says that God obtained the church with His own blood. If God never died on the cross how could He shed His blood? You may say that you cannot understand this. Actually, there are many things that we cannot understand. Even you cannot understand yourself. You cannot understand the food you eat every day. Do not take the excuse that you cannot understand. That God has shed His blood is a fact recorded in the Bible.</p>
<p>First John 1:7 speaks of &ldquo;the blood of Jesus His Son.&rdquo; The blood is of a person with two elements. As Jesus, He is a person who is constituted with the human element. As the Son of God He is constituted with the divine element. Without the divine element His redemption could never be eternal, and the efficacy of the power of His redemption would not be insured. As a man He could only die for one person, but as the eternal God with the eternal element, His death is for millions of people. His death is an eternal death, His redemption an eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12). He was dying with the eternal, divine element. Hebrews 9:14 tells us that He offered Himself through the eternal Spirit. What does this mean? Is this the eternal essential Spirit or the eternal economical Spirit?</p>
<p>We need to jump out of the shallow way of understanding the truth. We should not be those &ldquo;skating on the ice&rdquo; of the truth. We need to break the ice and get into the depths of the truth. This requires much labor. You need to study the Bible, to study the proper reference books, and to study thousands of pages in the Life-study Messages. You need to study the messages, not just to read through them as if you were reading a newspaper. You have a good heart to put the Life-studies on your shelves, but what has entered into you? What has been constituted into your being?</p>
<p>In the last chapter of Revelation the Lord told us He would come soon (Rev. 22:12). Two thousand years have passed, and He has not come yet. Who delayed Him? We delayed Him. The believers delayed Him by ignorance, by not having a full knowledge of the truth. Under the ignorance of all the believers, the Lord just could not find a way to go on. This ignorance is still prevailing today. Darkness is everywhere. Where is the sky clear and where is the real enlightenment? There may be a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of excitement, but no light. This kind of excitement is under darkness, and anything that is under darkness is nonsense.</p>
<p>According to this present situation the Lord nearly has no way to go on. The first thing He has to do is to shine. In His old creation, the first item He brought in was light. &ldquo;Let there be light&rdquo; (Gen. 1:3). We need the enlightenment. His word is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path (Psa. 119:105) and the entrance of His words gives light (Psa. 119:130). We need much proper apprehension of the word of the truth which is the real light to us. We need the enlightenment; then we could see the real significance of His incarnation, of His human living, and of His death. On the cross He died an all-inclusive death with seven aspects. (See message 53 of the Life-study of Luke, pp. 459-462). Could you speak this without any preparation? To do this you need a constitution of all these points of the truth. Then it is so easy for you to present the seven aspects of the all-inclusive death of Christ.</p>
<p>Instead of caring for this we may care for the shallow things, the superficial things. Who cares for the deep things today? Saints, are we really in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? Do we really mean business? If so, then why do we not have any interest in these deeper things of the divine economy? It is not a small matter to know the death of Christ in an all-inclusive way, but who would labor to study these things? Actually, someone has labored already. All these matters have been put into print. It only requires you to have a heart to spend about twenty minutes, then you would get every aspect of this all-inclusive death constituted into your being. You read about the aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s death in the Life-studies but nothing is left within you. These things come and go. This is the tragedy in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Anyone who teaches without the proper knowledge of the truth will make a lot of trouble. After having cataracts and cataract surgery twice I am now unqualified to drive a car. If you ask me to drive, I will drive in a nonsensical way. For you to travel to various places to minister the Word without the proper knowledge of the truth is like a blind man driving a car. You are traveling and doing the work, but you do not know how much damage you have caused. You are enthusiastic to do the work of the Lord, but how do you do the work? With what do you do the work? What do you preach? What do you teach? These are big questions.</p>
<p>In the same principle, what do the responsible ones teach the saints in their locality? I would propose that we all take care of and study three items. The first is the Triune God embodied in Christ, and the Spirit being His realization and also the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. The second is the seven major steps taken by our Triune God: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, breathing the Spirit, ascension, and pouring out the Spirit. Then, let us study as the third item the finalization of the intensification of the Triune God as the sevenfold intensified Spirit. I hope that all the elders would be constituted with these truths. Then we could be apt to teach these things. This does not mean that we no longer need the lessons for the new beginners. We are still bringing forth a number of new ones so we need lessons for them. Brothers, will you take this proposal? I assure you that it will cost you at least two or three months to get into these major and basic truths.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 05: Fellowship Concerning the Lord's Up-to-Date Move &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
