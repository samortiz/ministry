   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We see in the Bible one example of acting in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the archangel Michael argued with the devil over the body of Moses, did he say, "I rebuke you" or "May the Lord rebuke you"?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you add the word may, it becomes a prayer and a wish.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No, the archangel said, "The Lord rebuke you"!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jude 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that for him to rebuke the devil is for the Lord to rebuke him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The archangel Michael applied the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, being in the name of the Lord Jesus does not necessarily mean saying the words "in the name of the Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Doing things in the name of the Lord Jesus means that we use His name as we use our own name.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we touch a very important spiritual principle: we can use the Lord's name as we use our own name.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many people say that they have not exhausted the power in the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I would say rather that we have not exhausted the power in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul could say to the Corinthians, "I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Further on, he said, "I think that I also have the Spirit of God" 1 Cor 7:25, 40 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to see that this name is a name that we can use.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers and sisters, do you realize that here is a name, an authority, and a power that have been placed in the hand of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church can use them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church should use the Lord's name in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We say that the church reigns.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But without the name, there would be no way that the church could reign.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We say that the church holds the key to the kingdom and is responsible for bringing in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But without the name, the gate of the kingdom could not be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We say that God's intention is for the church to bind up death through life and bind up Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet if we did not have this name or did not know how to use this name, there would be no way for us to accomplish these things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to see that the Lord Jesus has given this name to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why God charges that a man must be baptized after he has believed in the Lord and is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is coming into the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the day I was baptized, I began to share this name.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From that day on, God committed this name to me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I can use the Lord Jesus' name as I use my own name.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why baptism is such a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the spiritual reality, I am a dead man and I am also a resurrected man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since I am standing on the ground of death and resurrection, I can use the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From that day, I became related to His name.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is Christ, and we are the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church is just a group of people on earth who can use the Lord's name, and God takes responsibility for their action every time they use that name.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In whatever way we use this name, God will take responsibility for it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a tremendous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our relationship with the Lord's name began at the time of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are baptized into the name.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In other words, through baptism we enter into the name.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here we see that the cross and resurrection are two indispensable things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only by standing on the ground of baptism can we use the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are not standing on the ground of baptism, we cannot use His name, because the cross will not have a free way in us, and the Lord Jesus will not have any effect on us; we cannot use the name.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even if we use the name, God will not take responsibility for it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must stand on the ground of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The ground of baptism means that we believe in the fact of the cross and believe that the old man is crucified with Christ; we accept the principle of the cross and receive the cross as something that deals with our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Baptism tells us that everything we have must go through death daily.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only that which remains after passing through death has spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If something is gone after it passes through death, it will not stand before God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God wants the things that pass through the cross and remain, the things that are not destroyed after death has done its work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God's children need to see the fact of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need God to reveal what we have received in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The day must come when the Lord breaks the backbone of our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only then will we become useful.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The day must come when God sees the mark of the cross in us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In many people, it does not seem as if the cross has done any work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It does not seem as if the cross has done any work in their speech, in the way they work, in their feeling, and particularly in their attitude before God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The day must come when God breaks and destroys such a person by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only that which remains after the cross is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Resurrection is that which is not terminated through death; it is that which is not annihilated through death.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Resurrection is what remains after a person is smitten by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Only those who stand on such a ground can exercise the Lord's authority, and only they can use the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God assumes responsibility for those who stand on this ground, and He is behind them when they use the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Brothers and sisters, this is the greatest commitment in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God can commit His Son's name to us and allow us to use this name as our own.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is too great a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God has to assume tremendous responsibility in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is, indeed, not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we do things in the Lord's name, what result will this name bring?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Bible shows us that there are three results of acting in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The first relates to man, the second to the devil, and the third to God.</S>
