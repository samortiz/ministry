<h2 class="head1">NEWS CONCERNING THE MEETING<br />IN P'U T'IEN, FUKIEN PROVINCE</h2><h2 class="head2">Its Beginning, History, and Most Recent Condition</h2><p>To all the brothers and sisters who have received</p><p>the same gracious calling in the Lord:</p><p>Grace to you and peace from our Father God and the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord Christ loves us, died and rose for us, obeyed the Father's will, and delivered us from so great a perdition; He is still saving us and will save us in the future. Therefore, we should give praise, honor, glory, and authority to the Lamb upon the throne forever and ever, amen.</p><p>We praise the Lord that despite the failure in the garden of Eden, there is the victory on Calvary. Although Jerusalem is desolated, Zion has already been raised up. The number meeting in the Lord's name in P'u T'ien is very small, and the work is still young, but each believer has had the experience of coming out of death into life, and there is much to tell about the marvelous things which the Lord has done in this locality. Therefore, we now want to report the news concerning this assembly through Collection of Newsletters to the brothers and sisters who care about us. We hope that each reader prays earnestly and much before the Lord for us humble and weak ones, asking the Lord to grace and protect us and to give us the leading of the Holy Spirit as we walk in His way so that we would obey His will and serve Him faithfully until the day of His coming, amen.</p><h2 class="head2">The Beginning</h2><p>In the very beginning there was only a group of women meeting in a sister's house. No men attended the meetings (unless there was a special meeting). Later, the Lord's servants came to preach the Word a few times, and the Holy Spirit of the Lord worked at the same time. A few people in the denominations were touched to know the gospel and to be saved clearly. All the believers felt that there was the need for a brothers' meeting to be raised up. They prayed in one accord to give this matter to the Lord who bears our burdens. Thank and praise the Lord, He heard the petitions of His children and led His servant, our dear Brother Faithful Luk, to move here with his family at the Lord's appointed time (1932) to be responsible for the Lord's work. Before Brother Lu arrived, the believers asked the Lord to arrange and prepare the place and building for a meeting (because there are many denominational chapels, and they are very pretty outwardly). Thank the Lord, His will can never be wrong. What He prepares will always come to pass. He finishes what He has begun. The Lord chose an appropriate location for us and a very good building. (It is at our present address, 6 Riverside.) This place is one where those who love the denominations dare not come. It is a house where the superstitious people in the area dare not live. Nevertheless, our Head, Christ, is the victorious Lord, the Lord of peace. He surprisingly has led us from past to present in this terrible environment. He is also the eternally unchanging God. We deeply believe that He can look after and protect us to the end. After the meeting place was decided upon and the Lord's servant came, we began meeting with the brothers and sisters in one accord in the winter of 1932. We established the Lord's table at the same time, and the lampstand of the truth began to shine forth. The trumpet of the gospel also was blown. This good work was begun by the Lord Himself. Glory to His holy name, amen.</p><p>During the first Saturday afternoon Bible study meeting, Brother Luk began by reading the passage in Acts 16:11-15 where it says, "We went..by the river, where we supposed there would be a place of prayer" (v. 13), and also "a certain woman named Lydia." She was the first believing sister in that locality, and she also led her whole household to be baptized into the Lord (vv. 14-15). Brother Luk read this passage which seems to be just like the beginning of the meeting here in our locality. Our meeting place is also right beside the river, and the first believers were a group of sisters who loved the Lord fervently (we are referring to the believers who have fellowship with us).</p><h2 class="head2">The History</h2><p>We thank the Lord for leading us step by step so that we could pass our days in His grace. With regard to the news of the meeting, I think that the brothers and sisters are happy to hear it, so we must tell you something of the condition of our history. We hope you will continue to pray for us constantly. We have told you how the meeting was started. There are a few points to mention concerning our history.</p><h2 class="head3">The Times and Nature of the Meetings</h2><p>There is a Lord's table and worship meeting every Lord's Day morning at 9:00. We continue with all the brothers mutually exhorting each other in Christ. At 2:30 p.m. we proclaim the truth of the gospel. (In addition to the responsible workers, the brothers also testify or preach the message.) On Wednesday afternoons at 2:30, there is a sisters' meeting. On Wednesday evening at 7:00, there is a brothers' meeting. On Saturday afternoon at 2:30, there is a prayer and Bible-study meeting. On the first Tuesday of every month, there is a combined meeting with the believers in Han Chiang (about twenty miles from here) that is an all-day prayer meeting. Whenever a brother or co-worker from another locality comes here, there are also conferences or other special meetings.</p>
