If someone who serves the Lord desires to minister to others in a practical way in the service, he must have some spiritual experience
The reason we cannot minister life richly to others is because what we have as our inner content is too immature
If we merely minister to others the spiritual knowledge that is in our mind, then what we minister will be merely doctrine and not life
As a result, when people come in contact with you, they will be able to sense your freshness and receive your supply
It is quite possible that because your spirit is joyful, fresh, and lively, you will be able to stir people up whenever you contact them
It is as if consecration is in our blood to the extent that it could be detected in us through analytical tests
When we minister to others, we cannot just repeatedly cause them to feel refreshed within without planting something real into them
For this reason, in our daily life we must learn something of life and have spiritual experiences step by step
Only in this way will we be those who truly live a life of consecration and who are able to minister the reality of consecration to others
Without learning we will not have anything stored up within us, and without anything stored up within us, our inner content will not be rich
Have we merely given him 'sunlight' and 'air,' or have we given him the most important thing-the seed of life?
At most, this is just like having the right kind of environment-like the air that a seed needs in order to grow
We must also have the seed, and how much real seed we have altogether depends on how much learning and experience we have in our daily life
After gaining this spiritual reality, when we meet people with problems, we will be able to minister to these people what we have learned
What we give them will not only create the right environment within them, but it will be a life that is solid and able to help them
In other words, if we do not experience the breaking of the cross, then when we visit someone, there will be no change in his condition
At present the majority of the work that most of us are doing is still the stirring up of the proper environment within people
Although it is necessary to stir up the environment, we also must be prepared to sow the things of life into people after we do this
For this reason we must look to the Lord that we would not just be excited for a moment but exercised every moment of every day
Solomon's prayer was pleasing to the Lord, and because Solomon did not pray for longevity or wealth for himself, God answered his petition
When the Lord returns, we will all see that what we were doing was much higher and weightier than what the kings on the earth were doing
Today many people in Christian denominations and organizations hold only the faith but do not hold the mystery of the faith
On the one hand we should have the experience and on the other hand we must have the biblical truths as the confirmation of our experience
When we encounter a difficult matter in our service in the church, how should we discuss it and make a decision concerning it?
Should the matter be settled by one person's word, or should it be decided by everyone expressing his opinion and then taking a vote?
In the Catholic Church only what the pope says matters whereas in the Protestant churches it is what the majority says that counts
The Holy Spirit operates in the church, and the church makes its decisions according to and along with the Holy Spirit
Neither is it decided by all the members praying until the Holy Spirit speaks forth the Lord's intention through someone as a prophet
Just as the elders clearly understand the situation in a locality, so the apostles clearly understand the situations in various localities
Through fellowship they present what they understand and have observed concerning what God has done in the saints in various places
Sometimes in the meetings of the elders and coworkers the majority of those in the meeting may not say anything as if they have no opinions
After the meeting, however, one person may say one thing while another person may say another thing, and all their opinions come out
Such a person avoids speaking in the meeting in order to save his face, because he is afraid that he might not speak well
One is when much discussion had taken place , and the other is for it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us
We should be delivered from our flesh and come together to discuss matters without insisting on our own personal preferences
Whether they are elders or deacons as long as they have any inner sense concerning the matter being discussed they should speak out clearly
When we learn to speak in this way, the Chinese should not have Chinese views, and the foreigners should not have foreigners' views
In Acts 15 when many people were discussing, Peter spoke not according to his own opinion but according to the Lord's work
He rose up and said, 'Men, brothers, you know that from the early days God chose from among you that through my mouth '
In Acts we see that after Peter had spoken, there was no solution, and after Paul had finished speaking, there was still no solution
One said that God gave grace to the Gentiles through him, and the other also said that God gave grace to the Gentiles through him
All those who were present in that gathering spoke thoroughly concerning what they saw related to God's work in this matter
We see that in the discussion they did not speak according to their own feelings but according to the result of God's work
Neither should the elders make decisions by getting the consent of the majority of the saints when they are unsure of what to do
The administration of the church does not depend upon the opinion of one individual or upon the opinion of the majority
Before the Lord and according to these feelings we should make a decision under the principles shown in the holy Scriptures
In order to have a proper administration of the church we need to put aside our flesh, opinions, narrowness, negligence, and carelessness
It is best not to talk to others about matters in the administration of the church before the matters are decided
If we all would understand this limitation and hold on to it, then there would be no gossiping, no scandals, and no problems in the church
All the saints in coordination must learn not to lightly make decisions on their own concerning matters about which they are not clear
For important matters we surely need to seek fellowship from others and find a way to solve the problem together before the Lord
The extent of our awareness of church affairs also shows the extent of our learning and of our being restricted before God
Under normal circumstances, a person who has been baptized and has entered into the church life must be perfected in these three matters
They must live in fellowship with the Lord, continually learning how to carry out this service in a proper way
If we want to help people advance in life, first we need to help them have an accurate understanding of the matter of salvation
Although a person may have already been baptized and received into the church, he still must begin with the matter of knowing his salvation
If a person does not have a thorough understanding of his salvation, then it will be difficult for him to advance in life
How do we help others have a proper understanding of salvation based upon the holy Scriptures so that they may establish a firm foundation?
We must have a basic knowledge of the Bible, and then we must lead them to the proper understanding step by step
In order to help him, we may open to Mark 16:16 and ask him to read it: 'He who believes and is baptized shall be saved'
We can ask him to read Matthew 24:35, where the Lord Jesus said, 'Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away'
If he says that he is clear, then we have to ask again, 'The Lord said that 'He who believes and is baptized shall be saved'
We can tell him, 'Since you have believed and have also been baptized, are you saved according to the Lord's word'?
We can ask him again, 'Did the Lord say here that he who believes and is baptized and who feels it shall be saved'?
We may start with a verse such as 1 John 1:7, which says, 'The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin'
Due to an insensitivity toward sins, he has never properly confessed his sins before God but only admits in a general way that he is sinful
To help remove someone's doubts concerning salvation, we need to use the Bible, because the Bible is the only means for man to be saved
What he needs is for someone to knock on his conscience and touch his conscience so that it will become sensitive
On that day by the well in Sychar the Lord Jesus did not tell the Samaritan woman, 'You were sinful from your mother's womb'
He has to deal with the past to such an extent that he can stand before God and men with a conscience void of offense
We must obey this sense, and we must also see that being a Christian is not an outward matter but an inward matter
As Christians, we behave ourselves not according to the outward letter but according to the living Person-the living God-within us
From the book of Romans we see that the Christian experience begins when a sinner is saved and consummates when he is mature in life
In the church life today most of the believers are lingering in the first experience and have not yet entered into the second experience
They remain only in their consecration, their zeal, their limited fellowship with the Lord, and their limited prayer
For these ones we need to have a systematic, section by section reading of the Word of God, studying it as if we were studying a science
When they talk about the Bible, they are just like children drawing pictures that are missing this part and that part
To them it seems that Matthew and Mark are almost the same, Mark and Luke are almost the same, and Luke and John are also almost the same
Those who have studied know that after a person passes the age of thirty, it is somewhat difficult to go back to school
Even many of us who have been saved for many years may not have spent enough effort on the Bible in a good way
We have to read Romans at least a hundred times, Ephesians at least a hundred and fifty times, and 1 Corinthians seventy times
Without the support of the holy Scriptures, the truth is empty, and without the support of the Holy Spirit, the truth is not practical
If possible, we need to bring him into the service in the church, perhaps even beginning with mopping the floor
If we lead the newly saved ones to advance in these three matters, then the church in our locality will be firmly established
It only mentions one point here and another point there and gives us one pattern here and another pattern there
The Bible tells us that the church is like a mustard seed , which is a small seed of life that produces a small herb
Not only is this great tree deformed, the birds of heaven-Satan and his evil spirits-also come and roost in it
If a person did not wish to join the state church he could join any of the private churches which were more advanced than the state churches
In the preaching of the gospel, John Wesley was quite proper, but in baptizing and receiving people, his requirement was too arbitrary
When we receive people by baptizing them we must do it not according to the practices in traditional Christianity but according to the Bible
The faith spoken of in the Bible particularly in the New Testament refers to our relationship with the Lordour union with Himthrough faith
Romans 6:3 says, 'Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death'?
To believe into Christ is not to understand something in the mind, to mentally agree with or acknowledge a doctrine
After repenting, a person naturally sees that the Lord Jesus is the Savior and that the Lord died for him on the cross
When he receives the Lord in this way, that is, when he believes, the Holy Spirit and the life of Christ enter into him
Whenever we baptize and receive someone, instead of asking him how much he understands, we should ask him whether or not he has believed
If a person has not touched the Lord in his spirit, then even if he has memorized the entire Bible, he is still unsaved
When King Herod inquired of them where the Christ was to be born, immediately they replied, 'In Bethlehem of Judea'
When we intend to baptize someone, we should not focus on examining him to find out how much doctrine he understands
At this juncture, God's sovereignty was manifested, and the Holy Spirit worked within him, saying, 'How could you be such a bad person?
When the missionary opened the door and saw the preacher, he said, 'Congratulations, you have been saved and born again'!
When the church in Foochow started to have a revival, there were many young people who were saved and wanted to be baptized
He said, 'Baptism means that we have died with the Lord and were buried with Him and that we are no longer in union with the world
When we go to the flour mill to buy flour, we do not need to open the sacks one by one to look at the contents
Some people do not understand the doctrine, but they have a living Lord within them who is their life and is reigning within them
In service, we not only need to be freed from sins and the self; we also need to be freed even more from our independence
Once service to God in the church is mentioned in the Bible, it is immediately linked to the members of the Body
While you are serving God together with the brothers and sisters do you feel that there is a relationship between you and the other members
When our coordination with all the members is normal, we may not have much feeling that we are in coordination
One kind is the coordination involved in outward arrangements such as sweeping the floor, cleaning the chairs, and dusting the windows
While learning to serve the Lord, many have had the experience that as soon as they were put in the coordination their condition was exposed
When they were at home praying, reading the Word, or pursuing the Lord, they did not sense their own condition very much
When they went out by themselves to preach the gospel and distribute gospel tracts, they also were not very conscious of their condition
In this race, the legs of two schoolmates are tied together, one student's right leg being tied to the other student's left leg
Similarly, until two persons are put together in coordination, they will not realize how strong they are in their disposition
Once we are put in coordination with the saints, we discover how much of the self we have and how strong we are in our disposition
You must realize that the most important thing in the church service is not that we perform our tasks successfully
When we who serve the Lord are coordinating together, the main thing is that our flesh and our disposition are dealt with
The reason is that our flesh and disposition have not been broken, and the Lord has not yet touched our individualism
In the book of Galatians, when Paul saw that what Peter did was inconsistent with the truth of the gospel, he rebuked him to his face
The biggest reason the church service is not strong and does not have much blessing is that the reality of coordination is missing
Our coordination in service has to be so real that it surpasses human organization and is as organic as the human body
We all know that in the service of the Body the first thing is coordination, and the second thing is authority
Some people think that authority pertains to only a few, such as apostles or elders-special kinds of people with authority
A hand has to submit to the authority of the arm, and at the same time this hand is also the authority over many fingers
In a family with five siblings, does the family have to vote for someone to be the eldest brother, the second, and so on?
As a matter of fact it may argue with almost any member and still be all right but there is one member with whom it may not disputethe arm
Even if all the leading ones were to leave to pursue the world, even if they all fell in this way, we would still stand on this ground
Those who saw that this was the Lord's way came this way, and those who did not see that this was the Lord's way did not come
Corinthians 3 tells us, 'For another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ'
In John 3 Nicodemus came to the Lord Jesus in the night and said, 'Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher'
It is no wonder that on the day the Lord Jesus was crucified, Nicodemus came to the Lord while all the disciples fled
We began to have a taste for God and entered into Christianity, and afterward we felt quite good and quite different
In this process, what concerns us the most is that people who cannot touch the high thing-Christ-often ruin the lower things-religion
We need to tell them that believing in Jesus is not for obtaining peace and joy or for going to heaven but simply for gaining Christ
In the New Testament, when the Lord appeared to the disciples after His resurrection, He said to Peter, 'Do you love Me more than these'?
In the same manner, the Lord often places something between us and Him to see if we love Him more than that thing
The Lord's way is to place persons, things, or matters before us in order to see whether or not we love Him more than them
No matter what man loves, he can only love it to a certain extent, because the thing he loves may be harmful to him
If we were to frequently study a certain thing or matter and get to know it intimately, after a while it would become part of our habit
In the same way the more we draw near to God love God and consider God the more we will spontaneously have a sense of affection toward God
In this way God will be able to enter into us and into all our situations in order to regulate us in every way
In practice, for us to live such a life of drawing near to God and loving God, we must do four things every day
The altar is a type of the cross that removes the barrier between man and God so that man may draw near to God
The Pentateuch, written by Moses, contains many descriptions of the altar that describe how a person should approach God
The records in the Pentateuch mainly emphasize the facts and not so much the feeling and taste concerning the altar
Because they rebelled to the uttermost, the judgment they received was the most severe the human race had seen
The description of the psalmists feeling about the altar in Psalm 8434 is the most beautiful the fullest and the highest in the entire Bible
While considering the habitation of God, the psalmist thought of the altar and expressed his feeling concerning it with poetic expressions
As a descendant of a rebel, he had been far off from God, yet now he could draw near to God because of the altar
Because he was unable to express his inner feeling with ordinary words, he used the sparrow and the swallow as illustrations
The sparrows mentioned in Matthew 10:29 and 31 show us that although a sparrow is worthless in itself, it is precious in the sight of God
Like the sparrow and the swallow, the people of God should know the ordinance of God, the time of God, and should live in His presence
Everyone who comes to the cross has the sense that in the universe he has no one whom he can trust and on whom he can rely
Most of the time people experience the cross not when they are restful but when they are feeling completely helpless
The psalmist felt that at the altar he had a resting place, just like a swallow finding a nest where she can lay her young
In chapter one of the Song of Songs the Lord tells those who follow Him not to forget to pasture their young goats by the shepherds' tents
Through the preaching of the gospel we must 'lay our young' by bringing sinners to the cross of Christ to produce spiritual children
Psalm 84 uses animals to signify Christians, showing how we are like the sparrow and the swallow, worthless and useless
Real Christians are just like this in the eyes of the world, having no attractive form or beauty and without ability or education
John 15 uses a plant to symbolize Christians, showing that we are just like the branches of a vine, which are not fit for use as lumber
Although Christians are very small and worthless in the eyes of the world, they can lay their young like the swallow in Psalm 84
Every branch that does not bear fruit shall be taken away, but those that bear fruit express the life of the vine
These are the two ends of our spiritual experience, which is the most precious experience in the Christian life
On the other hand, he must have the experience of the cross and be broken so that he can flow out the Lord's life
