   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moses had warned Israel that if they did not obey the voice of Jehovah their God, they would be cursed in every way Deut 28:15-68 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, Moses said, "Your heaven, which is above your head, will be brass, and the land, which is under you, iron.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And I said, I see a boiling pot, and it is facing away from the north.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And Jehovah said to me, Out of the north evil will be let loose upon all the inhabitants of the land" Jer 1:13-14 .</S>
