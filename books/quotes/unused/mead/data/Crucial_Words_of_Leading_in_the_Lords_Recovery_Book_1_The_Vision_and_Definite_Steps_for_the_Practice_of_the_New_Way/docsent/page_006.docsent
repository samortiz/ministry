   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Serving by Following the Leadership</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of Those Who Have the Vision The Example of Aquila and Priscilla</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the beginning of Acts 18, we are told that through his tentmaking Paul gained a couple, Aquila and Priscilla.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Immediately they joined Paul in his vision and in his service.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thereafter, there were meetings in this couple s house continually.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When they were in Rome, the church in Rome met in their house.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When they went to Ephesus, the church in Ephesus met in their house Rom 16:5a; 1 Cor 16:19b .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul praised them for risking their necks for his life Rom 16:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only was Paul grateful to them, but all the churches in the Gentile world were thankful to them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The service of Aquila and Priscilla was a service that followed after Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, their service was a service under the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Case of Apollos</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the end of Acts 18, there appeared a man named Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Was Apollos s service under the vision?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not safe to say that it was not, for he was powerful in the Scriptures v. 24 . He knew the Bible very well, but while he was ministering and working in Corinth, he created some problems.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After he left, a division arose in the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some said that they were of Apollos, and others said that they were of Cephas or of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Another group of people thought that they were superior; they did not consider themselves as belonging to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They claimed that they were of Christ 1 Cor 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because of this problem, Paul said in 1 Corinthians 16:12, Concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him many times to come to you with the brothers; yet it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that Paul wanted to go to Corinth, and he wanted Apollos to go with him to solve the problem of division in the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The strange thing is that although Paul urged him many times, it was not at all Apollos s desire to come now.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The reason Apollos gave was that the opportunity was not there.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was why he would only come when he had opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we all have to admit that Paul was a very spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since such a spiritual person had said, I urged him many times to come to you, we have to believe that his urging was not of the flesh but of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps some may ask, Does this mean that Apollos was not spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many would answer, Of course, Apollos was spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Otherwise, why would some in Corinth have claimed that they were of Apollos?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible clearly says that Apollos was powerful in the Scriptures and was an eloquent man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even Paul affirmed Apollos by saying that he planted, but Apollos watered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is difficult to say that the one who plants is under the vision, but the one who waters is not under the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, we can at most say that Paul was more spiritual than Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot say that Apollos was not spiritual and that he was not under the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Pattern of Timothy and Titus</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today in Christianity, many Christians claim that they are spiritual, but they do not like to listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even if Paul were here, they might not listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This attitude has found its way even to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It seems that in a way we are also spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometimes we have a feeling concerning a certain matter, but we can only say to the brothers, I urge you to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Perhaps you can pray to the Lord concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Strictly speaking, this condition is not too normal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we study the book of Acts and the Epistles of Paul, we can see that many times Paul pointedly told people to do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 2 Timothy 4, Paul directed people to do a number of things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He told Timothy, Be diligent to come to me quickly...Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, bring when you come...Be diligent to come before winter vv.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>9-13, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Paul charged Timothy in this way, Timothy did not say, It is not at all my desire to come now, because the weather is somewhat cold, but I will come when I have opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No, he acted accordingly, following Paul s instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the same way, when Paul asked Titus to remain in Crete, Titus remained.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When he asked Titus to come to him at Nicopolos, Titus obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When he sent Titus to Corinth, Titus went accordingly Titus 1:5; 3:12; 2 Cor 7:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 1 Timothy 1:3, Paul told Timothy, Even as I exhorted you...to remain in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul told Timothy to stay behind in Ephesus, and Timothy stayed behind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot find a trace where Paul exhorted Timothy in the way of saying, Timothy, for the sake of those who are teaching differently in Ephesus, I feel that you should stay behind and consider the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Please pray to the Lord to see whether or not this is the Lord s will.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Nor can we find Timothy answering, Good, I will pray and see.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If it is the Lord s will, I will stay behind.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Acts 17:15 says, Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible, they went off.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Acts 18:5 says, Both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They all obeyed immediately after they received Paul s command.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No one said, Sorry, I have to pray a little and see if this is the Lord s leading.</S>
