   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The kingdom of God is the Savior, the Lord Jesus, as the seed of life sown into His believers and developing into a realm over which God can rule as His kingdom in His divine life Luke 17:20-21; Mark 4:3, 26: The entrance into the kingdom is regeneration, and the development of the kingdom is the believers growth in the divine life John 3:5; 2 Pet 1:3-11.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The kingdom of God as the reign of God is a realm not only of the divine dominion but also of the divine species, in which are all the divine things John 3:3, 5: In John 3 the kingdom of God refers more to the species of God than to the reign of God.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Father delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love Col 1:13: The authority of darkness denotes the authority of Satan Acts 26:18: Darkness is Satan as death; thus, to be delivered out of the authority of darkness is to be delivered from the devil, who has the might of death Heb 2:14; John 17:15.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have been delivered from the devil, Satan, by the death of Christ and by the life of Christ in resurrection Col 1:13; 2:14-15; John 5:24.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Colossians the authority of darkness refers to the good aspects of culture and of our character, disposition, and natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we are in the natural man or live in the self, we are under the control of the authority of darkness; the only thing we can do is go to the cross and allow the cross to deal with every aspect of the satanic authority of darkness Matt 16:24; Col 3:5-9.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The kingdom of the Son is the authority of Christ Rev 11:15; 12:10: The Son of God is the embodiment and expression of the divine life; hence, the kingdom of the Son is a realm of life 1 John 5:11-12; John 1:4.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Son of the Father is the expression of the Father as the source of life John 1:18, 4; 1 John 1:2: The Son of the Father s love is the object of the Father s love to be the embodiment of life to us in the divine love with the authority in resurrection Matt 3:17.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Son, as the embodiment of the divine life, is the object of the Father s love 17:5: 1 The divine life embodied in the Son is given to us in the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>2 The object of the divine love becomes to us the embodiment of life in the divine love with the authority in resurrection; this is the kingdom of the Son of the Father s love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be transferred into the kingdom of the Son of the Father s love is to be transferred into the Son, who is life to us 1 John 5:12: The Son in resurrection is now the life-giving Spirit, and He rules us in His resurrection life with love 1 Pet 1:3; Rom 6:4-5; 1 Cor 15:45b.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we live by the Son as our life in resurrection, we are living in His kingdom, enjoying Him in the Father s love; here we have the church life Col 3:4; John 6:57.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although the kingdom of the Son of the Father s love comprises the present age, the coming age, and the eternal age, the emphasis in Colossians 1:13 is on the kingdom of the Son of the Father s love in this age, the age of the church: Because the Father delights in His Son, the kingdom of the Son of the Father s love is a pleasant thing, a matter of delight Matt 3:17; 17:5.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church life today is the kingdom of the Son of the Father s love, which is as delightful to God the Father as the Son of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God the Father loves the delightful part of the kingdom just as much as He loves His delightful Son.</S>
