   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MINISTRY BEING AUTHORITY ITSELF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 12 speaks of operations, gifts, and various ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whoever has the gift has the ministry, and whoever has the ministry has the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, the eyes see.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The seeing is the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The eyes have the gift of seeing, which means that they have the ministry of seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This also means that they have the authority of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The commission that one receives is the authority he inherits.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When a man is commissioned to a work, he receives a ministry as far as he is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But as far as others are concerned, he has become their authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A man may be commissioned to manage a house; to him this is a ministry, but to others his ministry has become his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Anyone who enters the house has to obey him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who are commissioned have the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who have the ministry have the authority, and others have no choice but to obey them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The ministry with which God commissions a person becomes his authority, and it is right for others to acknowledge this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today many people only see the relationship they have with the Head; they have not seen the relationship they have with other members; they have not seen how they should receive from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you are a cell, you are directly related to the Head, but at the same time, there are other cells all around you; there is a relationship between you and them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everyone likes to come under the direct authority of God, but God has arranged indirect authorities for us to practice our submission.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Authority comes from many directions in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the brothers and sisters practice submission when they encounter ministry, there will be oneness and coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A SUBMISSIVE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is very hard for God to make the world, the creatures in the universe, or the Israelites obey, because they do not have a life relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But it is easy for us to submit because we are related to God in life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Submission is God's nature; it is the very nature that God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To us, it is a hard thing not to obey, because we are one in life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the same as saying that it is natural and spontaneous for the hands and legs to be harmonious with one another because they are one in life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is hard for the hands and feet to fight each other.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Receiving others' ministry is an easy thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Conflict in the human body arises only when the body is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the body is healthy, all the members are one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Schism in the body occurs only with schizophrenics.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We feel right and comfortable when we submit because we are one Body in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why do we not allow the Body of Christ to live a life of joy?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why must God's children fight and bicker with one another?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why must we criticize and destroy each other?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is against the very nature of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is a matter of joy and rest for Christians to obey one another and to submit to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>ACKNOWLEDGING ONE'S LIMITATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>AND RECEIVING SUPPLY FROM THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are submissive, we will not need to bear many burdens; the whole Body will bear these burdens for us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will result in joy for the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once we have tasted this experience, we will realize that we have never enjoyed something like this before in our whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is a tiresome thing to bear all of our burdens alone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Perhaps we have not tired ourselves out yet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the reason we are still bearing our burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many people have been bearing such burdens for years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They should have tired of them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many people do everything by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is a tedious task for a member to bear the work of the entire Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have been working and bearing our own anxieties for years.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many burdens can be shared with others, and many works can be done by others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we share our many burdens and works with the other members, it will become a light and easy thing for us to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We will thank God, saying, "Brother So-and-so can speak this, and Brother So-and-so can see that."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As soon as a person accepts his limitations, he enters into rest.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a person who is an eye tries to be the leg, he will probably end up having insomnia.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If he is an eye, he should give himself to only be an eye; let the legs run.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Submission to the authority of the Body and mutual yielding of the members is a big release.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To put it another way, it is a great burden for a person to try to do what he cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must all learn to accept our limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do, the Lord will put the greatest rest and joy before us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Otherwise, we will run over others and overtax ourselves when we try to usurp the place of others and do what we cannot do.</S>
