   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have such a heavy burden about this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I fear and tremble that I may fail God in His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am not trying to give you a good sermon.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although Genesis gives us a record of man's fall, that is only a background showing us the true picture of the godly ways.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you had never fallen, you would never be able to taste the sweetness of God's salvation.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Abel was a fallen man who pleased Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His way of pleasing God was that of offering the type of Christ to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I can please God in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although I am a fallen man with a fallen nature, I can please God by offering Christ to Him as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am not boasting, but I can declare to you that I have pleased God very much in these recent days.</S>
