FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>ONE SPIRIT-ONE APPLICATION</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Third of the Divine Trinity-Gen. 1:2; Rom. 8:9; 1 Cor. 2:11; Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14.</li><li>He is self-existing, ever-existing, and coinhering with the Father and the Son in eternity.</li><li>He is, with the Father and the Son, the only God-Acts 5:3-4.</li><li>He was the Spirit of God from eternity and the Holy Spirit at the time of Christ&#8217;s incarnation (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20), but He was not &#8220;the Spirit&#8221; before the resurrection of Christ (John 7:39).</li><li>In Christ&#8217;s resurrection He was compounded with Christ&#8217;s divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power to be the life-giving Spirit, the divine anointing ointment as the compound Spirit-Exo. 30:22-31; 1 Cor. 15:45.</li><li>He is God&#8217;s essence (John 4:24) and God&#8217;s reaching of man (Matt. 28:19).</li><li>He is the realization of the pneumatic Christ (John 14:16-20) and the reality of the resurrection of Christ.</li><li>Thus, He became:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The consummated Spirit of the processed and consummated Triune God, even the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</li>	<li>The Lord Spirit-2 Cor. 3:18.</li>	<li>The Spirit of Jesus-Acts 16:7.</li>	<li>The Spirit of Christ-Rom. 8:9.</li>	<li>The Spirit of Jesus Christ-Phil. 1:19.</li>	</ol></li><li>After the church was established and became degraded, as the life-giving and compound Spirit, He became the seven Spirits of God; that is, He is the one life-giving, compound Spirit but is intensified sevenfold-Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6.</li><li>As the Spirit of life, He was breathed into the believers by Christ, in the night of His resurrection, as the gentle breath to be their indwelling Spirit to fill them inwardly-John 20:22; Acts 13:52.</li><li>He applies all that the Triune God is in Christ, all that the all-inclusive Christ is, and all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained to all the people whom God has chosen; thus He became the one divine application:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>He sanctifies, separates, God&#8217;s chosen people from the fallen people of the world and leads them to repent to God and receive Christ-1 Pet. 1:2.</li>	<li>He regenerates the people who have received Christ as their Savior with His resurrection life to be the sons of God-1 Pet. 1:3; Titus 3:5; John 3:5; 1:12.</li>	<li>He sanctifies the regenerated sons of God with the holy nature of God-Rom. 15:16; 6:19, 22.</li>	<li>He renews the sanctified saints-Titus 3:5.</li>	<li>He transforms the renewed saints metabolically into the glorious image of Christ-Rom. 12:2a; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29.</li>	<li>He conforms the transformed saints to the image of the firstborn Son of God-Rom. 8:29.</li>	<li>He seals the believers with all that Christ is and all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained, thus dispensing all the divine elements of Christ into the very being of the believers until they will be redeemed in their body, that is, transfigured to be like the glorious body of Christ-Eph. 1:13; 4:30; 2 Cor. 1:22; Rom. 8:23; Phil. 3:21.</li>	<li>He is the pledge from God to the believers guaranteeing that the Triune God is their inheritance-Eph. 1:14; 2 Cor. 1:22; 5:5.</li>	<li>He, as the compound ointment, anoints the believers with the divine elements of Christ-2 Cor. 1:21; 1 John 2:20, 27.</li>	<li>He witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God-Rom. 8:16.</li>	<li>He, as the Spirit of life and the Spirit of God, indwells the believers, imparting life and peace to them and even life to their mortal bodies-Rom. 8:2, 9, 11, 6.</li>	<li>He intercedes with groanings for the believers who are transformed by God under the working together of all things-Rom. 8:26-29.</li>	<li>He, as the indwelling Spirit, is the One in whom the believers pray in their spirit-Jude 20; Eph. 6:18.</li>	<li>He holds the sword of the Spirit of God for the believers to take the offensive in the spiritual warfare-Eph. 6:17-18.</li>	<li>He comforts the believers-John 14:16; Acts 9:31.</li>	<li>He leads the sons of God-Rom. 8:14.</li>	<li>He, who searches all things, even the depths of God, reveals all the things that God has done for the believers-1 Cor. 2:10.</li>	<li>He, as the life-giving Spirit, gives life to the word of God, through whom the new testament ministers minister the word of God-2 Cor. 3:5-6.</li>	<li>He is the Spirit of the new testament ministry of righteousness-2 Cor. 3:8-9; 4:1.</li>	<li>He imparts righteousness, peace, and joy into the believers as the reality of the kingdom of God-Rom. 14:17.</li>	<li>As the flow of God (John 7:38), He transmits in His fellowship the grace of Christ (the element of the divine life) with the love of God (the source of the grace of Christ)-2 Cor. 13:14.</li>	<li>As the dispenser of what God is in Christ to the believers, He dispenses the reality of God to them-Heb. 10:29.</li>	<li>He sets apart and sends out the apostles to spread the gospel of Christ-Acts 13:2, 4.</li>	<li>He leads the apostles in their trips for the gospel spreading-Acts 16:6-7.</li>	<li>He prophesies through the prophets concerning the apostles&#8217; sufferings and persecutions-Acts 21:11.</li>	<li>He leads the apostles to speak things concerning God&#8217;s dealings with His people-1 Cor. 7:40.</li>	<li>He distributes different gifts to the believers-1 Cor. 12:4-11.</li>	<li>He, as the reality of the speaking Christ, speaks to all the churches, calling for overcomers in the degradation of the church-Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26, 29; 3:5-6, 12-13, 21-22.</li>	<li>As the essence of the Body of Christ, all that He works in and on the believers is for the constitution, the building, of the Body of Christ in Him as the oneness-Eph. 4:3-4.</li>	</ol></li><li>As the Spirit of power, He was poured upon the believers by the Christ in ascension as the violent wind to be the power to fill them outwardly for their spreading of the gospel of Christ-Acts 2:2-4, 17-18, 33; 1:8.</li><li>Such an all-inclusive, compound, consummated, life-giving Spirit, the consummated Triune God as the Bridegroom, and God&#8217;s redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified church as the bride, say, &#8220;Come!&#8221;-Rev. 22:17.</li></ol><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
