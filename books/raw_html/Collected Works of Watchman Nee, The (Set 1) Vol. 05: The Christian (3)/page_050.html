<P>Now is the time to preach the gospel. The goal of the gospel is to gain people from the world for Christ. The thoughts, feelings, desires, and cravings of the saints must be upward toward the glory above. If they are already standing on the ground of Christ's endurance, they have already forsaken the world and will need no more sifting from the world. If they still reserve a place for the world, they will surely be tried together with those who dwell on the earth. We should know that we belong to heaven. We are heavenly people on earth. If we are not this way, we will be tried by the earthly men in order that we may be delivered from the earthly things. This is God's way of grace in bringing us closer to Himself. Since we are Christians, our job is no longer that of living on earth and seeking the earthly matters. A sojourning and pilgriming attitude should always be manifested in our daily living. Those sojourners who are so happy to be away from home will not want to return until they have become desolate in their exile. "Keep you out of the hour of trial." What a precious promise this is!</P><P>Soon the whole world will be tried, but the Lord will preserve a special group of people from this trial. To whom is this promise given? Will the whole church of God be spared from this great tribulation? No. The Lord has clearly shown us the qualifications of this group of people. It will not be for all the believers; only part of the believers will be preserved by the Lord. Those believers who possess the nature of Philadelphia will be preserved. Those who keep the Lord's word of endurance, that is, those who keep the word of His second coming and those who hope to be raptured will receive the things promised here. What is required here is not just faith, but the works after faith. Before the Lord will preserve, we must first keep. Such a promise is conditional.</P><P>The acknowledgment of the Lord Jesus as the Son of David is intimately related to the keeping of the Lord's word of endurance. Both speak of the glory of the millennium and the corresponding necessary preparation and watchfulness of the individual believers. Those who believe in one will have the other. The former is a testimony of the believers toward the Jews. As such it is linked to a promise of glory in the eyes of the Jews. The latter is a testimony of the believers in the world. As such it is linked to a promise of being spared from a trial which is designed for the world. Not all the believers will be preserved this way. Only those who keep the Lord's word of endurance will be preserved. All those whose character, nature, and conduct fall short of those of the messenger of Philadelphia will be disqualified. The Lord's word here tells us that all those who have not kept the crucial word of the Lord's coming and of His endurance, though they are still believers, will face the trial because of this little, nonetheless serious, failure. All those who are not willing to exalt the Lord's name as the King will see the door in heaven temporarily shut to them. How solemn this is! May we be properly affected! If we do not suffer at the hands of the world, we will suffer together with the world in the future. If we are tried by the world now through our faithfulness in our living and our testimony, we will be preserved from the judgment that will come upon those in the world in the future. However, this will not be the case with all regenerated Christians. Hence, some will have to experience trials, for this promise will not include them.</P><P>Here we see that Sardis and Philadelphia typify two kinds of believers. Both are saved, for both are golden lampstands before the Lord. An unsaved church cannot have a representation of a golden lampstand in the heavenly tabernacle. However, because of the difference in their conduct, they will receive different treatment at the coming of the Lord. Sardis typifies the unwatchful believers. The Lord will come upon them like a thief in the night. At a time when they do not know, the Lord will have already come and will have taken some believers away, while they will be left behind. Philadelphia is a type of the watchful believers. They will be raptured away before the hour of trial comes. As Sardis needs the trials to purify it from worldliness, Philadelphia needs the rapture to preserve its safety. The lukewarm Laodicea is probably the condition of the church in the world after Philadelphia. Yet the Lord is still calling the overcomers there.</P><P>The rapture is the unique way for the Lord to preserve His faithful people. Death can also spare one from trial, but death is not God's way of preserving man, because the final result of trial is also death. Neither will God prepare any place on earth to hide the saints because this trial will come upon "the whole inhabited earth." Surely there is no place that can be spared from this trial. The city of Philadelphia will not be spared from the attack of Antichrist. On the contrary, Philadelphia was one city in Asia, and Asia was a province in the Roman Empire. In the future the Roman Empire will be the kingdom of Antichrist. This trial will "try them who dwell on the earth." Hence, those who inherit this promise must be delivered from this "earth." They must be delivered from both the hour and the place. They will be raptured to heaven, just as God has revealed in other portions of the Scripture. This kind of rapture must occur before the appearance of the "man of sin."</P><P>What is covered here can best be proven by chapter twelve. There we see that whatever the intention of the enemy is, the man-child, the overcoming saints, will be safely raptured to the throne of God. Satan wants to shut the door, but he cannot do it. He wants to devour the man-child as soon as it is born, but he cannot do it. In the end, all he will be able to do is "to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, which tabernacle in heaven" (Rev. 13:6). The saints have kept the Lord's word of endurance already. They are spared from the trial. Yet the defeated ones will still suffer on earth at the hand of Satan and his ministers (Rev. 12:17; 13:7). They should allow the enemy to persecute them without any resistance. At that time they will realize that the world is not at all lovable anymore!</P><P>Hence, the teaching here is fully compatible with that in Luke 21:36. "But be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man." The things which are about to take place are the things happening in the great tribulation as mentioned previously. The way to escape is to stand before the Son of Man. This is the rapture, for without the rapture there is no other way for us to be able to stand before the Son of Man. The qualification to escape is to be watchful and to beseech at every time. The words here were spoken to the disciples. In the Lord's consideration, the condition for one's escape from tribulation is not being a disciple, but how to be a disciple. Watchfulness and beseeching are the necessary conditions for rapture. All the responsibility is now upon us. It is up to us to choose what we want and what we reject.</P><P>This kind of rapture is not a blessing for the Jews. When the time comes, God will say to them: "Come, my people, enter your rooms, / And shut your doors behind you; / Hide for a short moment / Until the indignation has passed" (Isa. 26:20). This is their way of salvation. However, this does not mean that they will have no sufferings, for Revelation 12, a corresponding passage, tells us that they, the woman in Revelation 12, escape to the "wilderness," an uninhabited place. However, the dragon is still chasing behind. Daniel said: "At that time your people, every one found written in the book, will be delivered" (12:1). However, those who keep the Lord's word of endurance will not only be "delivered" during the great tribulation, but will be kept out of the trial altogether. At that time, the godly remnants among the Jews will be "chosen" of God in "the furnace of affliction" (Isa. 48:10). They will be saved through "the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory" (Matt. 24:30). However, the overcoming believers will be raptured before the start of the great tribulation.</P><P>The blessing we will receive will be like that of Abraham. We will not be like Lot. We do not have to escape to Zoar. We will be totally out of the trials. We believe that we will not only be saved, but will fully be kept out of it. Our hope is the hope of Enoch and not the experience of Noah. We will be raptured before the flood comes. We do not want to pass through the flood safely. The Lord's promise to His faithful believers is to preserve them and to keep them completely away from the place and hour of trial. However, unless the believers have the spiritual condition of Abraham and Enoch, they will not have a part in this blessed preservation. Our separation from the world must be so deep that the world can no longer be counted worthy as our dwelling. Our walk with God must be so intimate that there cannot be a moment when we are separated from Him, so that He can take us away from the world and we can be with Him forever.</P><P>Brothers, the midnight call has sounded. The words, "Behold, the bridegroom! Go forth to meet him!" have sounded in your ears. May I ask if you have gone forth yet? It is not enough to hear and to believe in this call. The most important step is to go forth. Have you left behind everything that is not in harmony with the Lord? Have you forsaken everything for the Lord? Are you ready to face Him yet? If you are, there will be nothing for you to be afraid of. Actually, everything that man wants to preserve is worthless. Our greatest benefit comes when we give up everything to meet Him. Our greatest joy lies in taking His way of suffering. Such a thought should be impressed upon our heart. It is not enough for us to have oil in the lamp. For we ourselves to be saved does not include everything. The pleasure of His heart is the duty of the saints. May the Lord deliver us from selfish feelings. He has saved us for the purpose that we would think of Him. He wants us to go forth and to meet Him, that is, to consider His coming to be more important than anything else. Is this our attitude? Oh, that we would have greater love for the rejected Lord! Oh, that we would have a stronger inclination to please Him!</P>
