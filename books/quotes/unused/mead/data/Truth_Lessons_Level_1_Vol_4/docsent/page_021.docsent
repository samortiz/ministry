   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the initial stage of God s full salvation, the stage of regeneration, the believers are made a new creation by being regenerated, by receiving the Holy Spirit, by having God s eternal life, and by being renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I. THE NEED FOR RENEWING</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When man was first created, he was not crooked, wicked, or unclean, but upright, good, and clean Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>7:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At that time man was without sin, corruption, or defect; therefore, in the eyes of God man was very good Gen 1:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, through the fall Satan entered into man with the satanic life John 8:44; 1 John 3:10 , man became mixed and unclean, and he also became the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, sin Rom 7:23 and lust were constituted into the human body, because Satan s life, the poisonous element of sin, was mixed into it; therefore, the human body was transmuted and became flesh Gen 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, man became the devil s possession 1 John 3:8 , being obedient to the evil spirits Eph 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not only so, man is also brought forth in iniquity Psa 51:5 , his heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked Jer 17:9 , and nothing good dwells in his flesh, which is filled with all kinds of wicked things Rom 7:18; Mark 7:20-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, he is at enmity with God, not subject to the law of God, nor can he be, and he cannot please God Rom 8:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, man needs to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only through renewing can God dispense the divine essence of the new creation into man, that man may pass from his old state into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF RENEWING A. By the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the work of renewing that God does in us is carried out by the Holy Spirit Titus 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The work of the Holy Spirit within us begins with regeneration and continues with renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Holy Spirit renews us by imparting the divine essence into our being that we may become a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is the divine Person, the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God who has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He washes and renews us with the divine essence that we may become a new creation, having the divine life and nature, and may be heirs of God in His eternal life, inheriting all the riches of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, renewing is carried out by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>B. Through the Washing of Regeneration</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God does the renewing work in us through the washing of regeneration Titus 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The washing of regeneration is the process of God s new creation to make us a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is a reconditioning, remaking, or remodeling, with life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This washing of regeneration begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The washing of regeneration begins in us at the time of our regeneration, through which we obtain from God His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This divine life and nature cause us to be delivered from our natural life and nature, which through the fall have become defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, when we are delivered from our natural life and nature through God s divine life and nature, we are cleansed from all defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This purging is carried out through the washing of regeneration at the time of our new birth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Immediately following this, the Holy Spirit continues to do the work of renewing within us, imparting into us the divine essence of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The divine elements of the new creation produce in us a metabolic change that causes the old and natural elements within us to be replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the continuing work carried out by the washing of regeneration together with the renewing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Both the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are a continual working in us throughout our whole life until the completion of the new creation.</S>
