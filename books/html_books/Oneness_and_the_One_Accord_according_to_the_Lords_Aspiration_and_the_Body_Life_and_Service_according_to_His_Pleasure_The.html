Because of Your presence, we are full of faith that You are working here. Lord, we confess our weakness, smallness, and even uselessness. We need Your mercy. Your mercy is our trust. Lord, cleanse us fully. We need Your cleansing within and without. Thank You for Your cleansing blood and for Your anointing oil. Lord, speak to each one of us. Give each one of us a word, a word that You want us to have tonight. Lord, we thank and praise You for the blood, the anointing, and the sanctifying word. O Lord Jesus, open all of us up from deep within, and may we open up to You. Lord, may there be nothing whatsoever hidden or veiled within us, and may we not shrink back and hide from Your face. We do wish to see You face to face. May Your countenance, which is Your lovely face, become our help. Lord, we have followed You for years. Your presence has always been with us. Tonight, we need Your presence with us even more. Touch the deepest part of our being. Lord, You are our Head. We worship You here. We want to know You more, and we want to know more concerning Your organic Body. We also want to know ourselves and all the members more thoroughly so that we can enter into the consciousness of Your Body and maintain a proper relationship not only with You but also with all the members in Your Body. Lord, we can never forget Your evil enemy. You know that he is following us. Where You work, he is also busy. Lord, we pray that You would bind him. We also bind him in Your victorious name. We believe that whatsoever we bind here has been bound by You in heaven. Lord, bind Your enemy. You have promised that You will put him under our feet. May this word be fulfilled among us tonight. Clear out everything in us that has the poison and the bite of the serpent so that he can be trampled out of us. Lord, release Your word, so that all of us would receive Your boundless supply. Visit us once again so that we would have more of Your glory within and would express more of Your magnificence without. Amen.<h2 class=head1>SEEING THE ONENESS AND ARRIVING AT THE ONE ACCORD</h2><p>About a year has past since I was last here. I am so happy to see the brothers again. I wish to have some further intimate and thorough fellowship with all of you. After reading all the verses and the outline of this message, I believe you should have some impression that what I am sharing with you tonight is of two points: one is the oneness, and the other is the one accord. The oneness may seem high and far away in the heavens. But the one accord is very near and is even right here. It describes the condition within us. The term one accord speaks of something related to our mind.<p>According to the examples in the New Testament, oneness is very objective. It seems far away in heaven and hard to attain. But the one accord is very subjective; it speaks directly of our condition. For this reason, we can say that the one accord is the oneness in practice. The oneness without the one accord is only something on paper and has no reality to it. If we only speak of oneness without speaking about the one accord, we may have only some high and great doctrines. They may be good, but they are not practical. However, if we add the one accord to the oneness, we are &#8220;pulling the oneness down close to us,&#8221; like pulling a kite down from the sky. This will bring the oneness right to where we are. If we have the one accord, we will have the oneness among us in practice. Hence, we must first talk about the oneness, and then the practice of oneness, which is the one accord.<p>For quite a long time, I have been bothered as I considered our situation. Not only among those outside of us, but even among us the oneness and the one accord have suffered a great loss. The oneness has been neglected, and the one accord has been set aside. This has been our overall condition. For this reason, I have been constantly burdened within and have always wanted to come back to see all of you. I feel that our present need is to see the oneness, to emphasize it, and to dive into the significance of the oneness in an intensified way. At the same time, we should fellowship about the oneness in a serious way. In particular, we must arrive at the one accord. Without the one accord, there is no oneness. At most, there is the talk about oneness; there is no practicality of this oneness.<p>For this reason we have to thoroughly see the oneness spoken of in the Bible. The world talks about oneness also. As long as there is an organization, there is talk about oneness. A family wants to be one. A school wants to be one. In an institution or an army, people talk about oneness. Even in a community, or a little club, the same is true. What then is the difference between the oneness spoken of in the Bible and the oneness the world talks about? The oneness the Bible talks about is very different from the oneness the world talks about. It is even different from the oneness we may be used to talking about. The term &#8220;oneness&#8221; is the same for these different peoples, but its nature and ingredient are different. This is like the example of a ring; a platinum ring is of one nature, a gold ring is of another nature, and a brass ring is yet of another nature. The shape may be quite similar, but their natures are absolutely different. We can say that the oneness we talked about in the past did not touch the intrinsic nature of the oneness spoken of in the Bible.<h2 class=head1>THE ONENESS FOR WHICH THE LORD PRAYED</h2><p>Now let us look at the oneness for which the Lord Jesus prayed in John 17. The most important thing is the nature of this oneness. When one buys a suit or an appliance, the most important thing to consider is the substance, for the value depends first on the substance. This chapter is the Lord Jesus&#8217; prayer to the Father, but what is covered concerns His believers. If we study this prayer carefully, it is easy to see that it speaks mainly of glory and also of oneness. But what is glory? What is oneness? Should glory come first, or should oneness come first. This is difficult to determine. I want to explain to you what I comprehend in simple terms so that you may understand.<p>Verse 1 says, &#8220;These things Jesus spoke, and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&#8221; This is the main subject of the Lord Jesus&#8217; prayer. According to what follows, this glory is the oneness. Where there is glory, there is oneness. On the other hand, where there is oneness, there is glory. Without glory, there is no oneness. In order to have glory, there must be the oneness. Glory and oneness are consequences of each other. The subject of the prayer is glory, but its real content is oneness. In this chapter of the Lord Jesus&#8217; prayer, oneness is mentioned three times. In other words, there are three levels of oneness, and each of these levels is related to the Father.<p>The first time oneness was mentioned, it is related to the Father&#8217;s name and the Father&#8217;s life-the eternal life (John 17:2, 6, 11b). Hence, this oneness is in the Father&#8217;s name and in His life. This is the first level. When oneness is mentioned the second time, it is related to the Father&#8217;s word (John 17:14-21). When the Father&#8217;s word with the Father&#8217;s reality is applied to us, it produces an effect, which is to sanctify us from the Satan-ensnared world and to separate us unto God. This is the second level of the oneness, the oneness in the Father&#8217;s word, that is, in the Father&#8217;s reality. When oneness is mentioned the third time, it is related to the Father&#8217;s glory (John 17:22-23). In the Father&#8217;s glory, we are one. This is the third level of the oneness. When these three levels of oneness are fulfilled, the Lord Jesus&#8217; prayer for the oneness of the believers is accomplished.<h2 class=head1>THE THREE LEVELS OF THE ONENESS OF THE BELIEVERS</h2><h2 class=head2>One in the Father&#8217;s Name and the Father&#8217;s Life</h2><p>Now we need to properly consider these three levels of oneness. The first level of oneness is the oneness of all the believers in the Father&#8217;s name and life. What is the meaning of the Father&#8217;s name? The Father&#8217;s name denotes the person of the Father, who is the Father Himself. The Father is the source of life. The oneness of the believers originates from the Father Himself (the person), who is the source of life. Since the first level of the oneness which the Lord desires originates from the Father as the source, there is no need for our own person. We are not the source. Only the Father is the source. Hence, we should not live by our human life. We should live by the Father&#8217;s divine life. Only the Father&#8217;s life is the source. Hence, basically speaking, we have to see that the oneness of the believers for which the Lord Jesus prays is with the Father as the source rather than with man as the source.<p>Furthermore, this oneness is in the Father&#8217;s life. The Father denotes the source, and the Father&#8217;s life denotes the element. The Father&#8217;s life is the element for oneness. Hence, the oneness that we pursue after is the oneness of life, which is of the Father as the source. This oneness has the Father as the source and His life as the element. This sounds simple, but its requirements are stringent. Everything of what we are and do must be terminated. In this way, regardless how many thousands and millions of saints there are, if there is only one source with only one inward essence, there will surely be oneness. Hence, this oneness is not according to what most Christians would consider. It is not a oneness of people clustering together and convinced by one another to have the same thought and opinion. This is a muddy oneness. It is not a golden oneness. The oneness the Lord wants is one in which we have the same source and the same life, taking the Father as the source and living by His life. When the Father&#8217;s life with His nature becomes the element of oneness in us, we will spontaneously be one.<h2 class=head2>One in the Reality of the Sanctifying Word</h2><p>The second level of oneness is the oneness of all the believers in the reality of the Father&#8217;s sanctifying word. The Lord has given us the Father&#8217;s name and His eternal life. But He did not ask us to leave the world. How then should we live in the world? For this purpose, He has given us the Father&#8217;s word. The Father&#8217;s word has God Himself as the reality. God as the reality is in His word. Without God&#8217;s word, we cannot touch God&#8217;s reality. Today God is in His word. This word contains the reality of God, which is God Himself. God Himself as this reality has a special function, which is to sanctify us. Those of us who read God&#8217;s word frequently have this experience. Whether or not we understand the Bible, as long as we read a little of God&#8217;s Word in the morning and consider this Word a little during the day, we are sanctified.<p>One saint confessed that his mind was not sharp and that he tended to forget about the things he read in the Bible. Brother Watchman Nee comforted him by saying that it was all right to forget what one had read in the Bible. He illustrated by saying that when one takes a bamboo basket to the river to wash the rice in the basket, one drops the basket in and out of the water many times. Although no water is left in the basket, the basket itself and the rice in it are all washed clean. Many times we exert great effort in memorizing the words of the Bible, only to find that after a few days we remember nothing; everything seems to be gone. But in fact, when we read the Lord&#8217;s Word again and again, all the worldly matters in us are removed, and we are cleansed and sanctified. God&#8217;s word brings in God&#8217;s reality, and in us it produces a special effect, which is to sanctify us and to deliver us from this mixed world that we may be separated unto God.<p>The world is very mixed. But God&#8217;s word of reality sanctifies us and makes us pure. The result of this purity is holiness. Anything that is separated is pure. The more a person is in the word of God, the purer he becomes. A man who is not in God&#8217;s word but is in the world is complicated and impure. He may not be very literate, yet he can still be very complicated within. However, if we have God&#8217;s word within, this word with God&#8217;s reality will do a sanctifying work within us to separate us unto God, thus making us pure. God is on the side of purity, and Satan as the prince of the world is on the side of complication. Satan is the prince of the mixed-up world, but our God is the God of purity. The word of reality sanctifies us and delivers us from the mixed-up world, turning us back to the purity in God. In this way, we are one.<p>Hence, the Father&#8217;s name is the source of our oneness; the Father&#8217;s life is the element of our oneness; and the Father&#8217;s sanctifying word is the means of our oneness, bringing us to the sphere of oneness. Because of the Father, not only is our source one and our nature one, but where we are also becomes one.<h2 class=head2>One in the Expression of the Divine Glory</h2><p>Lastly, the third level of the oneness is the oneness of all the believers in the expression of the divine glory. In John 17:22 the Lord Jesus said to the Father, &#8220;And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one.&#8221; According to the revelation of the Bible and in comparison with our experience, glory here refers to the Father&#8217;s life with His nature to express His divine virtue. Hence, the glory of God is the expression of God. Glory is not a sudden kind of beam that shines on us and surrounds us from without. Rather, it is the Father&#8217;s divine life with the divine nature, expressing a kind of divine radiance and splendor. This divine, splendid expression delivers us from ourselves and makes us fully one.<p>The first level of the oneness is in the Father&#8217;s name and life, delivering us from the natural realm. The second level of the oneness is in the reality of the Father&#8217;s sanctifying word, delivering us from the world. Now the third level of the oneness is in the Father&#8217;s glory, delivering us from ourselves and causing us to become fully one in the Triune God. We have to realize that this oneness is the Body of Christ; it is the real and practical church. The church is the oneness lived out of the believers in the Triune God. This oneness has God as the source and His life as the essence, in which the radiance and splendor in divinity are fully expressed through God&#8217;s life and nature in a sanctified realm. This is the practical church life. This is also the building. It is something we ought to treasure and pursue.<p>Now we should all be clear that the oneness of the Lord&#8217;s believers is not as we imagined. It is not a oneness arrived at by dropping our opinions and agreeing mutually with one another. The genuine oneness of the church is a oneness in which we have the Father Himself as the source, the Father&#8217;s life as the nature, and the Father&#8217;s sanctifying reality as the realm, which enables us to live in purity, being unrelated to the world, and which expresses the divine radiance and splendor through God&#8217;s life with His nature. This oneness is the Body of Christ; it is also the building God is after.<h2 class=head1>THE PRACTICE OF ONENESS</h2><h2 class=head2>The One Accord, Having the Same Mind, Speaking the Same Things</h2><p>Now we will consider the practice of oneness. Oneness is practiced through the one accord. The Lord Jesus taught the disciples in Matthew 18:19, saying, &#8220;If two of you agree on earth concerning anything, whatever they may ask, it shall come to them from My Father who is in the heavens.&#8221; The word &#8220;agree&#8221; here, in the original language, means to be in a musical harmony; this is the practice of oneness. By the time of Acts 1, there were one hundred twenty people praying steadfastly in one accord (vv. 14-15a). All of them had one mind, which was to receive power from on high and to testify of the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Lord, whom they loved and followed. For this they were in one mind, and were thus in one accord.<p>In the epistles, through the conditions manifested in the various local churches, the Lord shows us further what the one accord is. First Corinthians 1:10 says that we have to speak the same thing and to be attuned in the same mind and the same opinion. How can we speak the same thing and have the same mind and the same opinion? The whole book of 1 Corinthians shows us that this same speaking is Christ, and the same mind and same opinion are also Christ. In our daily life, if we take Christ as our center and everything, what we speak, think, and understand will all be Christ. This is the one accord, which is the practice of oneness. Some among the Corinthian believers said they were of Paul. Others said they were of Apollos. Still others said that they were of Cephas. Then some were smart enough to say that they were of Christ. They were of four things. In other words, there were four minds and four speakings with four results, which end in division. The oneness is gone, the Body of Christ is lost, and the building is no more. Hence, 1 Corinthians 1:10 deals with this matter so that we would be captured by the Lord and that there would no longer be Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, but only Christ. Everyone would be thinking about Christ and speaking about Christ, having Christ as his view, Christ as his way of speaking, and Christ as his opinion and judgment. Everything would be Christ. This Christ has become the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45b) and has become our enjoyment within. The practice of our oneness depends on Him. When we speak Him, consider Him, enjoy Him, and express Him, we will be harmonious and one.<h2 class=head2>Thinking the Same and Having the Same Love</h2><p>Furthermore, Philippians 2:2 says, &#8220;Think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing.&#8221; What is it to think the same thing? And what is to think the one thing? After reading through the whole book of Philippians, and especially after reading through chapter three, we can see that this refers to the subjective knowledge and experience of Christ. Only Christ is the centrality and universality of our whole being. Everything else makes our mind different and causes disunity. For this reason we should focus our thoughts on the precious knowledge and experience of Christ. Furthermore, we need to have the same love. Our love towards the saints should not be classified into categories. Otherwise, our love will create problems, and there will be no way to have the genuine one accord.<h2 class=head2>The Basis, Means, and Indication of the Practice of the Oneness</h2><p>From Ephesians 4:4-6 we can see that our practice of oneness is based upon the attribute of the oneness of the church: one Spirit, one Lord, one God, one Body, one faith, one baptism, and one hope. By this we can see that oneness is the attribute of the church. Based upon this attribute of the oneness of the church, we can be in one accord and can practice the oneness. Moreover, the practice of this oneness is according to the apostles&#8217; teaching (1 Cor. 4:17b; 7:17b; 11:16; 14:34a). The apostles taught the same thing to all the saints in all the places and in all the churches. At the same time, the practice of this oneness is also according to the same speaking of the Spirit to the churches (Rev. 2:7, 11a, 17a, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). The seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 were words spoken to all the churches. He who has an ear, let him hear. Each epistle was written to all the churches. All the churches have the same Bible, and everyone is practicing oneness according to the same speaking. Finally, the practice of oneness indicates that the seven churches as the seven lampstands are completely identical (Rev. 1:20). The churches are God&#8217;s golden lampstands. Although they are distinct and self-contained, they are completely identical in nature, shape, function and expression.<h2 class=head1>PRACTICING THE ONENESS TO BRING IN GOD&#8217;S BLESSING</h2><p>All who are sitting here today are elders and co-workers. We must be in one accord to maintain the oneness Christ seeks. Since we are bearing the responsibility of the church, we should see the way for the church to receive grace and blessing. We must all realize that the blessing and grace of God can only come upon a situation of one accord. This situation is the practice of oneness. In the Old Testament, Psalm 133 says, &#8220;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron&#8217;s beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; as the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.&#8221; God will only grace and bless the one accord, that is, the practice of oneness.<p>Finally, I would say that if we only listen to these words without practicing them, they are but doctrines. The practice of oneness touches our mind, our love, and our speaking. Unconsciously, we have all violated the practice of oneness. Many times our mind is like an unreined wild horse, free from any restraint. Our love is not regulated. Our words are light and loose. All these damage the oneness of the believers and are factors for losing the Lord&#8217;s blessing. Today we are all living in the church and the Lord&#8217;s Body. We are also bearing the testimony for the Lord&#8217;s recovery. But it is very easy for our mind to be distracted and for our love to become unhealthy. Perhaps we do not speak evil words of reviling, but our speaking may be loose, and our opinions may be plentiful. Spontaneously, we bring many problems to the church and spread division among the saints.<p>Hence, we have to be on the alert. If we would first consider and think a little before we speak and would ask if it is Christ or not, there would be no problem. If we love the saints, we should ask ourselves if our love has different classes, degrees, or depths, and should be adjusted by the Lord accordingly. The same is true with our speaking. We should only speak if our speaking is Christ; otherwise, we should not speak. I have a heavy burden within me. We all want the church here to receive grace and blessing. But do not forget Psalm 133. The commanded blessing of the Lord, which is life forevermore, is upon the brethren dwelling together in oneness. It is like the ointment that flows through the whole body and like the dew that descends on Zion. Tonight we have seen that the oneness of the believers prayed for by the Lord is neither a oneness like the world speaks of nor a oneness according to what we formerly understood. Rather it is a perfected oneness by all of us being in the Father&#8217;s name and life, in His word of reality, and in His divinely expressed glory. Only by this is there the blessing of God. Of course, we should labor and work for the Lord, but if our situation is not in oneness and if we do not practice the one accord, I am afraid our result will not be abundant. Therefore, in order for us to receive God&#8217;s blessing, we must practice the oneness, and the way to practice the oneness is by the one accord.<p><p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, April 5, 1990)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE PLEASURE OF THE LORD&#8217;S HEART-THE EXPRESSION AND SERVICE OF HIS BODY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:23; 4:4-6; 1 Cor. 12:13, 27, 18, 21-25; Rom. 12:5; Eph. 4:15-16; 1 Cor. 12:4-11; Rom. 12:4-8</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The expression of the Lord&#8217;s Body:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The church being the Body of Christ-Eph. 1:23.</li>	<li>The church being the fullness of the One who fills all in all-Eph. 1:23.</li>	<li>One Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father, who is over all, through all, and in all-Eph. 4:4-6.</li>	<li>Many believers being baptized in one Spirit into one Body to be members in particular-1 Cor. 12:13, 27:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>God having placed the members in the Body even as He willed; every member being necessary-1 Cor. 12:18, 21-22.</li>		<li>God tempering the Body together, clothing the less honorable members with more abundant honor, lest there be division in the Body-1 Cor. 12:23-25.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The believers being members one of another in the Body of Christ, living Him and expressing Him together-Rom. 12:5.</li>	<li>All the members holding to truth in love, growing in all things into the Head, Christ-Eph. 4:15.</li>	<li>Out from the Head the whole Body, joined closely together through every joint of the rich supply and knit together through the operation in measure of each one part, causing the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love, that Christ may have a full expression-Eph. 4:16.</li>	</ol></li><li>The service in the Lord&#8217;s Body:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The same God with different operations, the same Lord with different ministries, and the same Spirit with different gifts-1 Cor. 12:4-6.</li>	<li>The many different gifts being the manifestation of the Spirit in all the members, being manifested in words of wisdom, words of knowledge, faith, gifts of healing, works of power, prophecy, discerning of spirits, various kinds of tongues, interpretation of tongues; these being mostly miraculous gifts of the Spirit-1 Cor. 12:7-11.</li>	<li>The members of the Body having gifts that differ according to the grace given to them, resulting in different functions-in prophecy, service, teaching, exhortation, giving, leading, and showing mercy; these being gifts produced through the growth in life-Rom. 12:4-8.</li>	<li>All the members, through the miraculous gifts of the Spirit with the gifts produced through the growth in life, serving and propagating Christ together.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>In the last message, we saw the genuine oneness in a simple and concise way. Based on this view of the genuine oneness, we mentioned that to practice the oneness, there must be the one accord. Now, we have to go one step further to consider the Body of Christ. Before we consider this matter, I want to give an additional word concerning the last message.<h2 class=head1>THE FOUNDATION OF THE ONENESS GIVEN BY THE LORD</h2><p>The light which the Lord gave us concerning the oneness of the believers can be considered the most thorough and deep. Our knowledge in the past concerning the oneness was relatively shallow and common, and did not touch the genuine oneness which was prayed for by the Lord and mentioned for the first time in the New Testament. Although our Recovery Version has listed this oneness in a clear way in its outline, it has not emphasized it as much as we did this time. In the Lord&#8217;s prayer, He spoke of the oneness of the believers in three levels. Each level of the oneness is deeper than the previous one. The last level is the deepest and highest. All three levels of oneness have everything related to the Father as their foundation. The foundation of the first level of the oneness is the Father&#8217;s name and His eternal life. The foundation of the second level is the Father&#8217;s word. In the Father&#8217;s word, there is the Father&#8217;s reality, which is just the Father Himself. The foundation of the third level of the oneness is the Father&#8217;s glory, which is the divine expression of the Father.<p>Moreover, the foundations of the three levels of the oneness are all expressed by the Lord in the way of giving. The Lord said, &#8220;I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world&#8221; (John 17:6). The Father&#8217;s name is the Father Himself. In giving us the Father&#8217;s name, the Lord is giving us the Father Himself. At the same time, He has also given us the Father&#8217;s life. John 17:2 says, &#8220;Even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him.&#8221; In verse 14 the Lord says again, &#8220;I have given them Your word.&#8221; Verse 17 says, &#8220;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.&#8221; The Lord has given us the Father&#8217;s word, which together with God Himself as the reality, the truth, is sanctifying us and delivering us from the mixed-up world to separate us unto God. The Lord has not only given us the Father&#8217;s name, the Father&#8217;s life, and the Father&#8217;s word, but has also given us the Father&#8217;s glory. In verse 22 the Lord said, &#8220;And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them.&#8221; Hence, the Lord has given us four things: the Father&#8217;s name, the Father&#8217;s life, the Father&#8217;s word, and the Father&#8217;s glory.<h2 class=head1>ONENESS BEING THE FULL MINGLING OF THE TRIUNE GOD WITH THE SAINTS</h2><p>This shows us clearly that each of the three levels of oneness has a basis. Each level is based upon the Triune God. This is the foundation of the oneness of the saints. In other words, the factor or element of our oneness is just the Triune God. In verse 11 the Lord said, &#8220;That they may be one even as We are.&#8221; Here &#8220;they&#8221; refers to the saints, and &#8220;We&#8221; refers to the Triune God. The divine Trinity makes us one even as the Father and the Son are one. In verse 21 the Lord says further, &#8220;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.&#8221; This matter of being in one another mutually is a kind of mingling. The Triune God and we are mingled together. This is the biblical oneness of the believers. The source of this oneness is the Triune God. Its element is the Triune God; its process is the Triune God; and its ultimate consummation is the Triune God.<p>Seemingly, the oneness which the Lord prayed for in John 17 and the oneness of the Spirit which Paul described in Ephesians 4 are not alike. But when we dive into these two passages of the Scripture, we can see that as far as the intrinsic element is concerned, they are the same. What the Lord prayed for in John 17 was for the saints to be mingled with the Triune God. Then in Ephesians 4, Paul said that there is a kind of oneness called the oneness of the Spirit. It is the inheritance and the possession of the saints. We do not need to strive for it. All we need to do is to keep this oneness. Following this Paul pointed out seven items as the basis of this oneness. Among them there is the one God and Father of all, the one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body. The Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the factors of this oneness. They also become the elements of this oneness, mingling with the saints to produce a fourth factor, which is the one Body. To put it simply, oneness is the result of the Triune God being mingled with His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people. This oneness is the Body, which is the universal new man.<p>Hence, the oneness revealed in the New Testament is not a oneness where we come together, give up our prejudices, and convince each other to agree to be together. This is a oneness produced by the world. The oneness we are talking about is the full mingling of the Triune God with us. If we do not see this matter to such an extent, I am afraid that the oneness we are talking about is only human-manufactured oneness; it is not the oneness of the Body. The Body of Christ is not an organization, but an organism in which the Triune God is everything. The Triune God has accomplished redemption and has been consummated to be the Spirit, entering into us believers, quickening our spirit, and making our spirit life. Then He spreads outward from our spirit to the mind in our soul, renewing and transforming our mind and resulting in our mind becoming life. Furthermore, when we walk by the Spirit and always put to death the practices of the body, the indwelling Spirit will transfuse the life of God into our body and will give life to our mortal body. In this way, our whole being-spirit, soul, and body-will be fully mingled with the Triune God.<h2 class=head1>ONENESS NULLIFYING THE NATURAL MAN, THE WORLD, SATAN, AND THE SELF</h2><p>This mingling of the Triune God is in you, in me, and in every saint. Moreover, the common and unique life which is in all the millions of believers has mingled us all into one. This is the oneness of the Body. This oneness has nullified all of our old creation and the natural man. This is accomplished by the Father&#8217;s name and the Father&#8217;s life. This oneness has also sanctified us from the Satan-ensnared world and has freed us from the world and Satan. This is the effect of the Father&#8217;s word of reality. Finally, this oneness will deliver us from the self so that there will be only God, and the splendid glory of divinity will be expressed.<p>May the Lord be merciful to us that we would see this revelation and would genuinely practice this oneness. Our human source, our natural life, the world with Satan, and even our selves are all put aside to allow this Triune God who is mingling Himself in us to fill and saturate us, with the result that the radiance of His divinity and the splendor of His glory are expressed, thus attaining to the highest level of oneness. This then is the church. In this oneness our natural source, life, and element are all nullified. The world is put aside, our self has no more ground, and spontaneously we will be in one accord.<p>After studying the Bible and looking into church history, we realize that although this matter is revealed in God&#8217;s holy Word in such a way, the practice of the church on earth is greatly contrary to such revelation. Many problems arose and even divisions were created as a result of man becoming the source and man&#8217;s natural life being active. In the church life, when there is too much human natural element, there will be opinions. First, they will create dissension. Later, they will lead to division, and eventually, they will end up in sects. This kind of thing has happened again and again throughout the last two thousand years. Those of us in the Lord&#8217;s recovery are no exception to this. From 1933 when I entered the work of the Lord&#8217;s recovery until today we have had a storm every few years. It seems as if this matter is a cycle. It is like our own body when infected with germs or poison. When the time is ripe, the sickness surfaces.<p>Recently, I have spent some time to list all the great and small problems in the churches in the New Testament. From the murmuring of the Hellenistic saints in Acts 6 to the failure of the church in Laodicea in Revelation 3, there were altogether fifty-one cases (see the book The Intrinsic Problem in the Lord&#8217;s Recovery Today and Its Scriptural Remedy, chapter 3, published by Living Stream Ministry). We can say that all of them violated the genuine oneness the Lord gave to the church. For this reason, I treasure the oneness all the more. May we all emphasize the oneness that the Lord has given us and preserve the oneness of the Spirit by being mingled constantly with the Triune God, thus removing the natural man, the world, and our self, and satisfying the aspiration of the Lord&#8217;s desire.<h2 class=head1>THE EXPRESSION OF THE LORD&#8217;S BODY</h2><h2 class=head2>The Church Being the Body, the Fullness of Christ, Being Mingled with the Triune God</h2><p>In the first message we mentioned the aspiration in the Lord&#8217;s desire, which is the oneness of the believers. In this message we come to the pleasure of the Lord&#8217;s heart, which is the expression and service of His Body. The thing that pleases the Lord the most is the expression of His Body and the service to Him. Let us first consider the expression of the Lord&#8217;s Body.<p>Ephesians 1:23 says that the church &#8220;is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&#8221; The church is the Body of Christ. It is not a human organization but the organism of the Triune God. This Body is the fullness of Christ. Fullness means expression. Christ is the all-inclusive, expansive God. He is so vast that He fills all and is in all. Such a great Christ requires the church to be His fullness that He may have a full expression.<p>When we come to Ephesians 4:4-6, we see one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and One God and Father of all, who is over all, through all, and in all. This shows us that the Body of Christ is uniquely one. In this unique Body is the one Spirit. At the same time this Body is of one Lord and is constituted by one God and Father who is over all, through all, and in all. Hence, this Body of Christ is fully mingled with the Triune God as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>Many Believers Being Baptized into One Body, Being Members in Particular</h2><p>Furthermore, this Body of Christ is composed of all the regenerated believers. First Corinthians 12 says that we were all baptized in one Spirit into one Body (v. 13) and are members in particular (v. 27). As soon as we were baptized, we were brought into an organic union with the Triune God to become living members of the Body of Christ. Furthermore, He has placed all the members in the Body even as He willed (v. 18). Each one of us members has our own place in the Body of Christ. It is assigned by God, and should be accepted by us. Since such an assignment is according to God&#8217;s will, every member is necessary (v. 21). Especially those members who are not comely are more necessary (vv. 22-23).<p>God has not merely placed all the members in the Body. He has even mingled them together. Verses 24 and 25 say, &#8220;But God has tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked, that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.&#8221; According to His will, God has placed and tempered us, the different members of Christ, together. It is as if we have been married. There can be no divorce. No matter how we feel, whether the situation is good or bad, easy or difficult, we all need more transformation to practice the Body life through the one Spirit so that every member will receive abundant honor.<h2 class=head2>Being Members One of Another, Living and Expressing Christ Together</h2><p>The purpose of us believers being members one of another in the Body of Christ is that we would live Christ and express Him together (Rom. 12:5). According to the New Testament, none of us believers can live and work alone apart from the Body. Our living and work must all be in the Body of Christ. As members of the Body of Christ, we are not separate and complete individual units. Rather, we should coordinate together to become the many parts of the one whole. What the Lord wants is not individual members, but a whole Body. However, most Christians are negligent concerning this matter. They think it is all right as long as they love and fear the Lord and preach the gospel to bring others to salvation. But as far as the expression of the Lord&#8217;s Body is concerned, this is not good at all. We have to see that in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, one great item is the recovery of the Lord&#8217;s Body. All of our living and work must be in the Body of Christ. We do not live Christ alone. Rather, we live Christ with all the members. In this way we will express Christ in a corporate way. By ourselves, none of us is the fullness of Christ. It is the church as the Body that is the fullness of Christ and the expression of Christ.<h2 class=head2>Growing into Christ, Being out from the Head, and Fitted, Knitted, Growing, and Building</h2><p>For this reason, all of us members have to hold to truth in love that we may grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things (Eph. 4:15). Through the love of Christ within us, we love Christ and the members of His Body. In this love we hold to the reality, which is to hold to Christ with His Body. In this way we will have Christ increase in us in all things, and we will grow into the Head, Christ. The word &#8220;Head&#8221; here indicates that our growth in Christ should be a growth as members in the Body under the Head. Hence, our growth is not only in Christ but also in His Body.<p>When we grow into the Head in this way, we can produce out from the Head many functions for the building up of His Body. Ephesians 4:16 tells us that out from the Head the whole Body is joined closely together through every joint of the rich supply and is knit together through the operation in measure of each one part to grow together and to build up itself in love so that Christ may have a full expression. Every one of us as members of the Body of Christ has a measure through the growth in life and can function for the growth and building up of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head2>The Service in the Lord&#8217;s Body Having the Same Triune God, but with Different Operations, Ministries, and Gifts</h2><p>Now let us come to the second main point, which is the service in the Lord&#8217;s Body. The service in the Lord&#8217;s Body is related to the operation of the Triune God in all the members. First Corinthians 12:4-6 shows us that we have the same God but different operations; we have the same Lord but different ministries; and we have the same Spirit but different gifts. Here we can see that the gifts come through the Spirit, the ministries are initiated by the Lord, and the operations are of God. Here the Triune God is related to the gifts, the ministries, and the operations. The gifts that come through the Spirit are to accomplish the ministries for the Lord through which the functions that result from the operations and works of God are manifested. This is the operation of the Triune God in the believers for the accomplishment of God&#8217;s plan unto the building up of the church, which is the Body of Christ, as the full expression of Christ.<h2 class=head2>The Members Serving Christ Together through the Gifts in Life with the Miraculous Gifts</h2><p>Following this, from verses 7 to 11, we see that the many gifts of the many members are the manifestation of the Spirit in all the members, being manifested in words of wisdom, words of knowledge, faith, healing, works of power, prophecy, discerning of spirits, tongues, and interpretation of tongues. Most of these are the miraculous gifts from the Spirit. The Spirit manifests Himself in this way in all the members so that the Body of Christ will receive the profit.<p>Other than the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, there are also the gifts that come from the growth in life of the members. This is mainly recorded in Romans 12:4-8. Here the members of the Body receive different gifts according to the grace given to each one, from which are produced different functions, whether they be prophecy, or service, or teaching, or exhortation, or giving, or leading, or showing mercy. All these are gifts produced through the growth in life. Every one of us as members of the Body of Christ has received a gift from God. This gift is God in Christ as the divine element entering into us as our life and enjoyment. When this grace enters into us, it brings in the element of spiritual skill and capability, which is developed into gifts of life through the growth of life within us. In this way, we will be able to serve Christ and function in His Body.<p>Therefore, there are two categories of gifts: the miraculous gifts of the Spirit and the gifts that come through the growth in life. The former are mainly for work and service, and the latter are mainly for the growth of the Body. The service in the Body of Christ cannot depend merely on the miraculous gifts. There is the need for the matching of the gifts of life. The Body service that the Lord is after is one in which the members serve Christ and propagate Him together through the miraculous gifts of the Spirit with the gifts that come through the growth in life in the members.<p>We all need to see the genuine oneness, the proper one accord, and the expression and service of the Body of Christ. With this basic understanding, many of the problems among us can be avoided and much misunderstanding between each other can be removed. The reason we cannot be one or cannot be in one accord is because the view is short and the viewpoints are different. But if we have this basic understanding and allow the divine revelation to enter into us, there will spontaneously be the one accord, which will bring in the genuine oneness, and there will be the expression and service of the Body of Christ.<p><p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on April 6, 1990)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE LIVING IN THE BODY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Col. 1:18; Eph. 4:15-16; Rom. 12:5; Eph. 5:23-24; 1 Tim. 5:17a; 1 Cor. 3:10a; Heb. 13:17; 2 Cor. 3:17; Rom. 8:11, 13; Phil. 1:8; 1 Cor. 12:25b-26</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Living corporately with the members under the Head-Col. 1:18:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Having the Head as the life, the principal object, and the center-Eph. 4:15-16.</li>	<li>Coordinating with the members to live a life which expresses the Head-Rom. 12:5.</li>	</ol></li><li>Authority in the Body:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The authority of the Head flowing throughout the Body-Eph. 5:23-24.</li>	<li>The deputy authorities carrying out the authority of the Head:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>There being elders in the local churches-1 Tim. 5:17a.</li>		<li>There being leading co-workers in the work-1 Cor. 3:10a.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>All the members submitting directly to the Head-Eph. 5:24a.</li>	<li>At the same time all the members also submitting to the deputies of the Head-Heb. 13:17.</li>	</ol></li><li>The authority of the Spirit and the Body:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Spirit being the embodiment of the Head-2 Cor. 3:17.</li>	<li>The Spirit living and moving in the members-Rom. 8:11, 13.</li>	</ol></li><li>The members&#8217; feeling for the Body:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Taking the Head&#8217;s feeling as their own feeling-Phil. 1:8.</li>	<li>In the principle of caring for the Body-1 Cor. 12:25b-26.</li>	<li>In mind, thoughts, words, and actions, taking the Body as the rule, with no separation or disconnection from the Body.</li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class=head1>THE NEED TO SEE THE BODY</h2><p>We have seen that the Lord&#8217;s aspiration is for all His believers to be one and that the Lord&#8217;s pleasure is to have a Body to express and serve Him. This kind of concept is far beyond our natural human thought. In the New Testament, there are three books, other than Colossians, that discuss the Body of Christ in detail. One of these three books is Romans (mainly chapter twelve). Another one is 1 Corinthians (mainly chapter twelve). The third one is Ephesians.<p>Ephesians 1 begins with the Father God&#8217;s selection and predestination in eternity past, passes through Christ&#8217;s accomplished redemption, with the Spirit&#8217;s sealing and anointing, and through the power of resurrection and ascension and the power that operated in Christ to subject all things to Him and to head up all things in Him, and ends with the church, which is the Body of Christ, the fullness of Him who fills all in all. Such expressions could never be composed by the human mind. They amply prove that the Bible is the inspiration of God. Although with difficulty we understand a little that the church is the Body of Christ, such a thing is not in our concept basically. This is the reason we have neglected this matter in our practice for so many years.<p>Five years ago we began to change the system. The reason we have to thoroughly replace, according to the Bible, our past methods is that they have produced serious effects. At the beginning we had our practice according to the truth of the Bible, with co-workers raised up by God to receive the commission from Him to convey God&#8217;s word to produce churches. Elders were then set up to administrate these churches. This is absolutely correct. But in the past decades, after practicing this way for so long, we have unconsciously developed it into a system. By doing so, the organic aspect of the Body of Christ has gradually been annulled. As a result, a situation has evolved in which we do not have the name of a clergy-laity system, but in reality there is such a system. A minority of people has usurped the life-function of all the saints. The main parts of the real service fall on the shoulders of the co-workers and elders. All the others are there only as helpers and supplements. How can this be considered the Body service? The result is that the Body of Christ is almost nullified.<p>Although the system has been changed for a few years now, to this day we still dare not say that we have the Body service. The main emphasis of the change of system is on removing the minority and having all the members do everything. Although all the churches here have accepted the new way, the intrinsic condition is still not satisfactory; we still do not have every member participating in the practices of the service. We are still quite far from this goal.<h2 class=head1>THE BURDEN STILL BEING THAT THE SAINTS WOULD BE ORGANIC</h2><p>In Romans 15, Paul said that he was a priest of the gospel of God, offering the saved Gentiles to God (v. 16). In 1 Peter 2, Peter said that we are a priesthood built up for the telling out of the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light (vv. 5, 9). This is not an individual preaching the gospel, but the Body preaching the gospel. In the past, among us we had the so-called gospel preaching by the church. On a specified date, a big gospel meeting was called, and all the saints were mobilized to coordinate together. Because the light of the revelation was not strong enough, it was more an outward activity rather than an inward organic matter.<p>At present, the church here is divided into over a hundred and thirty districts. There is also the practice of the gospel, the home meetings, the group meetings, and the district meetings. We can say that there is a definite initial form of the new way and that the new way is beginning to take off. But there is still not much of an organic functioning that originates from within as a result of the saints seeing the revelation. Only when we reach this stage can we consider ourselves as being fully on the track. However, this cannot be accomplished in one or two days. We human beings are living creatures, and it is not that easy to change. There are concepts, habits, and tastes which cannot be removed by force. Notwithstanding, I think that your condition is getting better every year.<p>My burden in coming back this time is still that the saints would be organic. In the past I came back to change the system. This time I hope that I can change your viewpoint, so that you can realize that only by the saints being organic will anything really work. There is no need to worry about anything. As long as the saints are able to serve organically, all that we hope for will spontaneously come to pass. For this reason, I began by speaking about the oneness of the believers. This oneness originates from the Father as the source and has the Father&#8217;s life as the element. Hence, this oneness is organic. Furthermore, this oneness is produced by the Father&#8217;s word of reality, which sanctifies us from the world. And it is also produced by the Father&#8217;s glory, which delivers us from ourselves. Based on this oneness we can have the proper one accord. Our speaking, thinking, perception, and love will all be in the Triune God. Then we will have the living and service of the Body.<h2 class=head1>NO NEED TO DEMAND, BUT TO WORK IN AN ORGANIC WAY</h2><p>I know that while you are serving in the different meeting halls, there are difficulties. Some elders may not be one. This has to do with your degree of maturity, your concern, your view or perception, and the extent to which you give yourself. Hence, we should not put demands on each other. Even if you make demands on others, they may not be able to do it. Everyone should just work in an organic way. You should believe that as long as you go forward, some will follow. Making demands will only create problems, and, even more, condemning others will accomplish nothing. Hence, you do not need to demand or condemn at all. Just do as much as you can. If you cannot do it, just wait. You can only pick the grapes when they are ripe. For this reason, we have to strive, but we also have to be patient.<p>In the last message, we said that the Triune God has been consummated to become the Spirit and that He is in our spirit. Hence, we all have to learn to live in this mingled spirit. When we are about to speak, we should touch the inner feeling to see if we are in the spirit or not. If we are not in the spirit, even if what we do is good, God will not be pleased with it. Originally, we may want to say something, but when we turn to the spirit, we may choose not to speak. If we learn to live in the spirit this way, others will follow us. In this way, one by one they will walk according to the spirit and touch life, and they will spontaneously have an organic service.<h2 class=head1>THE LIVING IN THE BODY</h2><h2 class=head2>What God Desires Being the Body and Not Individuals</h2><p>Now we must consider the matter of the living in the Body. On the one hand, the Body is for the expression of Christ; on the other hand, it is for the corporate service to Christ. For expression, its emphasis is on life, and life requires a kind of living. We have to see clearly that not only our service is a matter of the Body, but even our living is a matter of the Body. Practically speaking, however, we are not used to living a Body life. This matter depends on the degree of our understanding. Strictly speaking, according to the revelation of the New Testament, a person who truly touches God&#8217;s heart and is an overcomer in the eyes of God is one who is living in the Body and practicing the Body life. He is not spiritual individually and is not overcoming individually. Rather, he understands clearly that he is a member in the Body.<p>No member can live apart from the Body, yet almost all of us live an abnormal life. We may think that as long as we do not love the world or lust after sin, we are all right. But in fact this is not enough. The most important thing is whether or not we are living in the Body. Is our loving of the Lord and being spiritual, sanctified, and overcoming something in ourselves or something in the Body? If it is in ourselves, it is not worth much. Humanly speaking, it is better to be spiritual than not to be spiritual, and it is better not to commit sin than to commit sin. But from the view of God&#8217;s eternal economy, unless we are in the Body, whether or not we are spiritual and whether or not we sin are not worth much. God is not after a group of spiritual and sinless people. Rather, He is after a Body. Only our being in the Body will have eternal value in the eyes of God.<h2 class=head2>Living Corporately with the Members under the Head</h2><p>To live in the Body is to live corporately with the members under the Head (Col. 1:18). To live the Body life, first we must be under the Head and take the Head as the life, the principal object, and the center (Eph. 4:15-16). Many people desire to be holy, spiritual, and overcoming. But these are their own desires. They are not under Christ the Head. Instead they are their own head. This makes them unable to live the Body life. To have the Body life, whatever we think or do has to be under the control of Christ the Head; we have to take Him as the center of our whole being. Second, we have to coordinate with all the members to live a life that expresses the Head (Rom. 12:5). We have to learn to live in the Body and submit to the Head all the time, to care for the feeling of the Body, and to live together with all the members. We should not take our own spirituality, holiness, or victory as the center. This will make us particular and individualistic and will cause us to condemn others and make demands on them. Neither should we try to keep some regulations and conform ourselves to others. Rather, we should live in the Spirit to express Christ in an organic and coordinated way.<h2 class=head2>Authority in the Body</h2><p>In order to live in the Body, we also have to recognize the authority in the Body. In a body, there is surely authority. Our human body is very orderly. In the same way, God has placed the members, each one of them, in the Body (1 Cor. 12:18) and has blended them together (1 Cor. 12:24). Every member has his own place ordained by God, and everyone should be in order. This is a fact with which we have to come to terms. By doing so, we will neither overestimate ourselves nor despise others, and we will not have any complaints or feel mistreated. All the members are under the authority in the Body.<p>In the matter of the authority in the Body, first and foremost is the need for the authority of the Head flowing throughout the whole Body (Eph. 5:23-24). In addition, there is deputy authority. In the local churches there are the elders (1 Tim. 5:17a), and in the work there are the leading co-workers (1 Cor. 3:10a). All these are deputy authorities, carrying out the authority of the Head. Hence, in the Body of Christ there is also order in authority. On the one hand, all the members submit directly to the Head (Eph. 5:24a). On the other hand, they submit to the deputies of the Head (Heb. 13:17). When we feel that we are submitting directly to the Head, we must also care for the Body. It is impossible for us to say that we are submitting to the authority of the Head without caring for the Body. We have to take care of both aspects. We should submit to Christ, and we should also submit to the church. Only then is the submission proper. If we would only submit to Christ, without submitting to the Body, that kind of submission will cause problems. If no one cares for the Body, but everyone considers that he is submitting to the Head directly, division will result in the Body. Only by our submitting to the Head on the one hand and to the Body on the other hand can the Head be pleased and the Body preserved.<h2 class=head2>The Authority of the Spirit and the Body</h2><p>Following this, we have to consider the authority of the Spirit and the Body. Second Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit. Thus, we can see that the Spirit is Christ and is therefore the embodiment of the Head. Today, He is living and moving in the members (Rom. 8:11, 13). Hence, if we are to live the Body life, we must submit to the Spirit and walk according to the Spirit. Otherwise, we are not living in the Body. A person who lives in the Body must surely submit to the Spirit, for to submit to the Spirit is to accept the authority of the Head in the Body.<h2 class=head2>The Members&#8217; Feeling for the Body</h2><p>Since we are the members of the Body of Christ, we should have a feeling for the Body. First, we must take the feeling of the Head as our own feeling. In Philippians 1:8 Paul said, &#8220;I long after you all in the inward parts of Christ Jesus.&#8217;&#8217; This means that Paul took the inward parts of Christ Jesus as his own inward parts in caring for the church. This also means that he took care of the Body of Christ by taking Christ&#8217;s feeling as his own feeling. Christ&#8217;s feeling became his feeling for the Body. We all should be like Paul, taking the feeling of the Head as our own feeling. This is most necessary for our living the Body life. Furthermore, we should not only take the feeling of the Head as our feeling, but also do so in the principle of caring for the Body. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 12:25b-26 that &#8220;the members should have the same care for one another. And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if a member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it.&#8217;&#8217; In order for us to have the Body life, we must care for our fellow members and must be full of feeling for the Body.<p>If we as members have the feeling of the Head in everything and care for the Body, we will take the Body as the rule in our mind, thoughts, words, and actions. We should deny ourselves and should identify ourselves with the Body. By doing this, there will be no separation or disconnection from the Body. The life that we live will fully be the Body life, and the Lord will gain the expression of His Body.<p><p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on April 7, 1990)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SERVICE OF THE BODY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6; 5:9-10; Rom. 15:16; Eph. 4:11-12; Mark 16:15-16; Luke 10:2-3a, 5-6; 1 Thes. 2:7; John 21:15; 1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 23a, 24-25, 31; 1 Pet. 2:2; Rom. 12:1; Col. 1:28-29.</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The service of the Body being the service of the New Testament priests-1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6; 5:9-10:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Being a built-up priesthood in which everyone participates and coordinates in service.</li>	<li>Their duty being the preaching of the gospel to save sinners, making them sacrifices for the building up of the Body of Christ, the house of God-Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:9b, 5b; Eph. 4:11-12.</li>	</ol></li><li>The procedure in the service of the Body:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Preaching the gospel to save sinners-Mark 16:15-16; Luke 10:2-3a, 5-6.</li>	<li>Feeding the lambs as a nursing mother-1 Thes. 2:7; John 21:15.</li>	<li>Perfecting the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ-Eph. 4:11-12.</li>	<li>Prophesying for the Lord for the building up of the church-1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 23a, 24-25, 31.</li>	</ol></li><li>The three steps of offering by the priests of the gospel in the church service:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Preaching the gospel to save sinners, offering them up as sacrifices to God-1 Pet. 2:9b, 5b; Rom. 15:16.</li>	<li>Nourishing the believers so that they may grow up in life to present themselves as sacrifices to God-1 Pet. 2:2; Rom. 12:1.</li>	<li>Laboring and struggling according to the Lord&#8217;s operation which operates in us in power to warn and teach every saint in all wisdom, that we may present every one of them full grown in Christ-Col. 1:28-29.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>We have seen that the living in the Body is for the expression of Christ. Now we have to see that the service in the Body is for the ministering of Christ. Superficially speaking, one cannot find one clear phrase in the whole New Testament that mentions the service in the Body. But if we put together the portions in the Scripture concerning service, we can see a clear picture of the Body service. The term service implies a lot. Mainly it denotes ministry. In the original language, ministry and service are the same word. We can say that ministry is service and service is ministry. At the same time, service includes work.<h2 class=head1>SERVING IN THE BODY</h2><p>We all know that we do not live for our living, but for our work, that is, for the accomplishment of something. This is the goal. It is more important than our living. However, without our living, we cannot work. We have to live properly before we can work diligently. The two are related to each other. I hope that from now on you would have the deep impression that the Christian living is corporate and of the Body; it is not individualistic. The reason for this is that we are all members in the Body of Christ and cannot be independent. If a member is separated from the Body, it will dry up and will be unrelated to the Body. It will then have nothing to do with all the riches in the Body. Hence, all of our living must be in the Body. Furthermore, even our service, work, and move must be in the Body.<p>Serving, working, and moving in the Body mean not being independent. Whatever you are doing for the Lord, whether it is the preaching of the gospel, the feeding of the lambs, the perfecting of people in the group meetings, or the prophesying in the district meetings, you must remember that you are not doing it alone, but are doing it in the Body. When you work, it is Christ working; it is also the Body of Christ working. Seeing such a thing encourages us very much. It also puts us very much on the alert. We have to be careful about our speaking and actions, for we are the members of the Body. This feeling for the Body is very precious. It is what is usually known as one&#8217;s frame of mind. The frame of mind is one&#8217;s perception of things and is very crucial. When there is the proper and thorough perception of matters, the frame of mind is normal; otherwise, the frame of mind is not normal. If the frame of mind becomes very abnormal, there is mental illness. Strictly speaking, we Christians are somewhat &#8220;mentally ill&#8217;&#8217; in regards to the matter of the Body of Christ. If we do not have an adequate understanding of the Body of Christ, our frame of mind is not proper, and we will not be able to have the common recognition of the Body of Christ. Hence, we must understand that our being Christians is fully a communal matter. In order to seek after spirituality, we must be in the Body. Also, in order to serve the Lord, we must not be detached from the Body. Once we are detached, we are through.<p>The difference between the new way and the old way lies here. The old way did not make it necessary for us to be attached to other members. It was individualistic and not of the Body. This is contrary to the Scriptures. The principle of the Bible is that everyone has to preach the gospel. All must not only preach but also preach corporately. We become a team in the Body. Everyone functions. At the same time, there is coordination, and no one is independent. The old way has one great drawback, which is that in it the organic function of all the members was killed. Only a few capable ones were left there working. Nothing of the Body was seen. Hence, in the new way every saint is able to serve organically, and every member is attached to the Body to receive the life supply in the Body and to coordinate and function together.<h2 class=head1>THE SERVICE OF THE BODY BEING THE SERVICE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS</h2><h2 class=head2>Being Built Up into a Priesthood in Which Everyone Participates and Coordinates in Service</h2><p>The Body service that the Lord is after is the service of the New Testament priests. Peter told us in 1 Peter 2:5 through 9 that we are the living stones to be built up as the house of God and become a holy and royal priesthood. This built up priesthood is one in which everyone participates and coordinates in service, where we tell out together the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. This is the Body preaching the gospel for the offering up of spiritual sacrifices. According to Peter&#8217;s word, we the New Testament priests are to be transformed into living stones in the hand of God and are being built into a &#8220;hood.&#8217;&#8217; This building requires some time. It cannot be produced overnight. For us to preach the gospel, we must first be built up. Once we are built up, we become a &#8220;hood&#8217;&#8217;; and when this &#8220;hood&#8217;&#8217; preaches the gospel, it is the Body preaching the gospel. Here everyone preaches the gospel, yet no one preaches individualistically. Rather, everyone has a part, and at the same time all coordinate together.<p>Some have thought that it is an easy thing to change from the old way to the new way. Actually, this is not true. But it is true that this is the way to serve with the priesthood. Just wait and see; in another ten years it will be A.D. 2000. I believe that by then not only you and I will be preaching the gospel by visiting people, but also a lot of other Christians will be doing so. They will all take this new way. Now, in places overseas, especially in the United States, the glimmer of the new way has gradually begun to appear. Many Christians know that to depend on spiritual giants does not work any longer. These Christians are constantly improving their methods. Unless it is the whole Body moving, and moving in coordination, the Lord&#8217;s gospel will have no way on earth today. This is the reason that we have to change the system. However, we should not be impatient, and we should not try to be hasty. Such things cannot be done hastily. There is the need to labor and to be patient.<p>Since coming back this time and seeing your meetings here, I feel confident about your practice of the new way. I also have seen a few good testimonies in the United States. In the San Gabriel Valley, near Anaheim, two churches were raised up within the last two years; one is in Monterey Park, and the other is in San Gabriel. The former began with about thirty people. Now after two years, they have increased to about a hundred and fifty. The rate of increase has been quite fast. This is the result of practicing the new way. The latter church began with about fifteen people. Now in the Chinese-speaking meetings, they have over fifty people. In the English-speaking meetings, they have over thirty people. They do not have big gospel campaigns, and they do not have spiritual giants. All of them are ordinary saints. Every one of them is working there. If you asked them to change back to the old way, to have one man speaking and all the rest listening, they would be unwilling to do so. This is because in the new way, in the Body of Christ, everyone is serving and everyone is organic.<p>I have recently discovered that whoever opposes the new way and attacks me or my ministry becomes dead within. But whoever practices the new way and receives my ministry becomes living. Life is from God and death is from the Devil, who has the power of death. Whoever accepts the new way becomes overcoming and rejoicing, and whoever opposes the new way becomes sad and dead. This shows us where the living God is and where the death-reigning Devil is. I know that Satan hates me. It is because I have been commissioned by the Lord. This commission is not just the release of His word. Since 1984 I have been very clear that the Lord wants me to change the old way and to promote the new way that the Body of Christ may be recovered. Because of this, Satan and all the demons have risen up to launch their attacks.<p>Hence, we all have to see clearly that what the Lord wants and desires is the Body service. The Body service is the service of the New Testament priests. When all the saints are the New Testament priests and are built up into a priesthood with everyone participating and coordinating to serve together, we will have a healthy Body service.<h2 class=head2>Their Duty Being the Preaching of the Gospel to Save Sinners, Making Them Sacrifices for the Building Up of the Body of Christ, the House of God</h2><p>According to the revelation of the Bible, the main work of the New Testament priests of the gospel is the saving of the repentant sinners and the offering of them as sacrifices to God. These sacrifices are the material for the building up of the Body of Christ, the house of God. Hence, what we are doing here today is not merely the preaching of the gospel to save sinners, but the offering up of the saved ones as sacrifices to God. Once they are offered up, they become materials for the building up of the Body of Christ. Hence, the New Testament gospel begins with the preaching of the gospel for the saving of sinners and continues unto the completion of the building up of the Body of Christ. This is the duty of the New Testament priests of the gospel (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:9b, 5b; Eph. 4:11-12).<h2 class=head1>THE PROCEDURE IN THE SERVICE OF THE BODY</h2><h2 class=head2>Preaching the Gospel to Save the Sinners</h2><p>Now let us look at the procedure in the service of the Body. The first step is the preaching of the gospel for the saving of sinners (Mark 16:15-16; Luke 10:2-3a, 5-6). In the past we preached the gospel by visiting people at their doors. Now I would strongly recommend the way of preaching the gospel by telephone. You must first study to find out how we should get the telephone numbers. This kind of gospel preaching is easier and faster than preaching the gospel through visiting people. Over the telephone we do not have to force people to come. We can say, &#8220;We are believers of the Lord Jesus, and we love the Lord. We like to, number one, preach the gospel to people, number two, introduce the truth, and number three, help people to know the Bible. Which one would you like? If you would tell us, we can arrange a time to come and talk to you. And if you would like to, we can pray together now over the phone.&#8217;&#8217; If you do this, and especially if the sisters do this, you will surely meet some willing receivers. You can try this out. Another way is to write gospel letters. With the letters you can enclose a return mail response card. On the response card there can be a few suggestions. For example, one can be, &#8220;Can we come to your home to discuss with you the gospel of Jesus Christ?&#8217;&#8217; Another may say, &#8220;If you have believed in Jesus, we would like to discuss the Bible with you face-to-face.&#8217;&#8217; You can add other things as well. The goal is to get an answer to your letter. All three methods are useful. Those of you who do not want to go out to visit people can write gospel letters. Those who do not like to write letters can make telephone calls. Whichever way you take, you can find willing receivers. In short, you have to practice a lot and study a lot. Later on, others may find other ways of gaining people.<h2 class=head2>Feeding the Lambs as a Nursing Mother</h2><p>The second step is the feeding of the lambs as a nursing mother. The Lord Jesus asked Peter in John 21, &#8220;Do you love Me?&#8217;&#8217; If he did, he should feed the lambs (v. 15). Not only do we have to save the sinners, but we also have to feed them, as nursing mothers cherish their own babies (1 Thes. 2:7). I met a couple who brought sixteen people to salvation within a few months after they were baptized. Among them one- third attend meetings regularly. When this couple stands up to give testimonies, they are like a mother to a group of children. Hence, the new way works. But no matter how much it works, it depends on man taking this way. As long as we labor and strive, we can keep people and help them to grow in life.<h2 class=head2>Perfecting the Saints unto the Building Up of the Body of Christ</h2><p>The third step is the perfecting of the saints unto the building up of the Body of Christ. This step is the fulfillment of Ephesians 4. There it says that all the gifts are for the perfecting of the saints. The perfected saints will then go out to perfect others. Eventually, everyone will be able to do the work of the ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ. In the Body service, we must perfect the saints to be able to do what the gifts, that is, the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers, can do. The gifted ones work first for a while. When the saints can work by themselves, they can go away to perfect others. At a certain point, everyone will be able to work and perfect others.<h2 class=head2>Prophesying for the Lord for the Building Up of the Church</h2><p>The fourth step is the prophesying for the Lord unto the building up of the church. Concerning prophesying, Paul said clearly in 1 Corinthians 14 that first we all have to desire prophesying (v. 1). To prophesy is not to foretell; rather, it is to speak building up and encouragement and consolation to men (vv. 3-5). Furthermore, this prophesying is something that every one of us can do, so that &#8220;all may learn and all be encouraged&#8217;&#8217; (v. 31). Prophesying is not only the capability of every believer, it is also the most excellent gift for the Body (v. 12). If there is no prophesying in a local church, there will be no excelling gift. The practice of the old way did not apply this excelling gift. Now for the service of the Body we all have to learn, exercise, and use the excelling gift of prophesying to speak for the Lord, to speak the Lord forth, and to speak the Lord into others for the building up of the church, the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE THREE STEPS OF OFFERING BY THE PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL IN THE CHURCH SERVICE</h2><h2 class=head2>Preaching the Gospel to Save Sinners, Offering Them as Sacrifices to God</h2><p>Finally, we have to see the three steps of offering by the priests of the gospel in the church service. The first step is the preaching of the gospel for the bringing in of the saved sinners to be offered up as sacrifices to God (1 Pet. 2:9b, 5b; Rom. 15:16). We should never merely lead sinners to salvation without offering them up as sacrifices to God. There is a big difference here. As soon as you lead a person to salvation, you should offer him up. You have to pray for this matter. Perhaps you have to pray with them and offer them up in a serious way as sacrifices to God.<h2 class=head2>Nourishing the Believers so that They May Grow Up in Life to Present Themselves as Sacrifices to God</h2><p>The second step of offering is the nourishing of the believers that they may grow in life and may present themselves as sacrifices to God. We feed the newborn babes with milk that they may grow (1 Pet. 2:2). Then, we beseech them, according to Romans 12:1, by the compassions of God, so that they would present themselves as a living sacrifice to God. This is different from our offering of them to God at the time of their salvation. At that time they were babes. Now they have grown up and can present themselves as living sacrifices to God.<h2 class=head2>In All Wisdom Warning and Teaching Every Saint that Everyone May Be Presented Full-grown in Christ</h2><p>The third step of the offering of the gospel priests is that we the gospel preachers use all wisdom to warn and to teach every man that they may be presented full-grown in Christ to God (Col. 1:28). This is not an easy work. For this reason, Paul said that he was laboring and struggling according to the Lord&#8217;s operation, which operated in him in power (Col. 1:29). This is not just a work, but also a struggling. Hence, for this we have to labor and struggle. This is like competing for the crown in the Olympic games or like wrestling to win. These require labor and struggling. The goal is to present every saint full-grown to God. This is what Ephesians 4 speaks of. We have to arrive at a full-grown man, at being full of the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (v. 13). In this way, we will accomplish the building up of the Body of Christ.<p>I hope that since you were born in this age and have heard this word, you would dive into the flow of this new way and would catch up with the Lord&#8217;s leading. We live and serve in the Body in such a way, and we lead others to live and serve in the Body, so that everyone can be just as we are and can realize their function as members and live in the Body. Eventually, what we can do, they will be able to do also. Each one of us will be functioning and will coordinate to serve together. This service is for everyone, and it is in the Body. Only then will the will of God be accomplished. This is the law in our service. It is also the law of God. By the Lord&#8217;s mercy, what we are passing on to the brothers and sisters is not something rash and light; rather, it is based on the Bible and came about through much consideration and study. May the Lord be merciful to us. The future of the new way is very bright. May we all strive to walk in it.<p><p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on April 8, 1990)</body></html>
