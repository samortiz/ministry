<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE NECESSITY FOR PRAYER TO BE IN RESURRECTION</h1><h2 class=head1>I. THE INDICATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT TYPE</h2><p>Beginning with chapter thirteen, we have been dealing with the various aspects of prayer based on the Old Testament types. We have covered the matter concerning the cross and prayer based on the relationship between the offering altar and the incense altar. We have covered the matter of life supply and prayer based on the relationship between the showbread table and the incense altar. Based on the relationship between the golden lampstand and the incense altar, we have also covered the matter of life illumination and prayer. Now, based on the type of the incense altar itself, we shall see the necessity for prayer to be in resurrection.<p>In spiritual experience, the outer court of the tabernacle denotes the earth, the earthly aspect; whereas, the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies denote the heavens, the heavenly aspect. Whatever is heavenly is in resurrection. The showbread table signifies that the Lord is our bread of life. This is of the heavenly aspect and is, therefore, in resurrection. The golden lampstand indicates that the Lord is our light of life. This is also of the heavenly aspect and in resurrection. The incense altar which denotes man’s prayer before God is entirely something in resurrection.<p>Whenever the Bible speaks of man going before God to burn the incense, it invariably refers to man going before God to pray. For example, in the beginning of the Gospel of Luke, it says that Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist, entered the temple of the Lord to burn incense. Then it refers to the people praying outside at the hour of incense. Also, Revelation chapters five and eight tell us that the burning of incense before God is the prayer of the saints ascending to God. Therefore, to burn the incense is to pray.<p>Among the spices that are burnt on the incense altar, the principal one is frankincense. In the Bible, frankincense specifically signifies resurrection, just as myrrh denotes death. The frankincense which is burnt on the incense altar is a symbol of resurrection. When the sweet-smelling savor ascends, there is altogether an atmosphere in resurrection. Hence, according to the type in the Old Testament, man going before God to burn incense is entirely a matter in resurrection. This indicates that man’s prayers before God must be in resurrection.<p>Although we are praying on earth today, strictly speaking, every prayer must be in the position of ascension. And although we who pray are humans, every prayer needs to be in resurrection. For our prayer to be acceptable to God and be considered by God as a sweet-smelling savor, it must be in ascension and in resurrection. There is no burning of incense, no prayer, at the offering altar. All the incense must be burnt at the incense altar. I believe this picture in typology is very clear.<p>In the tabernacle setting one must pass through the offering altar, the laver, the showbread table, and the lampstand, and then arrive at the incense altar. This entire picture is for one thing: that man may go before God to burn incense, that is, to utter prayers before God by drawing near to God and contacting God. Such prayer is absolutely in resurrection.
