He has appointed deputy authority in all human government and institutions. All the brothers and sisters in the church have to learn to submit to the authority of the elders. We obey the elders because they are the Lord's deputy authority in the church. The basic principle governing Christian conduct on this earth is submission. It is interesting that believers are exhorted to obey in all the Epistles, but these Epistles do not say anything about authority itself. Where there is a demand, there must be the object of demand. For example, without the Word of God, we cannot have faith. If we talk about faith all the time, but do not give others God's Word, no one can have faith. Similarly, if there is no authority, there can be no submission. God wants all the believers to practice submission in the church. This means that there must be an object of submission. The object of submission is the authority in the church. In the church the elders act as God's deputy authority. God wants us to learn submission. If a man truly knows authority, he will learn to submit. The young brothers and sisters should learn to have a proper response. I am not talking about a kind of deliberate performance. Rather, it is a spontaneous reaction that comes when a person is confronted by something. If we have a proper response, the first thing that will come to our mind when we are confronted by a situation is, "Who should I check with in this situation?"</p><p>Every time Brother Witness faces a situation, he asks, "Who should I check with concerning this matter? To whom should I submit?" Once we hand over ourselves, we enter into the coordination of the Body, and no member can be independent any longer. Every member is under the authority of the Head. Any member who does not submit to the authority of the Head is a lame member.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE AUTHORITY OF THE ELDERS</h2><p>I would say a word to the elders concerning their authority: We have to have the basic understanding that there is no authority within ourselves. The authority in the Body of Christ is Christ, the Head. It is the Holy Spirit who is operating in the Body. Therefore, only the Holy Spirit is the authority. The Holy Spirit is the authority of Christ in His Body. From where do the responsible brothers derive their authority? Do not think that as long as a person is an elder he has authority. We have to know and understand authority. Only those who understand authority have authority. If the elders do not understand authority, they are not qualified to be elders, and they are not fit to be an authority. We do not have any authority in ourselves. The only difference between us and the brothers and sisters is that we know the authority of the Holy Spirit a little more clearly, and we are able to communicate the thought of the Spirit to them. The elders do not have any authority in themselves. They are able to help the younger ones in the church because they recognize the authority of the Holy Spirit in Christ's Body, the church. The elders should never say, "I am the authority. I have the authority to make decisions for you." Rather, they should say that they recognize the Holy Spirit more. This is the reason they can open their mouth and speak, and this is the reason they can represent God's authority before the brothers and sisters. An elder becomes God's authority by knowing God.</p><p>Let me relate a story to you. In Shanghai, Brother Du, Brother Chu-chen, and Brother Yu Cheng-hwa are elders. Brother Du is the most senior among them. As far as his human stature is concerned, he is as mature as Brother Witness. The social and political condition in Shanghai is such that the church has little to offer to out-of-town visitors in terms of hospitality. Once a brother from the church in Shanghai was led by the Spirit to open his house to a midnight visitor. Brother Du came and told me that the brother was wrong. It was right for him to provide hospitality, but it was wrong for him to do so without fellowshipping first with the elders. I told him that there was nothing wrong with it as long as it was done under the leading of the Holy Spirit. Besides, how can a person seek fellowship from the elders in the middle of the night? We are helping the brothers and sisters know the authority of the Holy Spirit, not to submit to us as elders. It was right for this brother to obey the Holy Spirit.</p><p>The elders are here not to build up their own authority, but to lead the brothers and sisters to know the authority of the Holy Spirit. All the brothers and sisters have to learn to submit to authority, but all the responsible brothers have to see that they do not have any authority in themselves. If the brothers and sisters make a mistake, we have to rebuke them, not because they have offended our authority, but because we know the authority of the Holy Spirit. We should rebuke them because they have offended the authority of the Holy Spirit. The young brothers and sisters should remember that in disobeying the responsible brothers, they are disobeying God. The responsible brothers should not try to build up their own authority; they should not consider that they have authority in themselves. The whole church must help the brothers and sisters submit to authority. They should know that they are rebelling against the authority of the Holy Spirit when they do not listen to the elders. This is the meaning of submitting to authority.</p><p>We have spent a great deal of time to select the elders. We have had much consideration in this matter. In appointing the elders, we are not saying that these ones have any authority in themselves. We are merely saying that they know more of the authority of the Holy Spirit. This is the reason the church has to accept their decision. It does not mean that their decision is the authority. The elders should not set their heart on the matter of authority. Rather, they should set their heart on whether or not the one-talented gifts are being utilized. If the one-talented ones are not utilized, the church is dead. Of course, once the one-talented ones are called into use, their flesh will easily follow. These one-talented ones may serve happily in the church, but their service will bring in confusion if they do not submit to authority. Therefore, the church must not only recover the function of the one- talented ones, but it must recover the practice of submission. In this way, the church will have a way to go on, and the service will be proper. It is unprofitable to drag someone into the service without the proper discernment.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_082.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_084.html">Next</a> </body></html>
