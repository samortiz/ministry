<H1 CLASS=TITLE>IN NOTHING BE ANXIOUS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 30</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Phil. 4:4-7</H1><P>Everyone likes to rejoice. No one likes to be sorrowful. For man to rejoice and not be sorrowful, he must not have any burden. Otherwise, he will not be able to rejoice. According to the Bible, there are two kinds of burdens: one is the burden of sin, and the other is the burden of anxiety. If the burden of sin is not resolved, there is no joy; if the burden of anxiety is not resolved, there is also no joy. If the burden of sin is resolved but the burden of anxiety is not, the joy is not complete. At the same time, if the burden of anxiety is resolved but the burden of sin is not, the joy cannot be complete either. The burdens of sin and anxiety must be resolved together in order for one to rejoice.</P><P>Today what we will speak is for Christians. We will consider how a Christian can have joy. Since all Christians are saved, the burden of sin has already been resolved! However, if their burden of anxiety is not resolved, they still cannot rejoice. If Christians are not joyful, they put the Lord and His name to shame. This means that they do not trust in Him and that they doubt Him. Christians know that their sins are forgiven and that they are saved; they know that they are children of God. But many Christians are not joyful. This lack of joy is surely not God's portion for Christians. The verses we will read show us how to have joy. When we are free from anxiety, we can rejoice.</P><P>But how many Christians can always rejoice? Christians today are putting the Lord's name to shame. The Lord's will is that we know our sins and come to Him for forgiveness so that we can have the authority to become children of God through the redemption of the Lord's blood. All these things are good, but He also wants us to always rejoice. If we do not have joy, we do not have the proper living and attitude of a Christian. Christians must always rejoice. If we read the Bible, we will find out that believers ought to live in joy and without anxiety. Let us now look into Philippians 4:4-7 phrase by phrase.</P><P>Philippians 4:4 says, "Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice." The first thing we have to know is that rejoicing is a commandment of God. God never commands us to do what we cannot do. Every command of God to man can be done by man. The Bible commands us not to be happy, but to rejoice in the Lord. We should not only rejoice in the Lord, but rejoice in Him always. If a man worships idols, we know that this violates God's commandment. But we may not realize that if a Christian is not rejoicing, he is also breaking God's commandment. We may think that if we worship idols we are breaking the commandments but if we do not rejoice, we are not breaking the commandments. Actually, in both cases we are breaking His commandments. Since rejoicing is a command of God, we must practice accordingly; otherwise, we are breaking God's commandment. Perhaps you may think, "I have such and such a problem. How can I rejoice? I am a laborer and have to support a family. Even though I toil and sweat, I do not earn much in wages, and living expenses are so high. How can I rejoice?" As a result, you may become anxious. Perhaps you are a mother and a widow. You have many children and a meager income which does not adequately cover your expenses. Since you live from hand to mouth, you may think, "How can a person like me rejoice?" Perhaps you are a student, doctor, master, or servant, and you feel that it is difficult to deal with other people in the world. You cannot rejoice. Indeed, many things can make you unable to rejoice. But please note that the rejoicing in verse 4 is not to rejoice in yourself, but to "rejoice in the Lord always."</P><P>A widow who has just lost her husband, whose possessions are about to be pawned, and whose landlord is about to drive her out of the house is suffering greatly under these circumstances. Yet she can still play with her little baby. She cannot rejoice in the house, her deceased husband, or her surroundings. But she can rejoice. She can rejoice in her baby. In the same way, God has not asked us to rejoice in our environment, in things going our way, or in any kind of happiness. God tells us to "rejoice in the Lord." The world may oppose us, misunderstand us, reject us, and trap us, but no one can cover the heavens from us. The Lord never changes. The world could put Paul into prison and lock him up, but it could not keep the Lord within Paul away from him. Therefore, Paul and Silas were able to sing and praise God within the prison cell. We should be clear about one thing: do not rejoice in the environment; rather, rejoice in our Lord. When friends and relatives are away and the heart is aching and weeping, we can be comforted and rejoice if we look to the Lord who loves us and whom we love. He is enough to satisfy our heart. But Christians are very forgetful! We may hear about this today but forget about it tomorrow! This is why Paul followed by saying, "Again I will say, rejoice." God's intention is that we rejoice. Therefore, whatever happens, we must rejoice.</P><P>"Let your forbearance be known to all men." "Forbearance" in the original text has a meaning of moderation. It means to not incline to the left or the right, to not be too much or too little. If a Christian feels crushed under a great mountain as soon as he encounters some problems, he is not moderate. The world may press us, but the Lord gives us joy. This joy is great, and it enables us to pass our days joyfully in the midst of difficulties. This is the principle of moderation according to the Bible. It is not the moderation the world teaches.</P>
