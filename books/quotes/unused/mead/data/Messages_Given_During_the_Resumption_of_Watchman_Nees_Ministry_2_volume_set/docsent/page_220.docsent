   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE BROKENNESS AND MINISTRY CO-WORKERS' MEETING 25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:6:30 p.m., Friday, April 30, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>CONCERNING THE ONE TALENT IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother Chi Yung-tung asked: What does the one talent in the Bible Matt 25:15 refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brother Nee answered: The one talent refers to the gift that the believers receive through the Lord's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today, the church fails because the one-talented ones have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If all the one-talented ones rise up, the church will be manifested, and others will see what is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every redeemed one has at least one talent; no one can have less than one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>CONCERNING COORDINATION IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Chu Cheng asked: Is the coordination of the Body something spontaneous, or is there some kind of arrangement?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Need for Arrangements</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Nee answered: Strictly speaking, our coordination before the Lord should be something spontaneous, but the problem today is that the young ones do not see the matter of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why the brothers ahead of them should make some arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the book of Timothy, Paul did not leave one thing for Timothy to make his own decision.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He only required that Timothy and those with him be obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today, if we do not make any arrangements, many people will not coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Submission Helping a Person</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>to Break through His Individual Limitations</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are certain advantages to being coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All our judgments before the Lord are based on the light that we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The amount of light we see determines the amount of judgment we have.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During the first few years of their Christian life, many people do not see much light.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Their work and conduct surely cannot exceed the light they see.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, their work and conduct are limited by their judgments, and their judgments are limited by the light they have received.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At Pentecost, the church became a strong testimony in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, as far as the church is concerned, it has been strong ever since the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But as far as the individuals are concerned, their condition progresses as time goes on.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the young ones would accept the judgments of the older ones, they will be able to do things beyond their capacity, and all the services before the Lord will be covered properly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way, the church will gain a profit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If all the one-talented ones will submit to authority, they will not have one talent only, but will make a profit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to see that the riches in the church far exceed the riches of individual members.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>CONCERNING FOLLOWING THE MINISTRY OF THE AGE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Question: How should Jonathan in the Old Testament Saul's son 1 Sam 14:1-46 choose his way?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Seeing the Ministry of the Age</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brother Nee answered: In the Old Testament, both Solomon and David represented the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The two persons represented the one ministry in two separate ways.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Old Testament, there were many ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After Moses, the judges were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After that, there was Solomon, the kings, and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the Israelites were taken into captivity, the vessels for the recovery were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Old Testament is filled with different kinds of ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In every age, there is the ministry of that age.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These ministries of the ages are different from the local ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Luther was a minister of his age.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Darby was also a minister of his age.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In every age, the Lord has special things that He wants to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He has His own recoveries and His own works to do.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The particular recovery and work that He is doing in one age is the ministry of that age.</S>
