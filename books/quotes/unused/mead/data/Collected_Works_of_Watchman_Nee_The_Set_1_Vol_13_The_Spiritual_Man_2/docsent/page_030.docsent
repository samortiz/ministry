   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Fleshly believers are those who remain as babies for a long time and do not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This does not mean that they do not have the outward suppression of sin or an increase in biblical knowledge during that time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It does not mean that they do not strive to work for the Lord or have not received the gift of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The believers in Corinth had all of these.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They were "in everything...enriched in Him, in all utterance and all knowledge... with no lack in any gift" 1 Cor 1:5, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to man's view, are these not growth?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We would probably say that they were the most spiritual believers because of their growth in utterance, knowledge, and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even so, the apostle said that they were still babies and fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How could this be?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Is growth in utterance, knowledge, and gifts not growth?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can observe a very important fact that the Corinthians grew in secondary issues, but their spirit did not grow, and the intuition in their spirit had not become stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>An increase of eloquence in preaching, an increase in biblical knowledge, and an increase in the gifts of the Holy Spirit are not increases in spiritual life!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a believer's spirit, with which he fellowships with God, has not become stronger and keener in the eyes of God, he has not grown at all!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How many Christians are growing in the wrong direction today?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How many think that after they are saved, they should pursue higher biblical knowledge, better eloquence in preaching, and more gifts of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They forget that they should pursue the growth of the spirit with which they have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eloquence, knowledge, and gifts are just outward; only the intuition is inward.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The most pitiful thing today is that believers allow their spirit to remain as a baby, but they fill their mind, emotion, and will with eloquence, knowledge, and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even though these things are precious, they cannot be compared with the position of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has newly created this spirit in us which can be called our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What should grow and become full-grown is this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we misunderstand and do not pursue the growth of the spiritual life and the intuition, which enable us to know God, the matters of God, and have fellowship with Him, but instead we pursue the increase of riches in the soul, we will not have any progress at all in God's view.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the eyes of God, our spirit is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is concerned with the growth of this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to His view, no matter how much our eloquence, knowledge, and gifts increase in our mind, emotion, and will, they are worthless in the spiritual realm if there is no growth in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We expect daily to have greater power, broader knowledge, more gifts, and better eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the Bible says that even if we have all these things, our spiritual life has not necessarily grown.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the contrary, our spiritual life may remain the same, without an inch of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The apostle said that the Corinthians "were not yet able to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But neither yet now are you able."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In what aspect were they not able?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They were not able to use the intuition to serve God, to know God deeply, and to receive the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Corinthian believers were not able to do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Were not yet able" means that they were unable when they had just believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Neither yet now are you able" means that even after they had believed in the Lord for several years, after they were full of eloquence, knowledge, and gifts, they were still not able.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through the word "yet," the apostle indicated that even though they were rich in eloquence, knowledge, and gifts, their spiritual life was the same as when they were without eloquence, knowledge, or gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There was no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Real growth is measured by the growth of the spirit and intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everything else is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These words should be deeply engraved in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The most pitiful thing today is that Christians appear to have growth in almost everything; but their spirit, which is for fellowshipping with God, has not grown.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After believing in the Lord for years, one may still say, "I do not feel that I have a spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How different is our thought from God's thought!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are like the Corinthians in that we try to utilize the intelligence in our minds to search for the so-called spiritual knowledge, and we really do acquire a great deal of it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But growth in the mind is not and cannot substitute for the growth of the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In God's view, we have remained the same.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Please remember that God wants us to grow not in our knowledge, eloquence, or gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He only wants the growth of our spirit, our spiritual life, and the intuition of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He expects the new life that we received in our regeneration to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The old creation should be totally forsaken.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Otherwise, even if we are full of eloquence, knowledge, and gifts, He will still say that we are fleshly believers, babies without an inch of growth in the spiritual life!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When a believer is overly influenced by the flesh, he cannot successfully become a spiritual man and take solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only one who has a sharp intuition and unceasingly fellowships with God will really know the deep truths.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If one's intuition remains weak, he cannot help but drink milk.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is said that milk comes from the mother after she digests solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that the fleshly believers are unable to fellowship with God clearly in their intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They can only depend on more experienced believers to tell them the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Experienced believers fellowship with God through their intuition, transform what they know into spiritual milk, and give it to fleshly believers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At the very beginning of a young Christian's life, the Lord allows this to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, the Lord does not want His people to be dull all their life and unable to fellowship directly with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Drinking milk only means that one cannot fellowship directly with God and needs the transmission through others.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A full-grown man is one that has his intuition well exercised; he knows how to discern.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we cannot fellowship with God and know the things of God in our intuition, all of our idealistic thinking is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Corinthian believers had much eloquence and knowledge and many gifts, but their spirit was very inactive.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The church in Corinth was of the flesh because they only had what was stored in their minds.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many Christians today err in the same way as the Corinthian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They study theology with their dispassionate mentality to search out the hidden meanings in the Bible in order to arrive at the best explanations.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord's words are spirit and life, but they do not receive them as spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They only want to satisfy their own "lust for knowledge" and want to tell others, either verbally or by writing books, what they have learned.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Although their meanings, theories, and outlines are the best, and although they appear very "spiritual," in reality they are dead in God's view.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Their knowledge comes from the mind of one person and is transferred into the mind of another without passing through the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those who listen to them or read their writings may say that they have been helped, but what kind of help have they received?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Nothing has happened other than the addition of a thought into their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This kind of knowledge has no spiritual effect.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Only that which comes from the spirit will enter into man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Whatever comes from the mind will enter into man's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Furthermore, only that which comes from the Holy Spirit will enter into our spirit, and only that which comes out of the Holy Spirit through our spirit will enter into someone else's spirit.</S>
