   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PETER'S EXPERIENCE OF KNOWING HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before the Lord's crucifixion Peter was very confident in himself that he would not deny the Lord Matt 26:33-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>So, the Lord in His sovereignty arranged the environment for Peter to deny Him three times, even in front of the Lord's face Luke 22:55-61 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through those kinds of experiences, Peter was subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the Lord's resurrection according to John 21, the Lord met Peter at a place where he and the other disciples were backsliding v. 1 . As they were fishing, the Lord appeared on the seashore.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When they saw the Lord, they realized that they were naked v. 7 . This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord met Peter in a backslidden condition when he had no covering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When they arrived on the seashore and while they ate breakfast, Peter was very subdued and was probably not very comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He may have felt very ashamed because of his recent failures: he had denied the Lord, he had not remained in Jerusalem, the place where the Lord had charged him to stay Luke 24:49 , and he had taken the lead to backslide, going back to Galilee to pick up his old job of fishing John 21:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Peter might have been excited to see the Lord inwardly, but due to his failures, he may not have had the faith to express his feeling outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After breakfast, the Lord asked Peter a question, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Peter responded to the Lord by saying, "Yes, Lord, You know that I love You."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Peter's response indicates a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He did not just say, "Yes, Lord, I love You" nor did he say, "No, Lord, I'm sorry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I'd like to love You, but I cannot love You."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Peter's answer to the Lord's question reveals that he was really subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He had lost all confidence in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peter's confidence had been transferred from himself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because he no longer had any confidence in himself, he wanted to know what the Lord would say.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He may have remembered both his own confident declaration that he would never deny the Lord and the Lord's word that he would deny Him three times.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through this failure Peter realized that only what the Lord said really counted.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>So, when the Lord questioned Peter, Peter turned the question back to the Lord to see what He would say.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By this little word, you can see that Peter, having no confidence in himself, was subdued and broken.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the Christian life, a life which is subdued and broken.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A SPECIAL WORD TO THE TRAINEES CONCERNING GOING BACK TO VISIT THEIR SUPPORTING CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As trainees, you may have become disappointed or discouraged by your experience of exposure in this training.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of this, you may consider to withdraw from the training to go back to the church which supported you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Your going back in this way may make you even more miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because you do not know yourself, you may think that you need to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, you do not need to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You simply need to tell the Lord, "Lord, here I am.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have no confidence in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My confidence and trust is just in You.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without You or apart from You, I am just a pitiful person."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To come to this realization is really positive.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Your attitude in visiting your supporting church, parents, and relatives is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you go back with an attitude and realization that you are nothing and that your confidence is really in the Lord, this would be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such a testimony would nourish everyone who listens to you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if you go back testifying how marvelous the training was, everyone who hears your testimony may be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If your experience with the Lord in the training was proper, you were being exposed every day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everything in the training only served to expose you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such experiences are very profitable, because it indicates that you are beginning to really know yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Though you have learned and been equipped with a great deal in this training, this learning may be considered as only some "gold" to adorn you outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To give people the impression that you are now gilded with gold would not be so fitting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The best impression to give others is that you are a broken and subdued person with no apparent gold.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If your supporting church would receive such an impression from you, this would be very profitable.</S>
