   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR BEING FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT THE NEED TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the Lord is our meaning and that we are the meaning of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without us, the universe has no purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without Christ, we also have no purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is our meaning, and we, as Christians, are the meaning of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In addition to these points, we have also seen that the Lord Jesus now is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was incarnated to be the last Adam, and He died and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, The Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The One who is in us is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For this reason, our primary concern is for us to be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Concerning being filled with the Holy Spirit, we do not need too much doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are the Lord s expression and representatives.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus is the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, in order to express and represent Him, we must be filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are not filled with the Spirit, we cannot properly express the Lord, nor can we properly represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without being filled with the Spirit, the Lord will not be the meaning of our human life in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THOROUGHLY CONSECRATING OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to be filled with the Holy Spirit, we first must turn to the Lord so that our face is toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are not facing Him, He will not be able to fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the opening of a vessel is turned down instead of up, it can never be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order for the vessel to be filled, the vessel must be turned so that the opening is facing up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are the Lord s vessels, but are we facing the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although He is in us and desires even more to fill us, we need to be facing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to face Him, we must consecrate ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should all go to the Lord and take a specific step of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to have a transaction with the Lord, consecrating ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It does not matter whether we have previously consecrated ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even if we have consecrated before, we still need to go to the Lord today and again thoroughly give ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more times that we give ourselves to Him the better, and the more thoroughly the better.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have said that we should be beside ourselves to the Lord, but it is not enough to be merely beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If there is no consecration, our actions will only be outward, making us the same as those who act in a drama, who are merely pretending.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Pretending is to act in a drama.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, when Paul was beside himself, it was not a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul s being beside himself was genuine; it came from within.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What he was within was expressed outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The saints have been very responsive to the messages that have been spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are calling on the Lord, singing, and even playing drums.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the one hand, this makes me joyful, but on the other hand, I am concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not know whether the saints are acting or are genuinely beside themselves, whether they are performing or are genuinely crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be genuinely beside ourselves is to be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are beside ourselves because we are filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the day of Pentecost all the disciples seemed to be filled with new wine Acts 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can say that they were drunk, filled with the Spirit, to the point of being crazy Eph 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Are we as drunk as they were?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am afraid that not many of us are drunk in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is possible that some of us have not yet touched the Lord as the new wine Matt 9:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to be filled inwardly with the Lord so that we are truly beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that we must go to the Lord and have a thorough consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Consecration is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must go to the Lord and pray to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have seen that the Lord is the meaning of our human life, and the meaning of our human life is also the meaning of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If there were no Christians in the universe, the universe would have no meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a country has no Christians, it has no meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a social group has no Christians, it is a pitiful group.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If no one in a family is a Christian, the family is dark and miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are the meaning of the universe, as well as the meaning of society.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, we cannot work this out by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is the Lord who works this out in us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have meaning in our human life and are the meaning of the universe, the meaning of society, and the meaning of our country because the Lord Jesus is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, we must say, Lord, I praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You have opened my eyes to see that You are the meaning of my existence and that I am the meaning of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Lord, I need to be filled with You inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I give myself, my life, my future, what I am, what I can do, and what I have to You.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I do not want to do anything for You.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I want to be an empty vessel fully filled and occupied by You.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to make this kind of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are not asking the saints to give themselves to go and preach the gospel in remote regions.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In Christianity believers consecrate themselves to preach the gospel in remote regions.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are not promoting this.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Rather, we desire to give ourselves completely to the Lord in order to be His vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Whether or not we will go to the mountains or overseas for the gospel is an entirely different matter.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are not speaking about the people in remote regions.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should first take care of whether we are filled with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord Jesus is in us, waiting to gain ground in us so that He may fill our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Have we given Him the ground?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Perhaps we have not given Him any ground, or we have not given Him enough ground.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have received the Lord, but we have not allowed Him to occupy us completely.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When we truly see the meaning of human life, we will go to the Lord in consecration, placing ourselves completely in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should not be doctrinal with the Lord, telling Him to place us on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We should be simple and tell Him that we want to give ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We were created in His image, and we are His vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He is already in us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Now He is waiting for us to give ourselves completely to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must take care of this matter with the Lord, saying, Lord, I give myself completely to You.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>My life, my future, what I am, and what I can do are altogether Yours.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Lord, fill me with Yourself!</S>
