Our Peter, the Peter revealed in the Bible, is in certain respects different from the concept of Peter held by those in Catholicism
Although Paul speaks concerning the blood of Christ, he does not use this particular expression, the precious blood
At this point we need to see that a particular characteristic of Peter's writing is his use of adjectives, especially high adjectives
Although Peter did not behave in a clever way, the Lord Jesus selected him and put him ahead of all the other disciples
The Spirit of reality did come on the day of Christ's resurrection, and Peter was probably the first one to be infused with this Spirit
After the coming of the Spirit of reality and through the Spirits reminding him of those things Peter began to understand their significance
Through the Spirit of reality something solid, high, rich, and strong was built into the very fibers of Peter's being
As he uttered this word, Peter must have had a certain feeling within him regarding the preciousness of the blood of Christ
The Lord Jesus is our writing copy, an under-writing used by students to trace letters in learning to draw them
We however may be familiar with the grace of salvation or the grace of forgiveness without ever having been impressed with the grace of life
In this matter, not even Paul was as particular as Peter, for he never spoke in his Epistles of grace and peace being multiplied
We all should be good stewards of what Peter calls varied grace, grace in different aspects and of different categories
In 1 Peter we have four unique expressions concerning grace: grace of life, multiplied grace, varied grace, and all grace
If his wife is difficult and even somewhat stubborn, he will have the opportunity to enjoy a very specific and rich aspect of grace
In 2 Peter 1:3 Peter says, 'As His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness'
As believers in Christ, we have not only the divine life, but we are now partaking, enjoying, participating in, the divine nature
If Paul were to read such an expression, he would have to say, 'Brother Peter, in this matter, your writing surpasses mine'
By this we can see that the span of Peter's writings embraces the two eternities; it goes from eternity past to eternity future
To speak of the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ is to expound the matter of redemption, define it, and apply it
Even after reading 1 and 2 Peter many times, you still will find it difficult to say what the main subject of these Epistles is
Eventually, in eternity future, everything will be right and in good order, for righteousness will dwell in the new heavens and new earth
The reason the two Epistles of Peter were written, especially the first, was that the dispersed Jewish believers were suffering persecution
Because the believers were troubled and perhaps doubting, Peter wrote to instruct them and also to comfort them
Peter wrote to comfort the suffering, persecuted saints, showing them that all of them were under God's government
In his second Epistle Peter shows us that God is not only governing us, ruling us, but also providing us with whatever we need
Peter 11 says Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the chosen pilgrims of the dispersion of Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia
If we read the four Gospels and Peters Epistles we may find it difficult to believe that Simon a Galilean fisherman could be such a writer
These chosen ones were sojourning on the earth, somewhat like the children of Israel sojourning in the wilderness
God's government is universal; it deals with all His creatures in order that He may have a clean and pure universe to express Himself
Strictly speaking, this term in this book refers to the Jewish believers who were sojourners, foreigners, dispersed in the Gentile world
These pilgrims are God's elect, chosen by God out of the human race, out of all the nations , according to His foreknowledge
The divine economy through the operation of the Trinity of the Godhead for the believers' participation in the Triune God is unveiled
In 2:2 Peter says, 'As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it you may grow unto salvation'
On the way home from work, the Lord Jesus may tell him to apologize to his wife, something that he finds very difficult to do
We have pointed out that in 1:1 and 2 we have the operation of the Triune God upon His elect for their participation in His full salvation
The believers have received the initial grace; yet this grace needs to be multiplied in them so that they may participate in all grace
The sequence is this: God's selection, the Spirit's sanctification, justification, and then subjective sanctification
Many Christian teachers say that God's selection comes first, then justification, and then the Spirit's sanctification
In time the Spirit came to us to sanctify us, to set us apart, from the world so that we would obey Christ's redemption
In 12 we have the first aspect in Romans 619 and 22 the second and in 2 Thessalonians 213 the allinclusive sanctification of the Spirit
The old sprinkling, the sprinkling of the blood of animals, merely brought God's people into the Old Testament blessing
The new sprinkling, the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, brings us into the full enjoyment of God's new covenant'
Of course, it is not true to say that the Jews believe in one God and that Christians believe in a different God
According to the understanding of the Jews, God is the Creator of the universe, but He is not the God and Father of Jesus Christ
In our understanding, however, God is both the Creator of the universe and the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
In 1:3 Peter declares that the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ has regenerated us unto a living hope according to His great mercy
We see that once again Peter uses an adjective: he speaks not merely of God's mercy, but speaks of His great mercy
In 1:1 through 3 we have four actions in the following sequence: choosing, sanctifying, redeeming, and regenerating
At the very moment we were sprinkled outwardly by the blood, we were inwardly regenerated by the sanctifying Spirit
Regeneration enlivens us with God's life and brings us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with God
It is not a hope of objective things; it is a hope of life, even eternal life, with all the endless divine blessings
If we have the skill to interpret this expression according to our experience, we shall realize that more is involved
Formerly we were dead, and everything related to us, in particular any expectation for the future, was also dead
When we were sprinkled with the blood of Christ, immediately the life-giving Spirit came into us to enliven us
Formerly we were dead and altogether without hope, but we have been 'lifed' through the life-giving Spirit unto a living hope
The regeneration of God the Father results in the hope that every part of our being and everything related to us will be lifed, enlivened
With one who has been regenerated by God with the divine life, there is the hope that everything will be enlivened and thus become living
According to the Bible the gospel is preached not merely to sinners; it is also preached to those who are dead in Adam
We know from Peter's word in 1:3 that through the means, the instrumentality, of the resurrection of Christ, God has regenerated us
Now He is the life within us that potentiates the new birth and causes every aspect of our being to become living
At this point we need to ask an important question: Is this inheritance for us today, or is it only for the future?
Others may think that in 1:4 Peter is speaking about an everlasting inheritance in contrast to the temporal inheritance of physical things
Often when we read the Bible we read things into it; we inject some element of our natural thought into God's revelation
Our heavenly divine spiritual inheritance is kept in the heavens yet it is continually being transmitted into our spirit for our enjoyment
One of these deep matters is the sanctification of the Spirit; a second is the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ
Without the application through the Holy Spirit, how could God's selection have anything to do with us in a practical, experiential way?
Without the sanctification of the Spirit, there would be no way to apply what the Father and the Son have done for us
For this reason, the Lord sent the apostles to proclaim that the dispensation of law is over and that we need to believe in Christ
In Romans 1:5 he says, 'We received grace and apostleship unto obedience of faith among all the nations on behalf of His name'
If life could be imparted into a dead person, he would have the hope that every member of his physical body would be enlivened
Our daily experience of eternal life is also an experience and enjoyment of the inheritance kept for us in the heavens
The everlasting expression indicated by the word 'unfading' is the Son as the expression of the Father's glory
In verse 5 Peter says, 'Who are being guarded by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed at the last time'
Even though we are saved, we need to ask ourselves if we are now ready to stand before the judgment seat of Christ
If this is your situation, then the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ may have a negative result as far as you are concerned
That will not be eternal perdition; rather, it will be the dispensational punishment of God's governmental dealing
In this stage, God has justified us through the redemption of Christ and regenerated us in our spirit with His life by His Spirit
We have received God's eternal salvation and His eternal life , and become His children , who shall not perish forever
He is sanctifying us by His Holy Spirit , with His holy nature, through His discipline and His judgment in His own house
He is building us together into a spiritual house for His dwelling and maturing us in His life for the completion of His full salvation
In this stage, God will redeem our fallen and corrupted body by transfiguring it into the body of Christ's glory
He will glorify us , immersing us in His glory that we may enter into His heavenly kingdom , into which He has called us
With the second aspect of the Spirit's sanctification there are two sides-the positional side and the dispositional side
After God justifies us and regenerates us, immediately the sanctifying Spirit continues His separating work upon us and within us
After we have been justified and regenerated, the Spirit works to sanctify us positionally and also dispositionally
Whenever we consider the last time, we should exult, that is, we should become joyful and rejoice to the uttermost
In verse 6 Peter not only speaks of exulting in the last time, but also speaks of being made sorrowful by various trials
They are used by God to test and prove their faith , to see whether they will follow Christ in suffering for doing good
It is not the student's study itself that is found approved; rather, it is the examination that is found to be approved
The emphasis here is not on our faith; the emphasis is on the proving of our faith by the trials through sufferings
An examination will prove how thoroughly he has studied and how much he knows concerning the material on which he is being tested
In verse 7 Peter says that the proving of our faith is 'much more precious than of gold which perishes and is proved by fire'
In verse 7 Peter indicates that the proving of our faith 'may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the unveiling of Jesus Christ'
The various trials in verse 6 are that the proving of our faith may result in praise, glory, and honor at the unveiling of the Lord
In verse 7 Peter emphasizes the particular matter that the Lord's coming back will be the taking away of the veil that now covers Him
If we do not love the Lord, follow Him, and seek Him, our situation will be very different when He is unveiled
If the proving of our faith is positive, this proving will result in praise, glory, and honor at the unveiling of Jesus Christ
It is characteristic of Peter that he does not stop with the word 'praise' but goes on to mention glory and honor
At the time of graduation, the outstanding student in a class is in a condition of glory and also in a position of honor
Although Peter's writings may not be highly regarded by certain scholars, he nevertheless expressed in these verses what he intended to say
The full salvation of the Triune God includes the Father's regeneration, the Spirit's sanctification or application, and Christ's redemption
Eternal life has been brought into us, and we have been brought into the hope, the inheritance, of eternal life
The result of the Father's regeneration is to bring eternal life into us and to bring us into the full enjoyment of God as our life supply
At least to some extent, the spiritual matters in Paul's writings may be covered over by his excellent language
The Father's regeneration has brought His eternal life into us and has also brought us into the enjoyment of this eternal life
When some hear that we may enjoy the living hope today, they may argue and say, 'How can you claim that the living hope is a present matter?
Those who would try to argue in this way need to realize that the living hope, the inheritance, is ours today, tomorrow, and for eternity
If no one comes to work on the chair to repair it, it will remain indefinitely broken without any hope of being fixed
Peter 1:5 says, 'Who are being guarded by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed at the last time'
According to this phrase, it would seem that we do not yet have salvation, for we are being guarded by the power of God unto salvation
It does not refer only to a part of our salvation, to that initial aspect of salvation that comes through the Savior, Jesus Christ
In this full salvation a great part is accomplished by the Father; another great part, by the Son; and yet another great part, by the Spirit
These three stages are not divided according to knowledge or merely according to objective aspects of God's salvation
Spiritual life, as we all know, begins with regeneration, continues in transformation, and reaches maturity in the stage of consummation
The initial stage, the stage of regeneration, is composed of redemption, sanctification , justification, reconciliation, and regeneration
We have received God's eternal salvation and His eternal life , and we have become His children , who shall not perish forever
There is no need for us to grow unto this stage, and it is not necessary for us to wait until it is revealed to us
Because we have been regenerated and have received God's eternal salvation and eternal life, we have become God's children
Although this initial salvation saves us from God's condemnation and from eternal perdition, it does not save us from God's discipline
By this we see that through the initial stage of God's salvation, we receive eternal salvation and eternal life
It is altogether contrary to the Bible to teach that to be disciplined by God means that we shall lose our salvation
God may punish us for certain things, but we have been saved for eternity and we shall never lose this eternal salvation
The sanctification in this stage is mainly dispositional, although there is still an amount of positional sanctification
In the first stage sanctification is altogether positional; in the second stage sanctification is mainly dispositional
The means through which we are sanctified is God's discipline and judgment, the judgment He exercises in governing His own house
He is transforming us by renewing the inward parts of our soul by the life-giving Spirit through the working of all things
In the second stage we are being delivered from the power of sin, the world, the flesh, the self, the soul , and individualism
The goal of this deliverance is that we would have maturity in the divine life for the fulfilling of God's eternal purpose
Although we have experienced the first stage of salvation and are now in the second stage, the third stage is still far beyond us
In the completing stage of salvation, God will redeem our fallen and corrupted body by transfiguring it into the body of Christ's glory
In this new realm we shall share and enjoy all the Triune God is, has, and has accomplished, attained, and obtained
The young people may expect to finish their education, find a good job, and then have a very pleasant married life
In that realm we shall have the full enjoyment of the Triune God and of all that He is, has, and has accomplished, attained, and obtained
We should eagerly expect such a marvelous salvation , and we should prepare ourselves for its splendid revelation
In this message we shall consider the Spirit's application through the prophets' prophesying and the apostles' preaching
By this we see that two groups of persons were used by the applying Spirit to apply God's full salvation to His chosen people
Although Peter wrote only eight chapters, not much in comparison with Paul, he put into these chapters the divine riches
Not caring for grammar, language, or composition, Peter found a way to express the divine riches in his writings
The more we read them and prayread them and in so doing touch the depth of these verses we shall realize that Peters word here is quite deep
One example of Peter's depth is what he says in verse 11 about the prophets searching into the manner of time Christ would suffer
Peter 1:10 says, 'Concerning which salvation the prophets, who prophesied concerning the grace unto you, sought out and searched out'
Eventually it was revealed that those marvelous things were ministered not to them, but to the New Testament believers
Although it is easy to understand the meaning of 'what time,' it is difficult to know what Peter means by 'what manner of time'
In conversation we sometimes refer to a certain kind of time, or ask a person what kind of time he had in doing a certain thing
According to these prophecies, it was necessary for God's anointed One, the One appointed to fulfill God's commission, to suffer
We have seen that it is characteristic of Peter to use particular and even peculiar expressions in his writings
Many of us have been dealing with the Bible diligently and seriously for years, especially during the years we have been in the recovery
Although we have these verses related to what time Christ would suffer it is very difficult to find a verse that tells us the manner of time
If we read through the Old Testament from Genesis to Malachi, we shall see that all the Old Testament saints were seekers
The prophets in particular were seeking and searching into what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them made clear
In 1:11 Peter definitely says that while the ancient prophets were seeking and searching, the Spirit of Christ was in them
According to the accomplishment in history, Christ was crucified somewhat more than nineteen hundred years ago
Regarding its accomplishment, the crucifixion of Christ took place in time more than nineteen hundred years ago
Regarding function the effectiveness of Christs death is eternal and in the sight of God Christ was slain from the foundation of the world
Peter's somewhat awkward composition helps us to see that as the prophets were searching, the Spirit of Christ was working in them
It is rather easy to understand what time, but it is difficult to understand what Peter means by what manner of time
Christ did not come at a time when the people of God were filled with faith and everyone had a strong belief in God
If we read concerning the seventy weeks and study the context, we shall understand that the seventy weeks are a time of captivity
When the Old Testament prophets were searching into what manner of time Christ would come to suffer the Spirit of Christ was working in them
According to function, there is no difference between the Spirit's work in the prophets and His work in the apostles
In 1:3 he speaks of 'the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ' to distinguish the God of the Christians from the God of the Jews
Now we see that he even used the term 'the Spirit of Christ' instead of the Spirit of God in order to make yet another distinction
Peter was seeking to convince the Jewish believers that even the Old Testament prophets were the same as New Testament Christians
Peter says that the Spirit of Christ in them made the prophets clear concerning what manner of time Christ would suffer
The unbelieving Jews challenged the Jewish believers, saying, 'Look, what a small number believe in your Jesus!
That, however, is against the principle that the manner of time of Christ's coming is characterized by unbelief
In using his limited knowledge of the Greek language, Peter tried his best to put the aspects of his experience into words
In verse 11 Peter says that the prophets witnessed beforehand 'the sufferings of Christ and the glories after these'
He has a glory in resurrection, another glory in ascension, and other glories in enthronement, lordship, kingship, and reigning
The Spirit applies God's full salvation by two instrumentalities, the prophesying of the prophets and the preaching of the apostles
As long as you preach Christ, you are included among those who preach the gospel by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven
The Greek word rendered 'look into' portrays one stooping and stretching the neck to look at some wonderful sight
These ten verses in 1 Peter 1 may not be good human composition, but they give us an excellent, marvelous, and wonderful divine revelation
To bless God the Father is to speak subjectively of what He is to us, of what He has done for us, and of what He will do for us
These ten verses in chapter one of 1 Peter tell us what the Father has done for us through the Son and by the Spirit
It is important for us to realize why Peter uttered such a well-speaking concerning the Triune God in a letter written to scattered saints
According to 1:1, this Epistle was written to 'the chosen pilgrims of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia'
About thirty years before the birth of Christ, Julius Caesar defeated Egypt and established the Roman Empire in full
Probably there has never been a stronger government in history than the government of the Roman Empire in the first century A
The Roman Empire controlled the entire region around the Mediterranean Sea, including territory in Asia, Europe, and northern Africa
It is common knowledge that western culture is built on three pillars: Roman law, Hebrew religion, and Greek culture
The well-speaking concerning the Triune God in 1:3-12 is altogether different from both Hebrew religion and Greek philosophy
Other matters are God's great mercy, regeneration, living hope, and the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead
Writing this Epistle according to his spiritual experiences, Peter intended to annul Jewish religion and Greek philosophy
With Jewish religion and Greek philosophy as the background, Peter declared, 'Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ'
In verse 4 Peter goes on to say, 'Unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for you'
Verse 5 says, 'Who are being guarded by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed at the last time'
They are not guarded by religious rituals or philosophical reasonings, but are guarded by the power of God through faith
In addition to exulting, Peter speaks here of being made sorrowful for a little while, if it must be, by various trials
Peter's desire is that this proving would be found unto praise, glory, and honor at the unveiling of Jesus Christ
Verse 8 says, 'Whom having not seen, you love; in whom, not seeing at present yet believing, you exult with unspeakable and glorified joy'
Peter indicates that the end of our faith, the consummation of the process of our faith, will be the salvation of our souls
These words testify not only that there is a God, but also that there must be One, the Son of God, whose name is Jesus Christ
Peter did not care for literary style; he cared only for the genuine points of his experience of the Triune God
Verse 15 says, 'But according to the Holy One who called you, you yourselves also become holy in all your manner of life'
Verse 22 says Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth unto unfeigned brotherly love love one another from the heart fervently
We need to set our living hope completely on the grace that is being brought to us at the unveiling of Jesus Christ
If we are not enjoying the Lord Jesus as the foretaste, we shall not have the hope that He will be unveiled as our full taste
In verse 14 Peter goes on to say, 'As children of obedience, do not be conformed to the former lusts in your ignorance'
Verse 15 says, 'But according to the Holy One who called you, you yourselves also become holy in all your manner of life'
In the Pentateuch we are told at least a few times that God's people should be holy because God Himself is holy
The Holy One who has called us as the Father has regenerated us to produce a holy family-a holy Father with holy children
The thing spoken of here is the daily judgment of God's government in this world, exercised with regard to His children
After the millennium, all the dead, including men and demons, will be judged and perish , and the heavens and the earth will be burned up
Some judgments result in a disciplinary dealing, some in a dispensational punishment, and some in eternal perdition
Such fear is mentioned a number of times in this book because its teaching is concerning the government of God
The point here is that the holy manner of life should issue out from the dear and precious redemption of Christ
According to 1:15, we should not merely be holy and live a holy life; we should become holy in all our manner of life
Some Christians who emphasize a so-called holiness may sometimes act holy, but at other times they may be very worldly or fleshly
If an apple tree did not have the life of an apple tree, it could not possibly have the manner of life of an apple tree
The Father has imparted His holy nature into us, and this is what makes it possible for us to have a life that expresses the holy God
With the Father's holy nature within us as a basis of operation, the Holy Spirit is working in us to make us holy
According to most other references in Scripture the blood of Christ redeems us from sins transgressions lawlessness and all sinful things
Knowing that this was accomplished with the highest price, the precious blood of Christ, we pass the days of our sojourning in fear
The word 'redeemed' is an example of a biblical term that has become religious because of the way it is commonly used
If the spiritual feelings within you are tender when you are in a shopping center, you will realize that such a place is unclean
Unwilling to release us, to let us go, he raised up many obstacles and barriers to frustrate Christ from purchasing us
The blood of Christ is a material substance, yet its effectiveness, function, worth, power, and authority are eternal and incorruptible
The blood of Christ, by which we are sprinkled and thus marked out from common people, is more precious than silver and gold
The highest price has been paid for our redemption, that we might be redeemed from the vain manner of life to the holy
Through this comparison, Peter indicates that the price paid for us by Christ was related to something of life and to something organic
On the one hand, the life of Christ is represented by the vegetable life; on the other hand, His life is represented by the animal life
It is important to understand what Peter means by 'blemish' and 'spot' and to know the difference between them
If this stone is pure, it does not have any mixture; that is, it does not have any foreign body mixed in with it
We can see from the typology in the Old Testament that the animal sacrifices were to be without blemish and without spot
Among all the human beings who have ever lived on earth, there has been only one Man-the Lord Jesus Christ-who is without mixture or blemish
The words 'without blemish and without spot' are Old Testament terms used with respect to sacrifices offered to God
Before the lamb could be sacrificed, it first had to be examined to prove that it was without blemish and without spot
According to both divine law and secular law, the Lamb of God was examined and found to be without mixture and without spot
He is our sin offering and our trespass offering, the One offered for the atonement of the sins of God's people
You will want to become holy in all your manner of life and to pass the remaining time of your sojourn in fear
If we would live in this way we need to realize that we have been redeemed bought purchased with the high price of Christs precious blood
In 1:20 Peter speaks of Christ: 'Who was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in the last times for your sake'
In the eternal view of God, from the foundation of the world, that is, since the fall of man as a part of the world, Christ was slain
God's foreknowledge, therefore, means not only that He knew us in eternity past; it also means that He ordained us
Hallelujah, God's foreknowledge includes foreapproval, foreappreciation, foreacknowledgement, foremarrying, and foreordination!
In an eternal ordination ceremony before the foundation of the world, we all were ordained when Christ was ordained
Do you believe that you were foreknown by God when Christ was foreknown, and ordained by Him when Christ was ordained?
Perhaps you are reluctant to say that you were ordained before the foundation of the world when Christ was ordained
You may feel uneasy about speaking such a thing; you may think that others would consider you beside yourself if you said this
It is a marvelous spiritual fact that we and Christ were foreknown and foreordained by God the Father in eternity past!
In eternity past, on the day of the ordination of Christ and all the believers, God could see all the millions of Adam's descendants
He selected some from the United States, from China, and from England, France, Germany, and many other nations
With God's foreknowledge and foreordination as the basis, Christ came to earth to be our Redeemer and to accomplish God's purpose
Because we were foreordained by God, the Spirit came to us and did whatever was necessary to cause us to believe in Christ
The incarnation, the crucifixion, the resurrection, and the constitution of the Spirit of Christ exist eternally in the sight of God
Christ had already been ordained to be Christ, and we had already been ordained to be Christians in eternity past
One day we heard the preaching of the gospel, repented, believed, called on the Lord, and thanked Him for all He had done for us
Christ died and God raised Him from among the dead and gave Him glory so that, for the purpose that, our faith and hope may be in God
It may be better to render verse 21 'so that your faith and hope are in God,' instead of saying 'might be in God'
Verse 22 says Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth unto unfeigned brotherly love love one another from the heart fervently
The purification of our souls is the Spirit's sanctification of our disposition that we may live a holy life in God's holy nature
The latter is the purification of our outward doing; the former, the purification of our inward being-the soul
To have our soul purified is to have our mind emotion and will the parts of our heart purified from any kind of defilement and contamination
In this one verse Peter covers the purification of our souls, obedience to the truth, and unfeigned brotherly love
We need to ask ourselves if in our Christian life we have experienced the purifying of our souls by obedience to the truth
If we are to have more than a natural understanding of John 316 we need to touch the reality contained in this short word and conveyed by it
Through the preaching of the gospel and the apostles' teaching, the truth, the reality, in the word of God was conveyed to those Jews
The gospel and the teaching of the apostles contain realities, and these realities had been conveyed to the Jewish believers
The talk of the Judaizers was distracting and disturbing and caused the mind of the Jewish believers to wander away from the truth
The matter of our being chosen according to the foreknowledge of God is not merely a doctrine; it is a truth, a reality
It is a truth that this living hope is an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading, kept for us in the heavens
In verse 13 Peter is telling the Jewish believers to forget their religious background, to be sober, and to no longer wander in their mind
As the Judaizers tried to influence the Jewish believers, so today certain ones may try to influence those in the Lord's recovery
Then a relative who is a pastor with a theological degree may visit this brother and say, 'What do you mean 'recovery'?
Eventually, by God's mercy and the moving of the sanctifying Spirit within him, he declares, 'Praise the Lord!
Unfeigned brotherly love is brotherly love that is genuine, without pretense; it is brotherly love without any kind of mask
If a brother takes in dissenting thoughts concerning the Lord's recovery, he may still love the brothers, but that love will be feigned
If he decides to obey the truth and by that obedience purifies his soul, this purification will result in unfeigned brotherly love
Inwardly they are doubting, and their souls, including the mind, the emotion, and the will, have been polluted
When we have purified our souls by our obedience to the truth, we can love one another from the heart fervently
To love from the heart is to have a love that comes not only from the parts of the soul but also from the conscience
Regeneration with the divine life is the base, the ground, for the purification, sanctification, of our souls unto unfeigned love
We may paraphrase Peter's writing this way: 'Brothers and sisters, don't you know that we have all been regenerated?
You need to realize that you have been regenerated of incorruptible seed which is conveyed to us in the living word of God'
In verses 24 and 25 Peter goes on to say, 'Because all flesh is as grass, and all its glory as the flower of grass
God's full salvation includes the Father's regeneration, the Son's redemption, and the Spirit's sanctification
These two matters, a holy manner of life and unfeigned brotherly love, are a picture of the genuine church life
Holiness and love are the result of the full salvation carried out by the operation of the Triune God upon His elect
In 2:1 Peter goes on to say, 'Therefore, putting away all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings'
According to the sequence of these five matters, malice is the root, the source, and evil speaking is the expression
The development from malice to evil speaking includes guile hypocrisies and envyings three downward steps from malice toward evil speaking
The root is malice, the development includes guile, hypocrisy, and envy, and the final expression is evil speaking
Verse 2 says, 'As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it you may grow unto salvation'
The purpose of Peter's writing here is to show a contrast between guilelessness and the guile that proceeds out of malice
Just as our physical body is nourished with milk, so our inner being, our soul, needs to be nourished with the guileless milk of the word
If you are full of malice, guile, hypocrisy, envy, and evil speaking, you will not have any appetite for the Word
Suppose for quite a long period of time, perhaps more than a year, a particular brother has been filled with malice
Because he is full of malice and also full of guile, hypocrisies, and envyings, spontaneously he begins to speak negatively about others
According to Peter's word in verse 2, we should long for the guileless milk of the word so that by it we may grow
We should desire the guileless milk of the word not only to have a spiritual antibiotic, but also to receive nourishment so that we may grow
If we are growing in life, the life element within us will increase, and there will be an increase in our spiritual stature
God's full and complete salvation has a long span-from regeneration, including justification, to glorification
We need to grow by feeding on Christ as the nourishing milk in the word of God unto full salvation, unto maturity for glorification
To be saved from malice, guile, hypocrisies, envyings, and evil speakings is not accomplished by effort of our own
If you try to give nourishment to something lifeless and inorganic, that thing would become corrupt and unclean
Both regeneration in 1:23 and the newborn babes in 2:2 point to the same matter-regeneration with the divine life
As newborn babes, we should long for the guileless milk of the word so that by it we may grow unto transformation
It was certain that the believers were newborn babes, but as verse 3 indicates, some of them may not have tasted that the Lord is good
Today millions of believers have truly been regenerated, but a great many have never tasted that the Lord is good
She praised the Lord that He gave her husband a better job, provided a better place for them to live, and even healed their son
Suppose the same sister testified something like this: 'My husband has lost his job, we have lost our dwelling place, and our son is ill
No matter what kind of environment we may be in or what kind of circumstances we may have, we are sustained by the Lord
In these verses Peter indicates that if we have tasted that the Lord is good, we shall surely long for the milk in the word
The very Christ chosen by God as a stone, even a cornerstone held in honor, is the preciousness to His believers
Verse 8 says And A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense who stumble at the word being disobedient to which also they were appointed
In 2:4 Peter says, 'To whom coming, a living stone, having been rejected by men, but with God chosen, held in honor'
Let us go on to consider what Peter says in verses 6 through 8 regarding Christ as the stone for God's building
To the Pharisees and to all the others who opposed Him, the crucifixion of Christ was a sign that God had rejected Him
There the word denotes preciousness in essence; here it indicates preciousness as recognized and held in honor
The Jewish people may have an earthly Zion, but we Christians, those who believe in Christ, have a heavenly Zion
Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved'
The very Christ chosen by God as a stone, even a cornerstone held in honor, is the preciousness to His believers
The resurrection and exaltation of Christ are strong signs both that God has chosen Him and that He is held in honor by God
Christ is not only a rejected stone and a stone held in honor; He is also a stumbling stone and a rock of offense
For us, He is the cornerstone positively, but for the unbelieving Jews, He is a stumbling stone and a rock of offense
In verse 8 Peter speaks of those 'who stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed'
It is the word quoted by Peter in verses 6 through 8, the word regarding a chosen stone, a cornerstone held in honor, being laid in Zion
Sometimes we have spoken with certain believers regarding the matter of Christ being both the building stone and the stumbling stone
We shall not believe that, on the one hand, Christ is the building stone and that, on the other hand, He is also the stumbling stone
Anyone who does not believe in the word will stumble at it and then reap the fruit, the harvest, of what he has sown
Someone may hear that the Lord is merciful, gracious, full of kindness, sending the rain upon the just and on the unjust
Eventually, the result of not believing the Lord's strict word and stumbling at it will be disobedience, rebellion
The principle is that if we have this kind of unbelief, we shall reap the harvest of disobedience, and that disobedience is rebellion
In verse 3 we have a condition related to drinking the milk of the word: 'If you have tasted that the Lord is good'
In these verses Peter seems to be saying, 'You believers have all been regenerated, and now you are as newborn babes
By the guileless milk in the word they could grow unto a salvation that was transformation for their building up
Because it is sometimes difficult to understand Peter, we need help to grasp the various points he covers in his writings
Feeding on Christ by the nourishing milk in the Word of God is not only for growing in life; it is also for building up
At regeneration we received the seed of the divine life, which by its growth in us transforms us into living stones
When Peter received the revelation concerning Christ, the Lord revealed further that He also was the rock-a stone
Referring to the Lord Jesus and Peter John 142 says Looking at him Jesus said You are Simon the son of John you shall be called Cephas
No doubt, these two incidents, the one recorded in John 1 and the other in Matthew 16, were deeply impressed into Peter's being
On the one hand, the element of wood is carried away; on the other hand, the element of stone is brought in to replace the element of wood
As we stay in this flow, the current will carry away our natural substance and replace it with heavenly, divine minerals
Gradually, over a period of time, we shall be transformed or 'petrified'; that is, we shall become precious stones
We have pointed out that the way to come to Christ as the living stone is to drink the guileless milk of the word
If others ask us what is happening in the Lord's recovery, we should say, 'We are simply allowing the water of life to flow through us
Let us allow this process of petrification, of transformation, to take place for forty or fifty years and then see what the outcome will be
In the New Jerusalem there will not be any clay, for all the clay will have been transformed into precious stone
It is not the spiritual life in an individualistic way, but that in a corporate way that can fulfill God's purpose and satisfy His desire
Royal' denotes the status of our priesthood, which is kingly, like that of Christ the King, our High Priest, typified by Melchisedec
He says not only that we have been called to God's glory and virtue; he says that we have been called by His glory and virtue
According to verse 9, we should proclaim abroad the virtues of the One who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light
Now, after they were called by God, they became God's people, God's particular possession, as a treasure to God
Before believing in Him, they did not obtain His mercy, but after believing, they have obtained the Lord's mercy
Unlike the practice of many Christians today, this telling out should be a corporate matter, not an individual one
We are transformed unto the building up of a spiritual house for God's dwelling, a holy priesthood for God's service
In the introduction to this Epistle we see that the operation of God's economy is to bring us into the full enjoyment of the Triune God
God's full salvation includes the regeneration of the Father, the redemption of the Son, and the sanctification of the Spirit
If we get into the depths of this book, we shall see that these are the basic matters Peter was seeking to cover as he wrote
In this book the mighty hand of God is emphasized because the subject of this Epistle is the Christian life under the government of God
The mighty hand of God is for the carrying out of His governmental administration, and with this administration there is a goal
Both by his experiences and by his writing Peter could declare what the true grace of God is and testify concerning it
The fleshly lusts are in man's fallen body , warring against man's soul-man's inner being, composed of mind, will, and emotion
You are sojourners and pilgrims, people who belong to another country and who are traveling through a foreign country
The fleshly lusts in the fallen body war against the soul, against our inner being, that includes the mind, the will, and the emotion
The fleshly lusts often war against what we think in our mind, what we love in our emotion, and what we decide with our will
The day of visitation is the day when God will look upon His pilgrim people, as a shepherd over his wandering sheep
Concerning the understanding of the day of visitation mentioned in verse 12, there are different schools of interpretation
Instead of coming to judge us, God visits us for the purpose of looking upon us and observing how we are doing and what we are doing
Because they saw God's visitation of the saints, a good number of opposers regretted what they had done and repented
Even though these saints were evil spoken of, they lived a marvelous, excellent life under God's gracious care
Their excellent manner of life and God's visitation eventually caused the opposers to repent and give glory to God
Although they did not have the word to describe it, they were witnessing the Lord's transforming work in their son
Eventually, the parents had a complete change in attitude, and in some cases, they also came into the church life
In verse 13 'institution' means the making of regulations or ordinances much like the enacting of laws by the legislature
According to the context, 'every human institution' includes 'a king as supreme' and also 'governors as sent by him'
In verse 15 Peter goes on to say, 'Because so is the will of God, by doing good to silence the ignorance of foolish men'
The brotherhood is the aggregate of the brothers, the family of the brothers, the brothers in the feeling of brotherliness
By using the word brotherhood Peter indicates that we should not merely love the brothers separately, one by one, or individualistically
Although they may love one another, this is not the love in the category of a '-hood,' as love in a brotherhood
If twelve people are in the same family, born of the same parents, their love for one another will be a love in a -hood
Even though certain masters may be crooked, the believers who are household servants should be subject to them
In verses 19 and 20 Peter says, 'For this is grace, if anyone because of conscience toward God bears sorrows, suffering unjustly
As we have pointed out a number of times, grace is actually the Triune God becoming our life for our experience and enjoyment
According to the context, the unjust suffering spoken of in verse 19 must be the mistreatment inflicted by the unbelieving masters
We shall have at least five major problems: temper, disposition, habit, background, and our way of understanding things
They will have difficulties with the five troubling factors of temper, disposition, habit, background, and way of understanding
If a mother-in-law is visiting at such a time, she will find the situation altogether unpleasant and unacceptable
In spite of the differences in temper disposition habit background and understanding grace inwardly motivates both the husband and the wife
If the mother-in-law of either the husband or wife observes their way of living, she will find it gracious, pleasant, and acceptable
Anyone observing a believer living this way in a situation of suffering and persecution would have to recognize that this is grace
If a mother-in-law sees her daughter and son-in-law living such a life, she may say, 'Thank You, Lord Jesus, for Your grace'
As we have seen, in verse 20 Peter says, 'For what credit is it if sinning and being buffeted you shall endure it?
In order to understand Peter's writing here, we need the sufficient knowledge and proper realization of the divine facts
Toward the end of this portion Peter says in verse 19, 'This is grace,' and at the end of verse 20, 'This is grace with God'
If the Greek word is translated literally, the reader may find it difficult to understand what Peter is saying
Verse 19 says, 'For this is grace, if anyone because of conscience toward God bears sorrows, suffering unjustly'
It is the motivation of the divine life which we received at our regeneration inwardly and the expression of this life outwardly
The word 'this' in verse 21 refers to the unjust sufferings, the suffering for doing good, mentioned in verses 19 and 20
Probably very few of us, whether young or old, have realized from verse 21 that we have been called to suffer unjust treatment
As the context indicates, some of the believers to whom this Epistle was written were called to suffer unjustly under crooked masters
In verse 19 Peter continues, 'For this is grace, if anyone because of conscience toward God bears sorrows, suffering unjustly'
As we have pointed out, conscience toward God means consciousness of God-the consciousness of our relation to God
Verse 20 is very similar in content to verse 19: 'For what credit is it if sinning and being buffeted you shall endure it?
Literally, the Greek word means a writing-copy, an under-writing for students to use in tracing letters as they learn to draw them
The Lord Jesus has set His suffering life before us as an under-writing for us to copy by tracing and following His steps
In the process of spiritual xeroxing, the Spirit of Christ is the light, and the riches of the divine life are the inking substance
We should become xerox copies of Christ by experiencing a process that involves spiritual light and the riches of the divine life
The manner of life that expresses the processed Triune God as grace is not only grace-it is a reproduction of Christ
Is not as easy to understand how Christ can be the grace expressed in our daily life, and how He can be the writing- copy
From experience we know that as we are living out Christ day by day, we are under the process of spiritual xeroxing
To illustrate, a man may set up an example for a monkey to stand upright, and the monkey stands up, imitating the man
Both the heavenly light and the spiritual ink are available to us, and we are all undergoing the process of spiritual xeroxing
If we do not have adequate Christian experience, we shall not understand what Peter says concerning grace and concerning Christ as our model
Because we in ourselves cannot be without guile, Peter specifically says that no guile was found in the Lord's mouth
He Himself was always under the government of God, and He committed everything related to Him to God's judgment
The thing spoken of here is the daily judgment of God's government in this world, exercised with regard to His children
After the millennium, all the dead, including men and demons, will be judged and perish , and the heavens and the earth will be burned up
Some judgments result in a disciplinary dealing, some in a dispensational punishment, and some in eternal perdition
For this reason, Peter says that when Christ was on earth, He kept committing all to God the Father, who judges righteously
According to Genesis 315 the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent and the serpent would bruise the heel of the womans seed
Apparently, being kept away from sin terminates us; actually, it enlivens us so that we may live to righteousness
Christ put our sins upon Himself and carried them up onto the tree, the cross, where He suffered God's righteous judgment for all our sins
Because of the life of Christ within us, we live always with the intention toward righteousness, the inclination toward righteousness
The life-giving Spirit is working within us continually to carry out the subjective aspect of Christ's cross in our being
Daily we are undergoing the inward working of the cross of Christ, and daily we are being made alive so that we may live to righteousness
It is important for us to realize that Christ our Savior has carried up all our sins onto the tree and died there for us
Spontaneously, we are under God's government and have no problem with His government because we live to righteousness
In verse 25 Peter goes on to say, 'For you were as sheep being led astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls'
A shepherd takes care of the physical needs of his flock, and Christ our Shepherd takes care of the needs of our soul
Many times we speak of turning to the spirit, perhaps expecting that when we turn to the spirit everything will be all right
Once you arrive at that city, you will need a guide, someone to direct you to the exact place where you want to go
These disciples were going in one direction, but the Lord went with them in order to turn them to go in another direction
Luke 24:15 says, 'And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them'
At the same time, we shall experience Him as the Savior saving us, as the Shepherd leading and guiding us, and as the Overseer caring for us
In 2:18-25 we have five important matters, five aspects of Christ: grace, the model, the Savior, the Shepherd, and the Overseer
Peter did not write this Epistle merely according to the knowledge of doctrine, but according to his rich experiences of Christ
Through Christ's bruise, a suffering that resulted in death, we have been healed of our death, so that we may live in His resurrection
From our spirit Christ reaches the parts of our soul-the mind, emotion, and will-and takes care of all our problems, needs, and wounds
He knew the things on earth, and according to 2 Corinthians 12, he was taken to the third heaven and also to Hades, to Paradise
For some reason he does not mention in his writings the matter of Christ's making a proclamation to the spirits in prison
In 3:20-21 we have an excellent word by Peter concerning baptism, a word that cannot be found in the Epistles of Paul
Peter 3:1-13 is still in the section concerned with a life in an excellent manner toward all men in all concerns
In Ephesians 5 Paul gives a word concerning married life that is familiar to every reader of the New Testament
The most outstanding point is what Peter says about a husband and wife being 'joint-heirs of the grace of life'
Paul does not say anything about the grace of life, much less about a married couple being joint-heirs, or co-heirs, of the grace of life
Peter wanted the husbands and wives to realize that they are heirs together not of property or material possessions but of the grace of life
Perhaps you have been a Christian for many years and yet do not have any understanding of what Peter means by the grace of life
The problem is that, when we read about this, our mind may be veiled, or we may not pay adequate attention to this term
In 1 Peter we have four unique expressions concerning grace: multiplied grace, grace of life, varied grace, and all grace
Although Paul has a great deal to say concerning grace, he does not use the unique expressions Peter uses in his first Epistle
The phrase 'in like manner' refers to the subjection of the household servants to their masters, as described in 2:18
As a household servant submits himself to his master, so the wives should subject themselves to their own husbands
That movement is against the Bible, for it is against God's ordination in His creation with respect to male and female
Concerning this matter, once again Peter uses a particular expression in pointing out that the females are weaker vessels
Even in the church life sisters may find it easier to subject themselves to a brother other than their own husband
The reason for this is that the wives know all the defects and shortcomings of their husbands, having lived with them in married life
Having had the concept that her husband was very nearly perfect, she may wonder if she has made a mistake in marrying him
The pure and chaste manner of life must be the holy manner of life, the excellent manner of life , and the good manner of life
Verse 3 says, 'Whose adorning, let it not be the outward plaiting of hair, and putting on of gold, or clothing with garments'
Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul-mind, emotion, and will-and of the main part of our spirit, the conscience
The wives' adornment before God should be their inner being-the hidden man of their heart, which is their spirit, in meekness and quietness
A spirit that has become meek and quiet is the kind of adornment that should be possessed by all Christian wives
He may have used the words 'meek' and 'quiet' because he knew that often the spirit of Christian wives is not meek and quiet
The sisters need to realize that when they exchange words with their husbands, they do not have a meek and quiet spirit
At the end of verse 6 Peter tells the wives to do good and not to fear any terror, that is, not to have fright or nervous excitement
In verse 1 Peter indicates that, as household servants are subject to their masters, so the wives should be subject to their own husbands
When he speaks concerning the husbands he indicates by the phrase in like manner that the husbands should subject themselves to their wives
If our married life is to be balanced, we need to have two poles, or, if you prefer to say it this way, two extremes
One pole should be the wife's subjection to the husband, and the other pole, the husband's subjection to the wife
If we have these two poles in our married life, we shall be balanced, and we shall live our married life in a 'temperate zone'
For a husband to dwell together with his wife according to knowledge is to live with her in an intelligent and reasonable way
If we have this knowledge, we shall know that God created woman the weaker vessel simply for the nature of the marriage relationship
We must realize that our wives' weakness was created by God specifically for the purpose of the marriage relationship
We need to understand the reason for the weakness of the female, and we need to understand the nature of the marriage relationship
In verse 7 Peter also says that the husbands should assign honor to their wives as to the weaker, female vessel
Man, including woman, was made a vessel to contain God , and believers in Christ are vessels to contain Christ as the treasure
Although the wives as female vessels are weaker they are still vessels of the Lord and can be vessels unto honor deserving a certain honor
If we see that a husband should honor his wife, we should realize that this implies some kind of submission to her
A husband should not argue that because his wife is the weaker vessel, she should not be honored by him, the stronger vessel
Married life can be compared to a corporation, a business, that assigns a percentage of the yearly profits to its shareholders or owners
In our married life husbands must learn what percentage of the 'profit' of the marriage 'corporation' should go to the wife
Our dwelling with our wives should be according to knowledge and also accompanied by the assigning of honor to our wives
If our married life lacks this balance, it will be like a scale with one side in the air and the other side down low
If you assign honor to your wife in a proper way, the 'business' of your married life will be healthy and sound
In brief, the grace of life is the Triune God processed to become the all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling Spirit
Verse 8 says, 'And finally, be all of the same mind, sympathetic, loving the brothers, tenderhearted, humbleminded'
Peter's word here corresponds to what the Lord Jesus says in Matthew 5:44 and to what Paul says in Romans 12:14
We have been called to bless others, so we, as a blessed people, should always bless others that we might inherit blessing
In this message we come to 3:14-22, a section that speaks of suffering for righteousness by the will of God, as Christ suffered
Peter speaks of fear a number of times in this Epistle because the teaching of this book concerns the government of God
In our suffering of persecution, we should make Christ particular; we should show that He is magnificent, absolutely different from idols
Sanctifying Christ as Lord in our hearts is not a matter of outward activity to set Him apart from what is common
To sanctify Christ as Lord in our hearts means that when we are under persecution, we have the Lord in our hearts
If we are bold, sanctifying the Lord in our hearts and expressing Him in our faces, others will realize that we do have something within us
Since the conscience is a part of our human spirit , to care for our conscience is to care for our spirit before God
If we would have a good manner of life and sanctify the Lord in our daily life, we must take care of our conscience
We should not be satisfied that we are justified by the community, by the brothers, or even by the entire church
A renewed conscience enlightened by the indwelling Spirit is trustworthy in its testimony and accurate in its judgment
The reason the enlightened conscience of the regenerated spirit can be an inner judge is that it cooperates with the indwelling God
In verse 17 Peter continues, 'For it is better to suffer for doing good, if the will of God should will it, than for doing evil'
Sins in verse 18 and in 2:24, 1 Corinthians 15:3, and Hebrews 9:28 refer to sins we commit in our outward conduct
The fact that Christ, the righteous One, died 'on behalf of the unrighteous' indicates that His death was for redemption, not for martyrdom
The crucifixion only put Christ to death in His flesh, which He received through His incarnation , not in His spirit
Verse 19 and the first part of verse 20 say, 'In which also having gone to the spirits in prison, He proclaimed to those once disobedient
Throughout the centuries great teachers of different schools have had varying interpretations concerning 'the spirits in prison'
The word 'proclaim' does not indicate the preaching of good news, but the proclaiming of the triumphant victory
These are angelic beings, not human beings, and therefore are different from the 'eight souls' spoken of in verse 20
Many interpreters say that the spirits in verse 19 denote the spirits of certain human beings who disobeyed Noah's preaching
Another interpretation is that Christ, after He died, preached the gospel to the spirits of human beings who had died
According to this interpretation, after people die and go to Hades, the gospel may still be preached to them there in Hades
It was after His death that He went to that particular place, in His empowered spirit, to proclaim Christ's victory
They left their own place, came down to earth, and used human bodies to commit fornication with the daughters of men
Finding that situation intolerable, God would no longer allow the human race to exist, because mankind had been polluted by Satan's angels
A number of Bible scholars, including Pember and Govett, agree with this understanding of this part of the Word
Although He was put to death in His body, He was enlivened and empowered in His spirit even before the resurrection
In this enlivened and empowered spirit He went to proclaim to the rebellious angels God's victory over Satan, their leader
He shows us that Christ's death not only accomplished redemption for us, but also gained the victory over Satan and his followers
In the Old Testament the waters of the flood at the time of Noah and the waters of the Red Sea both typify baptism
The ark saved Noah and his family from God's judgment, from the punishment of God's condemnation that came by the flood
The water saved them and separated them from that corrupted age and brought them into a new age to begin a new life on a new earth
The water of baptism delivers us out of the inherited vain manner of life into a manner of life in resurrection
Baptism itself does not and cannot put away the filth of our flesh-the dirt of our fallen nature and defilement of fleshly lust
Peter's thought here may be that baptism is the appeal to God of the baptized one for a good conscience unto God
Both before God and toward man we have had many transgressions, trespasses, and offenses, and we had a great deal of guilt
The proper preaching of the gospel brings the view of this 'scenery' into us, and the Holy Spirit enlightens us
In our being there is a reflection of Christ's accomplishments, and this reflection is our believing in Christ
After we have been baptized and rise up out of the water, we have a conscience that is good and pure, a conscience without condemnation
Baptism does enable us to have the assurance and the testimony that we appeal to God for a good and pure conscience
Apart from the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we could not have resurrection life, and we could not have the life-giving Spirit within us
It is through the resurrection of Christ that we genuinely and with assurance experience the reality of what is figured in baptism
When the life-giving Spirit comes into us with resurrection life, this Spirit makes the death of Christ effective in our experience
Immediately and spontaneously, we are free from sin, and we enjoy the redemption accomplished by Christ on the cross
If the ark of Noah did not represent the Christ of resurrection, how could the ark pass through the water and come out safely?
Christ not only entered into death and passed through it, but He even deliberately stayed in the realm of death for three days
In His resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit to come into us and to impart His resurrection life to us
Now this resurrection life with the life-giving Spirit makes every aspect of Christ's death real and effective to us in our experience
Through the organic union, we are brought not only into Christ's resurrection but also into His ascension and exaltation
One main purpose of this book is to encourage and exhort the believers to follow the footsteps of Christ in their persecution
Many Christians think that as long as we love God and do His will, we shall be under His blessing, and we shall not suffer in any way
According to this concept, we shall be blessed and may have a good job, a nice house, and an excellent family life
If we have the mind of Christ, we shall realize that we are living in a rebellious age and in a crooked, perverted generation
Because the age is rebellious and the generation is perverse, the more we love God and do His will, the more we shall suffer
Suffering responds to Christ's redemption in this purpose, preserving us from the sinful manner of life, from the flood of dissipation
If you have vast riches and do not need to work, you will be able to spend your time indulging yourself in your lusts
If you are wealthy and drive a luxurious car to make a display, immediately the lust in your heart will be stirred up
In verse 2 Peter goes on to say, 'No longer to live the rest of the time in the flesh in the lusts of men, but in the will of God'
If He charges husbands to assign a certain portion of honor to their wives, surely He Himself knows how much suffering to assign to us
The opposition we face, even from members of our own family, may be a suffering assigned to us by God for our good
Literally the Greek word rendered 'desire' here is purpose, will; that is, intention, inclination; hence, desire
The Roman Empire was defeated not only by foreign armies; it was defeated because of its own inward corruption
The first day of the week was arranged by God to be a free day so that we may worship Him and learn the things of God
In verse 3 Peter tells us that the time which has passed is sufficient for us to have worked the desire of the nations
To live in the flesh in the lusts of men is common to unbelieving Gentiles, who are running together into the flood of dissipation
The principle is the same with our not running together with unbelievers and worldly people into the flood of dissipation
Your colleagues at work may think it strange that you do not use the weekend to indulge in worldly entertainment
The way of this corrupted world, the way of this crooked, perverted generation, is to follow the trend of indulgence and dissipation
It is all right for someone with a special need to take a little wine for his health, but that one should not go too far and drink to excess
According to Peter's word in 4:1, we need to arm ourselves with the mind of Christ in order to fight against the flesh with its lusts
If we try to arm ourselves with the same mind without having Christ as our life, we shall merely be imitating Christ in an outward way
In verse 5 Peter goes on to say, 'Who shall render an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead'
In verse 5 Peter says that the unbelievers will render an account to the One who is ready to judge the living and the dead
In 2 Timothy 4:1 Paul says to Timothy, 'I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is about to judge the living and the dead
As the righteous Judge , He will judge the living at the time of His second appearing, and He will judge the dead after the millennium
the gospel was preached also to the dead' means that it was preached to certain believers who had died before this Epistle was written
Peter says that the gospel was preached to the dead so that they might be judged according to men in the flesh
If we would understand what Peter says concerning judgment in verse 6, we need to have a full view of the entire Epistle
Aaron, Miriam, and Moses all died under the judgment of God, for they all had done certain things that were wrong, against God's government
Eventually, of all those who came out of Egypt at the time of the exodus, only two persons, Joshua and Caleb, entered into the good land
After the millennium all the dead including men and demons will be judged and will perish and the heavens and the earth will be burned up
Some judgments result in a disciplinary dealing, some in a dispensational punishment, and some in eternal perdition
In verses 15 and 16 Peter says that we should not suffer as wrongdoers or as those who meddle into others' affairs
In order to keep us from sin or cause us to cease from indulging in our lusts, God may assign a certain kind of persecution to us
He judged the rebellious angels, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the children of Israel in the wilderness
All things on which the flesh rests will pass away, and the end of them, the apostle tells us here, has drawn near
Verse 8 continues, 'Before all things having fervent love among yourselves, because love covers a multitude of sins'
Because the saints love the Lord the church and the ministry they are willing to extend hospitality to those visiting from other localities
Verse 10 continues Each one according as he has received a gift ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God
The varied grace of God, as the all grace in 5:10, is the rich supply of life, which is the Triune God ministered into us in many aspects
The fact that verse 10 is the direct continuation of verse 9 indicates that even showing hospitality is a gift
You need grace to prepare food for your guests, to provide transportation for them, and to help them with special needs
In the ministry of grace, as mentioned in verse 10, our speaking should be God's speaking, God's utterance, that conveys divine revelation
Peter considered the persecution the believers suffered as such a burning furnace used by God to purify their life
If we were not Christians, we certainly would not suffer the kind of persecution described in verses 12 and 13
Because we believe in Christ love Christ live Christ bear testimony to Christ witnessing of Him in this age the world rises up against us
Because he believes in Christ, loves Christ, and follows Christ, his business may suffer, and he may lose the opportunity to become wealthy
Paul could even say that he made up what was lacking of the sufferings of Christ for the sake of His Body, the church
We may face fiery ordeals, but these are the sufferings of Christ in which we have the privilege to participate
According to my understanding, this means that we shall not only be joyful inwardly, but we shall sound out our joy
In the name of Christ' is actually in the person of Christ, in Christ Himself, because the name denotes the person
The believers, having believed into Christ , and having been baptized into His name , that is, into Himself , are in Christ and one with Him
When they are reproached in His name, they are reproached with Him, sharing His sufferings, in the fellowship of His sufferings
Peter tells us in verse 14 that if we are reproached in the name of Christ, the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon us
According to what Peter says in this Epistle, the Spirit of Christ is in us, and the Spirit of glory rests upon us
We should rejoice when we are reproached in the name of Christ, because the Spirit of glory is resting upon us
Verse 15 says, 'For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a meddler into others' affairs'
In verse 16 Peter continues, 'But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name'
It glorifies God because when we suffer in the name of Christ and as Christians the Spirit of God who is the Spirit of glory rests upon us
The ending -ianos, denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire
Those who worshipped the emperor the CaesarKaisar were called Kaisarianos which means the adherents of Kaisar the people belonging to Kaisar
When people believed in Christ and became His followers, this caused some in the Empire to consider Christ as a rival of their Kaisar
At Antioch , they began to call the followers of Christ Christianos , adherents of Christ, as a nickname, a term of reproach
As we have pointed out, Peter's use of the word 'judgment' in verse 17 indicates that persecutions and sufferings are a kind of judgment
The thought of dispensational discipline is found not only in the writings of Peter, but also in the Epistles of Paul
In verse 29 Paul uses the word judgment, saying that the one who does not discern the body eats and drinks judgment to himself
To die this way is equivalent to what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 10:5 about being strewn along in the wilderness
When they read about judgment, they may say, 'Oh, we have been redeemed by the Lord, and we can never be judged
According to the Bible, God in His government carries out His universal administration by different kinds of judgment
According to the record in Matthew 25, at the time of the Lord's coming back, all the living ones will be judged
After they made their exodus from Egypt and crossed the Red Sea, they enjoyed the living water out of the cleft rock and the heavenly manna
Out of more than two million people who came out of Egypt, only two, Joshua and Caleb, escaped the judgment of God leading to death
God intended to preserve his body so that Moses could appear on the mount of transfiguration to be with the Lord
These judgments include both the judgment for eternal perdition and the judgment for dispensational discipline
To teach the matter of disciplinary judgment, a discipline that is dispensational, is altogether according to the Scriptures
In 4:17 Peter asks what will be the end of those who disobey the gospel of God if God's judgment first begins from us
As God's people, the Jews had received the Mosaic law and also the ordinances and rituals of the Old Testament
John should have eaten priestly food, which was composed mainly of fine flour and the meat of the sacrifices offered to God by His people
John did not offer sacrifices, he did not light the lamps in the temple, and he did not burn the incense on the incense altar
According to Matthew 3:2, John preached in the wilderness, saying, 'Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
The local ones, in particular the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the leaders of the people, were not willing to believe
In their writings the apostles used the word 'disobey' with respect to the unbelieving Jews who did not obey the gospel
Words such as 'dispersion' in 1:1 and 'disobey' in 4:17 indicate that Peter's writing has a strongly dispensational aspect
When God's dispensation changed and He wanted to give them the gospel, the Jews disobeyed the gospel and rebelled against it
If we would understand verse 17, we need to realize that 'disobey the gospel' refers mainly to the disobedience of the unbelieving Jews
Because of this dispensational aspect of 1 Peter, certain verses are not fully applicable to Gentile believers
In verse 18 Peter goes on to say, 'And if the righteous is saved with difficulty, where will the ungodly and sinner appear'?
God saved His chosen pilgrims with difficulty through much discipline and through many judgments, sufferings, and persecutions
On the day of Pentecost, when God poured out His Spirit for salvation, the Lord opened the door for all sinners to be saved
When they asked the Lord Jesus about the time of His coming, He told them that this was something known only by the Father
When the disciples spoke to Him concerning the buildings of the temple, He answered, 'Do you not see all these things?
In Luke 21:20 He said, 'When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that her desolation has drawn near'
We know that in not too long a time the city of Jerusalem will be destroyed, and God will judge the unbelievers'
Literally 'commit' here means to give in charge as a deposit, as in Luke 12:48; Acts 20:32; 1 Timothy 1:18; and 2 Timothy 2:2
The Creator in verse 19 does not refer to the Creator of the new creation in the new birth, but to the Creator of the old creation
If the thought of God's judgment were removed from the books of 1 and 2 Peter, these Epistles would lose their basic structure
Many Christian readers of these Epistles may not pay adequate attention to the matter of God's governmental judgment
Many years ago, some of us were having fellowship concerning the main subject of the books of the New Testament
We all knew that Matthew is on God's kingdom; Mark, on service to God; Luke, on God's salvation; and John, on life
Eventually, after God's judgment has been completed, there will be a new heaven and a new earth wherein righteousness dwells
God's judgment began to be exercised in the Old Testament, and it has been continually exercised throughout the generations
In the New Testament we see that God's judgment begins from His own household and ends with the burning of the old heaven and the old earth
When God has thoroughly cleansed the universe through judgment, there will be a new heaven and a new earth wherein righteousness will dwell
In particular, we need to see that the subject of these two books is God's government carried out by His judgment
The thing spoken of here is the daily judgment of God's government in this world, exercised with regard to His children
After the millennium, all the dead, including men and demons, will be judged and perish , and the heavens and the earth will be burned up
Some judgments result in a disciplinary dealing, some in a dispensational punishment, and some in eternal perdition
It is important for us to realize that, in Darby's words, the judgment in 1:17 is not 'the final judgment of the soul'
What we have in 1:17 is the daily judgment of God's government in the world, a judgment that is exercised with regard to His children
Those who oppose this teaching from the Word may say, 'How is it possible for us, God's children in grace, to be judged by God?
In the Old Testament God judged the fallen angels, He judged the earth at the time of Noah, and He judged the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
Three categories of people are included in God's judgment: the Jews, the church people, and the worldly people
The day of the Lord will be a day of judgment before the millennium on the Jews, the believers, and the Gentiles
After that judgment has been carried out, the heavens and the earth will be burned up and the new heaven and the new earth will appear
According to the Gospel of Matthew, some believers will suffer during the dispensation of the kingdom in the coming age
Some Bible teachers say that the unfaithful servants in Matthew 25 are false Christians, whereas the faithful ones are genuine Christians
Of following the interpretation that the unfaithful servants are false Christians, we believe the pure Word of God
We can see three kinds of results of God's governmental judgment: disciplinary dealing, dispensational punishment, and eternal perdition
Peter 4:5 says, speaking of unbelievers, 'Who shall render an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead'
The relative pronoun 'who' here refers to the nations , who are astonished at the believers' different manner of life and speak evil of them
They have to render an account by relating to the Lord all that they have done and spoken in their entire life
Before the Lord sits on His throne of glory according to Matthew 25:31, He will carry out many judgments during the great tribulation
During the period of the great tribulation, many people will be killed by natural calamities, by wars, and by Antichrist
It will also be the fulfillment of Paul's word spoken in Acts 17:31, which says that God has appointed Christ to judge all men
Again, in 1 Peter 4:5, Peter says that everyone will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead
The 'dead' in 4:5 refers to the dead unbelievers, who will be judged at the great white throne described in Revelation 20
According to Revelation 20:15, 'If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire'
It signifies the burning of a smelting furnace for the purification of gold and silver, like the metaphor used in 1:7
Peter considered the persecution the believers suffered as such a burning furnace used by God to purify their life
The fiery ordeal is God's way to deal not with sinners and opposers but with believers, the members of His household
In the administration of His government, God uses fiery ordeals as a furnace to purify any dross the believers may have
In this message we shall continue our review of God's governmental judgment as revealed in the first four chapters of 1 Peter
In verse 18 Peter goes on to ask, 'And if the righteous is saved with difficulty, where will the ungodly and sinner appear'?
Many believers have the concept that because they believe in the Lord Jesus and are saved, everything in their lives should be smooth
The Lord Jesus had prophesied concerning this in Matthew 24:2, when He said of the temple that not one stone would be left upon another
The word 'commit' here literally means to give in charge as a deposit, as in Luke 12:48; Acts 20:32; 1 Timothy 1:18; and 2 Timothy 2:2
The Creator spoken of in verse 19 is not the Creator of the new creation in the new birth, but the Creator of the old creation
If we would carefully read the two Epistles of Peter, we would see that Peter is quite deep in the matter of life
At the same time in his writings Peter gives a serious word regarding God's governmental dealings with His regenerated people
In the Epistles of Peter we need to see the Christian life and God's government and also see how the two go together
My immediate concern is that those of us in the Lord's recovery will have a clear view of all the basic matters in the Word
All the elders need to be clear concerning the condition of the churches with respect to the knowledge of the truth
We should be able to do the same with the Gospel of John the Epistles of Peter the book of Revelation and in fact all of the New Testament
If we are filled with the solid content of truth in knowledge life and experience we shall have a firm foundation for our praise and release
We shall also be able to show others that we have a basis for the shouting of praises and the release of the spirit
When we read the Bible, study the Bible, or listen to a message, we may apply what we read or hear in a traditional and even a light way
We need to take the Word into us as our nourishment, and we also need to learn how to apply it to ourselves and others
You may have a general idea regarding this, but you may not know how to use this truth or how to present it properly to others
You may contact a Christian who does not know that Christ is life to him or that the Spirit of life dwells in him
You need to pray for that one and help him to realize something from the Word regarding Christ as life and the indwelling Spirit of life
If we speak concerning this at the proper time, others will be helped, and there will be a positive reaping from what we say
If we treasure the Word and grasp every opportunity to get into it and to take it into us, eventually we shall be fully equipped
We need to abandon the traditional way and take up a new way to know the truth, experience it, and present it to others
The word therefore indicates that 5111 is a concluding word to the preceding section concerning suffering for Christ in nobly doing right
Peter was the first of the initial apostles and at the same time he was one of the elders in the church at Jerusalem as was the apostle John
He was a leading witness, a martyr, one who was willing to sacrifice his life to testify of the sufferings of Christ
He was a fellow-elder, he was a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and he was a partaker of the glory about to be revealed
Committing our souls to a faithful Creator is effective only if we are engaged in welldoing, that is, if we are doing noble deeds
Because Peter was a noble witness, a noble martyr, he had the assurance that he would be a partaker of the coming glory
Whether an elder will be a partaker of the glory to come depends upon how noble and faithful he is as a witness
Not only the elders themselves, but the elders' wives also need to have the concept of sacrifice in relation to the eldership
If the elders are willing to sacrifice in this way then they will be witnesses of the sufferings of Christ and partakers of the coming glory
We thank the Lord that in His recovery, for the most part, the elders are loyal, faithful, and willing to sacrifice
It is a little herb for the supply of life, not a big tree for birds to lodge in , not a huge religion like Christendom
It is possible for an apostle to think since a certain church has been raised up through his ministry, that that church belongs to him
Because parents have a loving care for their children, they exercise oversight concerning the children's activities
More than a century ago, the so-called Brethren saw this truth, dropped all denominational names, and simply called themselves brothers
To oversee according to God means according to Gods nature desire way and glory not according to mans preference interest and purpose
The churches are God's possession, allotted to the elders as their allotments, their portions, entrusted to them by God for their care
It will be a portion of the glory for the overcomers' enjoyment in the manifestation of the kingdom of God and Christ
In this message we shall begin to consider 5:5-11, a section concerned with the mighty hand of God and its goal
Although the Greek word rendered elders in verse 5 is the same as that used in verse 1 here it should in principle refer to all older men
In 1:13 Peter charges us to gird up the loins of our mind, but here he indicates that our entire being needs to be girded
The Greek word for 'gird' here is derived from a noun meaning a slave's apron, which girds up his loose garments in the service
Because this loose clothing made it difficult to work, the slaves wore an apron to bind up their loose clothing
According to Peter's word, we should be girded with humility 'because God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble'
Strictly speaking, this grace refers to the Triune God Himself as the life supply being multiplied in the humble believer
The believers have received the initial grace, yet this grace needs to be multiplied in them that they may participate in all grace
The varied grace of God, as the all grace in 5:10, is the rich supply of life, which is the Triune God ministered into us in many aspects
The Greek word for 'humble' in 5:5 also means lowly, as in Matthew 11:29, where the Lord Jesus says, 'I am meek and lowly in heart'
In verse 6 Peter says, 'Therefore, be humbled under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time'
The words 'be humbled' here are passive voice, indicating to be made humble by God, mostly through the sufferings of persecutions
We may take a way that forces God to humble us, or we may take another way, the God-honoring way, that helps God to exalt us in due time
Although the verb 'casting' indicates a once-for-all act, because we are weak, we may need to cast our anxieties upon God again and again
If you watch the airplanes making their approach to land, you will see that they usually come in one after another
The older we are, the more anxiety we have, because more airplanes of anxiety are waiting to land at our 'airport'
The reason we need to be watchful is that our adversary, the Devil, as a roaring lion walks about, seeking someone to devour
We have seen that the brotherhood is the aggregate of the brothers, the family of the brothers, the brothers in the feeling of brotherliness
For this reason, Peter charges the believers to withstand the Devil by remaining firm in the faith, that is, firm in their faith
Preachers and teachers often quote the phrase 'the mighty hand of God' without regard to what it means in the book of 1 Peter as a whole
We have seen that the entire book of 1 Peter is on God's government, and that God's government is administrated through His judgment
According to Peter's word in 5:6-8, we need to do three things that are related to our experience of the mighty hand of God
We shall be watchful regarding our adversary, the Devil, who walks about as a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour
The initial step is to call us, and the consummate one is to glorify us, as mentioned here, 'who called you into His eternal glory'
In all these divine acts, the bountiful supply of the divine life is ministered to us as grace in varied experiences
The God of such grace will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground the persecuted believers after they suffer a little while
The suffering believers should be encouraged by the fact that, although they are suffering, their God is the God of all grace
After we have suffered a little while, the God of all grace will personally perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us
After God establishes us, He strengthens us, empowers us, and eventually, He grounds us in Himself as the Triune God
Peter wrote this Epistle to pilgrim believers in order to entreat them and testify to them of the grace of God
We have seen that Peter speaks of grace being multiplied, of varied grace, of all grace, and here, of true grace
