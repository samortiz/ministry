The divine life is the element with which we are transformed. Transformation is the addition of some new elements and the discharge of the old elements. It is a metabolic process. The main thing in this process is the element of the divine life. Therefore, we must learn to go along with the element of the divine life, the inner metabolism, the inner transformation, in order to be conformed by God to the expression of His firstborn Son, Christ.<h2 class=head3>By God Causing All Things to Work Together for Our Good</h2><p>Romans 8:28, which says that &#8220;God causes all things to work together for good to those...who are called according to the purpose,&#8221; unveils that it is by God causing all things to work together for our good that we are conformed to the image of the Son of God (v. 29) and are thus saved from the expression of our natural life. By His sovereignty God causes our environment to fulfill the purpose of His calling, that is, to conform us to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God. Our environment and our circumstances work together with the divine life within us for our conformation to the image of Christ. Whether we think our marriage is right or wrong, the wife or husband we have today is the right one for us. A brother may think that if God had given him a better wife, he would be a better person. In this way he may blame God for his being in a poor condition because of the &#8220;poor&#8221; wife the Lord has given him. Yet we must realize that all things, including our spouse and children, are the environment God uses to conform us to the image of the firstborn Son of God.<h2 class=head1>BY OUR BEING CONFORMED</h2><p>Concerning God&#8217;s full salvation to us, Romans 8:29 unveils to us that God predestinated His chosen people to be conformed to the image of His firstborn Son. The next verse, verse 30, also unveils to us that God calls, justifies, and will glorify His predestinated people. Both our conformation to the image of God&#8217;s Son and our glorification are the consummation of the purpose of God&#8217;s predestination concerning His people. This indicates that God&#8217;s conforming us and God&#8217;s glorifying us are two aspects of the same step of God&#8217;s saving us in the life of Christ. God&#8217;s conforming us is His fashioning us in the life of Christ that we may bear the image of Christ as the God-man to express Him as the embodiment of the Triune God, and God&#8217;s glorifying us is His saturating us with the splendor of the life of Christ that we may be soaked with His glory to express the processed God. Both are for the expression of the Triune God, which will be consummated at the consummation of our Christian life when Christ will appear the second time. This is to make us like Him not only in our spirit and soul but also in our body, and to bring us into His divine glory (Rom. 8:18; Heb. 2:10; 1 Pet. 5:10).<h2 class=head2>A Process in the Growth of the Divine Life, Not Merely an Operation by the Power of Christ</h2><p>God&#8217;s conforming us to the image of Christ and God&#8217;s glorifying us with His divine glory are a process in the growth of Christ&#8217;s divine life, not merely an operation by Christ&#8217;s power as unveiled in Philippians 3:21. While we are experiencing all these items-the reigning in Christ&#8217;s life over all the insubordinate things, the subjective sanctification in our disposition by the indwelling Spirit, the freeing from the bondage of sin by the law of the Spirit of life, the dispensing of the Triune God into our tripartite being, the renewing in our mind and the transformation in our soul, being built up in the organic Body of Christ, and the living of the proper church life in a locality-God is actually conforming us gradually to the image of His firstborn Son, the God-man, Christ. Not only so, while we are experiencing these items of life in the life of Christ, God is actually also saturating us with the splendor, the glory, of the life of Christ. Such a process of conforming us to the image of Christ and saturating us with the splendor of Christ&#8217;s life will proceed all the way through the whole course of our Christian life until we become mature in the divine life.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
