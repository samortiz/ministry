   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 8:4 is a verse that is parallel to Colossians 2:8 in the sense that it tells us to walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To walk according to spirit is to walk according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you walk daily according to spirit, you will automatically walk according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you walk in this way, you will do certain things or refrain from doing things, not because you are conforming to the practice of the local churches, but because you are walking according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the New Testament there are some crucial verses concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second Corinthians 3:17 tells us that the Lord is the Spirit; 2 Timothy 4:22 indicates that the Lord is with our spirit; 1 Corinthians 6:17 says that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit; and Romans 8:4 charges us to walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3:17 the Greek is better rendered the Spirit rather than that Spirit is the very Spirit spoken of in John 7:39, the Spirit which was not yet until Jesus was glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After His resurrection, the Lord became the Spirit who gives life to all who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today the Lord is the Spirit, and we have this Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Praise the Lord that we are one spirit with Him and that we may walk according to spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>AN ALL-INCLUSIVE COMMANDMENT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The commandment to walk according to spirit is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It includes what the Bible says about husbands loving their wives, about wives submitting to their husbands, about children honoring their parents, and about parents caring for their children.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the necessary virtues, such as humility, kindness, honesty, faithfulness, and love, are included in the walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God does not want us to endeavor to be virtuous, loving or submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He only wants us to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Oh, it is crucial for us to see this!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The book of Colossians reveals that Christ is all-inclusive and extensive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Him we have everything, for in Him we are made full, perfect, and complete, and we are supplied and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we must go on to see that, for our practical experience, this all-inclusive and extensive Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who do not care for the experience of Christ will deny that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we who care for the experience of Christ must see that the New Testament reveals clearly that the Lord is now the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the Spirit, the Lord is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, we know what the Lord is the Spirit and we know where He is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord wants us to be able to locate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Knowing that He is the Spirit in our spirit, it is easy for us to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Should someone ask you where is the Christ about whom you talk so much, you should answer that He dwells in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>APPLIED IN OUR DAILY LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to apply the matter of walking according to spirit in every aspect of our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, the brothers who live together need to apply this to their conversation with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One brother may be accustomed to speaking according to his mind, whereas another brother may talk according to his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Both brothers must learn to talk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When they rise up early in the morning, they should exercise to talk not from the mind or from the emotion, but from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The brothers should pray, Lord, grant me the grace to speak from my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, instead of doing this, the brothers may live according to the tradition of men and the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although they may not quarrel with each other, they may live according to their humanity which has been refined by the church life and not live according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A very important area in which to walk according to our spirit is our married life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is difficult for husbands to remain in the spirit with their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is easy for them to be either in the mind, the emotion, or the will.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One of the most difficult things for a brother to do is to turn to his spirit in the presence of his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we brothers need to learn to walk according to spirit in relating to our wives.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a brother s wife treats him well, he may be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if she is not pleasant to him, he may be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead of turning to the spirit, he may choose to stay in his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But whether our wives are kind or unkind, we need to stay in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If your wife rebukes you, stay in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If she speaks well of you, stay in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you stay in the spirit, you will walk according to Christ in your married life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Wives also need to learn to be in the spirit when they are with their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is even more difficult than for a husband to be in spirit with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many sisters can be in the spirit with almost anyone except their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When they are with their husbands, they are usually in the emotion, not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need the Lord s mercy and grace to be in the spirit with our husband or wife.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must confess that, to a large degree, our married life is not according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Let us look to the Lord that He would grant us the mercy and grace to have our married life according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is basic and crucial for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The married life is the foundation of the family life, the family life is the basis of our daily life, and our daily life is the basis of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This shows the crucial importance of our married life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we can live according to our spirit in our married life, a great many difficulties will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is vital that we learn to behave according to our spirit at home.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A brother may be careful to be in spirit with the saints, but not with his children.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Actually, we should be more exercised to be in spirit with our children than with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If in our daily life at home we are exercised to live, walk, and have our being according to the spirit, our living will be according to Christ, not according to the tradition of men or the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If our daily walk is according to the spirit, we shall spontaneously know what to say and what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There will be no need for regulations or a code of behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Spirit in our spirit will be our unique, living regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we walk according to the divine Spirit mingled with our human spirit, we shall have our being according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then not only shall we be in Christ, but we shall also be according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May the Lord grant us the grace to go on from simply being in Christ to living according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Praise the Lord that we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Now He is waiting for us to satisfy the desire of His heart by walking according to Him.</S>
