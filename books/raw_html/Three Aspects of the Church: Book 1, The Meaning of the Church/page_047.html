	 <h2 class="head3">The Floor of the Tabernacle</h2>
<p>The tabernacle did not have a floor. Its floor was the sandy soil of the wilderness. In the tabernacle, everything elevated is detailed and intricate, but everything positioned close to the earth is simple and plain. This signifies that although the church is located on the earth, she is heavenly.</p>
<p>The frame of the tabernacle was made of gold and was magnificent in appearance. Similarly, the covering of the tabernacle was splendid, being made of fine linen and embroidered with cherubim. However, beneath was the desert sand. Hence, the tabernacle above the ground was highly ornamented, but its floor was not ornamented at all. This signifies that the church should be heavenly. The beauty of the church is seen only by looking upward; when looking downward, all that is seen is a desert land. Hence, in the church we should look upward instead of downward.</p>
<p>The floor of the tabernacle indicates that the church is journeying on the earth as a sojourner, a pilgrim, walking through the wilderness. The church does not have a permanent position on the earth. It cannot take root in the earth. Wherever the tabernacle was placed, its floor was the sandy ground. The tabernacle did not take root on the earth; it was a traveler, a sojourner.</p>
<p>The first time I went to Foochow, the elderly women rowing boats near the bridge over the Min River caught my eye. Though they were dressed beautifully, their feet were covered with mud. The appearance of these women is similar to the appearance of the tabernacle. If a person looked up in the tabernacle, he would see blue, purple, scarlet, and white as well as embroidered cherubim. This was truly beautiful. However, if he looked down at the floor, it would look like &ldquo;muddy feet.&rdquo; The church is journeying on the earth and does not belong to the earth. The church does not care for anything of the earth; it cares only for the things that are above.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Sections</h2>
<p>The tabernacle was composed of different sections. The tabernacle itself consisted of two sections or parts. The outer section was the Holy Place, and the inner section was the Holy of Holies. In addition, there was a court outside the tabernacle, which the Bible calls the outer court. Long curtains of fine linen surrounded the whole outer court. Thus, including the outer court, there were three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. In type, the three sections of the tabernacle signify the three parts of our being&mdash;the body, soul, and spirit. The outermost part of a person is the body, the inner part is the soul, and the innermost part is the human spirit. The soul is inward, but the spirit is the innermost part. Even though the tabernacle typifies the parts of man, it is also a type of the church.</p>
<p>The sections of the tabernacle typify the spiritual condition of those within the church. Some are newly saved, and their spiritual condition can be associated with the outer court. Others who have made more spiritual progress can be associated with the Holy Place. Finally, the condition of those who have made further spiritual progress can be associated with the Holy of Holies. Under the grace of the new testament, our Lord is the High Priest in the heavens, and we are priests serving God. Thus, although the position and status of all the believers are equal before God, our inward spiritual condition may differ and vary greatly. Hence, the various kinds of people who served God in the tabernacle typify the spiritual condition of the individual believers in the church.</p>
<p>The Old Testament says that Levites served in the outer court, the priests served in the Holy Place, and the high priest served in the Holy of Holies. Under the grace of the new testament, there is no distinction among the saints as to their priestly service; rather, we are all priests (1 Pet. 2:5) and are all equal. Only the Lord Jesus Himself is our High Priest (Heb. 4:14). However, in terms of the level of spiritual experience, we cannot deny that some saints are like Levites, some are like priests, and some can be compared to the high priest in the Holy of Holies. We must have an accurate understanding concerning this point. We must not introduce the Judaistic concept of rank into the church. This is absolutely forbidden. On the other hand, we do acknowledge that there are indeed different levels in the spiritual growth of the saints. According to position, there is no rank among the saints; there is no first class, second class, or third class. There is only one class: the universal priesthood. But as far as spiritual experience is concerned, some are living in the outer court, some are in the Holy Place, and some are in the Holy of Holies.</p>
