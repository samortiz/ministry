He was also the door for the Old Testament saints such as Abraham (John 8:56) and even Moses to enter in through their expectation of the coming Messiah.</li>		<li>Now after setting them free from the Judaistic fold, He feeds them with Himself as the rich pasture in life.</li>		<li>This is for them to be flocked together with God's other sheep (the Gentile believers) to be His one organic Body to arrive at the ultimate goal of God's economy&#151;the New Jerusalem.</li>		</ol>	<li>The resurrection and the life&#151;John 11:25:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>At the death of Lazarus, his sister Martha counted on the matter of time, not on the person of Christ.</li>		<li>Christ, as the embodiment of God, is the resurrection all the time, even before He was resurrected.</li>		<li>Not only was the resurrecting of Lazarus His exercise as the resurrection, but also all the miracles done by Him were the exercise of Himself as the resurrection. </li>		<li>Resurrection is mainly to overcome death and all the things belonging to death. Blindness, dumbness, deafness, and all kinds of sickness belong to death.</li>		<li>Before Martha came to Him, Christ was the resurrection when He did the many miracles of healing. Today with His believers everything He accomplishes is the exercise of Himself as the resurrection. Regenerating, sanctifying, renewing, transforming, conforming, and even glorifying are the exercise of Christ as the resurrection who is life eternal.</li>		</ol>	<li>The one grain of wheat (John 12:24), which refers to Himself as the divine seed to produce many grains (the people who receive Him) to become His many members who constitute His organic Body which consummates in the New Jerusalem.</li>	<li>The way, the reality, and the life (John 14:6). John 14&#151;16 is a long discourse of Christ on the night before His crucifixion. That discourse is concerning the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God, the constitution of the processed Triune God with His regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed people. To participate in this organism, the divine and human constitution, we need the way, the reality, and the life, all of which are the exercise of Christ as the eternal resurrection:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The way is Christ in resurrection to be our reality and life. Vanity, as described by Solomon in Ecclesiastes, and death, as explained by Paul in his Epistles, can never be the way for anyone to participate in the organism of the processed Triune God.</li>		<li>The reality is all that God is, which becomes the person of Christ. The way to participate in the divine and human constitution, which is the organic Body of Christ, is to enjoy all that the person of Christ is, which is His unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8).</li>		<li>Life is the divine element of the person of Christ. If we have Christ, we possess the divine element, which is His divine constitution of all the attributes of what God is. In regeneration we have received this life, and in the growth of the divine life through sanctification, renewing, transformation, etc., we participate in the reality of Christ, which is the way for us to enter into the Body of Christ, which is the Father's house that consummates the New Jerusalem.</li>		</ol>	<li>The Comforter, referring to Christ coming in the flesh to be the first Comforter (Paraclete) to take care of our cases and affairs and to Christ realized as the Spirit to be our second Comforter both in us and in heaven before God the Father&#151;John 14:16-17; 1 John 2:1.</li>	<li>The all-inclusive consummated Spirit&#151;John 20:22:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>This consummated Spirit is Christ's breath.</li>		<li>He is the Holy Spirit of God processed through Christ's death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), who is the consummation of the earthly ministry of Christ and the ending of Christ's speaking from His incarnation, God becoming the flesh, to His transfiguration of the flesh, the last Adam becoming the life-giving Spirit (see Message Eight on the consummated Spirit).</li>		</ol>	</ol></ol><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 41</div><br></body></html>
