to Encourage the Spread of the Lord&rsquo;s Work</h2>
<p>Taipei has a population of almost two million. It has a convenient transportation system, a highly educated populace, sufficient economic strength, and good public security. In addition to these things, the church here has several thousand saints who meet regularly. We cannot afford to lose this tremendous opportunity to spread. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and we should seize this opportunity to do business for the Lord&rsquo;s interests. The way to do business is to begin with the small groups as the basic level. We should use the small groups to encourage every household to function, to recover the dormant saints, and to open their homes to preach the gospel. Everyone has extended family, neighbors, classmates, colleagues, and friends who are not saved. Two million fish are swimming around us every day. So why do we not go out to catch these fish? We are five thousand fishermen. Why do we not catch fish? We need to wake up and go out to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>We must remember that one day we will all stand before the Lord. How will we give an account of ourselves, if our hands are empty? <em>Hymns,</em> #930 says, &ldquo;&lsquo;Must I go and empty-handed,&rsquo; / Thus my dear Redeemer meet? / Not one day of service give Him, / Lay no trophy at His feet?&rdquo; This hymn gives a vivid description of how pricked our hearts should feel. We should not wait for others to ask whether our friends and relatives are saved. I am afraid that when God asks us, even the angels will condemn us. This understanding will change our living. In the past we had our friends and relatives over for dinner and politely laughed and conversed with them, but we never preached the gospel to them. How can we repay our debt of the gospel to them?</p>
<p>Paul said that he was a debtor both to Gentiles and to barbarians (Rom. 1:14). How can we justify working with our colleagues at the office for five days a week, fifty-two weeks a year, and yet not preach the gospel to them? If we have this view, we would all repent and confess to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me; I am a debtor to too many people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great American evangelist, Mr. Moody, determined that he would preach the gospel to at least one person every day. One day as he was getting ready for bed, he suddenly remembered that he had not preached the gospel to anyone that day. So he got dressed and went outside. It was the middle of the night, and he could not find anyone except for a policeman standing at the street corner. Mr. Moody went to the policeman and said, &ldquo;Mr. Policeman, you must believe in Jesus.&rdquo; The policeman was both amused and angry because he felt that anyone who would go out in the middle of the night to persuade people to believe in Jesus had to be crazy. He said, &ldquo;Go back home quickly. How is it your business whether or not I believe in Jesus?&rdquo; Later, after the policeman went home, the Holy Spirit worked in him, and he had no peace. The next day he went around asking about a man who preached the gospel. He finally found Mr. Moody. The two of them had a conversation, and the policeman got saved.</p>
<p>If we would preach the gospel in this way, it would be equivalent to having five thousand Mr. Moody&rsquo;s. Who knows how many people we would bring to salvation? This depends on the leading at the basic level, that is, the leading in the small groups, where the co-workers encourage and perfect the saints. May all the saints make this their goal, by praying and following in one accord. Then the church in Taipei will increase, spread, and have a glorious future.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 3: The Future of the Lord's Recovery and the Building Up of the Organic Service &nbsp; pg 54</div><br></body></html>
