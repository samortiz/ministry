   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR GOD'S SERVANT TO HAVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A GENUINE TOUCH WITH AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In working for the Lord, we are God's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As servants, the first thing we should touch is the authority of the Master.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those whose eyes are set on men have never touched authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As ministers of God, being in line with the authority of the Head is the first principle we have to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Naturally, we were all under the principle of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to serve God, we have to be confronted by His authority in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to come into His presence and meet His authority face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to be wounded and defeated by this encounter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to be humbled by authority and face it in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This experience has to be as real as our experience of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the only way for us to be ushered into His service.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before we can participate in His work, we must touch authority in a definite way once.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In our relationship with God, one controversy whether or not we have touched His authority remains.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once we touch authority, we will sense it everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not ask others to obey us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who know authority will never have a problem with men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I was in Shanghai someone asked me concerning the matter of submission: "What if God's deputy authority is wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What if my inner being cannot respond to the words of a deputy authority?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who ask such a question show that they have a fundamental problem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Will a person give up a fish simply because he has found bones in it or give up a bowl of rice simply because he has found a husk in it?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who ask such questions have their eyes on men, not on authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are contending for the reality of the presence of God and an encounter with His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This encounter has to produce wounds and brokenness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the only way for us to be humbled.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Unless there is such an encounter, our problems will never go away, not even if Paul, Peter, Solomon, and David came to our aid.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A brother in Shanghai once said to me, "Brother Nee, now I see authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From now on I will obey whatever you say."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I heard this, I said to Brother Lee, "Terrible!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He wants to obey me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That is a big mistake."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No mistake in this world is greater than this one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man thinks that obedience is going along with a certain person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If our mind is set on men all the time and if our thoughts are set on obeying men's words all the time, we are on the wrong track.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we constantly expect others to obey us, we are also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we think this way, we are only touching men; we have not touched authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I would like to ask a question: "Have we touched the Lord's authority as definitely as we touched Him at the time of our salvation?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we have not, everything we have is a deception; we are merely acting out our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brothers and sisters, we have to be brought to the point where we can say that there is such a thing in this universe as authority and that we have touched it and have been wounded by it, just as a man is wounded when he hits the wall with his head.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we can say this, we will have the proper feeling the next time we touch authority.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We will have the proper judgment within, and we will not be careless in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We will know that we are touching authority, not men.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we only touch men, we may obey when these men are around.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As soon as they are gone, however, we will assume our throne again.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some people are only afraid of certain brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When these brothers and sisters are not around, they feel free to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, if a man has truly touched authority, he will not behave this way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even if the persons he is afraid of are gone, God's authority will still be present.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a man has touched authority in one place, he will touch authority in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Authority fills the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It fills the world as well as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The most perfect manifestation of authority is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once we find authority in the church, we find headship, we find speaking that represents headship, and we find obedience that issues from this headship.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If anyone does not obey this headship, he has not seen God's appointed authority.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The fundamental problem in our service is that we obey men rather than authority.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Foochow there were two brothers who would obey only me but no one else.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These brothers had not touched authority.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It was equally wrong for them to obey me and for them to not obey others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is useless for a man to listen to and to obey others if he has never touched God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are not here to obey men, but to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You have been a Christian for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now you are giving yourself to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you have never touched God's authority, how can you serve Him?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those who know authority sense it wherever it may be.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those who do not know authority are selective in their obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Such a selection will not occur with those who know authority.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Everyone who knows authority is enlightened before God.</S>
