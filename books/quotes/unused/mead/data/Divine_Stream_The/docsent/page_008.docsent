   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What we must do today is just go along with the stream, just subject ourselves to the current of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this matter I have no personal liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not according to my thoughts, but according to His flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The words of a hymn say:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not where we elect to go,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But where Jesus leads the way;</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There the living waters flow,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There our darkness turns to day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE STREAM IN RELATION TO THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Out of the flowing of the stream come the gold, the pearls, and the precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Look at the picture in Genesis chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These precious substances are for the building of God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Wherever the flowing is, material will be produced for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Look at the tabernacle, the dwelling place of God in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the shoulder pieces and on the breastplate of the high priest were precious stones set in gold.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Apostle Paul tells us that the Church is built with gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These are the materials that come out of the flowing of the current of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Revelation we are told that the entire city, the New Jerusalem, is built with gold, with pearls, and with precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How did all these materials come into being?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Simply from the flowing of the current of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Where the stream of the divine life is, there some material, some precious material, for the building of the church will come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You and I can never produce material for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only the flowing of the divine life, the current of the Holy Spirit, can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It has been flowing through the generations and is flowing today; and wherever it goes, gold, pearls, and precious stones are produced for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>May the Lord grant us to be impressed by this picture.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May He always keep us in the flowing of the life, in the fellowship, in the testimony, in the work, and in the building of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>May we also pray toward this end.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>W.L.</S>
