   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God also told Abraham to be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What does it mean to be perfect?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For Abraham to be imperfect did not mean that he was not good; it meant that he was short of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>None of us can be perfected without God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without God, there is no perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without Him we are always lacking something.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Regardless of how perfect we may be in ourselves, we are still short of God and need to be perfected by and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If your home life is without God, your home life is not perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If God is not in your married life, your married life is imperfect.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is no perfection without God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose your hand had only four fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although it might be a good hand, since it did not have the thumb, it would not be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Your hand would need to be perfected by the addition of the thumb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If one day the thumb would come to be added to your hand, your hand would be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, to be perfect means that we need God to be added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To walk before God means to enjoy Him, and to be perfected means to have God added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Have you ever realized that your perfection is God Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Have you ever realized that regardless of how good you are or how perfect you are in human eyes, without God you are short of something?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not have the perfecting factor in ourselves, for the perfecting factor is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God must be added into our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If He is not added into our lives, our lives will remain imperfect.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why did God require Abraham to be perfect?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because God was and still is the all-sufficient Mighty One.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since He is the all-sufficient Mighty One, there is no reason or excuse for us to be imperfect.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whatever we lack, God is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you lack strength?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is strength.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you need energy?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is energy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God is whatever we need.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, God's all-sufficiency requires us to be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no reason for us to be poor; we have a large deposit in the heavenly bank.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Practically speaking, to be perfect means that we do not rely upon the strength of the flesh but trust in the all-sufficient Mighty One for our life and work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not rely upon the exercise of our natural self or upon the energy of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must always trust in God's all-sufficiency for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many of us, for example, are troubled by our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why do we lose our temper at certain times?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because at those times we do not trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The losing of our temper should force us to learn one lesson never to stay away from God but to trust in Him every moment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not try to overcome your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you forget your temper and trust in God every moment, your temper will be overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every imperfection is due to one thing: that we keep ourselves away from the all-sufficient Mighty One.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we keep ourselves away from Him, we are like an electrical appliance that will not work because it is cut off from the supply of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all must learn to keep ourselves constantly in God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the way to be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When as a young Christian I read 17:1, I realized that I was not perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I lacked kindness, humility, patience, love, and many other virtues and attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, in my prayer I made the decision that with the help of the Lord I would have love, patience, humility, kindness, and the other virtues that I lacked.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But I must tell you that I never succeeded.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever I read 17:1 I could not understand what it meant to be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually I saw that the perfecting factor in our life is God Himself and that I needed to have God added into me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The most that we have is four fingers; we do not have the thumb.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Regardless of how much we might train our four fingers to do things, they will still be imperfect because they are without the thumb.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need the thumb to be added to our hand to make it perfect.</S>
