This is the transmission of the transcending One's great power that raised Him from among the dead in Hades and that caused Him to transcend to the Father's throne above all the human race and the angelic race. This is the great power that subdued and subjected all things under His feet and that gave Him to be Head over all things to the church. This great power is toward us who believe (Eph. 1:19) and to the church (v. 22). This indicates that the divine power is transmitted into us to cause the church to come into existence. After the church comes into existence, daily, hourly, and moment by moment, by His mercy and grace, we must learn the lesson to be supplied with His gradual, slow, and fine dispensing in a threefold way by the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This is the revelation in Ephesians 1.</P><P>Christ's transmitting is to the church, His Body. The surpassing greatness of God's power which operated in Christ is toward us. God subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be the Head over all things to the church. This shows the divine transmission. He is transmitting all His accomplishments in His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection into us. He also transmits His victory in His resurrection. Finally, He transmits all His attainments and obtainments in His ascension.</P><P>This consummates in His heavenly ministry. He is in His heavenly ministry in the following twelve statuses:</P>	<ol class="decimal">	<li>The Lord of all (Acts 2:36a).</li>	<li>The Christ of God (Acts 2:36b).</li>	<li>The Leader of all the rulers (Acts 5:31a).</li>	<li>The Savior (Acts 5:31b).</li>	<li>The High Priest (Heb. 4:15; 7:26).</li>	<li>The Advocate (1 John 2:1b).</li>	<li>The Intercessor (Heb. 7:25).</li>	<li>The Mediator of the new covenant (Heb. 8:6).</li>	<li>The surety of the new testament (Heb. 7:22).</li>	<li>The Life-giver (John 10:10b).</li>	<li>The Comforter (John 14:16-17).</li>	<li>The Lamb-God (Rev. 22:1b).</li>	</ol><P>Because He is such a Lord, such a Christ, and such a Ruler that can manage all the things on this earth, He can be the all-inclusive, all-capable, omnipotent Savior to save us. As the Advocate, He is the One who takes care of our case in the heavenly court. He is ministering in the heavens in the above twelve statuses. This is why Philippians 1:19 speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ! This is the supply from Him in these twelve statuses in His heavenly ministry. What a bountiful source of supply!</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> </body></html>
