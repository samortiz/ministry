   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Fact</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1 ...so also shall the coming of the Son of Man be.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then shall two men be in the field; one is taken, and one is left.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Two women shall be grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left Matt 24:39-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the Lord s prophecy, that at His coming, some believers will be raptured and others will be left.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Undoubtedly, those who are raptured are the believers mentioned previously, who overcome or are counted worthy to escape; those who are left are the believers who are defeated and who remain.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2 And she the woman brought forth a son, a man-child, who was about to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne Rev 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The woman refers to the totality of God s chosen people throughout the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The man-child refers to the overcomers among God s chosen people, who will rule the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before the end of this age, the overcomers among God s chosen people will be raptured to God and to His throne in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>3 ...the Lamb standing on mount Zion in the heavens , and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand...These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He may go.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These were purchased from among men as firstfruit to God and to the Lamb Rev 14:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This word of prophecy discloses to us that before the end of this age, a group of overcomers, signified by the one hundred and forty-four thousand, will be raptured to the heavens to stand with the Lamb-Christ on the heavenly mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Purchased from among men, they are those who follow the Lamb absolutely and who have become the firstfruit to God and to the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>D. The Time</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1 I also will keep you out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth Rev 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The hour of trial for all those who dwell on the earth is the time of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here, the Lord promises the overcoming saints that He will keep them from the hour of trial; that is, He will take them away from the earth, which is under trial, to the heavens before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2 ...a man-child...was caught up to God and to His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And the woman fled into the wilderness...so that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days, that is, a time, and times, and half a time Rev 12:5-6, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One thousand two hundred and sixty days, or three and a half years, is the time during which the people of the earth will be tried by the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before the three and a half years, the overcoming man-child, the overcoming saints, will be raptured to God and to His throne in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>E. The Place</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1 Caught up to God and to His throne Rev 12:5 ; On mount Zion in the heavens Rev 14:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These two verses show us that the overcoming believers who are raptured before the great tribulation are taken to mount Zion in the heavens, where God and His throne are.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>F. The Conditions</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1 But be watchful, at every time beseeching Luke 21:36 ; Watch...be ready...</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Matt 24:42-44 ; ...looking for their own lord...that when he comes...</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Luke 12:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The items mentioned in these verses to be watchful, to beseech at every time, and to look for the Lord s coming are the conditions for us to be raptured as the overcomers among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>2 ...those who have loved His the Lord s appearing 2 Tim 4:8 ; You have kept the word of My the Lord s endurance Rev 3:10 ; He who overcomes, and he who keeps My the Lord s works which the Lord accomplished and will accomplish until the end Rev 2:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The items mentioned in these verses to love the Lord s appearing, to keep the word of the Lord s endurance, and to overcome and keep the works which the Lord accomplished and will accomplish, that is, to keep all that the Lord has accomplished for us are also conditions for us to be raptured as the overcomers among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE RAPTURE OF THE MAJORITY</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>OF THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>1 The fact And He who sat on the cloud the coming Christ thrust His sickle over the earth that is, sent the angels , and the earth the believers was reaped raptured Rev 14:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This verse speaks of the rapture of the majority of the believers, which is apart from that of the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>2 The persons the resurrected saints and the believers who are living, who remain 1 Thes 4:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These verses indicate that the majority of the believers who will be raptured are the dead saints, who will be resurrected, and the believers who are living and remain after the rapture of the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>3 The time ...the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together being raptured to Him...the day...will not come unless...the man of lawlessness Antichrist is revealed 2 Thes 2:1-3 ; ...at the last trumpet 1 Cor 15:52 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These two passages tell us that the time of the believers rapture will be after the revelation of Antichrist, at the end of the great tribulation, when the angel sounds the last trumpet and the Lord comes to gain His kingdom Rev 11:15; 1 Thes 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>4 The place ...in clouds...in the air 1 Thes 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The majority of the believers will be raptured to the air, unlike the overcoming believers, who will be raptured to the throne of God in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>5 The condition The harvest the believers ...is ripe Rev 14:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The condition for the rapture of the majority of the believers is maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Like the unripened harvest that cannot be reaped, an immature believer cannot be raptured.</S>
