   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>of the Lord and the Apostle</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The second half of the last of the seventy weeks, prophesied in Daniel 9:24-27, has been made more firm by the Lord's words in Matthew 24:15 and Revelation 11:2 and 13:1-8, and by the apostle's word in 2 Thessalonians 2:3-10.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The three and a half years of the great tribulation, the second half of the last of the seventy weeks, is very much defined, made more firm to us, in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today I have the boldness to say that the majority of the saints will be raptured on the last day of the three and a half years because Revelation 12:6 says that they will be nourished for a thousand two hundred sixty days, which is three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They will have to pass through the entire three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then their nourishing will be finished, and they will be raptured.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This understanding makes the prophecy of the consummation of the age more firm to me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I also have seen that the two witnesses will be raptured on the same day as the majority of the saints because they will prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After these days are completed, they will be raptured to the air into Christ's parousia, presence.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Resurrection of the Dead, Prophesied by</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The rapture of the overcomers, prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 24:39-42 and Luke 21:36, has been made more firm by the Lord's words in Revelation 3:10, 12:5, and 14:1-5.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Revelation 3:10 the Lord says, "Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The hour of trial is the three and a half years of the great tribulation, including its initiation with the shaking of the earth and heaven in the sixth seal, which will be the beginning of the supernatural calamities.</S>
