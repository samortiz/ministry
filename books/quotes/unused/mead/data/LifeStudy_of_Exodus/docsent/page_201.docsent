   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE SIXTY THE BLESSING RECEIVED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE LOVING SEEKERS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH HIS LAW AS HIS LIVING WORD 2 Scripture Reading: Psa 119:11, 57-58, 65, 98-101, 114, 133, 135, 169, 175; 19:7b</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This message continues the day aspect of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In fact, we may even say that we have come to the noontime, for, as we shall see, through the law as God s living word we have the enjoyment of God Himself as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be sure, this is the highlight of all the blessings we receive through the living Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Psalm 119 the psalmist uses different expressions to refer to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One of these terms is the testimony, or the testimonies vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>88, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The law is God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the testimony of God, the law describes God and presents a picture of what He is like.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A law is always a testimony, or expression, of the person who makes the law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, if bank robbers could make laws, they would no doubt legalize the robbing of banks.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A law is always the expression of the legislator.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In like manner, the law given by God on Mount Horeb is the testimony of God as the divine Law-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God s law is His portrait.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the expression of God, the law shows us what kind of God He is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the reason the word testimony is used in the Old Testament with respect to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Ten Commandments inscribed on two stone tablets were called the testimony Exo 34:29; 31:18; 32:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because these tablets were placed in the ark, the ark was called the ark of testimony Exo 25:22; 30:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, the tabernacle in which the ark was located was called the tabernacle of testimony Exo 38:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Other terms for the law in Psalm 119 are statutes, ordinances, precepts, and judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The law truly judges us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Apart from God s law, there is no yardstick of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The law tells what is right and what is wrong, what is of God and what is not of God, what is for God and what is not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the law judges, it measures and exposes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It also accuses and excuses, justifies and condemns.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For all these reasons, the law is called God s judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to verse 91, the law is also called God s ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ordinances are regulations or rules.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, in the city where you live there are ordinances about where you may park your car and where parking is prohibited.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every city has its own ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Likewise, the law is the divine ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Psalm 119 the law is also called God s statutes v. 12 . Each of the commandments is a statute.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The psalmist also referred to the law as God s precepts v. 4 . A precept is instruction given as a proverb in which people are taught concerning their behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the foregoing message we covered ten aspects of the blessing received by the loving seekers of God through His law as His living word: enlightenment, life supply, watering, restoration, deliverance, strength, comfort, nourishment, upholding, and safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first blessing we receive is that of enlightenment 119:130, 105; 19:8b .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If our condition is right when we come to the Word of God, we shall enter into a realm of light and thus be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we shall receive the life supply and experience the watering.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These three items go together and bring in restoration, deliverance, strength, comfort, nourishment, upholding, and safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This sequence is according to spiritual experience, not according to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We praise the Lord that the word spoken by God has been written and printed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The invention of the printing press was for the distribution of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Millions of copies of the Scriptures have been printed and circulated around the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although the Bible is so available, whether or not we receive blessing from it depends on our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As we have pointed out, we need a proper heart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If our heart is proper when we come to the Word, we shall enter into the realm of light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God is light 1 John 1:5 , and this light is consolidated in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that the Word of God is the embodiment of God as the divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the reason verse 130 says, The entrance of thy words giveth light.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because the Word of God is light, the entrance, the opening, of the Word gives light.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Actually, there should be no need for us to say that we receive light from the Bible concerning certain points.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should enter into a sphere of light and not just receive a particular kind of light.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Light brings in life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, it is also true that life brings light.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is difficult to say which comes first, life or light.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to the Old Testament, light comes before life Gen 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But according to the New Testament, life precedes light John 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although we may not be able to say accurately which comes first in our experience, we know that as long as we have the one, we also have the other.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have light and life, and then the life supply becomes water.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As we have seen, light, life, and watering bring in many other blessings.</S>
