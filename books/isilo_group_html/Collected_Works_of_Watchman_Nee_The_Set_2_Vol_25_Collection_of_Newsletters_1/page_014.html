They are often noisy and bother the people in the meeting. We do not know what is an appropriate way to deal with this. We also have a few questions that we do not want to write to you in ink. May the Lord bless us so that in the upcoming meeting, we will have the opportunity to speak with you face to face.</P><P>We especially greet Brothers Chang Kuang Jung, Tu Chung Ch'un, Ho Yue Chiao, Huang Tsai Ching, John Wu, Chou Hsin Yi, and we greet all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</P><P>Your brothers in the Lord,<br>Yuan Ching Chou<br>Yuan Hsi Ling<br>December 14, 1933</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTER FROM DAIREN, MANCHURIA</H2><P>To Brother Hsin Yu in the Lord:</P><P>I have received all your letters, and I am acquainted with the condition of the brothers and sisters there. Truly His will is different from our will. To those who do not obey, it appears that God is really contrary to man in every place. But to those who have already obeyed, we just have to say, "Father, Your will be done." Throughout history, who has blocked God's will? (See Job 4:2-3.)</P><P>I am still much pressed physically. Sometimes I can hardly stand it. But I still want to thank Him even with tears because He still enables me to stand. There has been a change in my environment. Beginning on the twenty-third of this month, I have been transferred to work in the P'u Lan Tien (about one hundred twenty miles from Dairen). Although this is a transfer, I was thinking about going myself anyway, because there is not much of a way for me to do the Lord's work in Dairen. Most people here pursue the comforts of the soul, and not many are willing to obey God and walk the narrow way. I have been in Dairen for exactly two months and have only gained two brothers. They are brothers Chiang Ch'uan Ch'ing and Chang Wen Wei; both are beloved by the Lord. May the Lord protect them so that they can testify for the truth. Whatever happens, the truth of the church in Dairen has already begun. May the Lord bless His own work. Amen.</P><P>I am quite active in this place through His power. I know that Satan is fighting fiercely. I ask the brothers and sisters to please pray for the Lord's work here in their meetings, to resist the devil more. (Parts omitted.) Peace to you. I greet all the brothers.</P><P>Your brother in the Lord,<br>Chang Chun Ming<br>November 28, 1933</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM MR. WANG CHING SHENG</H2><P>(This was sent by a Mr. Wang Ching Sheng who works in the Min Ai Hospital in Nan Kuan, Su County, Anhwei Province to his pastor, and a copy was sent to us. We have never seen Mr. Wang. This is his story of obeying the truth.)</P><P>Dear Pastor:</P><P>I was led by the Lord's Spirit to walk in the Lord's way. I was enlightened and did not dare to refuse. If I am a little late, I am afraid it is from sin again. I have decided to leave the system of the denominations, because the system of the denominations is not according to the teachings of the Bible. I cannot return to the denominations to be a lukewarm layman. I want to be a solid believer and walk by following the Lord's light. The Lord is the lamp to my feet and the light to my path. Wherever the Lord leads me, I will go. I cannot follow my own will, because it is God who operates in me both the willing and the working for His good pleasure. I hope you will cross my name off the roster. When we meet, we cannot lose our civility. Our feeling for each other is the same as it always was and always will be. Different people have different views because the gift God has given each one is different. No matter what, we should perfect the saints for the work of the ministry unto the building up of the Body of Christ. All the brothers and sisters in the Lord should hold forth the word of life to this perverted generation, which does not obey the truth, but obeys human affections. If we love God, we should be the children of God without blemish. This is what pleases the Father. I hope that you can forgive your little brother. It is not pride, nor is it jealousy, nor is it division. I write this to notify you.
