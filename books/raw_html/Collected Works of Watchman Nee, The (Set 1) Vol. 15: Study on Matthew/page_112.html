<P>Verse 15:"To one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability. And he went abroad." What is a talent? It is usually said that a talent is property, position, power, time, life, personal attributes, a good mind, good health, position in the church, etc. However, a talent is a gift, not a natural ability. This is because (1) only Christians have talents; unbelievers do not. The Lord gave talents only to His slaves, and not to the slaves of others. (2) The talents were given according to ability and were not given carelessly. (3) The talents can be increased, or earned. (4) The talents can be taken away. (5) God did not give them to man in an ordinary way; the talents were given after the Lord's ascension. According to the above five points, we know that the talent is not, as one usually interprets, property or position. If it referred to position, then unbelievers would have talents also. If a talent meant an eldership, how then could an eldership be increased?</P><P>A talent refers to the gifts of the Holy Spirit. For (1) the gifts of the Holy Spirit are possessed only by the Lord (Acts 2:38); (2) they can be dispensed (Acts 19:6); (3) they can be increased (1 Cor. 14:12-13); and (4) they are given according to one's ability. Peter, for example, was a fisherman. He was therefore most gifted in "fishing." John's ability, on the other hand, lay in his net mending. (5) The gifts were given after the ascension, on the day of Pentecost (John 7:39; 16:7), and (6) the gift can be laid aside by us. This is why Paul charged Timothy, "for which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands" (2 Tim. 1:6). There is no doubt that talents are the gifts of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>"To one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one." The Lord mentioned only three slaves. "Three" represents all the believers, just as "seven" in "the seven churches" represents all the churches. (The church in Colossae also was in Asia, but it was not mentioned because it was already included in the seven.) These three slaves refer to three kinds of servants. They cannot denote three individual servants because the Lord would then have only three servants. Since this is a parable, we cannot interpret it in such a literal way. The believers, or slaves, are always given the gift of the Holy Spirit. No one can excuse himself by saying that he has no gift, because we all have at least one talent. Do not excuse yourself by saying that you have no gift. If you have no gift, you are not a child of God. Since all believers do have the gifts of the Holy Spirit, each will have to give an account of himself before the Lord in that day.</P><P>The Lord gives talents to His servants mainly according to their ability. Today too much attention is given to ability. Ability is not talent. We cannot do anything by ability alone. However, we should not take ability lightly. Ability determines the talents given. It is God who gives the ability, which in turn determines the talents. We ourselves cannot control how much ability we have. Therefore, the ones who received five and two talents should not feel proud and self-satisfied. Neither should the one who received one talent feel ashamed, disappointed, or envious. Their abilities and their gifts are all ordained by God. Today the tendency is for believers to prefer the greater ability over the smaller ability. This is fleshly activity. We must remember that grace is given by God for us to do His business. We need only to do His business according to the measure of God's gift. This will reduce division and strife in the church, for we understand that gifts vary according to ability.</P><P>It is important to notice that the Lord delivered His possessions to the slaves by Himself. He did not appoint someone else to do this on His behalf. Hence, the church should not ordain a pastor or trust in any theology, for pastors and theology cannot give gifts. A man has a gift only because he has received it from God, and not because he has received it from man. In these days people like to deliver possessions on behalf of the Lord (through the ordination). Rewards are not given because one has more talents, for the rewards were the same for the one who was given two talents as for the one who was given five talents. The one who received only one talent would have received the same reward if he had gained another talent. The phrase "and he went abroad" refers to ascension.</P><P>Verses 15-18:"To one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability. And he went abroad. Immediately he who had received the five talents went and traded with them and gained another five. Similarly, he who had received the two gained another two. But he who had received the one went off and dug in the earth and hid his master's money." This passage concerns the slaves' trading. They knew that the Lord's desire was that their talents should not lie idle. They knew that the Lord's desire was to see the increase of their talents, and that they should not hoard them in one place. If they would share the same heart as the Lord's, they would enjoy the Lord's happiness in the future. However, it is not easy to engage in trading. There are troubles, worries, risks, and hardships involved. The purpose of this parable is to direct our attention to the third slave. Most Christians are in this category. Receiving one talent is dangerous because those who receive one talent have the greatest tendency to become lazy or slothful and bury their talent. They often feel ashamed of having little, and they often bury their talent. However, the one-talented ones should try to gain another rather than bury the one talent. Some feel that it is better to have nothing than to have only a little. Yet the Lord says that a little is better than nothing at all. Actually knowing how to use your talent is more important than the number of talents you possess. The one who was given five talents was responsible for the five talents. The one who was given two talents was responsible for the two talents. Today believers are always dissatisfied with God's gifts. If you are willing to work only when you have the same gift as a certain brother or sister, God will never give you that gift. This parable focuses on the one who receives only one talent. One who cannot give a great message and save hundreds of people can still do a little for the Lord. It is cowardly to bury our talent. May we have such a heart that as He is willing to give a little, we will be willing to use a little.</P><P>The one talent was not put in a box or in the attic but was buried in the ground. The ground is a likely place to bury God's gift. When we are close to the ground, or the earthly things, it becomes easy to bury God's gift. We cannot magnify God's gift if we bury God's talent. It is impossible for a believer to preach the truth if he has just told crude jokes or spoken lewd words. He has lost his testimony. Therefore, let us stand firm in our position and make the best possible use of the gift we have received. We must not make friends with the world, lest our gift be buried. Bear in mind that the flesh always causes us to look down on the gift of God, and the world always causes us to fail to be a testimony of God.</P><P>"Immediately he who had received the five talents went and traded with them." Trade indicates flow and communication. It means to contact the unbelievers. We need to pray that God will make us one who flows and communicates with unbelievers. If we do not learn how to use our gift today, we will not be able to submit a good account to the Lord in the future. Eventually, we will not be able to use the gift in the kingdom.</P>
