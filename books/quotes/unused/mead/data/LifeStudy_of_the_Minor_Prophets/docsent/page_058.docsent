   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Nahum is the opposite of the book of Jonah.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Both books deal with the city of Nineveh, but whereas Jonah brought, or extended, God s salvation to that sinful city, Nahum brought God s judgment upon Nineveh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jonah reveals that God in His salvation is the God of all the peoples of the earth, not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nahum reveals that God is also the God of all peoples in His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, God is the God of all peoples both in judgment and in salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The book of Nahum shows us why God judges a city.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this book we see both the fact and the cause of God s judgment on Nineveh.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, Assyria was the first nation to come and devastate Israel, invading Israel in 713 B.C. 2 Kings 18:13 19:37 , more than one hundred years before the Babylonian invasion in 606 B.C.</S>
