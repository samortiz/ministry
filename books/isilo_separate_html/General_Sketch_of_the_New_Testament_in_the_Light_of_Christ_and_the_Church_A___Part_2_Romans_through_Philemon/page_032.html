At the very beginning of my salvation, I was very living. Immediately following a person&#8217;s salvation, he is living and desires to pray and know the Word. A young brother especially likes to obtain more knowledge. Accordingly, I was brought into contact with a Brethren group which was particularly strict in the study and exposition of the Word. For seven years I studied at the feet of the Brethren teachers. I attended almost every one of their meetings during this time. I listened to more than a thousand messages concerning all the types, prophecies, and expositions of book after book of the Bible.<p>The Brethren spent a great deal of time studying Daniel chapters two, seven, nine, and eleven, especially the end of chapter nine concerning the seventy weeks and the second half of the last week, the last three and a half years of this age. During those seven years with the Brethren I was really &#8220;addicted&#8221; to their teachings. I could even recite what they taught word by word. Apparently there was nothing wrong and there was no death. They did not criticize others but positively passed on what they had to others. However, in those seven years I never heard a message saying that Christ is life to us and that this living Christ today dwells in us. No one would talk about this. Rather, what they always talked about were the types, prophecies, and fulfillment of the prophecies. One person among them was even a &#8220;living concordance.&#8221; He could quickly tell you in what book and in what chapter any verse was located. He was very trained in the study of the letter of the Bible.<p>It was a great mercy of the Lord to me that after seven years with the Brethren, by the fall of 1931, I realized within me that there must be something wrong. I did not love the world; I had given that up as a young man. I also was not sinning, and I had a heart to seek after the Lord and study His Word day by day. I also went to meetings regularly, sometimes even walking through deep snow. However, I still felt dead within, and I had no fruit. For seven years I did not bring one person to the Lord. I felt weak, poor, and impotent. At this point I continued to attend their meetings, but when I rose up every morning to pray, I would go up to the mountains about ten to fifteen minutes away. I prayed to the Lord and wept, saying, &#8220;What is wrong with me, Lord?&#8221; It was in this way that after about six months, from the fall until the next spring, I broke through. At that time, I realized that all the teachings I had received were sound and scriptural, but they were killing. They had been killing me for seven years. Although I was very living when I was first saved, I had become dead after seven years; the teachings of the letter had put me to death.<p>Around July of 1932, after I had prayed in this way for six months, the Lord did something under His sovereignty, and I was brought into contact with Brother Watchman Nee. The Lord brought him to the city where I was living. That was the crisis, the turning point, in my life. I had no intention to stop meeting with the Brethren, but the next day after Brother Nee left, a man came to see me. He came to talk about personal things, not spiritual things, but that night the Lord brought us to the beach, and the man asked me to baptize him. That was something miraculous. I was young, and I felt that I could not do this, but he had the ground to ask me to baptize him because I had already shared many things about baptism with him. At that time I was about twenty-five years old. That was the start of the Lord&#8217;s work in my hometown.<p>Spontaneously the Holy Spirit led us to stop attending the denominations, and we two began to meet together. Two days later, two others heard that I had baptized the first one, and they came to be baptized. Then on the third day, we baptized another two. By the Lord&#8217;s Day there were seven of us, and by the next week, there were about nine. On the following Lord&#8217;s Day, we began to have the Lord&#8217;s table with eleven. We were eleven brothers, with no sisters, like the eleven disciples. We met in this way for three weeks, after which a sister began to meet with us. The number increased quickly, and by the end of the year nearly eighty were meeting with us. This happened because my entire being was turned from the letter to life. Even though I was young and did not know much, my messages were aggressive and challenging, and people were attracted.<p>By this I now realize what it means for the letter to kill. It is to pay attention to knowledge instead of life. In many seminaries and Bible colleges, the more they teach, the more they kill people by their teaching. When many young people are saved, they are living and seeking the Lord, but after entering a seminary, all day long they are under the killing of the letter of knowledge. We must learn to pay attention not to mere knowledge and letter but to spirit and life. If we pay attention to anything other than life, we will kill others. Although we have no intention to do this, we will do it unconsciously.<p>The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. Therefore, we must exercise the spirit and let the Spirit take the lead. Then life will be ministered. The living letters of Christ can be composed only by the Spirit, by the ministering of life, not by knowledge, teaching, or doctrine.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
