<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Paying the Price to Obey</H2><P>The Lord says in the Bible, "Or do you not know...?" (1 Cor. 6:9, 16). This means that we ought to know such things already, because a living God is living within us. You have to learn to follow closely the inner leading. If God tells you to give up certain things and to forsake them, you should say, "Lord, for the sake of loving You, I would forsake them." Christians today like to listen to teachings. Very few of them listen to the voice within them. I would like to ask the brothers and sisters who are sitting here if there is anyone who has been obeying God from morning until evening today in every matter. If you have a genuine desire to take care of God's word, He will only have to speak once. If you do not have this desire, even if He were to speak many times, it would still be useless to you. If there is a group of people here who are willing to give themselves completely to God, in a year's time this place will have a complete turnaround. But if there is not such a group of people, then even if someone were to preach to the people the whole year round, it would still not be of much use. Every time we want to obey the inner feeling, we have to pay a price, because to do such a thing would cause pain to our self and would inflict loss on us. This will show how much you really love God. If you are not willing to obey, even if you listen to a hundred more messages, it will still not do you any good.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Obeying in a Simple Way</H2><P>If there is a small number of brothers and sisters who will obey God, His blessing will be brought in through them. Only when we learn to live in the reality of the spiritual things can we have real spiritual progress. This is the only thing that will cause us to live before God and in His light. Our inner feeling and guidance is our spiritual restriction. When we go along with this feeling, we go along with the spiritual restriction. God's way is always simple. If it is complicated, it is because we have made it so.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OBEYING THE LEADING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</H2><P>Question: We may know the leading and the restriction of the Holy Spirit. But why is it that we are not able to obey this leading and restriction?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Not a Question of Being Able,<br>but a Question of Being Willing</H2><P>Brother Lee answered: Actually, the issue is not one of being able or not able, but of being willing or not willing to obey. It is not a question of ability, but a question of willingness. When you are willing, God will manifest His strength upon you. We were all paralyzed and were unable to walk. But when we obey, strength will come upon us. When the Lord called the paralyzed person to stand up and walk, he was able to stand up and walk (Mark 2:10-12). If God says yes, you have to say yes. When God says to put your feet down, you have to put your feet down. The water of the Jordan will spontaneously be divided (Josh. 3:8, 13-16). Your eyes should never be fixed on the water. If you look at the water, you will say, "The Lord must divide the water first before I can put my feet down." If you do that, the water will never be divided.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Secret of "Willingness"&#151;<br>Being Drawn by the Love of God</H2><P>How can you become willing? The secret of willingness is to be drawn by the love of God. It is a matter of how much you love the Lord. If you do not love enough, you will feel that you cannot do anything. If you love enough, you will be able to obey what others cannot obey, and you will be able to do what others cannot do. Only those who love the Lord with a single heart can go on in this way. Hence, it is not a question of whether or not you are able, but a question of whether or not you are willing. In order to be willing, you have to love the Lord, and you have to be constrained by the Lord's love.</P>
