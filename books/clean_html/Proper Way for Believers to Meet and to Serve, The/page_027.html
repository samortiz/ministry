<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF THE EARLY CHURCH</h2>
<p>The practice of the new way does not come from our imagination. It is according to the pattern shown in the Bible. In Acts 8 the disciples were scattered abroad because of a great persecution. Prior to the persecution, the church in Jerusalem had brought in three thousand and five thousand new believers at two separate times (2:41; 4:4). Many more were brought in at various other times. There were thousands of believers in Jerusalem. They all enjoyed gathering together and were not willing to go out to other places. Therefore, persecution was raised up, and consequently, the believers, not including the apostles, were scattered to various places (8:1). These believers went out announcing the word of God as the gospel (v. 4). I do not believe that they found a meeting place and invited people to come and listen but that they preached the gospel by knocking on doors from house to house to visit people, just as they did in the church in Jerusalem (2:46; 5:42).</p>
<p>Immediately after a person was saved, he met from house to house (2:41, 46). In the homes they practiced fellowshipping, praying, breaking bread, announcing the gospel, and baptizing people (v. 42; 5:42). This was the regular life of the early saints, and as a result, &ldquo;the Lord added together day by day those who were being saved&rdquo; (2:47). This was the way ordained by the Lord, and He confirmed it with blessings. In Taipei we are now practicing this same way, and even though we are limited, we have seen the same result: new ones are being added to the church day by day.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN EFFECTIVE PRACTICE</h2>
<p>Immediately after we lead a person to believe in the Lord and baptize him, we must spend some time to edify him and then set up a meeting in his home in order to teach him the fundamental truths. This is the first step in our practice. The second step is to have a home meeting with him once every three or four days in order to lead him to practice and learn to exercise his spirit, to pray, and to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. If possible, we should go to his home ten times in the first month and after that meet with him once a week.</p>
<p>We should teach the new ones to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name from deep within their spirit, not softly. Such an exercise is not only helpful to the new ones but also beneficial to us. Many of us have been saved for years, but we often call on the Lord habitually and softly; hence, we are not released. If we would call loudly with our spirit, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! I love You!&rdquo; we would feel different within. We should not lead the new ones by teaching them our old and ritualistic ways. We must give them the proper practice and help them to exercise and release their spirit in order to receive the genuine, spiritual supply.</p>
<p>Such a supply is not a psychological effect but a spiritual fact, just as the benefit that we receive from our physical deep breathing is not something psychological. Regrettably, Christians have lost the practice of calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name. The Greek word for &ldquo;call on&rdquo; is <em>epikaleomai,</em> which means to call out loudly, to call by name. Some Christians think that we do not need to call loudly, because the Lord Jesus can hear us when we call softly, and He knows all our needs. On the one hand, this is correct, but on the other hand, there is a great difference in our experience between calling loudly and calling softly. Hence, if the environment permits, we should exercise our spirit to call on the Lord loudly from deep within when we get up in the morning. This will have a great effect on our living throughout the rest of the day. Therefore, the first things we need to teach the new ones are to exercise their spirit, to pray, and to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>According to the progress of a new one, we should lead him to attend the small group meeting with other believers in his neighborhood. This is the third step. If he is at home alone, it will not be easy for him to stand firm. The brothers and sisters who he blends with in the small group meeting will become the best help for him. They can have mutual care and supply. This can be compared to burning coals. It is not easy for one or two pieces of coal to catch on fire. Even if they start burning, the fire will not last long, but it is easier for four or five pieces of coal to burn strongly. Such a practice is not legal; it is organic. We need to lead a new one according to his situation; otherwise, bringing him to a group meeting may &ldquo;kill&rdquo; him.</p>
<p>The basis of the group meeting is first found in Matthew 18:20: &ldquo;Where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.&rdquo; This indicates that as long as there are two or three gathered together, they can have a group meeting. In Acts 12 Peter was kept in the prison, and &ldquo;prayer was being made fervently by the church&rdquo; (v. 5). The saints were not gathered together to pray in a large meeting as we do today; they prayed separately in many homes. Therefore, after Peter was rescued out of the prison, he went to the house of the mother of John and told those assembled there to &ldquo;report these things to James and the brothers. And going out, he went to another place&rdquo; (vv. 12, 17). This is proof that in those days the saints met in many homes for prayer. Those were small group prayer meetings.</p>
<p>When we go to lead the new ones, our spirit must be living and uplifted. This is the fourth step. Only when we are living can we cause those whom we lead to be living. Only when our spirit is uplifted can we enliven others and cause their spirit to be opened and fanned into flame. If we are depressed and downhearted, we will cause the new ones to be discouraged, and they will be unable to touch the spiritual reality. We must be living in our daily life. Then we will be joyful and exulting, either singing, praising, or calling. Consequently, we will bring the spiritual atmosphere into the new one&rsquo;s home and enable him to touch the spiritual reality and gain the supply. Perhaps when we visit him, he is not happy, or he is quarreling with his wife. But through our visit he will be supplied, enlightened, and comforted, and he will obey our leading and teaching and thus begin to sing and to pray. Hence, the home meetings depend on the kind of persons we are. If we are living, the dead will be made alive, but if we are dead, the living will become dead because of us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHANGING THE SYSTEM<br />
BEING TO CHANGE THE HABITS<br />
IN OUR DAILY LIFE</h2>
<p>The churches in all the localities should have a complete, genuine change of system. We should no longer live according to the old manner of life, which is to invite people to come and listen to the gospel. Instead, we should go out every week to visit people. Furthermore, we should not invite new ones to come to the church meetings and listen to messages; rather, we should deliver the meetings to their homes. Formerly, we always invited people to come to a big meeting and listen to a wonderful message. If they did not obtain something when they came to the meeting, their appetite was spoiled such that they did not come again. As a result, we lost them. Now we need to repent and have a thorough change in our way. Instead of asking people to come to the meeting, we should deliver the meeting to their homes. Every week we should deliver the meeting to others. After a few years we will raise people up and establish them. Then according to their situation, we can gradually lead them to have group meetings and attend district meetings. Furthermore, we should also encourage them to function in the meetings.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei has been practicing home meetings, group meetings, and district meetings. There are about fifty people in a district meeting. When the number in a district meeting exceeds a hundred, it needs to subdivide. The advantage of such a meeting is that we can know one another through mutual care, fellowship, and intimate contact. Moreover, such a meeting also provides the saints with opportunities to function. After a new one has been led in the home meeting and has learned how to sing, to pray, and to speak, he will spontaneously be able to open his mouth and fellowship or testify in the group meeting and in the district meeting. Hence, there will no longer be the need for someone to give a message in the district meeting. Everyone can prophesy, and the prophesying will be enjoyable.</p>
<p>The God-ordained way revealed in the Bible is not to invite people to come and listen to the gospel but to go and knock on doors in order to visit people. Furthermore, it is not to invite people to come to a meeting of the church but to deliver the meeting to their home. If we lead people in the fundamental truths and help them to exercise their spirit, they can live the church life without being brought to the church meetings. A new believer may require us to spend six months to a year with him before he can become remaining fruit. But if we do this, the church will definitely increase twofold yearly. This is a tremendous rate of increase. May we all see this and take action.</p>
