<p>Ephesians 4:15 says, &ldquo;Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&rdquo; This verse says that we grow up by holding to truth in love and that this growth takes the Head as its goal. In other words, our growth is to enter deeper into the Lord, that is, to be more subject to His authority. If we have truth and love and apply the truth by holding to it in love, we will grow up into the Head daily, and we will be increasingly subject to His authority.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the growth of a Christian is not for himself but for the other members. Because we grow, the brothers and sisters under our care will also grow. If we do not move forward, those who are with us will not move forward either. If we move forward, they will move with us. When we grow, those who are under our care will spontaneously grow.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GROWTH OF THE BODY<br />
UNTO THE BUILDING UP OF ITSELF IN LOVE</h2>
<p>Verse 16 speaks of the growth of the Body: &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; The growth of the Body of Christ is through the many joints of supply. In addition to these joints of supply, there are many parts, and each part has its measure. The joints supply the Body, and each part operates and functions according to its measure. For example, my arm has many parts. I have fingers, a wrist, a forearm, and an upper arm, and each part has a different measure. The function of my arm is manifested when each part operates according to its measure, and it is not manifested if the parts do not operate according to their measure. A doctor once told me that if a person covered his eyes and did not use them, in less than three years he would lose the ability to see. Hence, function comes from operation.</p>
<p>I have a little experience in this matter. When I was forty, I was restricted to complete bed rest due to an illness. For six months I did not get out of bed. When I became healthy and gained weight, I got out of bed and quickly discovered that my legs were too feeble to walk and that I could not even stand. My feet and my legs had been functioning for forty years; I had been able not only to walk but also to run and jump. I never would have thought that after six months of bed rest, my legs would not be able to function. I needed to lean on two people in order to begin to walk again. Initially, my legs would get tired after one minute, and I would need to sit down. After practicing for some time, I was able to walk for ten minutes. This experience shows that the ability of our legs, including their strength to walk, comes from their operation. Our legs lose their function if they do not operate for a long time. Therefore, although each part of the Body has a function, each part must operate according to its measure in order for that function to be manifested. Every brother and sister in the church is a member of the Body of Christ and has a measure. We do not manifest our function because we do not operate according to our measure.</p>
<p>If every joint of supply supplies the Body, and each part operates according to its measure to bring about its function, all the parts of the Body will be joined together and knit together. Then the various members will no longer be disjointed; rather, the Body will be joined and will be one. Some churches have an atmosphere in which the saints are not joined or knit together. This situation is caused by a lack of supply from the saints who are joints of supply and by a lack of functioning in the saints. If every joint of supply would receive something from the Head to supply the Body and if every believer would function according to the operation of his measure, the whole church would be joined and knit together. Then through every joint of supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, the Body will cause its own growth unto the building up of itself in love.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOLDING THE HEAD AND<br />
THE GROWTH OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>Colossians 2:19 says, &ldquo;Holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God.&rdquo; This verse and Ephesians 4:15-16 speak of the same matter.</p>
<p><em>Holding the Head</em> means to be joined to the Head, that is, not leaving the Head but being subject to the authority of the Head and taking the Head as the source in all things. This includes growing up into the Head, Christ, in all things and all the supply being from Him, as in Ephesians 4:15. Being supplied is a matter of the joints, and being knit is a matter of the sinews. This is the same as &ldquo;being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply&rdquo; in Ephesians 4:16. The growth of the Body in Colossians 2:19 is caused by the increase of God&rsquo;s element in the believers. If in the church those who are joints and sinews grow up into the Head, are subject to the authority of the Head, and hold the Head in all things, the Body will be supplied by the joints and knit together through the sinews. As a result, God&rsquo;s element will increase in the believers and the Body will grow.</p>
<p>The growth of the Body in verse 19 refers to building up. As God&rsquo;s dwelling place, the church must be built up, and as the Body of Christ, the church needs to grow. The dwelling place is the Body, and the Body is the dwelling place; therefore, building is growing. For us to build up the church is for us to cause the Body of Christ to grow.</p>
<p>For over two thousand years of church history, few believers have paid much attention to these two portions in the Bible. I believe that in these last days the Holy Spirit will show us the significance of these verses and reveal more light. Thus, we should memorize these two portions and keep them in our heart.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
