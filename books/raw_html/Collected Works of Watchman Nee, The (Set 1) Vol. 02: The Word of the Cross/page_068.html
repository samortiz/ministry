<H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON EIGHTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CHURCH</H1><P>In the Greek language, the word "church" is ekklesia. This word is very hard to translate, and "church" can hardly express the meaning of the word. Its original meaning is the called-out congregation or the called-out ones gathered together. Hence, "church" is the name given to those who are called out of the world by the grace of God to meet together. Therefore, those who are not called out of the world do not belong in the church.</P>	<ol class="upper-roman">	<li>Who belongs in the church?		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"All those who believed" (Acts 2:44)</li>		<li>"Those who were being saved" (Acts 2:47)</li>		<li>"Those who had believed" (Acts 4:32)</li>		<li>"The church...apostles" (Acts 8:1)</li>		<li>"The church...disciples" (Acts 11:26)</li>		<li>"Those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints" (1 Cor. 1:2)</li>		<li>"The saints" (2 Cor. 1:1)</li>		<li>"His Body" (Eph. 1:23)</li>		<li>"His Body" (Col. 1:24)</li>		</ol></li>	</ol><P>Both the tares and the wheat grow together in the world, but they do not co-exist in the church. According to the Bible, there are no other kinds of people in the church except the regenerated ones. Even the saved believers who commit sins should be removed (1 Cor. 5:5, 11-13).</P>	<ol class="upper-roman" start="2">	<li>Who establishes the church?		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"I [the Lord]" (Matt. 16:18)</li>		<li>"The Lord" (Acts 2:47)</li>		<li>"Jesus Christ" (1 Cor. 3:11)</li>		<li>"The Head, Christ" (Eph. 4:15)</li>		<li>"Being built up [by God]" (1 Pet. 2:5)<br>		According to the verses mentioned above, man cannot establish the church.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Can the church be divided into denominations?		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"Be one" (John 17:11, 21-23)</li>		<li>"Were together" (Acts 2:43-47)</li>		<li>"Is Christ divided?"
