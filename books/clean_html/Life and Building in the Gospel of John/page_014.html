<h1 class="title">THE LIGHT SHINING IN THE DARKNESS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:5, 9-11; 12:35-36</h1>
<p>John 1:5 says, &ldquo;The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.&rdquo; <em>The darkness did not overcome it</em> is rendered as &ldquo;the darkness did not take it&rdquo; in the Chinese Union Version. The word <em>overcome</em> has several meanings in Greek. First, it denotes to take, to receive, and to understand; once a thing is understood, it can be received. Second, it denotes to seize, as a policeman seizes a criminal. Third, it denotes to conquer. Therefore, in one sense, this sentence means that the darkness did not take the light or seize the light; in another sense, it means that the darkness could not overcome or conquer the light.</p>
<p>John 12:35 says, &ldquo;The light is still among you a little while. Walk while you have the light so that darkness may not overcome you.&rdquo; The phrase <em>so that darkness may not overcome you</em> is rendered as &ldquo;so that darkness may not come upon you&rdquo; in the Chinese Union Version, yet the Greek word for <em>come upon</em> is the same as the Greek word for <em>overcome</em> in 1:5. <em>Come upon</em> in the Chinese Union Version does not adequately convey the meaning of this phrase; it should instead be rendered as &ldquo;so that darkness may not overcome you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;so that darkness may not conquer you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;so that darkness may not seize you.&rdquo; In 12:36 the phrase <em>believe and obey the light</em> in the Chinese Union Version is better rendered as &ldquo;believe into the light.&rdquo; By believing we enter into the light so that we may become sons of light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BEING THE LIGHT</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will focus on the matter of the light shining in the darkness. The light that shines in the darkness is the Word, that is, the God who spoke Himself forth. If God remained hidden, He could not be light to men. If electricity cannot find an outlet for its expression, there will be no light. However, when electricity finds an outlet, it is expressed as light. The light that we see is electricity, but it is no longer hidden; rather, it is manifested. Light is electricity coming forth; it is electricity being expressed. Similarly, if God had remained hidden in eternity, He would not be light to man. However, since He is not only God but also the Word, He has come forth. Furthermore, His speaking to man is His speaking of Himself to man, His speaking of Himself to be with man, and His speaking of Himself into man. Such a spoken God is light to man. We need to see several points concerning this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIGHT COMING TO SHINE</h2>
<p>First, God does not desire mere outward worship or service; He desires that we would receive and express Him as the shining of light. According to man&rsquo;s natural religious concept, God is so mysterious, authoritative, dignified, and great that He can only be worshipped. This is not a bad concept. In fact, if everyone in human society lived according to this concept, society would be much better than it is today. Nevertheless, God does not want a relationship based on our worship and service to Him as a great, but distant, God. He wants a deeper, more profound, and more subjective relationship with us. Thus, He presents Himself to us as the Word. He speaks Himself forth to be with us, to be among us, and to be in us so that He may be light in us. Whenever we contact this God, we are inwardly filled with light. When He speaks Himself into us, He enlightens us, and He makes us living. He gives us life, and He makes us living and shining. He is begotten in us as life, and He shines in us as light.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;While I am in the world, I am the light of the world&rdquo; (9:5). The Lord Jesus is signified as light. The electricity that shines in the meeting hall does not need our worship or service. The electricity shines so that we may be under its shining. If we turn off the lights in the meeting hall, we will be in darkness and chaos. The light that shines in the meeting hall causes everything to be calm and orderly. Under the light our situation is proper, orderly, and calm; this is the issue of shining. In addition, light manifests and restricts everything. Loose and unrestrained people have no light; instead, they are living altogether in darkness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIGHT SHINING IN THE DARKNESS</h2>
<p>Second, the light shines in the darkness. John 1:5 says, &ldquo;The light shines in the darkness.&rdquo; Verse 9 says, &ldquo;This was the true light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man.&rdquo; The true light enlightens every man in the world. Since the true light enlightens every man, the darkness into which the light shines must refer to men in the world. Men in the world are not only dark but darkness itself. The God who speaks Himself forth also shines in the darkness, in men who are darkness itself. Every unsaved person is darkness itself, and even every saved one still is darkness to a considerable degree.</p>
