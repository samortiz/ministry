   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Most Christians today are cold, quiet, and dead.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The dead are formal and never make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The most regulated place on earth is a cemetery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everyone there is quiet and orderly and never disturbs others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Most Christians are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although they think this is beautiful, it is actually dreadful; it is a stench.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christians should be living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The reason many are not living is that they are short of the experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we experience Christ day after day, eventually the Christ we experience will become wine in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more we experience Christ, the "crazier" we shall become.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since the time you were saved, how often have you been "crazy" in your fellowship with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Have you ever been in a state where you were so happy that you were not able to control yourself, even beside yourself with joy?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Have you ever been so joyful that you did not know whether to jump, to dance, or to shout?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more we are "crazy" like this with the Lord, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not only the young people, but even the older brothers and sisters should be "crazy" in their inner chamber with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we are with the Lord, we must say, "Oh, what joy!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What wine!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I simply cannot stand it!"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the experience of Christ as wine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we experience Christ as our sin offering time after time, this offering will eventually become wine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The reason is that Christ as the sin offering will make us happy and cause us to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, if you very seldom enjoy Christ as your sin offering, it will not become wine in your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if you experience Christ as the sin offering, and as the other basic offerings daily, Christ as all these offerings will become wine and cause you to be exceedingly happy and joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we experience Christ in all His riches, the more the elements of His riches will make us "crazy."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, whatever we experience of Christ will become our new wine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Matthew 9:16 and 17 the Lord told the disciples of John the Baptist that He came as the new cloth to cover us and as the new wine to satisfy us and to stir us up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How we need to experience Christ today!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to experience Him as our burnt offering, meal offering, peace offering, sin offering, and trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ultimately, our experience of Christ becomes the element within us stirring us up to be ecstatically happy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we continue in this enjoyment, we shall even become one with the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A drunkard is a man who has become one with the wine he drinks.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Wine has saturated his whole being, and he even has the appearance and aroma of wine.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may say that this man is just wine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We Christians, like a drunkard saturated with wine, must be saturated with Christ until we become wine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is the wine, but the wine must saturate us until it becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we become drunk of Christ and with Christ, we become wine to satisfy God, and we are qualified and ready to be a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The drink offering is not merely Christ Himself; it is the Christ who saturates us until Christ and we, we and Christ, become one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the first seven chapters of Leviticus, we have the basic offerings, but not the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The drink offering is mentioned in Leviticus 23:10-13, verses related to bringing the firstfruits of the harvest of the good land to the priest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although the harvest was for the enjoyment of the children of Israel, they were required to bring the firstfruits of the harvest to God that He might have the first enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest was waved before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, the firstfruits were a wave offering, typifying Christ in resurrection as the firstfruit being waved unto God 1 Cor 15:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Along with this sheaf of firstfruits, the children of Israel had to offer a burnt offering with a meal offering and a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is in this context that the drink offering is mentioned in Leviticus.</S>
