   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Entering into Canaan</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Canaan has a twofold significance in typology.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, it typifies the riches of Christ, and on the other hand, it typifies the heavenlies; both of these aspects are spoken of in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 3:8 speaks of the riches of Christ, and Ephesians 1:3 and 2:6 speak of the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this sense, the book of Joshua in the Old Testament is comparable to Ephesians in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both books are a record of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In regard to Canaan, there is the matter of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ and the matter of spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As soon as the children of Israel entered Canaan, they enjoyed the riches of Canaan and engaged in warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that when the church fulfills God s purpose, it immediately enjoys the riches of Christ and engages in spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These two matters are spoken of after the children of Israel entered Canaan in the book of Joshua and after the church was raised to the heavenlies in the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Typifying the Riches of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Old Testament three items are often mentioned to describe the riches of the land of Canaan: milk, honey, and grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Milk and honey are riches produced through the mingling of the vegetable life and the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Milk comes from cattle and sheep, which feed on grass.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, milk is a product of the animal life plus the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Bees are animals, and flowers are plants.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Bees gather nectar from flowers and produce honey.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, honey is also a product of the animal life plus the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a place without animal life or vegetable life, there can be no milk or honey.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A place with milk and honey is a place full of life and full of the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The unleavened bread, bitter herbs, and manna, which the children of Israel ate in Egypt and in the wilderness, typify Christ, but they do not typify the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was not until the children of Israel entered Canaan, a place flowing with milk and honey, that they enjoyed the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A beautiful aspect of the type of Canaan is that it typifies the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the good land two men were needed to carry a single cluster of grapes on a pole Num 13:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The produce of the land was rich.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The produce of the sixth year was sufficient to sustain the children of Israel for three years because no sowing was done on the seventh year Lev 25:4, 19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This portrays the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the land of Canaan there was not only milk and honey but also grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Bible, grapes produce the cheering wine Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>9:13; Psa 104:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, wine from grapes typifies the salvation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the riches of the land of Canaan are related to life and the riches of life, typifying the riches in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The riches of Christ recorded in Ephesians 3:8 are typified by the riches of the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The entrance of God s people into the land of Canaan signifies their entrance into the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Typifying the Heavenlies Spoken of in Ephesians</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Canaan also typifies the heavenlies spoken of in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The land of Canaan not only yielded rich produce but also contained many enemies the seven tribes of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These tribes typify the rulers, the authorities, the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies spoken of in Ephesians 6:12, that is, Satan and his angels.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the rich realm of Canaan there is still the need for warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The object of the warfare is not to deal with sin or the flesh but to deal with the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the church concludes her life of wandering in the wilderness and enters into the riches of Christ, she simultaneously enters into a spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At this time, there is the enjoyment of the riches of Christ, and there is the spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On one hand, the church enjoys all the riches of Canaan, but on the other hand, she engages in warfare to deal with God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Both Joshua in the Old Testament and Ephesians in the New Testament speak of the enjoyment of the riches and spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These two books show that when the church measures up to God s standard, she enjoys the riches of Christ and bears the responsibility to fight for God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this warfare the church does not deal with the world, sin, or the flesh but with the forces of Satan, the rulers and the authorities of the air, typified by the seven tribes of Canaan in Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These tribes harassed and opposed the children of Israel in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, the record of the warfare in Joshua, Judges, and 1 and 2 Samuel is related to chapters 2, 3, and 6 of Ephesians, and it demonstrates the principles in spiritual warfare, including how the church can gain the victory and under what circumstances she can be defeated.</S>
