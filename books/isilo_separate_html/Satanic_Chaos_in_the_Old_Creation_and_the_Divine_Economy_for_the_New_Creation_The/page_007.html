A few days later I became angry with my mother. My anger troubled me, and I had no peace. Instead of economy, I had chaos once again. Eventually I prayed to the Lord about this and was forgiven. The peace returned, and I had the sense of something bright, pleasant, and lovely within. At that time, I did not know about the divine economy, but I was experiencing it.</P><P>Do you know what the Christian life is? The Christian life is a life of economy mixed with chaos. The economy is divine, and the chaos is satanic. Hence, the Christian life involves both the divine economy and the satanic chaos. The Christian life is a history of economy and chaos, of chaos and economy. During our time with the Lord in the morning, we experience economy, but later in the day we may experience chaos.</P><P>This has been my experience during the nearly seventy years I have been a Christian. However, I am learning the secret, the strategy, of defeating chaos and of coming back to economy and order. I am learning how to be filled not with chaos but with economy. I have not only God's economy within me&#151;I have God as my economy within me. The very God who dwells in me is my economy.</P><P>As a mixture of economy and chaos, the Christian life is a miniature of the entire universe. The history of the universe is a history of God's economy and Satan's chaos. Furthermore, the entire Bible, from the first chapter of Genesis to the last chapter of Revelation, is a record of the divine economy and the satanic chaos. In our married life we also have the economy of God and the chaos of Satan. The reason for this situation is that in the universe there are two sources&#151;God and Satan.</P><P>Sometimes when we preach the gospel to thoughtful people, they ask us why there are these two sources. Such people may say, "Why is there Satan as well as God? God is good, but Satan is evil. If there were no Satan, everything would be fine." Others may ask why there were two trees in the garden of Eden&#151;the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, a tree that involves knowledge, good, evil, and death. To the ones who ask these questions I would say, "You should go to God and ask Him. I do not know the answer to your questions. However, I do know that the history of the universe is a history of God's economy and Satan's chaos."</P><P>In order to understand the divine economy and the satanic chaos, we need to see the difference between the old creation and the new creation. God created the heavens and the earth, and this became His first creation. God's first creation eventually became old and involved with death, for to become old is to become dead. In a sense, the words first, old, and dead are synonyms.</P><P>The first creation did not accomplish God's purpose directly. Rather, it was God's intention to gain the new creation through the first creation. This means that through the old creation God will have a new creation. Concerning this, in 2 Corinthians 5:17 Paul says, "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation." Galatians 6:15 says, "Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters." We were the old man, but we have been regenerated to become the new man, and the new man is the new creation.</P><P>Although God created the heavens and the earth, He was not in the old creation. This means that the old creation does not have God as its life, nature, and person. But in the new creation we have God within us as our life, our nature, our person, and our everything. Do we need love? Our God within us is love. Do we need light? Our God within us is light. Do we need the divine attributes? Our God within us is the divine attributes, which will be expressed in our human virtues. Therefore, in the new creation God is everything.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
