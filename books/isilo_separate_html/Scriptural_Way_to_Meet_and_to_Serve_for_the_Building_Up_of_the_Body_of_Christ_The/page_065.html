<h1 class="title">THE INCLUSIVENESS OF THE SCRIPTURAL WAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 2:2; Col. 2:2; 2 Cor. 3:8; John 1:4; Eph. 1:23; 3:4; 5:32; Matt. 22:9-14; Luke 14:23; Acts 2:46; 5:42; 12:12; 1 Cor. 14:26; Heb. 10:25; Acts 9:31; Eph. 4:12, 16</h1>
<p>In October of 1984, I was burdened that we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery could have a new start. I told the saints in Taipei that what I meant by a &ldquo;new start&rdquo; was that we needed to change our present practice. I was fully aware of all the complications that would be raised up when we attempted to change our practice so that it could fully conform to the scriptural way. Christianity has been in this old practice, this old system, for centuries. We studied church history in order to help us find the way to meet and to serve according to what is clearly revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25.</p>
<p>Brother Watchman Nee was the one who brought the revelation concerning the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to us in China about sixty-two years ago. About fifty years ago in 1937, Brother Nee saw the light concerning the scriptural way of meeting and serving for the building up of the Body of Christ, and what he spoke concerning this was printed in the book <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em> But he did not have the chance or even the possibility to practice all that he saw. I not only listened to Brother Nee&rsquo;s messages concerning this matter but he also talked with me personally about it. He told us clearly that to change our practice would be very hard because of two factors. First, the old way of meeting and serving is a deeply rooted habit in us Christians. It is very difficult to remove this habit from us. Second, he said that if we remove our old way of having the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning message meeting, we will not have anything to replace it. If we did not replace it, this would create a gap in the practical church life into which negative things could come. Thus, we did not enter fully into the practice of this scriptural way for eleven years.</p>
<p>In 1948 Brother Nee had a training in which he picked up this matter again. This time his word was stronger. His fellowship concerning the Lord&rsquo;s Day message meeting is in chapter four of the book <em>Church Affairs.</em> In this fellowship, he picked up three crucial points. First, he said that the old system of meeting with one speaker and the rest listening was according to the customs of the nations (2 Kings 17:8&mdash;NASB). Second, he said that this kind of meeting was a waste. It wastes the saints&rsquo; energy and time. Third, he said that there was no need to maintain the Lord&rsquo;s Day message meeting. These are three crucial matters.</p>
<p>Based upon the light of this fellowship, I realized that changing our practice would be difficult and that it would touch the different feelings of the dear saints who have been meeting with us. I knew that some would feel very positive about this change, but I was also aware that a small number of the dear saints who have been meeting with us for many years and who have been so faithful to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and to the church life might not be so happy about this change. For this reason, I told the saints in Taipei that I was carrying out an experiment to find out the best way to carry out the revelation of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the New Testament that was seen by Brother Nee and fully covered in his verbal teachings and written articles. I told them that I had the desire to do something according to our present situation.</p>
<p>In 1984 the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery were in a dormant situation. At the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery outside of mainland China in the East and in the West, the churches were not like this. But by 1984, we were drifting back to a situation that the Lord would not honor. This situation bothered me to the uttermost and compelled and forced me to study our situation. Through this study, I realized that we needed a change. The statistics of the major denominations in the United States and Britain show that the old way of meeting and serving has resulted in a declining membership. In these end times, the Lord will not honor an unscriptural practice that He tolerated in the past. Now is the time for the Lord to accomplish His recovery of the scriptural way of meeting and serving for the building up of the Body of Christ. This may be the Lord&rsquo;s concluding recovery. With this vision, I was strong to run the risk of practicing the new way. I told the saints that I would set up an experiment in Taipei to see what would come out.</p>
<p>Today we are attempting to change from a traditional way which has existed on this earth for nearly nineteen centuries. It is not so easy to take the scriptural way. We have to take this way slowly, carefully, and gradually. If we are going to practice the scriptural way, we need to see its inclusiveness. The factors of the new way are in the objective aspect of the truth and in the subjective aspect of practice.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> </body></html>
