We can say that Christ is the new man since Colossians 3:10 and 11 say that in the new man Christ is all and in all
We can also say according to Ephesians 42224 that our old man is our former manner of life and our former manner of life is our peculiarity
Our old man is our peculiarity, the peculiarity is the expression, the exhibition, of the self, and the self is the expression of the soul
According to God's creation and ordination, He has preserved the central part of our being, our spirit, for Himself
When all the unbelievers are in trouble, the innermost part, the deepest part, of their being will remind them of God
A fallen man responds to the preaching of the gospel because of his spirit, the part of him that has been preserved by God
The first Spirit here is the divine Spirit, the Holy Spirit of God, and the second spirit is the human spirit, the regenerated spirit of man
Whenever our spirit invades our soul, the whole world rises up to put pressure on the invading spirit to withdraw
Our spirit is forced to withdraw many times by our spouse, our children, our roommates, and others who are close to us
Maybe after two hours, something exercised pressure on our spirit, forcing our spirit to withdraw from our mind
Some of the older saints may feel that they need to be sympathized with and given the freedom to live as they are
We are defeated because our spirit has been forced by our way of living to withdraw from our mind, emotion, and will
Matthew 16:24-26 says, 'If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me
Luke 92325 says And He said to them all If anyone wants to come after Me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me
For whoever wants to save his soul will lose it, but whoever loses his soul for My sake, this one shall save it
In Matthew, the Lord speaks of a person forfeiting 'his soul,' while in Luke, He speaks of a person forfeiting 'himself'
If we do anything by our self, in our self, and with our self, we are doing it in our peculiarity and apart from God
It was dealt with already by the Lord Jesus when He was crucified on the cross because we were crucified with Him
The realm of the divine life is new, and our walk and being should be in the realm of the newness of the divine life
Corinthians 517 says So that if anyone is in Christ there is a new creation the old things have passed away behold they have become new
In the New Testament, the phrases 'in Christ,' 'in Christ Jesus,' 'in the Lord,' and 'in Him' are used many times
Confucius taught concerning being renewed, and according to his teaching, many learned Chinese consider that they are being renewed
As long as we do not live in the realm of Christ as our newness, whatever we do is our peculiarity, and even we ourselves are peculiarity
If we do not live Christ, if it is not Christ who lives, speaks, and acts through us, whatever we do is a peculiarity
Many times making fewer telephone calls and speaking only briefly on the telephone may help us to be overcomers
We may be very careful with the brothers or our parents, but we may be too free and not hesitate with our husband or wife
If we are going to deal with our peculiarity, we have to deal with our living which is not in the realm of Christ
If we hesitate and check ourselves our intuition the inner knowledge in our spirit will tell us that it is we and not Christ who is living
If we learn to be renewed in this way, we will have a deeper perception with which to understand persons and matters
We lack the perception that penetrates the barriers and coverings because we do not practice being daily renewed in the spirit of our mind
The renewing in the spirit of our mind always revolutionizes our logic, philosophy, thought, concept, and psychology
As a result, our perception in all things is different, and we have a deeper understanding of the people we meet
The reason why we are peculiar in everything, in every way, and in every aspect is that we do not take the cross
If we go to visit people for the gospel after talking too much on the telephone, we will not have the power or impact
On the other hand, if we check and are stopped when we are about to make a phone call, we will have an impact when we go out
Accordingly, we may walk according to our flesh or according to our soul, that is, according to our mind, will, or emotion
Question: When a brother's peculiarity comes out in a certain situation, is it right to speak to him to expose his peculiarity?
We should not see anything hear anything or sense anything because we are walking according to spirit and are under the killing of the cross
When we have a negative consideration about someone, this indicates that we are not walking according to our spirit
If we all practice to walk according to spirit, our church life will become the New Jerusalem in our experience
Question: Does walking according to spirit mean that before we do or say anything we hesitate and ask the Lord, 'Is this You'?
We cannot say that to hesitate is to walk according to spirit, but to hesitate helps us to walk according to spirit
Ultimately, these angels along with Satan will be thrown into the lake of fire which has been prepared for them
Both Daniel and Isaiah also reveal that in the spiritual world there are two sides: God's side and Satan's side
At Daniel's time, the prince of Persia, an angel who followed Satan in his rebellion, withstood Michael the archangel
In Genesis, there was a physical serpent, but in Revelation, that physical serpent has become a spiritual serpent, even a dragon
In the garden of Eden, Satan was just a little serpent, but in Revelation 12 he becomes a great and powerful dragon
Today the entire world is under the authority of Satan, the ruler of this world , but no one can see him because he is invisible
In this universe, God enters into man to be one with man, and Satan, God's enemy, enters into man to be one with man
From Genesis to Revelation, these two different activities are going on: God's mingling with man and Satan's mingling with man
Antichrist will be the last of the 'false Christs' and will work signs and lying wonders with the power of Satan to deceive the perishing
The phrase 'through faith' is very important because we often do not have any sensation that Christ is making His home in our hearts
If we are full of doubt because of our lack of sensation, our experience of Christ making His home in our hearts will seem to vanish
The phrase the 'faith of Jesus Christ' used by Paul in Romans 3:22 has caused translators a great deal of trouble
When the Bible says that Jesus as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit and that He is indwelling us , we must say 'yes'
When we have a time with the Lord in the morning in His Word, we should not expect to have a spectacular feeling
We may have some feeling, and we may call it inspiration, but we should not expect a spectacular or extraordinary feeling
We behold the Lord Jesus and we see Him today, not by our physical eyes, but by faith in the fact that He lives in us and we live Him
In this message we want to see that in our Christian life and service we need to do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus
In John 5:43 the Son comes in the name of the Father, and in 14:26 the Father sends the Spirit in the name of the Son
When the New Testament says that the Son came in the name of the Father, this indicates that the Son and the Father are one
When the New Testament says that the Father sent the Spirit in the name of the Son, this indicates that the Father is one with the Son
The Father and the Son do two things the Son comes in the Father's name, and the Father sends the Spirit in the Son's name
In reading these verses, a question may immediately be raised: Does the Father send the Spirit or does the Son send the Spirit?
The Spirit being sent by the Father in the Son's name implies that both the Father and the Son are the Sender of the Spirit
The Son sending the Spirit from the Father and the Father sending the Spirit in the Son's name refer to the same thing
Based upon the above verses in John 14 and 15, we can be helped to understand what it means to pray to the Father in the name of the Son
To do things in the name, to call on the name, to mention the name, reminds us that we are one with the Lord Jesus
Matthew 7:21 is part of the conclusion of the Lord's teaching concerning the kingdom's constitution given on the mountain
The Lord concludes His teaching on the mountain by reminding us that as His believers we have His name and that we may use His name
To say that we cannot exchange words with our wives and be in the name of the Lord is easy to realize because exchanging words is evil
Another aspect is that we not only need to do things in the name of the Lord Jesus but we must also be regulated by Gods Word by Gods will
When you deal with your children, what you should say and what points you should take care of depend upon your understanding of the Word
To be in the Lord's name requires us to abide in the Lord and let Him and His words abide in us that we may actually be one with Him
Question: It seems that this matter of being in the name of the Lord requires some amount of realization which comes through growth
How can we prevent the matter of being in the name of the Lord from becoming a religious formality with the new ones?
To lead the new ones into calling upon the Lord's name is okay, but the content of this message may be too advanced
You have to realize that the Lord taught the disciples concerning praying in His name after three and a half years of teaching
Answer: We need the teachings from the Bible, but we should not apply the teachings of the Bible to our feelings
These four divine items the divine dispensing the divine Trinity the divine economy and the divine purpose can be seen in the Gospel of John
Just as a building has a steel frame, the divine Trinity is the intrinsic frame of the divine revelation in the Scriptures
The Gospel of John is probably the top book that speaks of the divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
The Son is one with the Father, but He said that He would pray to the Father, asking the Father to send a third one, the Spirit of reality
The Spirit of reality is one with the Son, because the Son said that the Spirit's being in the disciples would be His being in them
He entered into the womb of a virgin, being incarnated, for the purpose of dispensing Himself to His chosen people as grace and reality
In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul said, 'I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me'
John 3:16 says that God gave His only begotten Son for the dispensing of His Son to His believers as eternal life
The giving of the Son in 3:16 is for the dispensing of the Son to His believers as the eternal life; this was the second step
He is the Word who is God, the incarnated God, the Savior, the Redeemer, the crucified One, and the resurrected One
He dispenses Himself as grace, as reality, and as eternal life, and all these are compounded in the consummated Spirit
John 6 reveals that we need to eat Christ as the daily manna, the heavenly bread, the bread of life, the bread of God, and the living bread
The purpose of the divine dispensing is first that we would have rivers of living water flowing out of our innermost being
We all have to realize that the real Christian life, the real life of the believers in Christ, is not an exchanged life but a mingled life
Regeneration is the initiation of the divine mingling, the mingling of the divine Spirit with our human spirit
Breathing drinking eating and growing are the continual dispensing of the divine Trinity into us as a continuation of this divine mingling
In a previous message, we saw that the Son came in the Father's name and that the Son did things in the name of the Father
To do things in the name of another one is not only to be one with another person but also to be that other person
The Father 'wrote the check' by sending the Spirit, but He 'signed' the name of the Son by sending the Spirit in the name of the Son
In John 14:26 the Father sends the Spirit in the name of the Son, but in John 15:26, the Son sends the Spirit from the Father
When these two portions are put together, you can see that when the Father sends the Spirit, He does so with the Son
In making the Son the Firstborn of the two creations, the Father gave the preeminence, the first place, to the Son
Because man is a tripartite being having a body, a soul, and a spirit he may be considered as a 'human trinity'
The Bible says that the flesh, our body, lusts or fights against our spirit which is mingled with the divine Spirit
The Christian life is the 'human trinity' the body, the soul, and the spirit mingled together with the divine Trinity
In our Christian life, God uses four instruments to mingle us with the divine Trinity: the divine life, the cross, the Spirit, and the Word
In the first chapter of the Bible, Genesis 1:2 says, 'And the Spirit of God brooded upon the face of the waters'
When the Spirit is mentioned, the entire Triune God, comprising the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, is implied
The Spirit and the bride are now calling us to come to the feast to drink of the river of the water of life and to eat of the tree of life
Stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him'
These verses say, 'He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water
The seven Spirits in verse 4 indicate that, at the end of the Bible, the drinking of the living water is intensified
According to the context of the book of Revelation, the Spirit in Revelation 22:17 is the consummated, sevenfold Spirit
The Spirit's work in the new creation produced Jesus Christ among the human race as the tree of life for us to take and enjoy
We saved ones, the regenerated sons of God, must be in our human spirit in order to enjoy the consummated, life-giving Spirit
If a man lives in his soul, he will be better, but he will be a natural man logical, considerate, careful, and thoughtful
The virtues of humility, patience, endurance, love, and kindness flow from the one fountain of our human spirit
The Chinese ethical teachers such as Confucius taught that within human beings there is a part which they called the bright virtue
To be saved is to be brought back from our lustful body and our thoughtful soul to the right part of our being, our spirit
By faith we know that the Bible is the Word of God, and by faith we know that we have been saved, regenerated, and forgiven by God
The age of mystery began at the time of the Lord's incarnation, but when He appears again, the age of mystery will be over
The more we believe that the divine Spirit indwells, works, moves, and operates in our spirit, the happier we are
If we say there is no God, then to us there will be no God, but if we say there is a God, then we will experience that there is a God
To speak indicates that we believe, and when we believe, we receive what we believe and even become what we believe
We should go so far as to say not only that the divine Spirit is in our spirit but also that we ourselves and God are one spirit
To depend solely upon our experience we do not need revelation, but to believe what the Bible says requires much revelation
We also need to exercise our faith to believe that the divine Spirit is not only in our spirit but also in our whole being
If we have such an enlarged vision, this vision will keep us sanctified, transformed, victorious, and even overcoming
Eventually, however, some taught heresy by saying that the mingling of the human nature and the divine nature would produce a third nature
In dealing with the truth of the mingling of divinity with humanity we must consider the mingling of the divine Spirit with our human spirit
These two verses say 'my spirit' and 'your spirit,' denoting undeniably that we, the God-created human beings, do have a spirit
The heavens, the earth, and the human spirit are the three marvelous, excellent, and crucial elements of the universe
Spirit' here does not refer to the Holy Spirit but to the regenerated human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God
When we realize that we should be nice to them, we act like gentlemen and talk very thoughtfully with much logic
The book of 1 Corinthians reveals three kinds of persons: the fleshly man, the soulish man, and the spiritual man
If one does not examine himself, he still has the human life, but if he opens himself up to find his human life, he will lose it
He may not have felt the Spirit, and he had no way to prove that he had the Spirit, but he thought he had the Spirit of God
We must not be influenced by the teaching that we must pray and do many things before we can receive the Spirit
When there is no problem with our stomach, we are not aware of it, but when our stomach has a problem, we are aware of it
For this reason, in many verses in the New Testament, we cannot discern whether 'spirit' denotes the divine Spirit or the human spirit
Our physical body was formed of the dust of the ground, but there was no life in it until the Creator breathed His breath into it
If we set our mind on our flesh, we will suffer death, but if we set our mind upon the spirit, we will enjoy life and peace
Paul said Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you whom you have from God and you are not your own
Regeneration has planted Christ as the 'root' in our spirit, but we also need the 'root hairs' of eating, drinking, and breathing the Lord
Many of us in the Lord's recovery do know how to eat, drink, and breathe the Lord, but we may not be practicing this in our daily life
We may not know the practicality of the Spirit spreading Himself with our spirit into our soul and saturating our body
Our experience of eating, drinking, and breathing the Lord should be built upon the foundation of the deposit of the holy Word
Several thousand messages of this ministry have been published, but we are still discovering new light from the Word
The more we practice this as the root hairs of our experience, the more we will have the dispensing of the divine Trinity
If we have many root hairs and grow by our root hairs, all the small defects in our behavior will be swallowed up
While one person is prophesying and something is revealed to another sitting by, the first person should be silent
At that time if a leading one says that it is time to stop, we may consider that he is not as spiritual as we are
Our spirit is needed to receive Christ as the Spirit to be our person that we may live, walk, and have our being in Him
Some may feel that the proper way to make a decision is to consider all the factors related to our situation and the persons around us
Others may consider that the way to make decisions is to pray with fasting until the Holy Spirit suddenly enlightens us
We should live in our spirit which is mingled with the Holy Spirit and be spiritual in our whole being including our mind emotion and will
In Romans 12:2 Paul says, 'And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind'
Question: In Romans 8, are minding the things of the Spirit , setting the mind on the spirit , and being in the spirit the same experience?
In verse 5 is the experience of practicing to be spiritual, but the experience of verse 6 comes after we have had further practice
It is also a fact that our human spirit has been regenerated and that the Lord Jesus as the divine Spirit is now in our spirit
We should not think that as Christians who love the Lord we are hot, while the Lord Himself is cold and needs to be stirred up by us
The disciples in the early church were living worshipping attending the meetings and working in a normal way being filled with the Spirit
When lighting a fire, it is best to start with a small burning and then feed it with some fuel as it is needed
The real growth, the real advance, in the Christian life is evidenced by our always remaining the same with no fluctuation
We have been talking about the new way for the church life for several years, but some among us are not taking the new way
We must learn not to quench the Spirit but to stand with the spiritual facts and live a life according to these facts
The more we grow in life, the more we will live this way, and the Lord will be able to use us to accomplish many things
The dispensing of the divine Trinity is a fact and a reality, but we must exercise our faith to say 'amen' to this fact
God's New Testament economy is by faith, not by appearance, and this faith is based upon the divine facts that have been accomplished
As a result, many times we do not stand with the divine facts but prefer to exercise our feeling and natural concepts
What we preach as the glad tidings, the good news, is that God has accomplished everything needed for His economy
He went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death as the Lamb of God , the brass serpent , and the grain of wheat
After He accomplished all these things, He recorded what He had accomplished in His testament and passed this testament on to us
If we question whether or not we have the authority of Christ, this indicates that we do not have the habit of faith
In His resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit , and in His resurrection He resurrected us and regenerated us
The New Testament also tells us that Christ as the Spirit is now in us, and the Spirit who is in us is the very presence of the Triune God
In the divine Trinity, God the Father is the source, God the Son is the course, and God the Spirit is the flow
Every day is a day for us to enjoy the presence of the Triune God, but the means for our enjoyment of His presence is His teaching
When we put the Bible aside, we do not have His presence, but when we gather around His Word, we have His presence
The first appearance of the returning One to the same group of disciples was in John 20:19-25, when they were gathered together
The gathering of the disciples brought in the presence of the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God
We have peace and comfort in these gatherings because the comforting Spirit, who is our very peace, rest, and comfort is there
Our grace and our peace come from the Father as the source, through the Son as the course, and by the Spirit as the flow reaching us
The Lord Jesus became the Spirit in His resurrection, and this Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God, is always with us
We must not take the natural way, considering our feelings and seeking to have outward evidence of the divine facts
These saints have said that every message which has come out from the ministry concerning the God-ordained way is scriptural
God created man, Adam and Eve, and said to them, 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it'
After practicing the God-ordained way in only a partial way, there are now five thousand saints attending the Lord's table in Taipei
In the past the elders in Taipei had the hard task of getting one speaker to speak in each of their twenty-one halls
Before October 1984 there were only twentyone speakers every Sunday morning among about three thousand attendants meeting in twentyone halls
The content of the conference was the outlines used for the additional meetings after the 1990 summer training
The saints enjoyed each point so much and were so eager to speak that it was difficult for them to go on from one point to the next
A Christian group built up in the traditional way may start out as a small denominational church with a congregation of twenty-five people
They begin to make this need known and soon the money comes in to build a meeting place that can seat three thousand
They have never been developed and trained; therefore, they do not know how to speak, preach, and often do not even know how to pray
Some pastors in Christianity who have come among us have been surprised that most of the attendants in our meetings can pray
An indication of our having been drugged by the traditional way can be seen in the way we enter into the meeting hall
A meeting in which we all speak Christ to one another will be living, rich, uplifted, strengthening, and glorifying
When we come together in this state, everyone will have something to present from the storehouse in their being
As long as you are a Christian, you have the eternal life, and this life has the highest capacity, ability, gift, talent, and function
If we sow grass seeds in our yard today and go back to see it the next day, it seems that the yard is about the same
In a sense, the seeds grow on their own, but in another sense, there is still the need of proper care, fertilizing, and watering
Before we go out to visit people with the gospel, we should rise up early in the morning to have a time with the Lord
Perhaps those of us who have tried to practice visiting people with the gospel have been disappointed because we wanted quick results
If you labor and struggle consistently, two remaining fruit will be added to the church life each year from your labor
If today you are thirty years old, you could have as many as eighty spiritual children by the time you are seventy years old
You have to do it constantly, patiently, and faithfully in the way of fulfilling your vow to the Lord for your whole life
We all need to labor and struggle in the God-ordained way so that the recovery of Christ and the church can spread all over the earth
Christianity today mainly depends upon the clergy, but the majority of the people in the denominations do not labor
The Lord has shown us the details of His ordained way, but we have not yet come up to His standard in our labor
Peter and John confronted these two obstacles in the beginning of Acts, and the frustration of these two obstacles intensified with Paul
We do not realize how much help we have received from the church life, even from a church that we may consider to be poor
If we were to stop the church life for as little as three months, we would realize how much help the apparently poor'' church is to us
We can easily join ourselves to the church for the practice of prophesying in the larger meetings of the church
Once we get one of these relatives saved and baptized, they may also have twenty or more acquaintances to whom we can bring the gospel
In our preaching of the gospel, we may desire to gain the higher-class professional people or at least those of the middle class
It was mostly the lower-class people, those in the roads, at the hedges, and the idle people on the streets, who responded to the Lord Jesus
In 1 Corinthians 1, Paul told us clearly that not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many wellborn'' are called
Many of these people who have good jobs would only care for their enjoyment and weekend amusement; they have no heart for Jesus
Often the ones who take Jesus are those who have lost their jobs, who have nothing to do, or who are expecting help from others
We must go to the lanes and hedges, to those who are idle, as well as to those for whom we have a particular burden
Forty-five weeks out of the year, we should take care of our duty, our responsibility, in preaching the gospel
When you come to the stage of feeding new ones you have to add a few more hours to your budget of time for your labor in the Godordained way
Because you have to spend more time feeding new ones, you will have to reduce some of your time in visiting sinners
These divisions have come about not only because of different views and concepts but also because of improper motives and intentions
To find out what we should do with the new believers once they are saved and baptized, we must come back to the Word
Many years ago, Brother Nee initiated a new beginners' meeting in the church in Shanghai in order to meet the need of the new believers
The subjects which Brother Nee prepared were marvelous, and the teachers who taught the lessons were also good
The need to help the new believers has remained over the years, but the way to meet this need was not uncovered until recently
The group meeting is not formed by anyone in an organizational way; it is composed of the saints with their spiritual children in Christ
We may have been taught certain things, yet if we do not practice them, we are unable to realize the full benefit
A person may be taught how to play the piano but if he does not have the patience to practice he will not be able to play the piano properly
If we come together without singing, praying, or praising and without a willingness to open to one another, the group meeting will suffer
Without this proper opening, there is no possibility to have the mutual intercession, mutual care, or mutual shepherding
If we do not have these things, it is difficult to have the mutual teaching through asking and answering questions
The divine life is greater than our natural life, so the capacity in the divine life is also greater and richer than our natural life
There is a big difference between a person who has been saved many years and one who has been saved for a few days
These saints should bear more responsibility in the meetings, yet they should not be assigned to do this in an official way
Although we all should try to teach, those who are more capable in teaching should spontaneously pick up more burden in teaching
If you are not rich in knowing the Bible or rich in experiencing Christ, you will not have much to teach others
Paul charged Timothy a gifted co-worker to commit what he had heard to faithful men who would be competent to teach others
If our learning is limited, we will not have the ability to be flexible in asking and answering questions in the group meetings
According to my observation, both in Taipei and in this country, the biggest shortcoming among us is our unwillingness to learn
If just one-third of the saints practice the Lord's way honestly and faithfully with a pure motive and heart, the Lord will see the success
Many of us have been brought into the Lord's recovery, but we may not have an adequate realization of the Lord's recovery
The first factor of our Christian faith is the one Body for the corporate expression of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God
Eventually, we all will be glorified, and this is our hope, the one hope of glory for the redemption of our body
Some people may think we are crazy because our entire life is involved with the meetings and service of the church
The seventh factor of our Christian faith is the one God and Father, who is overshadowing us, taking care of us, and is always with us
Our Christian faith is of seven factors: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father
Eventually, we must have the boldness and the full assurance to say that we are one with God because we are in God and God is in us
The glory which was given to the Son by the Father was given by the Son to us so that we might be one in this glory to express God
It may be difficult for a brother to call his father-in-law 'father' because he is not his father according to life
As those who have been born of God the Father, we have His life, and our oneness is in the Father's name by the Father's life
Such an affectionate term implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father
Despite the differences in our ages we call each other brother and sister because we are all born of the same Father and have the same life
In order to keep the oneness of the Spirit, we need to bear with one another in love with all lowliness and meekness and with longsuffering
In order for us to practice the oneness of the Body of Christ, we need to realize that division is heretical, sectarian
In Galatians 5:20 the Greek word for 'parties,' hairesis, is literally heresies, which means schools of opinions , sects
Divisions and parties, sects, are works of the flesh, and 'those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God'
Peter 2:1 uses the word hairesis in referring to false teachers who bring in destructive heresies, denying the Master who bought them
Titus 3:10 uses the same Greek word for heresy in its adjectival form, hairetikon, in referring to a factious man
Denying the person of Christ in His divinity and humanity and division are the only two items that can be considered as heretical
Some who practice baptism in a different way than immersion still have God as their Father and Jesus Christ as their Lord
John says that if anyone denies the Lord's person in His divinity or humanity, we should not receive him into our home or even greet him
As we have seen, division is so serious, condemned as being heretical, because it dismembers the Body of Christ
In 1 Corinthians 111720 Paul condemned the Corinthians for coming together for the worse because there were divisions and parties among them
The apostles were also strong in condemning the heresies denying the person of Christ in His divinity or in His humanity
We must practice to receive all believers regardless of our doctrinal differences which do not damage our basic Christian faith
Paul was so general, saying that we have to accept and receive the believers because God and Christ have received them
When he comes to the last chapter, Romans 16, he becomes very strong in his charge concerning how to deal with divisive ones
In order to maintain good order in the church, a factious, divisive person, after a first and second admonition, should be refused, rejected
All the fullness' refers to all the matters, all the things, and all the persons involved in and with the Godhead
As man, sharing the created blood and flesh , He is part of the creation, having the preeminence in all creation
When the children of Israel entered into the good land, they allotted the land to the twelve tribes, so every tribe received a lot
Corinthians 1:2 speaks of 'all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours'
We cannot show them because this life is invisible, but there are the activities of this life, which show that we possess it
In many formal wedding ceremonies around the world, the bride has her head covered to indicate her submission to her husband
Eventually, through our soul, He will even invade our body, saturating us with Himself and dispensing Himself into our entire being
We need to grow up into Christ in all things with the growth of God, which is the increase of God, the addition of God
Since we realize that we have Christ living in us as our life, we have to walk carefully with much consideration
The hope of our calling is the hope of glory, which is the transfiguration of our body and the manifestation of the sons of God
In the Christian race, we should not drink anything other than the all-inclusive Christ as our all-inclusive drink
As the divine provision, Christ is God's power to us for carrying out and accomplishing what He has planned and purposed
Christ as wisdom should unceasingly flow from God to us to be our present and practical wisdom in our experience
He is the righteousness by which we have been justified by God so that we may be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life
As the One who is our redemption, Christ 'will transfigure the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory'
As the church's living foundation, He holds, supports, and dispenses Himself into every part of God's building
We may wonder how the church as the Body of Christ can be Christ and how Christ can be all the members of the new man
In whatever way we preach the gospel by reaching people where they are, we must be filled with Christ and minister Christ to people
Our fellowship, our prayer, our care, our shepherding, our help, and our mutuality in the group meetings must be Christ
Finally, Christ is the reality in the building up of the church, the Body of Christ, by prophesying in the bigger meetings of the church
In the Lord's recovery, everything should be Christ, every matter should be Christ, and every person should be Christ
Suppose some saints love the recovery, yet they are bothered about being immersed, and they do not want to be immersed
According to Romans 14, we need to receive all the believers according to God's receiving and not according to doctrinal concepts
We saw in the previous message that only two things are considered as heresy the denial of Christ's person and the making of divisions
Besides these two things, we have to learn to tolerate, to embrace, all the things with which we may not agree
We must have a proper heart when we read it, not holding on to any opinion, and we must be diligent in searching and studying it
In this way, we will not only see the outward shell of the Bible but also apprehend and enter into the heart of the Bible
God chose, predestinated, redeemed, saved, and regenerated us for the purpose of dispensing and working Himself into us
For the fulfillment of His economy, God created man, but He first had to create the earth to support man so that man could live
Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
After God created the heavens, the earth, and all the things on the earth in Genesis 1, He came to the last step of His creation
God created man for the purpose of working Himself completely and wholly into man to be man's life, so that man may be His living
In these verses, the word stewardship, which is another translation of the Greek word oikonomia, implies dispensing
A stewardship is for distributing and supplying the foodstuff as well as all the daily necessities to the household members
God became flesh so that He could come in His fullness to dispense grace and reality to us that we might receive His dispensing in full
God's giving of His Son was His dispensing which causes all those who believe into the Son to have eternal life
Christ not only spoke the words of God but also dispensed God into us, dispensing the Spirit of God not by measure
The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the Triune God becoming our bountiful supply
The ultimate result of the divine dispensing is the church, which is the ultimate consummation of the aggregate of God's dispensing
A fruit tree can blossom and bring forth fruit because it has received the supply of nutrients from the sun, air, water, and soil
He has received all authority in heaven and on earth and has commanded us to preach the gospel to all the nations
The preaching of the gospel is not a matter of how much doctrine we preach; it is a matter of spiritual reality and authority
When we bring people to believe in the Lord and continue to nourish and perfect them, we bring people to Christ that Christ may be enlarged
We bring people to Christ and nourish them so that they will begin to eat the Lord, drink the Lord, and absorb the Lord
Through preaching the gospel, practicing the group meetings, and prophesying, we dispense the Christ we enjoy to others
We will be organic both in our church life and in the practice of the new way, having Christ as the content and reality
Within the universe created by God, certain ethical principles exist among mankind in order to preserve mankind on the earth
Due to the ethical principles which exist among human beings, some amount of order is being kept so that mankind can continue to exist
God's final goal according to His eternal economy is to have a spiritual realm, a realm in which His believers are His new creation
In the new creation, God worked Himself into man in order to make man a partner with Himself and to make Himself a partner with man
Verse 5 shows that Christ in His redemption conquered all of His enemies in order to gain worshippers in the new creation
With the Spirit everything is organic and living, yet there is still the need of training to learn to know the Spirit's instant leading
In our practice of being revived every morning, we first take the written Word, in which are the God-ordained principles
Isaiah surely knew that God's people must be holy, but this vision reminded him of that God- ordained principle
At this time the vision he received was not just a written principle; it became an instant, organic leading of the living Lord
