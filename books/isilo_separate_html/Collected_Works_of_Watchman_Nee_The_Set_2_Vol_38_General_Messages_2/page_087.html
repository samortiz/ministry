I believe no place on earth irritates a person more easily than the family. One common problem in the family is that some husbands complain that their wives have a quick temper, while the wives complain that their husbands have caused them to have a quick temper. Or the wives complain that their husbands have a quick temper, while the husbands complain that their wives have caused them to have a quick temper. We have to deal with this matter properly. Every time something like this happens, you have to ask whether the other side provoked you or whether you provoked the other side. The one who loses his temper has sinned, but the one who caused the other to lose his temper has also sinned. If the husband is nice, quiet, and gentle but the wife is quick and impatient, there will be no peace in the family. A wife may be quick and impatient, but her anger is often aroused by her husband. Many people are impatient because others force them to be impatient. We often encounter problems in the family, and we believe that the blame belongs to the other person. However, we should not think in this way. We should ask whether we have contributed to the other person's blame. This kind of thought will help build a good family.</p><p>Let me give an illustration. Many wives complain that their husbands are not generous in spending money. Of the many wives that I have met, at least eighty percent have this thought. It is often true that the husband is hesitant in spending money; he does not buy the utensils, food, and clothes that are needed. However, you must realize that there is a reaction for every action in this world. There are two sides to everything in this world. On the one side there is action, and on the other side there is reaction. If you want your husband to spend money, you must not spend money. This is a fact. A man does not have to speak with his mouth; he can speak with his eyes, ears, or actions. The word protestant means one who protests. Every person is constantly protesting. Man's condition is in a constant state of protest. The wife may say, "My husband does not want to spend money. Therefore, since he will not spend money on what is necessary, I will spend more." The husband may then say, "If you decide to spend so much, I will spend even less." The husband protests by his actions. His holding back is a kind of protest, whereas the wife's spending is also a protest. They smile at each other when they meet, they are polite to each other, and they say nothing with their mouth, but when one of them does anything, the other does exactly the opposite. They do not agree with what the other is doing, so they do it the other way. Soon matters become worse, and they do not understand the reason for the change. Brother, you should not say that your wife is a spendthrift. She is so good at spending money because you will not spend money. Sister, you should not say that your husband is stingy or reluctant to spend money. He does not want to spend money, because you spend too much money. Both sides are maneuvering.</p><p>A family is often like the pendulum of a clock. One minute it is on one side, and the next minute it is on the other side. If you push it to one side, it will swing all the way to the other side. But if you put it in the middle, it will no longer swing. This is the way between the husband and the wife. If the husband puts the pendulum all the way to one side, he may be trying to hold his wife to one side, but the more he tries to hold her to one side, the more she will swing to the other side, and the whole family will be thrown into turmoil. The husband will push to one extreme, while the wife will push to the other extreme. This is where the problem lies. Brothers, please remember that this is where the greatest problem in a family lies; this is where husbands and wives fall most easily into arguments. If there is a problem in your family, you should immediately consider, "Have I provoked her in anything? What have I done or what attitude of mine has caused her to act this way?" Please remember that whatever she does may not be that serious. The more serious matter involves what you have done to affect her behavior. Behind all the arguments and problems in a family are the standoffs within the family.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2><p>When I visit others' homes, it is mainly for the purpose of acting as a reconciler. Although I am not that old, I have done a great deal of reconciling work. I often point out the reason for a couple's protests. One time I was a guest in a family. Both the husband and the wife were not young; they were middle-aged. At the table, one was speaking one way, and the other was speaking another way. After one said something, the other overturned what the first one said, and vice versa. This went on and on. The two of them did not know what they were doing. Yet as an outsider, it was very clear to me. Later, they turned to me and asked, "What is happening with the two of us? There is really nothing wrong with us. Yet we cannot say that we are all right. There is really nothing bad about us, yet we cannot say that there is anything good. There is nothing spiritually wrong with both of us. We do not hate each other. Yet neither do we love each other. What is happening with the two of us?" I told them, "You are trying to outmaneuver each other." They asked what I meant. I pointed out how they had been maneuvering. They laughed and agreed with me readily. Please remember that you have to pay attention to the matter of adjustment. You have to adjust yourself properly. Today is the wedding day for both of you. It is also the day of your inauguration into your jobs. As you live together, you will find that there are many wonderful days ahead of you. You have to commit everything into the Lord's hand. As the husband, you should not step back, nor as the wife should you step back. Let the Lord speak to you in everything. If you want to deal with this matter properly, you must not protest in attitude or in action. I hope that in five years, we will have another wonderful family. Someone said that any book published by the Shang-wu Printing Company had to go through twenty-three proofreadings. Perhaps five years from now, the two of you will have gone through your twenty-third "proofreading." I mean that you have to spend time to adjust yourselves. If you do not spend the time, you will be the same five or ten years from now. You will still be dragging along on your side while she drags along on her side. If you will deal with this matter properly, I hope that we will see a splendid family life in five years. May the Lord bless the two of you!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_086.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_088.html">Next</a> </body></html>
