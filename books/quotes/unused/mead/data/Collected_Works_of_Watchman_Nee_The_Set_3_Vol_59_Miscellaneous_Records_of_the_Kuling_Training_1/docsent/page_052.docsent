   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING OBEDIENCE IN EVERYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God must secure a group of people who are absolutely submissive to civil authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to Romans 13:1-7, they should render tax to whom tax is due, custom to whom custom is due, fear to whom fear is due, and honor to whom honor is due.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the family there should also be order and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One should be a submissive wife, obedient child, or obedient servant.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should maintain our standing and submit to authority in every circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This kind of behavior and attitude constitutes the best testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nothing can be more beautiful in the world than seeing submission in every circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who practice this are expressing God's glory and God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are not submitting to a person when we submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are submitting to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to take care of the sense of the spirit within us, we submit to deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who know authority will submit to authority wherever they find it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A brother who listens to only one man is not useful because he is submitting only to man; he has not seen God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once a man touches God's authority, he can submit to any authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should submit to authority wherever we are.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is one brother in Foochow who only obeys a certain person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Another brother will not take any word from Brother Chen or Brother Zheng.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Shanghai there is a sister who only responds to the words of Sister Wang and Sister Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are only obeying men; they are not submitting to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Submission to authority has nothing to do with persons.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to touch authority in the kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to touch authority in our office.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whenever we find responsible brothers in the church, we find authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We find the system of authority everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a man thinks that he needs to only submit to one person, he has not seen authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Submission is not directed toward one or two persons; it is directed toward all authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must have a feeling for authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not a matter of being polite and careful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to have a spirit of submission, a feeling for submission.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A person who has touched God's authority once will know it as soon as he touches it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The sisters who are in charge of the kitchen have their authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we step into the kitchen we have to obey them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This does not mean that we have to be polite to them and take care to not offend them like those in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What we need is a sense of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a sense comes spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is like the feeling an arm has when it is twisted; the feeling of pain is there spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who know divine authority will identify it as soon as they touch it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a brother says that everyone's word is wrong and that only Brother Witness's or Sister Wang's words are right, he is an outsider as far as spiritual matters are concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is looking for a group of people on earth who will not offend or rebel against authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a man truly knows authority, his submission will be spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not a matter of politeness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A Christian does not need politeness; he needs a sense of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If such a sense is present in the church, the coordination between the brothers and sisters will be spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without this the church will be in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may say that we are submitting to eight or ten persons, but the result of this submission will still be confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to submit to all authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the church the absence of obedience brings in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Confusion is equally brought in by an obedience to only one or a few persons.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The whole issue rests on whether or not we have touched authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What is God upholding on earth today?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is upholding authority.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a man destroys God's authority, any work, consecration, service, or zeal will be a form of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It will be nothing but an offense to His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Unless we can sense the evil of rebellion and insubordination, we are useless in the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God upholds His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we destroy this authority, we will have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This matter needs to be fundamentally resolved before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Unless we settle this, we may not get into trouble when we are on the mountain, but we will certainly get into trouble when we leave.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If a man errs in this matter, he may not get into trouble in one place, but he will get into trouble in another place.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is not enough for the brothers from Chefoo to obey Brother Witness alone; they have to find authority wherever they go and submit to it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In order to be obedient wherever we are, we have to see that God alone is the authority and that all authorities are from God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Authority is a mysterious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>No one knows what authority really is.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is hard to describe authority.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is something as mysterious as God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But once a man touches it, he feels that he has touched God because God is Spirit in Himself, but God is authority in His manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are speaking about touching authority; we are not arguing about who should obey whom.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Those who argue about such things are in depravity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May the Lord have mercy on them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A worker must ask if he is submitting to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One does not become a worker by being eloquent, persuasive, or capable.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some sisters find it hard to submit to brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Some wives find it hard to submit to their husbands.</S>

   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Some servants find it hard to submit to their masters.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is hard for them because they have only touched men.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Saul had to be enlightened by the light and fall by the wayside before he could exclaim, "What shall I do, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Acts 22:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Once a man sees authority, all critical thoughts against police, government, husbands, parents, and brothers and sisters will go away.</S>
