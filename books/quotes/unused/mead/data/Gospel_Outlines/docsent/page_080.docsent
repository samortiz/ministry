   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Seventy-nine THE DAYSPRING OF MERCY Scripture: Luke 1:76-79 Human living is in darkness In the Bible darkness symbolizes sins.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>So man living in darkness is living in sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sin brings in the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although sin is not death, it is at least the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>So men living in sins are living under the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why Luke says, them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s mercy toward men According to the condition of men living in sins, God should deal with men according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But God s heart causes Him to be merciful toward men.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mercy is something within God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to God s procedure and His laws, God should deal with us in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But not only does God have His procedure and His laws; He also has a heart, and it is His heart that causes Him to deal with us in mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Mercy reaches farther than grace; mercy reaches even to the unworthy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Grace is freely given, but it is given only to those who are worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If God had only grace and not mercy, all of us who are living in sins would be unworthy of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But thank God, He is also merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our position before God today is like that of a beggar needing God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To give something freely to someone who deserves it is grace; to give something to a beggar is mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God s mercy causes the dayspring to shine upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The dayspring signifies the end of darkness, and the dawn of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is to say that whoever has God s mercy upon him has his darkness ended.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>So God s mercy is not only the light, but also the sunshine of the dawn.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Friends, maybe today God s dayspring is shining upon you, to end your darkness, and to bring light into your life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is the sunshine of the dayspring God s mercy is to send Christ as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are living in darkness and under the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ comes to meet our need, to cause our darkness to vanish, and to chase away the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the business of the sunshine to cause darkness to vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is the sunshine of the dayspring to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Christ comes upon someone, the most obvious work is to make that one bright inside.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everyone who meets Christ right away feels that he sees light.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone who hears the gospel of Christ instantly feels that he is bright inside.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everyone who meets Christ instantly feels that his life has come to the daylight, and that he has come out of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Darkness is sins; sunshine is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a man meets Christ, he is sure to be delivered from sins, that is, from the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The shining of Christ causes man to be delivered from sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The result of being enlightened by Christ The Bible says that evildoers have no rest in them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When a man sins, his conscience is troubled, and there is no peace between man and God; even there is no peace with the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, there will be the eternal unrest in hell.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here you need to give some examples to illustrate how, after a person committed a certain sin, there was the unrest in his conscience and in his family.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since Christ s enlightenment causes us to see light, it also causes us to be delivered from the causes of unrest and the elements of unrest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the unrest comes from sins, darkness, and the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since Christ s shining causes us to be delivered from these things, we are delivered from the causes of unrest and its elements.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>So Christ s shining guides our feet into the way of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who are in darkness are walking in the way of sins and living a life of unrest.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As soon as we receive Christ s salvation and Christ shines upon us, we have peace in our conscience, peace with our environment, harmony with God, and are at peace constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What should we do with Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not reject His shining.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is God s mercy reaching to you that you are hearing this gospel message today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So friends, do not reject the shining of Christ.</S>
