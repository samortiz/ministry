   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUPPLY AND REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Corinthians 4 shows us clearly that where there is reality, there is the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul said, "Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body" v. 10 . This shows us that when the death of Jesus is manifested, His life is also manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In other words, the life of Jesus is seen in us because the death of Jesus is seen in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a group of people knows the death of Jesus, life is made manifest in them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul then said, "So then death operates in us, but life in you" v. 12 . In verse 10, he spoke of the manifestation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 12 he spoke of the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the manifestation is in us, it is life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the manifestation is in others, it is supply.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the source is the same the death of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, hollow preachings are vain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Preachings that do not touch any reality do not render any supply to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the death of Jesus operates in us, the life of Jesus operates in others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is not a matter of preaching or work, but a matter of the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, preaching has its use.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if there is no reality behind one's preaching, there will not be the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we have the "death of Jesus" in us, the Body of Christ receives the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Where there is reality, there is supply.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not know what the "death of Jesus" means and if we have not borne the cross in silence, we do not have the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brothers and sisters, we have to remember that as far as spiritual reality is concerned, no work should be "performed" by us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we pass through something in a real way, the Body of Christ spontaneously receives the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On our side, we should know the "death of Jesus," and on the side of the Body of Christ, there will be the supply spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, there is no need for us to tell others that we are forgiving others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no need for us to blow the trumpet and tell others that we are loving them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not need to draw attention to our bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we touch reality, spontaneously, others will receive the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It does not matter whether or not we know that others are supplied, and it does not matter whether or not we feel it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One fact is certain: "Death operates in us, but life in you."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our trouble is that we know too many doctrines already.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We act merely according to teachings and do not have the supply of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to realize that supply is not superficial behavior; supply is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we know what "the death of Jesus" means before the Lord, "the life of Jesus" will operate in the church spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If it is life, there will be the supply spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Supply gives life to others; it is not an exhibition of our own work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Supply edifies others, rather than broadcasts our own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The most important thing for us to do is have the supply through possessing the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every time we pass through "the death of Jesus," there will always be some brothers and sisters who receive the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There will be no need for us to wait to write an autobiography before others will receive the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As soon as we receive life from the Lord, the church will have the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must realize that the help many receive transcends consciousness and feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As long as we have the reality, others will receive the supply whether or not we feel it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Life is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever we are truly bearing the cross before the Lord, the Body of Christ will receive the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do not know the meaning of the supply of life, we will not understand what Paul meant when he said, "Death operates in us, but life in you."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Moreover, he told the Colossian saints, "I now rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church" Col 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we see that the Body of Christ is one, spontaneously there will be the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why Paul was able to suffer for the sake of the Body of Christ, and this is why he could fill up the lack of the afflictions of Christ in his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we do not see that the Body of Christ is one, we will not realize how the lack of the afflictions of Christ is being filled up.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May the Lord open our eyes to see that the Body is one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who truly see that the Body is one will see that everything they have has been received 1 Cor 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everything we have is received; everything we have is a supply to others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The reality that we alone touch before God is a supply to the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The supply of the Body transcends any physical contact.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul told the church in Corinth, "For I, on my part, though being absent in the body but present in the spirit, have already judged, as if being present" 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul touched the reality of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, he could say that he was present with them in his spirit, as if he was present with them in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is not a wish.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is touching the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we see that the Body of Christ is one, our spirit will be with the Body, and this is supply.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This supply transcends words, transcends work, and transcends all physical contact.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we know God and are in contact with Him, all of our experiences will become the riches of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is a pity that many Christians are still living in outward appearances!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There seems to be a supply only when they work, but this supply stops once their work stops.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When they open their mouths, they appear to be the best servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But when they do not open their mouths, they are no longer the best servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When others understand them, they can render others the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But when they are misunderstood, they cannot render the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They have not touched the spiritual reality before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the reason that they cannot render the supply of life to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One brother may be in the company of others, and he may only open his mouth for five minutes in three hours, yet others receive his supply.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Body of Christ is a fact; one does not receive the supply only when there is the shaking of hands or face-to-face conversations.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When a man experiences something before the Lord, and when he receives the "death of Jesus" from God's hand, he has supplied the Body of Christ already.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, brothers and sisters, we supply the church with our inward knowledge of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We do not have to consciously do something to supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We do not have to intentionally do something to supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We supply others spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Those who have not touched reality cannot supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Only those who have touched reality will supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There is no way to fabricate anything.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In Paul's experience, the supply to the Body of Christ is a reality; it is not an act.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we have passed through something in a real way before the Lord, and if there is the real thing in us, we will supply the church spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As long as we have the real experience, the church will spontaneously receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Paul's word was quite peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It would be easy to understand him if he had said that the death of Jesus operated in him and the life of Jesus also operated in him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But he said that the death of Jesus operated in him, and that as a result, the life of Jesus operated in others.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It would be difficult for anyone who does not know the Body of Christ to understand this word.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Since the Body is one, what operates in me spontaneously operates in others.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is life, and this is supply.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we see this, we will rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Everything that the members receive from the Head is found in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We are all enjoying the same Body.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Brothers and sisters, if we touch this reality, we will not feel that the church is poor or in desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Of course, we admit that outwardly speaking, the church does manifest a condition of poverty and desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We admit that, outwardly speaking, individual Christians have failed and individual Christian groups have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But whenever we touch the reality of the church, we will say that the church is not poor and not in desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The riches of the church are not diminished through the failure of individual Christians and individual groups.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Day by day, everything that the members receive from the Head is supplied to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Paul touched the spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>As a consequence, he could rebuke the church in Corinth on the one hand, and supply it on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Ephesians 4:13 says, "Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>It is difficult to understand this according to our mind or according to outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Outwardly speaking, it seems as if the oneness of the faith is far away.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>It is difficult to say when the church will arrive at this.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>But when we touch the spiritual reality, we will feel that these questions no longer exist.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We will know that the church is one in the eyes of God and that it has never been divided.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Once we touch reality, all outward problems will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If we have not seen the reality, we will not have the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Once we see the reality, the supply to others will begin.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Hence, supply is based on the experience of the cross, and it is also based on one's contact with the reality of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We have to realize that the supply of the word is also based on what we have already imparted to the church in life.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Brothers and sisters, if what we speak is what we have already given to the church, the Holy Spirit will testify to our words.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>But if what we speak is not something that we have before the Lord, the Holy Spirit will not testify to the words.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If we have imparted a certain matter to the church in life and then speak about that certain matter, others will receive the help from our words.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>But if our words merely provide others with clearer thoughts and more knowledge, we will only have fruits of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The food of the church is life; only the supply of life can be food to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The question is not what we can give to others, but what we have already given to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>What have we contributed to the real church?</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>What can we say is our contribution when we stand before that church?</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>If we have not touched reality, we will have nothing to supply to others.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Spiritual things and the reality behind the words supply the church.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Some Christians consider the Body of Christ to be an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>They do not see the reality of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>As a result they have no way to become a supply to others.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>If you do not see the Body, there is no way that you can be a supply.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>If it is the Body, the mouth's eating will be the Body's eating, the eyes' seeing will be the Body's seeing, and the ears' hearing will be the Body's hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>One member receiving something is the Body receiving something.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>No matter which brother or sister, as long as one receives something, the whole Body receives it.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>We have to see that the Body life is not just a matter of corporate living, but a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If we do not touch the reality, the church will merely be a doctrine, the Body will merely be an illustration, and we will not receive any supply.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Brothers and sisters, we have to remember that we are members of the Body, and we are all one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>We are not alone.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Paul said, "And whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it" 1 Cor 12:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Was he speaking vain words, or is this a reality?</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Paul was a person who had Body-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>If he had not touched the reality of the Body, he could not have said such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>May God grant us to touch the source, and may He grant us to touch reality, so that we can supply the church in a spontaneous way.</S>
