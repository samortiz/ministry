<p>A Christ that is produced by our own imagination cannot help us, and a Christ that others tell us about cannot help us either. A big problem in the church is that many people receive their Christ from others' teaching; they say something because others are saying it. This knowledge is useless. This does not mean that the church should not preach. But it means that the kind of knowledge that is passed on from one mouth to another and from one ear to another is useless. If we do not have light from the Father who is in the heavens, and if all the light we have is handed down to us through others, we will be shaken when others are shaken. It is spiritually useless to have doctrines without revelation. What is a doctrine? A doctrine is something that flesh and blood reveal to us; it is something that exists apart from God's light and apart from any direct communication with the Lord. Anything that comes from flesh and blood, that requires the mind to remember and the intellect to understand, is a doctrine. We have to remember that the doctrine of Christ will not save us; we stand because God has revealed this Christ to us and we have received Him. The inward revelation that results in an inward knowledge of the Lord cannot be shaken by anything.</p><p>After Peter answered the Lord, saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God," the Lord said that Peter was blessed, because his declaration was not the result of revelation by flesh and blood, but from a revelation of the Father who is in the heavens. The Lord Jesus was not satisfied with right answers from man. He was after answers that were based on revelation. The worth of an answer is based on revelation. It is easy for a person to tell someone that Jesus is the Son of God. When you ask the second person who Jesus is, he may be able to tell you readily that Jesus is the Son of God. But if his answer is not based on revelation, it is worthless.</p><p>Anything the church says must be based on revelation; otherwise, it will not have any spiritual value. Without revelation, there is no knowledge. All those who genuinely know the Lord recognize this fact. If a church lacks revelation, it only has teachings, and it is doomed to failure. A teaching is something that is passed on from one man's mouth to another's, and then to a third's. The result of this passing on is that whatever a man learns, he passes on the same thing to others. The only things that these ones have are based on teachings handed down by others, and not based on revelation. This is the reason for the church's failure. We do not despise preaching. We pay a great deal of attention to preaching. Yet preaching cannot replace God's revelation. God wants us to have revelation and to speak according to our revelation. For example, Philip was sent by the Lord to the way of the wilderness, and he preached Jesus to a eunuch. When they came to a place with water, the eunuch asked to be baptized. "And Philip said, If you believe from all your heart, you will be saved. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God" (Acts 8:37). Philip then baptized the eunuch. Some people may try to imitate Philip's work. They may speak to others about Jesus being the Son of God for half an hour, after which they ask their listener, "Do you believe that Jesus is the Son of God?" If the other one says yes, they baptize him. If you asked why they do this, they would say, "Philip did this; therefore, this is scriptural." It is true that they may be saying the same thing, but we have to ask what is the basis for their speaking. Some base their speaking on revelation. This speaking will penetrate others' hearts. Others do not base their speaking on revelation. This speaking will impart only words to others. If your speaking is based on revelation, not only will you be speaking, but the Father and the Holy Spirit will be speaking as well. When this happens, the word will enter into others. Otherwise, others may be able to repeat word for word that Jesus is the Son of God, but what they say is only letters. Just because Philip did something once does not mean that we can do it now. This is outward imitation; it is not Christianity. The basis of Christianity is inward revelation and inward knowledge. Anything that comes by the way of teaching and imitation is not Christianity.</p><p>The foundation of the church is revelation. Where there is revelation, there is life. We were not saved by taking doctrine as life. In the same way, after we are saved, we cannot replace life with doctrine. If a man has merely received a doctrine without being enlightened, if he has only acquired a doctrine without acquiring Christ, he does not have life yet. After a man is saved, how should we help him and lead him on? Should we just ask how much teaching he has received, without checking if he has received any revelation from the Lord? The reason for the church's weakness, failure, and desolation is that it has paid too much attention to doctrines and has not paid any attention to revelation. There are too many teachings which are simply passed on from one person to another; they do not contain any inward revelation. How can the church not be weak this way?</p>
