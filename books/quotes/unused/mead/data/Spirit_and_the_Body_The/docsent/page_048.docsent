   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GRACE WITH OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Grace be with you."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Galatians 6:18 and Philemon 25 both say, "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Right now the Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in our spirit, and grace, the full enjoyment of the riches of the Lord, is also in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are inwardly strengthened just by saying these words.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you do not believe it, I ask you to try it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As you are about to lose your temper, say, "Grace be with my spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This grace will kill your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Grace is the life-giving Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many of us are still very much under the influence of the religion of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have heard so many teachings about various things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But I have learned one thing to be a good eater.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because I have excellent metabolism, I do not gain weight, although I eat very well.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>My point here is this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not tell me to do certain things, for I only need to eat the proper food.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Forget those religious teachings about doing this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead, eat Jesus and enjoy grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not try to deal with your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One word is sufficient: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To this, we all must say, "Amen!"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you practice this, you will know wonderful victory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all need to say "The grace of the Lord Jesus be with my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Two things are very real.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first is grace, and the second is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is something in the universe called grace, and there is something within us called the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible says that grace is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the universe, there is grace; and within us, there is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hallelujah, this grace is now in our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If this were not such a wonderful matter, why would the Apostle Paul repeat it again and again, saying that grace is with our spirit, or that grace is with us?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not vain talk or vain words.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I was in Christianity for years, but no one ever told me such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, they taught me to honor my parents, and I did my best to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No one told me that there is something in the universe called grace and something within me called my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But after many years I learned through experience that grace is with my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This grace that is with our spirit is simply the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The all-inclusive Spirit has been born into our spirit, and we have been born of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now we are one spirit with Him, and He is within us as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The supply, the support, and the enjoyment are all with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE REAL CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In every chapter of the book of Ephesians there is a verse concerning the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our spirit is wonderful because it is indwelt by the Spirit and is one with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, it is the mingled spirit, our spirit joined to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to Ephesians 1:17, this spirit is the spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we would know the book of Ephesians, we need such a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Ephesians 2:22 indicates that today God's habitation, the church, is in our spirit, and Ephesians 3:5 says that the revelation of the mystery hidden in God can be revealed to us only in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Ephesians 4:23 says that we must be renewed in the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to this verse, our spirit spreads into our mind and becomes the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By this spirit we are being renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Ephesians 5:18 we are told to be filled in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our physical body may be filled with wine, but we do not desire this kind of filling.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Instead, we need to be filled in our spirit with the wonderful, all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Finally, Ephesians 6:18 says that we must pray at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we put all these verses together, we shall see what the real Christian life is.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is to recognize that our spirit is indwelt by the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must restrict ourselves to the spirit and do everything from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The life-giving Spirit indwells our spirit to be our Christian life.</S>
