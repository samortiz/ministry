<h1 class="title">THE WONDERFUL PERSON JESUS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: February 9, 1972</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 15:47; 1 Tim. 2:5; Heb. 2:6, 9; Matt. 4:3-4; 26:63-64; Acts 7:55-56; John 1:51; 5:27; Rom. 5:17, 19</h1>
<h2 class="head1">JESUS BEING A WONDERFUL PERSON</h2>
<p>The Bible shows that the first man, Adam, failed. He failed because he did not take God in; that is, he did not eat of the tree of life. Instead, he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 3:1-7). This tree signifies Satan as the source of death, just as the tree of life signifies God as the source of life. God wanted Adam to contact Him, but instead, he contacted Satan and took in the wrong element.</p>
<p>After the first man failed, God did not forsake His eternal purpose. God never gives up on what He has ordained. What God ordains will be accomplished. Thus, at the fullness of the time, God in the Son came as the second man (Gal. 4:4).</p>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; Everyone knows that the One who became flesh is Jesus. God became flesh. This is truly a wonderful matter. However, unbelievers and even many in Christianity, including theologians, do not have a clear understanding of this matter. This matter is so mysterious that it is incomprehensible to the fallen human mind. It is not a concept that comes naturally to the human mind. Nevertheless, I must say that God became flesh. This is a great matter in human history.</p>
<p>God become flesh when He was born of a virgin. The prophecy of Isaiah in the Old Testament clearly says, &ldquo;Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel&rdquo; (7:14). <em>Immanuel</em> means &ldquo;God with us.&rdquo; The son spoken of in this verse is very wonderful; He is a man, yet He is God; He is God, yet He put on flesh. He is God with man; this is Jesus.</p>
<p>The Bible certainly presents Jesus as a wonderful person; even history testifies that Jesus is a wonderful person. In human history there has never been a person as wonderful as Jesus. Every nation, even atheistic nations that oppose Him, regard the year of Christ&rsquo;s birth as the beginning of a new era. The Chinese know that the first year of an emperor&rsquo;s rule establishes the start of a new era and indicates that China, during that era, belongs to that emperor. Currently, the whole world is in an era based on the year of Jesus&rsquo; birth. Even nations that are against God and resist Jesus unknowingly acknowledge that they belong to Christ. Jesus is so wonderful. Even though some may oppose Him, they still acknowledge Him.</p>
<p>When Joseph Stalin was the leader of the Soviet Union, which was strongly opposing God, he was served by a military marshal named Beria, who was responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people. When Stalin died, Beria lost a power struggle, and he was discharged from service and executed. In 1953 I saw a newspaper report that contained a picture of his execution. According to the report, when Beria was taken to the place of his execution, he was granted one request. Incredibly, he asked for a Bible and began to pray. This shows that even those who profess to oppose Jesus still acknowledge Him in some way or another. Last year I went to Chicago and stayed at an American brother&rsquo;s home. He had a booklet concerning the repentance and conversion of Nikita Khrushchev, who eventually succeeded Stalin. I was amazed that Khrushchev, the one who dealt with Beria, heard the gospel and repented of his sins.</p>
<p>Saul of Tarsus resisted the Lord Jesus and was devoted to binding all who called upon the name of the Lord Jesus. One day, as he went from Jerusalem and drew near to Damascus, the Lord Jesus appeared to him and said, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; And He said, &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you persecute&rdquo; (Acts 9:4-5). Saul thought that he was persecuting only the followers of Jesus, such as Stephen, but the Lord said that Saul was persecuting the Lord because the Lord Jesus and His believers had become one great person. After the Lord Jesus appeared to Saul of Tarsus, he became a believer and an apostle. Jesus is indeed a wonderful person.</p>
<p>Isaiah 7:14 says, &ldquo;Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel.&rdquo; Verse 6 of chapter 9 says, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; / ...And His name will be called / ...Mighty God, / Eternal Father.&rdquo; The baby who was in the manger in Bethlehem was the mighty God. He was a Son born of man, yet He was also the eternal Father. He is the Son, yet He is the Father. This is truly wonderful. Our Lord Jesus is such a wonderful One. He is the second man. Regrettably, most of the speaking in Christianity regarding the Lord Jesus relates to His status as God; seldom is there speaking regarding His status as a man. Although Christians confess that the Lord Jesus came into the world as a man to be our Savior, the depths of this confession are rarely considered.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
