<h2 class=head2>B. The Reward of the New Testament Overcomers</h2><h2 class=head3>1. At the End of the Church Age</h2><p>The believers may be overcomers either as the man-child (the dead overcomers—Rev. 12:5) or as the firstfruits (the living overcomers—Rev. 14:4). The dead overcomers of both the Old Testament and the New Testament will resurrect and be raptured to God and to His throne to fight and defeat Satan before the period of the great tribulation. The living overcomers, comprised only of the New Testament overcomers, will be the firstfruit of God’s harvest on the earth. They will be raptured to Mount Zion in the heavens for God and Christ’s satisfaction before the great tribulation.<p>All the overcomers, both the dead and the living, will be the bride at the marriage feast of Christ and in the millennium (Rev. 19:7-9; 21:2). The overcomers will also be the armies in heaven fighting with the coming Christ against the Antichrist and his armies (Rev. 17:12-14; 19:11-21).<h2 class=head3>2. In the Age of the Millennium</h2><p>In the coming kingdom the overcoming believers will reign with Christ as co-kings (Rev. 20:4). This includes being crowned with many crowns such as the crown of righteousness (2 Tim. 4:8), the unfading crown of glory (1 Pet. 5:4), the crown of life (Rev. 2:10), and an incorruptible crown (1 Cor. 9:25). This also means that they will sit with Christ on His throne (Rev. 3:21) having authority over the nations to shepherd them (Rev. 2:26-27; 12:5), and to participate in the joy of the Lord (Matt. 25:21, 23).<p>They also will inherit the kingdom of Christ and of God to enter the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens (Eph. 5:5), to be glorified with Christ (Rom. 8:17), to inherit eternal life in the Millennium (Matt. 19:29), to have their names remain in the book of life (Rev. 3:5), to not be hurt of the second death (Rev. 2:11), to have the right to the tree of life (Rev. 2:7), to shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father (Matt. 13:43), to participate in the feast of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 8:11), and to enjoy the reward (Matt. 5:11). Finally, they will become the New Jerusalem—the paradise of God—in the millennium (Rev. 3:12; 2:7). This list of rewards should give all of us much aspiration and encouragement to be overcomers in the age of the church.<h2 class=head1>III. THE IMMATURE BELIEVERS WILL BE PERFECTED IN THE AGE OF THE MILLENNIUM</h2><p>[The need for transformation is neglected by many Christians today. As a result, many have been kept from being transformed and perfected by the genuine experience and enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ with His unsearchable riches. As a result, there is no way for God to perfect these immature believers in the church age. However, because they are God’s chosen, redeemed, called, and regenerated people, God will not let them go. Rather, He will perfect them in the coming age of the millennium.]<h2 class=head2>A. Through the Lord’s Dispensational and Governmental Discipline</h2><p>[The perfecting of the immature believers in the age of the millennium will be through the Lord’s dispensational and governmental discipline. Hebrews 12:6 tells us, “Whom the Lord loves He disciplines and scourges every son whom He receives.’’ The Lord’s discipline of the believers is not only in this age but also in the coming age. Because the age of the millennium will still belong to the old heaven and the old earth, the coming age will still be a time for the Father to deal with His children so that they may be perfected. Those believers who are not perfected in the church age will be perfected in the age of the millennium. The means of their perfection will be the Lord’s dispensational and governmental discipline. This discipline will be for those who were slothful in the church age, in the dispensation of grace, and did not apply the Lord’s sufficient grace and enjoy it, taking this grace as their portion. Such believers will need the Lord’s loving discipline in the coming age for their perfection.]
