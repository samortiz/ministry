   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE RENEWING OF THE INNER MAN Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:6, 17-18; 4:7-8, 14-16; 12:9 THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST AS OUR PORTION IN SECOND CORINTHIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians is a foundation for the book of 2 Corinthians; therefore, 2 Corinthians is much deeper than 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians shows us that Christ is our divine portion 1 Cor 1:2, 9, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He has been given to us as wisdom, including righteousness for us to be justified and regenerated, sanctification for us to be transformed and brought into a full realization of Christ, and redemption for us to be redeemed or transfigured in our body 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ has been made such a portion to us as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 that we may contact Him through and by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are one spirit with Him 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now He is waiting for us to enjoy Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These are the basic points mentioned in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These points concerning Christ are the foundation for Paul to build upon in the second book.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This foundation is Christ 1 Cor 3:10-11 not only as our Savior, Master, and Lord but also as the portion given to us by God as wisdom, including righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we look into the contents of 2 Corinthians, we must keep in mind the foundation given in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second Corinthians 3:6 says, "For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, "And the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit here refers to the Spirit in verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord is the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 18 continues, "And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Spirit may be considered a compound title indicating strongly that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Lord Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 2 Corinthians 4:7, the treasure is mentioned: "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ as the Spirit, the Lord Spirit, mentioned in 3:17-18, is our treasure, our unsearchably rich portion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How do we enjoy Christ as the treasure within us?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We enjoy Christ by being in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even this word may be a doctrine to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The condition among many in Christianity is not very powerful because there is too much knowledge apart from the living Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This knowledge distracts people from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's intention is not to give His chosen people doctrines, teachings, or gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's intention is to give His chosen people the living Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>GOD'S INTENTION FOR US TO LIVE BY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As human beings, before we were regenerated, we were born and raised by our parents to live by ourselves, that is, by the life in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some of us lived in a good way and others lived in a rather poor way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regardless of whether our living was good or bad, we lived by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We lived by the self, the fallen soul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be saved means that we experienced God's salvation which is Christ Himself, and Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's salvation is Christ Himself with redemption, forgiveness, justification, regeneration, and many other items.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Things such as redemption and forgiveness are not salvation itself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Salvation is a living Person Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After we are saved, we have two things within our being our self and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Following our being saved, God's intention is that we live absolutely not by ourselves anymore, but by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is simple in teaching or doctrine, but it is not so simple in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many teachings in Christianity focus on different aspects of human life, yet neglect the central aspect of living by Christ Phil 1:21a .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our real need today is to live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are honest and faithful, we have to admit that we do not live by Christ from morning to evening.</S>
