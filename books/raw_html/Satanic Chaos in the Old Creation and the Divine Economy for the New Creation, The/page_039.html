<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. NOT DISAPPOINTED OR DISCOURAGED<br>BUT STRENGTHENED AND ENABLED TO STAND FOR<br>AND LIVE OUT THE DIVINE ECONOMY</H2><P>The overcomers are those who suffer the chaos, but they are not disappointed or discouraged. Instead, they are strengthened and enabled to stand for and live out the divine economy. The satanic chaos is still going on around us in Christendom. Even within the Lord's recovery, we have experienced this chaos. Beginning in 1987 some among us rebelled against the recovery. Because of this rebellion, there are some divisions existing in the United States. All of us have to conquer this destructive chaos. If we are enabled by the Lord to conquer all the destructive chaos, we will triumphantly enter into the kingdom. We will be those who triumph in the unique constructive economy.</P><P>Romans 16:17 says that we need to mark those who make divisions and turn away from them. To turn away from those who make divisions is to conquer the destructive chaos. This preserves the oneness of the Body of Christ that we may have a normal church life. Those who make divisions like to contact the saints, and this contact causes the saints to be stumbled and leave the church life. If we open to these ones to listen to their divisive talk, we might be poisoned. This poison will cause us to doubt about the recovery and will weaken our morale for the recovery. We will be cold about attending the church meetings and about reading the Recovery Version with the Life-study Messages. If we contact and open to these dissenting ones, we will be cooled down. At the very least, they will make us lukewarm. In the Life-study of Second Timothy, we pointed out that the subject of this book is the inoculation against the decline of the church. We need such an inoculation to preserve us against the germs of the satanic chaos of rebellion and division.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. TO CONQUER ALL THE SATANIC CHAOS<br>AND CARRY OUT THE UNIQUE DIVINE ECONOMY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By the Processed and Consummated<br>Triune God as the All-sufficient Grace</H2><P>We have to conquer the satanic chaos by the processed and consummated Triune God as the all-sufficient grace (1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 12:9; 2 Tim. 4:22). In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul said that the grace of the Lord was with him; in Galatians 6:18 he said that the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is with our spirit; and in 2 Timothy 4:22 he said that the Lord is with our spirit. The Lord as the all-sufficient grace is with our spirit, and we can conquer all the satanic chaos and carry out the unique divine economy by Him as our all-sufficient grace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. According to the Truth, of Which the Church,<br>the Manifestation of God in the Flesh,<br>Is the Pillar and Base</H2><P>We can conquer all the satanic chaos and carry out the divine economy according to the truth, of which the church, the manifestation of God in the flesh, is the pillar and base (1 Tim. 3:15-16). The rebellious ones cannot shake the church in the Lord's recovery, because the church is the pillar and base of the truth. The pillar supports the building, and the base holds the pillar. The church is the pillar supporting the truth, and the base holding the truth. Because the church is the pillar and base of the truth, we need to be those who teach the truth. Our teaching of the truth will enlighten the darkened people, inoculate against the poison, swallow up the death, and bring the distracted back to the proper track.</P>
