        <h2 class="head1">MEETING WITHOUT FORMALITY AND<br />
PRAYING MORE TO RELEASE THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We also need to change the way that we meet. When we speak of the way we meet, we are referring not only to certain practices but also to the substance of our meetings. Since we do not release our spirit in prayer and we focus more on messages than the flowing of the spirit, our meetings have gradually become a formality. Every meeting has regulations or is conducted in a set way. The message meeting has a set way, the prayer meeting has another way, and the bread-breaking meeting has yet another way. Everyone is familiar with the ways to conduct the meetings. The meetings are orderly and have become a routine; hence, we seldom exercise our spirit. The saints listen to messages and rarely exercise their spirit. Even in the bread-breaking meeting and the prayer meeting, they rarely exercise their spirit. They merely keep the regulations for that particular meeting. This is a serious situation.</p>
<p>The co-workers must rise up to turn this situation. We must detest formality and the lack of the exercise of the spirit. We must be released in our spirit so that we release our spirit in the meetings. Then we can lead the saints to not be bound by traditional rules but to release their spirit. For example, the procedure in the prayer meeting is as follows: At 7:30 P.M. a brother calls a hymn for us to sing. Then another brother announces the items for prayer, after which we begin to pray. We should tell the saints to reject this procedure. For convenience, it is right to decide the day and the time of a meeting. We may decide that the prayer meeting should be on Tuesday from 7:30 to 9:00 in the evening. However, some saints may arrive before 7:30, others at 7:30, and still others at a later time; this does not matter. Those who arrive first should exercise their spirit and begin to pray. They do not have to wait until 7:30 before beginning to pray. Perhaps everyone will pray individually, but at a certain time, they should pray corporately. The saints who need to leave early can do so, while those who are burdened may continue praying. This kind of meeting has been delivered from regulations and allows the Holy Spirit to move in a living way.</p>
<p>We have fallen short of being living and have offended God in this matter. Since it is difficult for us to release our spirit, the gifted members have not been manifested in the meetings. The meetings are for the release of the spirit, but they have become a formality that causes the spirit to be bound. When three to five brothers pray together before the meeting, they exercise their spirit, but when the meeting begins, their spirit is bound, and they fall into regulations. We must overturn this situation of having formal meetings so that the meetings can cause the saints to be released. Regardless of what the saints do, we must be released. Our spirit must not be bound in the meetings. We should not sit quietly, looking around at the saints. We should come to the meetings in order to exercise and release our spirit. Then the meetings will be a real help to us. We must not allow the meetings to be bound by formality.</p>
<p>The bread-breaking meeting is another example. First we sing a hymn, and then we pray. We should not have this formal regulation. It may be that the meeting does not begin with a hymn; rather, the saints simply praise and pray until everyone&rsquo;s spirit is released. Then when the meeting has reached its climax, the bread and the cup are passed. This does not mean that we should intentionally try to do something different. My desire is that we would see that our situation is abnormal. The meetings, which should lead the saints to release their spirit, have deteriorated to the extent that the saints are bound. All the activities in the meetings have fallen on the shoulders of a few responsible saints who reluctantly try to meet the need. This situation must change.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:25 says, &ldquo;Not abandoning our own assembling together,&rdquo; but it does not give a procedure for Christian meetings. Should we sing hymns first or pray first? When should we read the Scriptures, and when should we give testimonies? We cannot find any procedures in the Acts or in the Epistles. The New Testament does not give such regulations. The Lord wants us to break bread in remembrance of Him, and He wants us to first break the bread and then drink the cup. But He did not give us a procedure for breaking the bread. He did not say how many prayers we should offer or how many hymns we should sing. He did not give any procedures. We cannot find a portion of the Bible that says how the apostles gave messages. The basic reason for such an omission is that in the New Testament age everything is of the Spirit, not of the letter or of forms.</p>
<p>We dare not say that the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting is altogether according to the Bible. Of course, neither can we say that it is not according to the Bible. However, if we continue to follow our present practice, this meeting will develop into a form, which kills the spirit. Every meeting in the New Testament age must be in spirit, not in rituals. Therefore, we must educate the saints so that every time they come to a meeting, they would serve in their spirit. It does not matter what kind of meeting they attend, they must release their spirit.</p>
<p>In order to lead the saints to exercise their spirit, the co-workers must exercise their spirit. We must spend more time to pray with an exercised spirit. We have spent a great amount of time to study the truth and to develop the work, but we have not spent an adequate amount of time to pray. The amount of time spent in individual prayer has been inadequate, and the amount of time spent praying with other co-workers has also been inadequate. Hence, our spirit is poor, weak, and dry, and we are short of the spirit in the work and in the meetings. As a result, the meetings are formal, and the work lacks vitality. May the Lord wake us up to make this turn so that we would be released and have the supply of the spirit in the work and in the meetings.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
