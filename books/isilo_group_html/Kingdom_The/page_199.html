The church is composed of the regenerated persons who are saved and separated from the world. Among the Christians, some are overcomers, but many are not. The overcomers will have been fully transformed by the time the Lord comes back. Because they have been living in the present reality of the kingdom, they will be transferred into the manifestation of the kingdom to enjoy the marriage feast and reign with Christ in the millennium.</P><P>Many Christians, however, will not have been transformed by that time. They will have to be dealt with during the time of the millennium so that they also can be transformed. Such defeated Christians will have to settle their accounts with the Lord. They will suffer a loss and a kind of punishment from the Lord. The false Christians, the tares, will be bound and thrown into the fire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GENTILES</H2><P>Now we need to see how the Lord will deal with the nations, the peoples, and the Jews at His second coming. Let us read Joel 3:2: "I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land." This verse indicates that the Lord Jesus will gather all the nations and bring them down. This will include even the armies of the Antichrist in the future. Verses 9 and 12 go on to say: "Proclaim ye this among the nations; prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up...Let the nations be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about" (lit.). These verses indicate that, at the time of the Lord's coming back, the nations will be stirred up to attack Jerusalem. According to their realization they will gather to attack Jerusalem, but in God's purpose, they will be gathered there to be judged. Zechariah 12:2-4 says, "Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling unto all the peoples round about, and upon Judah also shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples; all that burden themselves with it shall be sore wounded; and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it. In that day, saith Jehovah, I will smite every horse with terror and his rider with madness; and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the peoples with blindness" (ASV). These verses also show us that when the Lord Jesus comes back, the nations will be gathered to attack Jerusalem. At that time the Lord Jesus will come down from the air to defeat and destroy them. At the same time a wonderful and gracious thing will also occur. This is covered in verse 10: "And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn."</P><P>The Lord Jesus will return at the very time Antichrist will have gathered all his armies to attack Jerusalem. The Jews will be under siege by the armies of the Antichrist and will have no way of escape. But the Lord Jesus will appear, smite all the besieging armies, and pour out His Spirit upon the Jewish people. All of the house of Judah will repent and mourn, weeping because of their rebellion against Christ. They will realize that He was the one whom they crucified and pierced on the cross. They will repent and receive Him as their Savior. Thus, by His descending, the Lord Jesus will accomplish two things: He will smite all of the armies of the nations, and He will deliver all of the repenting and believing Jewish people. According to Zechariah 14:3-4, when the Lord Jesus returns to rescue the Jewish people, His feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives. When the Lord Jesus was ascending, the angel told His disciples: "This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven" (Acts 1:11). Since He ascended from the Mount of Olives, He will also return to the Mount of Olives. When the Lord Jesus stands with His feet on the Mount of Olives, the mountain will be cleft and a highway will be opened for the besieged Jewish people to escape. If you are an overcomer, you will be there with the Lord.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_198.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_200.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Kingdom &nbsp; pg 199</div><br></body></html>
