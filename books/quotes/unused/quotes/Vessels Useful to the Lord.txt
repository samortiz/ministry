Whereas God's divinity, His very nature, is what God is, His divine characteristics are the outward manifestation of His nature
Heaven, earth, and all things manifest God's divine characteristics, but they do not express God's person, nature, or image
The Bible shows us that before the Lord became a man, the heavens, the earth, and all things manifested God's divine characteristics
According to Colossians 2:9, all the fullness of the Godhead, the deity, was expressed in the Lord Jesus bodily
The second and third stanzas of this hymn are based on the gospel messages that Paul gave in Acts 14 and 17 respectively
In Acts 17 Paul spoke in a deeper and more logical way saying that God made the world and all things and gives life and breath to all people
The Lord Jesus Himself lived out the person, image, being, and divinity of the invisible God, the God who hides Himself
The first stanza of this hymn concerns the divine characteristics, and the fourth stanza concerns the divine nature
The divine characteristics were manifested through creation, but the divine nature was expressed through the Lord Jesus
God infinite, in eternity, / Yet man in time, finite to be; / O Christ, who is God's embodiment, / God is mingled with man-what good news!
His desire was that He would create man and enter into man, not only to be united with man but also to be mingled with man
Both Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3 tell us that God's word is not only for us to speak to others but also for us to sing to others
Sometimes during a meeting a saint will choose a hymn from the hymnal and ask everyone to sing it in order to fill up the time
In this gospel campaign we will also use Hymns,987, which is an excellent gospel hymn written by the American evangelist J
The modernists said that the Lord Jesus was not God, that His death had not been for redemption, and that He had not been resurrected
To learn how to write hymns, we need three things-the knowledge of the truth, the experience of life, and some attainment in literature
It is not necessary for us to be highly educated in literature, but we should at least have a certain measure of literary attainment
Stanza 4 speaks about man's sense of vanity and emptiness, and stanza 5 speaks about man's experience of joy and satisfaction
On the other hand, stanza 5 is the climax of this hymn on the positive side, describing the human life of vanity being turned into song
The Lord Jesus said that every good tree produces good fruit and that a tree is proven by the fruit it produces
More than thirty years have passed since the training began, and now we can see the fruit of the labor of these co-workers
In a sense, the work on the island of Taiwan has not gained much profit or made much progress during the ten years from 1975 to 1985
By the Lord's grace the co-workers have not brought the churches into disgrace or decline, but neither have they made much progress
The more educated a person is, however, the more he feels that he is inadequate and needs to learn more aggressively
The church in Taipei has over ten thousand saints and over three thousand of them regularly attend meetings in the twentyone halls in Taipei
Not only has there been no increase in Taipei, but the number of saints has actually decreased by five percent
We were like those doing research in a laboratory, trying to find a new way that was according to the Scriptures
The only reason they come is because of the strong ministry of the word and the transmission of the rich truths
One of Wesley's contemporaries, George Whitefield, who was considered to be more powerful than him, preached in the open fields
Sometimes when a mother finds that her little boy is being naughty, instead of spanking him, she will read him a story
Once the boy begins to listen to the story, he calms down, behaves properly, becomes obedient, and stops being naughty
The truths and the riches given to us by the Lord have all been released, but they have been put on the shelves and are not being used
Rather, it means that you will know how to use the Lord's word, how to study the truth, and how to preach the word
You should not be loose in any way during your first five years of fulltime service because these are the most crucial years of your service
Although those of you who are serving full time have already graduated from college, you are still under thirty years of age
You must treasure this period of time and endeavor to enter into the truth and to learn the experiences in life
In the United States over one hundred churches with over ten thousand saints have been raised up since the Lord's recovery began there
The author, who wrote the book in 1977, put numerous false statements, false accusations, and slanderous words against us in the book
As a result, some of the parents of our younger saints were concerned that their children had joined a deceptive organization
When a physician certifies that a young person is mentally abnormal the parents can hire people to force their children to be deprogrammed
A couple hired some people to seize their son, who was studying at a medical school in Texas, for 'deprogramming'
The author fabricated lies about us and slandered us to such an extent that we were like poisonous snakes and fierce beasts in people's eyes
The book damaged us to the extent that some of the brothers and sisters experienced hardship at their jobs and were even fired
After this book was published, we wrote hundreds of letters to the publisher, asking for an opportunity to clarify the situation
He had no choice because otherwise he would have been killed, and there would have been no way for the Lord's word to be completed
Today it is as if we are driving a car on the road, but someone has put some obstacles in the middle of the road to frustrate our progress
He did this not merely to file a complaint but to ask for help, because the Jewish officials were corrupt and unrighteous
Festus, wanting to gain favor with the Jews, asked Paul if he would be willing to go up to Jerusalem and be judged there
After conferring with the council, Festus had no choice but to say, 'To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go'
Like Paul, we were being greatly persecuted and felt quite helpless, so we had no choice but to 'appeal to Caesar'
Of all, we would have to pursue the lawsuits to their end, even if this required us to pour out everything we had financially
They would be the ones who would go out to collect evidence within the limits allowed by the law and in a definite way
Due to the large number of cases that were being presented in the American law courts we had to wait five years before the trial could start
The judge enumerated in a clear way the violations that our opposing party had committed and decided that we had won the case
Over twenty years ago he published the Encyclopedia of American Religions, which has a paragraph concerning us
While he was planning to publish a revised and enlarged edition, the two slanderous books against us were published
He was a supporter of that organization, but as a scholar, he believes that the goal of a writer should be to make a contribution to society
We must realize that the highest, most fundamental, and proper theology in Christianity is the Brethren theology
The top two seminaries in the United States today are Dallas Theological Seminary and Moody Theological School in Chicago
Melton because he was able to find out by reading my books that our theology is according to the Brethren theology
It has a wealth of talent and an abundance of seminaries with many theological professors and people with doctorate degrees
In the beginning he stood on the ground of an opposer, but after reading our books he turned around completely
Although the earth itself cannot be improved, other things such as the means of transportation on the earth can be improved
Today when we come to study the Bible, if we do not know how to use advanced methods to study it, we will fall behind and become out-of-date
In the Lords recovery we have already had a very good beginning and have laid a very good foundation all of which will be a big help to you
In the villages, however, it may not be that easy to preach the gospel due to the people's shortage of knowledge and lack of understanding
If you are short of the knowledge of the truth, it will be impossible for you to preach the gospel on the campuses effectively
During the training you should do your best to attend the church meetings, particularly the small group meetings
You have already been trained for a year and should be able to speak better and more strongly than the saints who have not been trained
In other words, we are like a team that cannot take the field to compete because we are not up to the standard
Food, clothing, housing, and transportation are the great necessities of life, but the most crucial necessity is food
It does not matter that much if a person's clothing is a little shabby or if his house leaks a little when it rains
The fact that our numbers are not multiplying is eighty percent due to the scarcity of food among us and to our inability to feed people
By practicing carpentry under a master carpenter from his youth, he can gain experience and eventually become a master himself
According to my general observation, the fate of the small group depends entirely upon the ministry of the word
Now, after the change of system, we have small group meetings with small numbers of people, and no one knows how to meet in this way
You can also use the Bible to open the meeting by leading everyone to read the verses related to the content being pursued for the week
Today you may be still learning how to serve full time, but this does not excuse you from knowing how to meet in the group meetings
Perhaps some would say that when they were serving full time in the past, they learned to serve in a different way
If the chairs in a hall are not being cleaned, this is an indication that the elders do not know how to lead the saints
If the elders cannot find people to wipe the windows or set up the chairs, then they should invite the saints to a love feast
To take care of services such as ushering and cleaning the meeting hall, we only need to prepare a few love feasts for the saints
We cannot simply invite a few saints over for a meal and then ask them to teach and expect them to know how to teach
If we have nothing with which to supply them and no food to feed them, then we should not blame them if they do not come back the next time
If someone does not lead the meeting in a good way, then when the brothers and sisters come to the meeting, they will not know what to do
If we appointed only two people, then the others would get offended and would not come to the meeting for one or two months
Some would even question the elders as to why they were letting a person be responsible who was less qualified than they
When this kind of person comes to the meeting, he spontaneously helps the brothers and sisters and supplies the meeting
When you go to a small group meeting, you should not have the intention or the attitude that you are there to teach
You should have only one real burden-to be a saint attending the small group meeting and learning to lead the small group meeting
You should not set out with the intention to teach the saints, but you should take the opportunity to educate them when you have the chance
You could even teach the head of the household how to open up his home and how to receive the saints when they come
After the contact, you may arrange to have a meal with him for fellowship before the next meeting and to attend the group meeting together
In your church life no service should conflict with the meetings because the church meetings are the full-timers' work
If you perfect one person every six months, then after five or ten years you will have borne fruit a hundredfold
Do not dream of becoming a great evangelist who holds campaigns and leads hundreds of thousands of people to be saved
Generally speaking, this is because no one knows what to do, and due to our complacency, everyone simply lets the time go by week after week
If his coach were to box in a competition, he would not box in exactly the same manner as he boxes while practicing
A word can be interpreted many ways, and one needs to make the best judgment based upon the context and logic of the facts
In the beginning the Lord created only one couple, but the issue of this one couple has been a continual multiplication and increase
Regardless of whether we are serving with the junior high, high school, or college students, the first goal should be to get people saved
Following a person's salvation, we should not bring him to the meeting hall to mop the floor or wipe the windows
These newly saved ones, because they are students, should be encouraged only to endeavor to preach the gospel to get others saved
We need to lead them to come together to break bread and teach them to understand what the breaking of bread is and what its significance is
If we are so accommodating, then as we go on, what seemed like a slight error in the beginning will result in a big mistake in the end
These kinds of words, along with the melody used for this hymn, will surely touch the young people, but the truth is lacking
Paying attention only to outward ways in order to stir up people may not be wrong, but it also may not be very good
If we depend only on these ways, our work will be like a castle built in the air-something empty, vain, and without a foundation
He saw that the Bible was turned to Psalm 1, and after reading it two or three times, he was captured by the Lord's word and was moved
To use a hymn at the beginning of a meeting and then to sow the seeds of the truth along with it is acceptable
For the preaching of the gospel we must spend time and energy to get into the truth to have thorough prayer and to labor in the Lords word
Throughout the ages the Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations have all paid great attention to this matter
Even though many matters in the Catholic Church have been confused, this matter of bread-breaking is still highly regarded
We need to bring a person to the bread-breaking meeting, preferably at the meeting hall on the first Lord's Day following his baptism
If in the long run he cannot go to the meeting hall that often, then we should find a place for him to break bread according to his need
It would be marvelous if there could be a home near each campus so that we could have the breaking of bread with ten or fifteen people
My dissatisfaction with the co-workers is that they are too rigid in their work and do not know how to be flexible
The Lord Jesus said, 'For the sons of this age are more prudent in their dealings with their own generation than the sons of light'
In South America, Brazil also has fifty to sixty churches now, and in Central America there are one hundred churches
Dear saints, we must be those who 'bring life to a dying business' and not be those who 'bring death to a thriving business'
For a meeting to be considered a part of the church life we do not have to bring the saints to the meeting hall
In this way the students who break bread in the homes will be specifically cared for as well as properly perfected
Do not focus only on the numbers, and do not say that everyone who is saved must come and meet in the meeting hall
The elders should not care whether or not the full-timers bring the students to the Lord's table at the meeting hall
It should be one hour at most, with fifteen minutes for singing and bread-breaking and then forty-five minutes for a message and sharing
You all have studied in school, and you know that regardless of how much your parents love you, they cannot study for you
The Western missionaries were called the 'big devils,' and the Chinese who received Christianity were called the 'second devils'
Not only so, the majority of those who received the Lord were mostly laborers, unskilled laborers, and the poor
We hope that on the whole island of Taiwan five hundred young people would begin to serve full time every year
In Taiwan, the United States, and Southeast Asia, there has been an urgent and pressing call for a better translation of the New Testament
Even someone who is knowledgeable and well-versed in Chinese, English, and Greek may not necessarily do a good job
To translate the Bible requires a substantial knowledge of the truth and also a great deal of careful consideration
Concerning the letter of the Bible, the Old Testament was written in Hebrew and the New Testament was written in Greek
The biblical truths in the Old Testament are not hard to understand, but those in the New Testament are altogether in the heavenly realm
When we were working on the English New Testament Recovery Version, we did not depart too much from the King James Version
We did our best to preserve its style and use its phrases, clauses, and words, unless they did not match the meaning of the original text
The language of the English New Testament Recovery Version is not too sophisticated and should be easy for you to get into
The University of the Philippines, as the highest national institute of education in the Philippines, gathers the country's top students
In opposing us they take the same way used in the United Stateswhomever we contact receives the slanderous book The GodMen the following day
The truths that we teach are definitely not according to tradition but according to the pure words of the Bible
Throughout the generations much of Christianity has been saying, 'Thus says the councils,' and not, 'Thus says the Bible'
Since you are attending the Full-Time Training, as a rule, you should be trained in the matter of knowing the church
It would be hard for someone opening a factory to achieve anything if he did not think of a way to gain the market
Even though we are not opening a factory for business, the principle is the same for us who are doing the Lord's work
If we are ignorant, boastful, closed to the outside world, and do not pursue progress, then the Lord will not have a way among us
In order to propagate and increase, some people in the Catholic Church have accepted the so-called Pentecostal movement
They do not put any demands on the believers; they do not even demand that they attend the Lord's Day meeting and testify
Our difficulty is that we are not only hoping to bring people in but are also hoping to bring them into the church life
We have to work harder because we not only ask the saints to meet but also expect them to meet according to a schedule
Many people are willing to believe in Jesus, but they are not willing to clean the meeting hall and the restrooms
Rather, one must learn from and investigate others' practices and absorb others' strong points in order to succeed
Regardless of what line of business they are in, the first thing they do is send people to foreign countries to learn from others
They then come back and have a meeting to compare and absorb all the good points and strong points from each country
The co-workers among us who are fifty years old or above are not like this; they are closed to everything except the truth
Today we are unaware that there are many groups that are far more advanced than we are, and we are also unaware of where we are
The serving ones in the recovery must pursue progress in their service; second, they must pursue the knowledge of the truth
The believers who join the class must register and take a test, and no one can join the class in the middle of the course
If you asked the people in this class whether they know Watchman Nee or Witness Lee, they probably would not recognize those names
Others love the truths in the Lord's recovery to such an extent, but what is our attitude toward the truths that the Lord has given us?
By glancing through the outline of the Bible study put out by that group, one can immediately recognize that they are using our material
Perhaps you may have some understanding of the basic truths of the Bible, but you probably have not spent much effort to study them
Among all of the books in Christianity today, the ones that give the clearest explanation of regeneration are our books
Rather, everyone wants to have his own 'new tricks' and 'new gimmicks,' not realizing that it is these new things that delay the Lord's work
Concerning the pursuit of life, what other books are more basic than The Knowledge of Life and The Experience of Life?
What other book can speak as clearly and transparently as the chapter on the three laws and four lives in The Knowledge of Life?
Paul told Timothy, 'Let no one despise your youth, but be a pattern to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity'
He said that his father, who is an employer, looks at applicants' shoes when he is interviewing and hiring people
Not only should we dress properly and neatly, even our living place should be clean and tidy both inside and outside
Do not forget that we are doing a great business for the King of the heavenly kingdom and are representing Him on the earth
If you do not learn to speak with the right volume, speed, and expression, your preaching of the word will be unbearable to others
You wear black shoes with blue socks and brown pants with red ties, which are as far from matching as heaven is from earth
When you stand in front of people and they see you dressed in such a peculiar way, how will they receive your exhortation and teaching?
The clothing that you wear is bought with your money, so you should give careful consideration to the clothes that you buy
A person's character is established little by little, just as a house is built by setting small bricks on top of each other one by one
If you study these points carefully, you will have some understanding regarding this matter of character building
If you do not take account of these things and do not pay attention to them, then there will be no way for you to build yourself up
The first matter is contacting people the second is ministering the word and the third is visiting people in their homes or on the campuses
The main reason why Taiwan is prosperous today is that in these years the university students are being educated quite well
Recently in America we sent out gospel teams, with ten people on each team, to the various campuses to take care of the Lord's need
If we preach the same old teachings, they will feel bored, even though they still desire to know something about God
If you go out to work in an ordinary fashion, it will not only be a waste of time but also a waste of your learning
You need to take care of such things as prayer, coordination, fellowship with the Lord, and not being individualistic
In order for you to be efficient in doing things and in working, you must first build yourselves up in your human character
If you conduct yourselves in a loose way, seeking only for a place to lie down and sleep, this will spoil your character
In Taiwan almost all of the brothers who graduate from college are required to render two years of military service
If they want to join the training upon graduating, they would have to simultaneously remain in school for another year
They would have to prepare for examinations while attending the training and would be unable to focus on the training
For those of you who are in this situation, this is a practical matter that you must thoroughly consider before the Lord
You need to consider whether you will still have the opportunity to be trained after serving in the military for two years
Since the present training in the church is a special training, once you miss this opportunity, you may not have such an opportunity again
If this is the case, then it would be worthwhile to consider deferring the military service to join the training for one year
You should first join the military service to fulfill your obligation and afterward devote yourself wholeheartedly to be trained
If you feel that your present need is to be trained, then you should grasp this opportunity and consider attending the training for one year
They are required to have small groups, to equip themselves with the truth, to pursue life, to preach the gospel, and to learn languages
Some feel very anxious, not knowing how to make use of the two short years in a serious way that will decide the path that they will take
You may say that the training has too many requirements, but according to my observation, there are actually not that many
You may feel that the class curriculum is very full and has many requirements, but in my opinion it is not that full
Concerning the matter of carrying out the group meetings, you do not need to purposely spend time to practice this
Simply devote your whole heart to the meeting when you are there, and endeavor to learn something while doing it
If you value this matter and set a definite time for your pursuit of the truth, the result will be better than it is at present
Currently there are more than eighty elders in the church in Taipei but only a few of these elders are fulltime coworkers serving as elders
Based on Paul's word in 1 Timothy 5, a church that is in a proper condition should have some elders who serve full time
Verse 17 says, 'Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching'
It is incredible that this kind of situation does not exist in the church in Taipei, which is the largest church
It may become manifest that some should serve full time, yet they may not be able to do so due to their circumstances
You must realize that those who serve full time are in the church, and those who have a job in the world are also still in the church
During a person's lifetime, the time when one is a student is the most blessed time because there are not many interruptions
Those who work in offices are there from nine in the morning until five in the evening, so their schedules are also very regular
There were many different hymnals entitled Hymns 1, Hymns 2, Gospel Hymns, Selected Hymns, and Additional Hymns
After the publication of the English hymnal in 1966, we immediately undertook the task of revising the Chinese hymnal
Paul said that in all his circumstances, in everything and in all things, he had learned the secret and knew how to conduct himself
You cannot stop learning because you have to attend the meetings, nor can you stop attending the meetings because you have to learn
You have been learning to serve the Lord for a period of time, so you should be clear that you are engaging in 'guerrilla warfare'
Some people sleep for only five hours a day, and their whole family helps them with the other aspects of their life
Of all, it is not according to the principle in the Bible to establish a school to train people to serve the Lord
In the recovery's sixty years of history, there were many who were rich in truth and had much learning in the matter of life
Regarding the church's plan for the training of the saints, the co-workers in the past, being too quiet, did not act aggressively
To meet the special need, there must be a group of believers who would give themselves as Nazarites before the Lord
You all need to consecrate yourselves thoroughly and voluntarily and take the initiative to pursue and learn before the Lord
Not only so, the Lord also said that the Father was always with Him and that the Father had not left Him alone
In chapter fourteen, before the Son prayed to the Father, He said that the Father was in Him and that He was in the Father
Of always 'occupying the nest without laying any eggs,' they should let the young people try to produce some results
Between 1936 and 1939 Brother Nee purposely did not publish any books because he wanted to see what Christianity could produce
Every locality is required to keep an attendance record of the video training and to send a report to the ministry station
The social trend, tradition, and natural habit of the Chinese people, all of which are in our blood, are altogether the opposite
When you learn to do the Lord's work, the first thing you must do is to have a radical change in your character
If you learn to do this within two years, then you would be the best in whatever you do, even if you take a secular job
Anyone who has ever served in the military knows that once a person joins the military, he loses all his freedom
He is thoroughly changed from head to toe so that he may be freshly equipped to receive strict military training
No looseness is allowed, because the improper conduct of one person during a battle could lead to the destruction of the whole army
No one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please the one who enlisted him'
Verse 4 clearly points out that the primary matter for a soldier is that he must not entangle himself with the affairs of this life
Similarly, in order to win a battle, a soldier must not allow himself to be entangled with the affairs and burdens of this life
The work of the Lord's recovery in the Far East has been greatly frustrated mainly because of the Chinese character
They were rejected and persecuted by the entire world, especially during World War II when millions of them were massacred by Hitler
Even though there are laws in the United States that protect minorities from discrimination, in actuality, minorities are not that protected
Those Chinese students who study abroad are successful because they are compelled to be determined and diligent
If they were to stay in their own country, they would readily become loose and lazy under the influence of the environment
Since there are so many valuable assets in the church, they tend not to care when they lose a few of the saints
That area was bombed by the allied forces during the war, and all that was left was an area of cement-covered ground
In this world every building, regardless of what kind of business it is used for, needs to have an impressive front
As we are working here, we should have an impressive front, a dignified appearance, so that people would be fully convinced to come to us
The two restaurants are alike in that they will both get customers, but the difference is that they will get different kinds of customers
If we are rough in the way we handle the services in the church, then it will be hard to gain people of high quality
These two matters are truly the most precious aspects of our inheritance, and you should pay attention to them
You must first perfect your character, be regular in your living and activities, and maintain a clean and elegant environment
We have to treasure the life and the truth in the recovery, but we cannot continue to be loose in our character
In other words if you are a professor and do not produce any articles for publication within a certain amount of time you will be eliminated
If we continue to be at ease, content, and loose, then those behind us will catch up to us and leave us far behind
Paul told Timothy, 'Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth'
In the same way, if you are going to cut straight the word of the truth, you need to spend time and energy to get into the truth
If you study the footnotes in the New Testament Recovery Version, you will discover that those footnotes were not composed in a loose way
Perhaps you may say that although the letters to Timothy mention many matters, the word character is never mentioned
What he said, how much he said, and when and how he said things should have caused others to respect him rather than despise his youth
The way of life is not a matter of ethics, morality, or culture but a matter of walking according to the Spirit
In the recovery we are pursuing the truth, we are learning to take the way of life, and we are proper with regard to morality
Our way of working is not very high, so when a Christian group with a way that is superior to ours emerges, we immediately fall behind
Thirty-five years ago in the Far East, there were not many groups that had as many high quality people as we had in the Lord's recovery
Today these groups have adopted a number of our ways and even improved on them through further study and revision
We unconsciously dropped the practice of the small groups and started to bring people to the meeting hall to gather them for conferences
Outwardly, the conferences seemed to be merely conferences, but in reality they had become occasions for 'celebrity speeches'
You need to have a set time to rise up, a set time to pray, a set time to read the Word, and a set time to study
If you were illiterate, you would be unable to read anything, not to mention the Bible, and would naturally be unable to study the truth
At least you have to learn the Greek alphabet, be familiar with Greek grammar, and be able to use reference books
If you do, your future, education, business, and occupation will all be a failure, and our work will not be accomplished
The New Testament covers a great variety of subjects, and these subjects are scattered throughout the New Testament
After speaking these things He showed His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem suffer many things be killed and on the third day be raised
The Lord first spoke about the church, then He mentioned Satan, and finally He referred to the way of the cross
It would not be very easy for someone who has been a believer for only a short time to find the line of life in the Scriptures
Although John 1:4 tells us that 'the life was the light of men,' Matthew 4 does not mention life in conjunction with light
Generally speaking, what we eat, what we drink, and what we wear are matters that are primarily related to our physical life
The church did not have a denominational background and there were no Western missionaries in it, yet our work brought in a big revival
One day a Japanese man with a translator came to interrogate me, asking, 'Why do you call your meetings 'revival meetings'?
Based on my own experience, the most difficult part of the Lord's transformation work is the transformation of our character
The Chinese have a saying which says, 'Mountains and rivers can be easily changed, but a person's nature is difficult to change'
The only exception they made was that they frequently invited Brother Watchman Nee to speak while he was there from 1938 to 1939
In 1956 and 1957 we invited Brother Austin-Sparks twice to minister to us and provided him and his wife with very warm hospitality
A meeting hall can be built only because every single piece of material has been broken and not one piece remains intact
No matter how hard our character is smashed, it cannot be broken, and no matter how much one drills it, it cannot be drilled through
Many Jews, for example, have determined not to choose God but to choose money, and in the end they have succeeded
In the same way, God has put us fallen ones in front of our character and Christ's salvation so that we may make a choice
These are all expressions of how you have chosen the tree of life and forsaken the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Now that you have joined the FullTime Training you must overcome this expression of the tree of the knowledge of good and evilyour character
According to my observation, however, character is the last enemy for those of us who love and pursue the Lord
In the twenty years since then, although by the Lord's mercy our work has not declined, there has not been much development
Without outward pressure in the environment, we become self-content at a certain stage and thus delay the Lord's work
They would not clean their homes again until their homes were so dusty that whatever they touched was covered with dust
When they would wipe off the dust, they would not do a thorough job, wiping only the center of the room and leaving the four corners dirty
In the matter of cleaning, we can see the Chinese character, which regards everything as being 'about the same'
Our work in the Far East in the last twenty years has suffered from this character of everything being 'about the same'
We can make improvements to our life on earth by improving the means of transportation and shortening the time required to travel
Regrettably, although transportation today has been much improved, our way of working is old and is according to the old customs
The senior co-workers truly love the Lord and have overcome the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in regard to the world and sin
The saints are advancing in the truth and are pursuing life, but why are they not being perfected in the matter of character?
Is the word of God' , and reminded us, 'And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit'
In order to serve the Lord, we must be equipped with the truth in the Scriptures and must also pursue the filling of the Spirit
Even many atheists dare not despise the Bible, acknowledging that the Bible is the most difficult book to deal with
Regardless of how much people have sought to discredit the Bible, the Bible still has not been eliminated from human society
Although most people are aware of the existence of such a precious Scripture, they are still quite baffled by the truths contained within it
We cannot call iron gold, because only gold is gold, and although copper looks very much like gold, we cannot say that copper is gold
When we go out to visit people one on one, if we bring the Bible with us and speak to them in a proper way, they will surely respect us
The Greek word that is translated filled is a different word from the Greek word that is translated filled in 2:4 and 4:8
We have to see that pleroorefers to the inward filling of the Spirit and plethorefers to the outward filling of the Spirit
Acts 6:3a says, 'But brothers, look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom'
Pleroo is used to describe the wind's filling of the house inwardly, and pletho is used to describe the Spirit's filling of people outwardly
The word pleroo used in 22 denotes the filling of a house inwardly the word pletho used in 24 denotes the filling of the disciples outwardly
When describing the condition of a person who has been filled inwardly with the Spirit, Luke uses the word pleres
When we speak of the inward filling of the Spirit, our presentation should be based on Acts 13:52 and Ephesians 5:18
If we speak concerning the outward filling of the Spirit, we need to use the Greek words to prove what we are saying
After you speak to them about the filling of the Spirit, you need to tell them in which part of our being the Spirit fills us
The human body was created with dust, so our body has all the elements of dust and needs to be maintained by minerals
Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, and the life-giving Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God
After the book of Acts the word for outward filling is not used in the twenty-two Epistles from Romans to Revelation
Although the Bible mentions the Spirit and they have read about the Spirit, they almost completely ignore the Spirit
The skin encompassing the water is a picture of the inward filling, and the water encompassing the skin is a picture of the outward filling
Confess your sins to the Lord one by one until, according to your inner sense and your memory, you have nothing more to confess
Once you have done this, you should simply believe that you have been filled in your spirit with the ultimate consummation of the Triune God
When you have completely emptied yourself of all filthiness, then you will also be completely filled with the Spirit
Through continuous confession we breathe out our filthiness until all of our uncleanness is gone, and as we breathe out, we also breathe in
Thank and praise the Lord that although we are still filthy, He comes to us with His blood as the Lamb-God, the redeeming God
Both our actual experience and the truth of the Bible give us a clear picture of the inward filling of the Spirit
Those who have discernment know that the tonguespeaking practiced among the Pentecostals is often not genuine and not according to the truth
On the one hand, this fellowship is meant to help you by giving you the proper way to pursue the filling of the Spirit
There are still many things within us that are not of Him, things that have not been dealt with and are filthy and sinful
Through repenting, confessing, and praying, we will breathe out our sins and breathe in God Himself as the life-giving Spirit
We are foolish if we study the truths in the Bible without using the life-study messages and the New Testament Recovery Version
Pletho, which is also used in 4:8, 31, 9:17, 13:9, and Luke 1:15, 41, and 67, refers to being filled outwardly
He was born of the Spirit essentially for His being and living , and He was anointed with the Spirit economically for His ministry and move
Acts 6:3 says, 'But brothers, look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom'
Being full of the Spirit is the condition of one who has been filled with the Spirit inwardly and essentially, as mentioned in 13:52
By serving the Lord full time, you will have time to study the truth so that when you teach others, you will be able to do so properly
They teach only shallow matters, such as the creeds and decisions made by the councils, biblical history, and biblical geography
He began to pursue the truth in 1920, and in 1922 he began to publish periodicals that expounded the truths of the Bible
Although so many were trained, no one has pursued and made adequate progress with regard to languages and writing
Melton studied our truths and felt that they were fundamental and even worthwhile for Christians to read through
Today Christians all over the world recognize that the Brethren theology is the best theology of all orthodox theology
The notes in the New Testament Recovery Version alone can almost serve as a compass for all the truths among us
No one has ever spoken concerning the three lives and four laws or regarding the nineteen points of the four stages of the spiritual life
You have to endeavor to get into these two books and to pursue, stage by stage, the four stages of the spiritual life
Anyone who abides by the law of propagation will reproduce, but this does not mean that what they produce will be acceptable
The Moabites and Ammonites were not permitted to enter into the holy congregation of Jehovah for ten generations
Lot and his daughters acted according to the law of propagation, but they did so in violation of the law of morality
We have led many people to salvation, but are they people of the holy congregation, or are they Moabites and Ammonites?
The proper procedure is as follows: first, we must endeavor to preach the gospel, and second, we must use the small groups
It is possible to carry out the law of propagation when seeking increase but violate the law of the spiritual life
We may bear children, but these children will not be able to enter into the holy congregation and will be condemned
Today we have to carry out the law of propagation that God has ordained, but we also have to care for the principle of the spiritual life
Many denominations and Christian groups fulfill the law of propagation, yet they do so by utilizing many human methods
Of course, there are also 'Ruths' among them who receive the Lord's special mercy to seek after Him and to choose Christ
Within the last fifteen years, however, many groups have surpassed us in their propagation and level of increase
Today many individuals and groups care only for their goal but not for their means or for the principle of life
Today we not only need to care for the principle of life, but we also need to carry out the law of propagation
Begetting children is right and necessary, but we cannot do it by any means that we choose without caring for the principle of life
Since this is the case, you have to seize the opportunity to be one who is strong and pure for the testimony of the Lord's recovery
The situation in today's Christianity is that although multitudes of people have been saved, few have entered the holy congregation
Even though propagation is good and increase is necessary, we still need to ask, 'How are children being born?
For this reason we must have the knowledge of life, and we must also have the genuine experience and growth in life
In this short verse four matters are mentioned-being diligent, not being slothful, being fervent in spirit, and serving the Lord
Apparently these matters are not involved with our character, but actually they are altogether related to our character
It is quite difficult to start a fire in a refrigerator, but it is very easy to start a fire where there are gas vapors or gasoline
If you are fervent in spirit, you will be like gas vapors or gasoline and will be easily kindled by even a little contact
In a gospel meeting if there are many gospel friends who are diligent, this is an indication that many will get saved
Today the most important matter regarding our service to the Lord is that we must be fervent and burning in spirit
The first ones to believe in the Lord and the most fervent ones in the pursuit of spirituality are those who are strong in character
In the service in the Body, those who are the most difficult to coordinate with are those who are weak in character
If a person is poor in character, there is no way for him to coordinate with others because his spirit cannot be set on fire
You are here to be trained so that you may be formed into an army to go to the villages for the spread of the gospel
Not only are young people often despised because of their youth, but even older people are despised when they act like children
In today's society, those who have successful careers or are given authority over others have a strict character
If you have a loose character and are unable to bear pressure, eventually you will become seriously ill or at least have stomach ailments
When Brother Nee was taking the lead among the co-workers in mainland China, he suffered much because of the co-workers
They were like hot potatoes that you want to get rid of but cannot and that hurt you when you keep them in your hands
If those brothers had been working in various professions in the world, they would have been asked to leave and to look for another job
It is true that no one will control you, but if you have this kind of intention, you will be finished and will be useless in the Lord's hand
Even though Timothy was a spiritual son to Paul, the most Paul could do was to write to him in the way of an exhortation
If Timothy received the exhortation, Paul would be comforted, but if he rejected the exhortation, Paul would not be able to do anything
History proves that Paul was able to get through with Timothy and was unable to get through with other co-workers
If you learn the truth and grow very well in life but are not built up in character, then this will become a great problem
The only thing that they ever did was to stretch out their hand when tea was brought and open their mouth when food was served
Later, however, after he retired from the military and got married, he needed his wife to help him find his watch, socks, and clothes
After you graduate from the training and go out to labor for the Lord, you must in a sense be like a 'suicide squad'
The various world powers were fearful of the bravery of the Chinese people and warned Japan not to act rashly and blindly anymore
That young pilot was brave and could sacrifice himself to save the country because he was a person of good character
A person who is loose in his character cannot be three-dimensional and is like a flat, two-dimensional surface
Verses 3 and 4 say that we who serve the Lord as good soldiers of Christ Jesus should not entangle ourselves with the affairs of this life
Some coaches not only teach their athletes skills but also train their character by controlling their diet, sleep, and dress
If an athlete is loose in his character and does not eat, sleep, live, and walk according to a schedule, he will not be able to win the game
Verse 15 says, 'Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth'
The word workman refers to a carpenter, and the cutting straight of the word is likened to the work of carpentry
If you are not strict enough in your character your reading of the Word will be loose and your interpretation of the Word will be inaccurate
If you take the attitude that everything is 'about the same,' then your interpretation of the Word will also be 'about the same'
Paul exhorted Timothy to cleanse himself from the vessels of dishonor that he could be trained in these four matters
If he has not been strictly trained, the gun can be very dangerous to him because he might pull it out and shoot carelessly
Old people will argue with you, Buddhists will argue with you, and those who have scientific minds will also argue with you
If you study these six kinds of people carefully, you will realize that they are altogether related to the matter of character
If you are willing to take this matter seriously and spare no effort to carry it out, then it will be easy for you to be trained
Even to be overly strict is all right, because it may be necessary to be overly strict in order to effectively correct our defects
Some elders and co-workers keep their homes clean and tidy but have no feeling concerning the dirtiness and untidiness of the meeting hall
Lord, make us good soldiers, good athletes, good farmers, good workmen, vessels unto honor, and good slaves to You
We pray that You would remember our desire and grant us grace upon grace so that we may seriously practice this in our daily living
These differences are not due to the Holy Spirit whom we have received, because we all have the same Holy Spirit
The third fundamental matter in serving the Lord is having the Holy Spirit and being filled with the Holy Spirit
In eternity past, before He had passed through the process of incarnation, death, and resurrection, God was already triune
According to the teaching and revelation in the Scriptures, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinct but not separate
They receive the doctrine of the Trinity that was presented in the creed that was put out by the Council of Nicea
We cannot say that this kind of teaching in the seminaries is wrong, but such teaching is too rough and general
They thought that they knew the truth well since they had received a theological education and had obtained doctoral degrees in theology
Since that time, they have begun to say that the Three of the Trinity are distinct and no longer say that They are separate
When the Lord Jesus said that he who had seen Him had seen the Father, what He meant was that the Son is the Father
His word also implied that the Son is in the Father, the Father is in the Son, and the Father and the Son are one
Over one thousand eight hundred years ago those who studied the Bible were forced to invent the word coinhere to describe the Divine Trinity
According to modalism, in the past God was the Father, and when He was manifested in the flesh, He became the Son
Once the Son came, the Father no longer existed, that is, once the Father became the Son, the Father ceased to exist
The Son existed on the earth for a period of time and then became the Holy Spirit and once He became the Spirit the Son also ceased to exist
Modalism emphasizes the aspect of God being one and neglects the aspect of God being three, thus becoming an extreme
The Son is in the Father the Father is in the Son the Father and the Son are in the Spirit and the Spirit is also in the Father and the Son
An overemphasis of coexistence may lead to tritheism, and an overemphasis of God being one may lead to modalism
In the Divine Trinity, the Father is the source, the Son is the course, the expression, and the Spirit is the flow, the reaching
Galatians 2:20 says, 'It is Christ who lives in me,' and Colossians 1:27 says, 'Christ in you, the hope of glory'
According to the pure truth of the Scriptures, Christ is not only dwelling and living in us, but He is also making His home in us
Today in the light of the Lord's recovery, the Spirit whom we enjoy and experience is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God
The One who was incarnated was not merely the Son but the entire Triune God, comprising the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
As proof of this matter, John 1:1 and 14 say, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God
Under the influence of traditional theology, most Christians believe that it was only the Son who was manifested in the flesh
When the Lord Jesus lived on the earth, it was not only the Son but the Triune God who was living on the earth
In other words, the Spirit is the ultimate consummation and the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God
He is not the Triune God before incarnation but the Triune God who has passed through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection
Genesis 1 reveals that prior to God's restoration of the heavens and the earth, the Spirit of God brooded upon the surface of the waters
The Spirit in Genesis 1 had only the element of divinity and not the elements of humanity, human living, death, resurrection, or ascension
Indeed, the Christ in the Gospel of John and the Christ in Revelation are different, but this does not mean that there are two Christs
When John saw the Christ whom he wrote about in the Gospel of John, he was not afraid of Him and even reclined on His breast
God has already created the heavens and the earth become flesh and passed through human living on the earth for thirtythree and a half years
He has gone through death, dying on the cross in seven statuses, and He has resurrected, ascended, and descended
Whenever we go to preach the gospel, we can tell people that the Word is near them, in their mouth and in their heart
The gospel that we preach contains a central blessing-the Spirit-which was promised by God to Abraham from the beginning
At the time we were saved, the Holy Spirit, who is God Himself, entered into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God
We need to be filled in spirit with the Spirit-the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God
On the day of Pentecost after the people had heard the gospel and had been touched they asked Peter what they had to do in order to be saved
We experience regeneration and salvation once for all, but we need to repent and confess our sins day by day throughout our whole life
After the Triune God accomplished redemption, He became the life-giving Spirit, and, like the air, He is in our mouth and in our heart
We need to confess our sins thoroughly, especially before we go to contact people or prophesy for the Lord in the meetings
We do not need to analyze whether it is the essential Spirit or the economical Spirit, because the two are just one Spirit
Although there is a distinction between the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit in function, They are still the same one Spirit
A sister testified that she once had prayed to the extent that her whole being was refreshed, light-hearted, and so full of joy
If the saints are not vital or vigorous in the church life, then our efforts to change the system will be futile
People in the Pentecostal movement speak in tongues in a miraculous way, thinking that this is the only way to receive the Holy Spirit
These are the matters concerning healing and casting out demons, which you must do by walking according to the spirit
Do not say that you cannot do these things, because it is not you who can but the Lord Jesus, the Spirit, who can
The demons will grasp the opportunity to trouble the ignorant people and to possess their bodies whenever they are ill or injured
From now on, all the workers among us must be ready to deliberately cast out demons whenever the occasion requires
Rather, the Lord wants us to cast out every demon and heal every disease when we preach the gospel in the villages
One time he cast out a demon by writing the sentence, 'Jehovah sent Jesus as the Savior, and Jesus casts out demons'
Our way to cast out demons is to ask people to read the Lord's Word and to call on the Lord's name continuously
Lord Jesus, we want to daily build up ourselves under Your precious blood and in Your name to meet the need in Your move
Lord, remember us and cause that which You accomplished to become our living so that our living would be without sin and without death
Lord, we want to confess our sins every day and to cast out all the demons for the coming of the kingdom of God
Lord, shine on us and cleanse us daily that we may become vessels unto honor and be completely filled with the Holy Spirit
Chicken feathers, skin, and bones are essential to the growth of a chicken, for without them it would not be possible for a chicken to exist
Many Americans do not know which parts of a fish can be eaten, so they discard the fish head, the fish tail, and the fish bones
Whether or not we do this depends on whether or not we are focused on the main points and have the proper enjoyment
After reading a particular section of the Scriptures, we should also try to speak the main points and understand the outline of that section
You greatly miss the mark, however, if you do not see the matter of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
The key, the life-pulse, to live Christ and to magnify Him is the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Without the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, you also will not have the power to defend the gospel
When we read the Bible, we have to find the life-pulse, the most precious point, of the portion that we are reading
In the midst of persecution and imprisonment he would still live Christ, defend the gospel, and magnify Christ
When you sacrifice yourself and receive criticism, everyone will receive benefit, but the one who will receive the most benefit is you
The secret to being trained is to be unafraid of making mistakes, of failing, of falling short, and of having your weaknesses exposed
If your composition is written poorly and your teacher adjusts it, you will have the opportunity to learn a great deal
In the same way, when you are in the training, you have to try your best to expose your mistakes so that you can receive the benefit
From the very beginning of the Lord's recovery among us, we have paid much attention to the filling of the Holy Spirit
We have been enlightened to see that there is more to the Holy Spirit than what is taught in Christian theology
Although you pay attention to the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit, you are still not filled with the Spirit
There is a hymn in the Chinese hymnal that says that everything related to the relationship between God and man depends upon the Spirit
Similarly, although we have been working all the time, we have missed a crucial point-the filling of the Holy Spirit
When you trainees are learning to serve the Lord, you must pursue to be filled with the Holy Spirit from the outset
You have to pay attention to this point and preach these two baptisms in a proper way especially when you go out to labor on the campuses
In Matthew 12:28, the Lord Jesus said, 'But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you'
It mentions two matters-casting out the demons by the Holy Spirit and ushering in the kingdom of God by casting out the demons
Once you apply the Lord's precious blood, you are covered, and once you employ the Lord's name, the demon is cast out
Today when you go out to preach the gospel, you have to be filled with the Holy Spirit, then you have to cast out demons and heal diseases
In the past when we preached the gospel, we merely paid attention to speaking and did not rely on being filled with the Holy Spirit
If you want to make people alive through baptism, you need to baptize them not only in water but also in the Spirit
The way to do this is to teach them to confess their sins, to pray, and to open themselves to receive the infilling of the Holy Spirit
In the past we focused on burying people in the water so that they would be delivered from the world through the death of Christ
Now we must pay attention to helping people to be filled with the Holy Spirit, and we ourselves should also be such people
Stanza three says, 'I will dig by praying, / Dig the dirt entirely, / Thus release the Spirit, / Let the stream flow freely'
In Christianity there are only a small number of hymns on the Spirit, and the truth in these hymns is unclear and vague
The only way for Christ to be realized in a practical way in the believers' living and experience is through the Spirit
For this reason we are endeavoring to change the basic form and way that we meet in the church and are focusing on our propagation
In depicting God's nature, the New Testament emphasizes only three things-God is Spirit, God is love, and God is light
The nature of God's person is Spirit, the nature of God's essence is love, and the nature of God's expression is light
He became the life-giving Spirit after passing through the processes of incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection
Mentioning Spirit and spirit nineteen times, this hymn repeatedly speaks about the relationship between the Holy Spirit and our human spirit
When the movement of air is strong, it is wind; when wind comes, air comes with it, and once wind is weakened, it becomes simply air again
Hymns 212 in the Chinese hymnal says The Holy Spirit as a strong wind Blows from heaven Upon the congregation As He did at Pentecost
They deny the spiritual reality and the spiritual facts and focus on the mind, which has been corrupted by Satan
They say that both the God who is spoken of in the Bible and the Spirit who is referred to in Christianity are imaginary perceptions
The fact remains, however, that mental perception is based upon feeling, and feeling is based upon something real
If there were no spiritual facts or reality behind what they preached, how could they have power and how could the believers be captivated?
One time a sister testified that she had emptied herself out to the Lord and had thoroughly confessed and prayed
Initially after doing this she did not have any feeling, but an hour later she felt relieved throughout her whole being
Paul said, ''The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart,' that is, the word of the faith which we proclaim'
The word, which is the Spirit and God, is not far from us; it is in our mouth and in our heart, just like the air
In the same way, without the Spirit and the exercise of the spirit, it is impossible for us to be spiritually healthy and victorious
If you are inactive when you should be active or if you are active when you should be inactive you will have great problems and much trouble
There is a Chinese proverb which says, 'Since the ancient times it is rare for human life to reach seventy years'
In the Bible Moses said something similar-'The days of our years are seventy years, / Or, if because of strength, eighty years'
From your youth you have to pay attention to your daily living so that you will be healthy and will live longer on the earth
Eating refers to our diet, resting refers mainly to our sleep, and exercise refers to our activities, our bodily exercise
Do not pay too much attention to the taste of the food that you eat; rather, pay attention to the nutrition that you receive from it
You should know something about nutrition, and you should also have a little knowledge about such things as oil, sugar, salt, and meat
You should consider exercise and being active as your recreation and leisure, but you must be careful not to fall into sin
You should exercise regularly, either doing calisthenics or 'shadowboxing' for at least twenty minutes each day
Doctors even encourage the patients who are confined in bed to try to stand up for awhile or to take a little walk after meals if possible
The best thing to do after a meal is to walk for three to five minutes, taking around a hundred steps each minute
A certain senior statesman in Chinese politics who lived to an advanced age wrote a proverb that contains a formula for longevity
The gist of the proverb is-'To enjoy longevity, you have to sleep seven hours at night and walk seven thousand steps during the day'
Elderly ones should walk seven thousand steps a day, but it is not too much for children to walk ten thousand steps a day
As young people, you are in between the children and the elderly ones, so you also should have the proper amount of exercise
After man's fall, man began to have the sense of shame, and there was the need for him to cover his nakedness with clothing
The priests in the Old Testament had to have their robes long enough to touch the ground so that others could not see their body
If a brother were to wear a wide tie that had a big cross and the words In Christ written on it, how would you feel?
It is not only wrong to expose one's bones, flesh, and skin, it is also a shame to expose the shape of one's body with tight clothing
You were students in the past, and as students you might not have had the means to pay much attention to your clothing
If you are careless in the way that you dress, you will compromise your outward expression and depreciate yourself
We belong to You, and we are willing to be those who are always filled with You within and transformed by You without
Lord, adjust us in our character that we may be vessels unto honor, those who are filled with You to express You
