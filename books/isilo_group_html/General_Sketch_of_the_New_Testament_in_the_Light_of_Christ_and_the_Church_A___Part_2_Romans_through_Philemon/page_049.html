When we were dead in sins, we were fallen to the lowest level, even to the grave. But God raised us up to the highest point, even to the heavenlies.<h2 class=head2>Seating Us in the Heavenlies with Christ</h2><p>Third, we were seated in the heavenlies with Christ. A person sits down only when his work is finished. Therefore, to be seated means that everything has been accomplished. In one sense, the church will be built, but in another sense, the church has been built up already. On the one hand, the Lord still must work on us, but on the other hand, He already has finished His work. He has made us alive, raised us to the heavenlies, and seated us together with Christ and in Christ.<p>When did God make us alive? When Christ was resurrected, His entire Body was made alive and raised up together with Him. Then in His ascension He brought us to the heavens and seated us with Him. Therefore, in God&#8217;s divine point of view, the church has been built already; everything is complete. We may worry about the building of the church, but God does not worry because it already has been accomplished. We cannot understand this, but it is a fact which has been revealed to us.<p>John 2 records that when the Jews were trying to kill the Lord Jesus, He told them, &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&#8221; (v. 19). When I was young I thought that this referred only to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Himself. However, in these last years the Lord showed me that according to 1 Peter 1:3 all of us were regenerated through the resurrection of Christ. When Christ was crucified on the cross, we were crucified there also. In the same way, when Christ resurrected, we resurrected with Him. Therefore, we died in Him, were resurrected in Him, and were seated in Him. In God&#8217;s sight everything has been accomplished and completed. Through Christ&#8217;s resurrection and ascension the church has been produced. This is what is revealed to us in Ephesians 2.<h2 class=head2>Christ&#8217;s History Becoming Our Experience</h2><h2 class=head3>By the Transmission of the Spirit</h2><p>What God accomplished through Christ and in Christ must become our experience. However, Christ is Christ, and we are we. He resurrected and ascended nearly two thousand years ago in a place far away. How then can the resurrection and ascension of Christ be our experience? How can we be in Christ, how can Christ be in us, and how can God&#8217;s accomplishments in Christ be ours? It is not sufficient to answer that it is by identification. Even more, it is by the Spirit.<p>We may illustrate the Spirit by transmission through electricity. By means of electricity, something that happens in Los Angeles can immediately be brought into our presence. By the same transmission, people in America and the Far East can speak with one another. Without electricity, only my direct audience can hear me, but by the transmission of electricity, people in the uttermost part of the earth can hear me. Because of electricity, the problem of space and time is eliminated. In the same way, there is no problem of space or time with the Spirit. What Christ has accomplished and what God has wrought in Christ have all been compounded into the Spirit. Now the Spirit has come into us, and we have been put into the Spirit. Therefore, what Christ has accomplished is ours.<p>The church is produced by the resurrection and ascension of Christ, which are applied to us by the Spirit. If we take these matters merely as doctrine, they can never be our experience. They will merely be a formula in our mentality. Only when we realize these things in the spirit do they become our experience.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church, A - Part 2: Romans through Philemon &nbsp; pg 49</div><br></body></html>
