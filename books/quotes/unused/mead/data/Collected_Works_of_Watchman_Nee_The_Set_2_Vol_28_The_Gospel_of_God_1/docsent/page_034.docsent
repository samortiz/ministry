   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE WORK OF CHRIST RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BECAUSE OF OUR JUSTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have already mentioned that the Lord Jesus died for us and for our sins Rom 5:8; 1 Cor 15:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have also seen how the Lord accomplished God's righteousness and, at the same time, manifested God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we have to ask a question.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How do we know that the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ has been accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How do we know that such a work was accepted by God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although we say that the Lord Jesus has fulfilled God's righteous requirements, what does God have to say about this?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How can God show us that His Son has indeed accomplished the work of redemption and indeed met His requirements?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is true that the Lord Jesus died for us and for our sins and that His work was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the cross before He died He clearly said, "It is finished!"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 19:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is true that He finished the work of redemption He set out to do on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was able to say that it was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every one of us who has looked forward to His salvation can also say that it is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But how do we know that the Lord's work of redemption is acceptable to God when it is presented before Him?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How do we know that the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus was approved by God?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is all right for us to say that the Lord's work has passed the test.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But what does God have to say?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can say that Jesus died on the cross and accomplished the work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But how do we know that our God is fully satisfied with such a work?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know that the Lord's work of redemption is most reasonable to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But how do we know that the same is true to God?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We say that the work of redemption is fully righteous, but would God say that it is righteous also?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we look at the cross, we say that all things are settled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But when God looks at the cross, is everything settled in His eyes?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to realize that there is no way to know whether or not God is satisfied based on the cross of the Lord Jesus alone; there is no way to find out whether or not God considers it final.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If there were only the cross, if we only had the Lord's death, if the cross alone were to remain with us until today, and if the Lord's tomb had never been emptied, we would not know what the work of the Lord's death has accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Regarding the redemptive work of the Lord, there is not only the aspect of the cross but the aspect of resurrection as well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE LORD'S RESURRECTION IS THE PROOF</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>OF GOD'S ACCEPTANCE OF HIS REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Tonight we are not going to speak about everything related to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, just as we did not share about everything related to His death the last time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Earlier we spoke only about the objective aspect of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Tonight we will also consider only the objective aspect of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Objectively, the Lord died a substitutionary death for us; He died on behalf of all 1 Pet 3:18; 2 Cor 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time, He died for our sins 1 Cor 15:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is what the Lord's death accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What then is the purpose of His resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God raised up the Lord Jesus from the dead as a proof that the work of redemption has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has justified and approved it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now He is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many of us have had experience working in business.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose you have a secretary who has proposed a plan to you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After you look at the plan you may write "OK" on it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that the work is approved; it is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now it can be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord has died for us and the work has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The resurrection of the Lord is God's signing of an "OK" on the work and death of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that this death is now approved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Man's problem of sin is now solved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since the Lord has resurrected, the problem of our sins is fully solved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the Lord had not resurrected, though the redemption would have been accomplished, our hearts would be held in suspense.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There would still be a certain uneasiness within us, for though we would know that redemption had been accomplished, we would not know whether it had been accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We realize that we are fully redeemed from our sins when we see that the Lord Jesus has resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Resurrection is the proof.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It shows us that the cross was right and the redemption was approved.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Resurrection is the proof that the work of the cross has been accepted and received by God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let us consider an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Suppose I owe a certain person a sum of money.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I may owe him so much that there is no way for me to repay my debt.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This, of course, is not a very good illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But we will use it here for the sake of clarifying one aspect of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It should not be applied to all aspects of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Let us say that I go to a brother and say to him, "You know that person to whom I owe the money very well.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You two are good friends.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Please plead for me a little.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I have no way to pay back what I owe, even if I pawn everything at a pawn shop.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I have a problem even in taking care of my own living today.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Please do me this favor by all means."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>My creditor does not live here in Shanghai; he lives in Soochow.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At my request, the brother makes a special trip to Soochow and tells the man, "Mr. Nee is really poor.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He cannot even take care of his own living.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This little sum of money is nothing to you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Why don't you let it go and write off his debt?"</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Suppose my creditor is very generous.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He says, "Since you come to plead for Mr. Nee's debt, I will forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He does not have to return it to me anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Take this promissory note back to him."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then he goes on and says to this brother, "We have not met each other for years.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Since we are good friends and since you are here in Soochow, you should take a trip to Tiger Hill and the Winter Mountain Shrine.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Why don't you stay here for a few days."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He invites him to stay in Soochow and lavishly hosts him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Suppose this brother left on May 10 and settled the business on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, by May 20 he is still not back in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>While he is feasting in Soochow, I am worrying in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I do not know whether or not this brother has finished the business.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Perhaps he has not come back because of some difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He did not come back on the night train on May 10.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Perhaps the business has not yet been settled.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He did not come back on May 11.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Neither did he come back on May 19 or 20.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>As long as he has not come back to Shanghai, my heart cannot have peace because I do not know if the business has been settled.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The business was settled on May 10, but I have not yet received news on May 20.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>As long as he has not come back, my business is not finished.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I still consider myself a debtor, and my heart is still ill at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When will the business be transacted?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Only when he returns to Shanghai will I know that the matter is cleared up.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Friends, this illustrates the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When He died for us, He solved the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>As soon as He died, the fact of sin was taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>But if He had not resurrected from the dead, and if He had not come back, then our hearts would have been held in suspense; we would not know what had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The Lord Jesus went through death for us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He went through the punishment of the law and the wrath of God for us Gal 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>But if the Lord Jesus had not come back, we would not know if the work was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We would not know if God had accepted the work of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>For this reason, the Lord Jesus must come back.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He must resurrect.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Then we will know that the work is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The work is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If the work had not been settled, the Lord would not have come out and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>His resurrection proves that our sins have fully been cleared up.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Romans 4:25 says, "Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification."</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Why was the Lord Jesus delivered?</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>It was because of our offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If we had had no offenses, the Lord would never have had to be delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>It was because of the offenses that the Lord was delivered to man.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>In the same way, His resurrection was because of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>In Greek the two clauses have the same structure.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Jesus was delivered because of our offenses and was resurrected because of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Some Bible translators have misinterpreted Paul's meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>They thought that resurrection is for the purpose that man may be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>They thought that it is first the resurrection of the Lord, then our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>But Paul was saying and the Holy Spirit was saying that He was resurrected because we have been justified.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>To put it simply, it is because we have been justified that the Lord was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Some versions say that resurrection comes first, then justification.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>But the Holy Spirit says that justification comes first, then resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>First there is the matter of our offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Then there is the death of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>In the same way, first there is our justification, then there is His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>He was delivered because of our offenses, and He was resurrected because of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>This means that the resurrection of the Lord Jesus is our proof of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Because we have been justified, God raised up the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Since the Lord has satisfied God's righteous requirement, God resurrected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>My friends, tonight I have to announce to you some very good news.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Although some have believed in the Lord, they are still in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>They feel like they are walking on the edge of a precipitous cliff or on thin ice.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>They think that they have committed their souls, their lives, and their eternal future to the Lord's cross.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>They do not know whether this trust in the Lord will be safe or not.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>If they find out at a later date that this trust does not result in salvation, then they are in trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>I may believe in the cross of Jesus for the redemption of my sins today.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>But if it fails me on that day, then I am in trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Today I may say that it is not a matter of doing good or of keeping the law and that all I have to do is rely on the cross of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>But what happens if God says in that day that this is not all right?</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>What shall I do?</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>How do I know today that the cross of the Lord is sufficient?</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>My friends, you should not look at the cross; you should not worry about whether the cross is sensible or not and whether it is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>All you need to look at is the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>If the work of the Lord's cross was not proper or right, God would not have resurrected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Hence, He resurrected because we were justified.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Because we are justified when we trust in the blood of Jesus, the Lord Jesus was resurrected.</S>
