   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. God Considering His Law</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>as His Requirement upon Sinners 1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The First Three Commandments Requiring Man</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>to Have Only God and Not Have</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Any Idols aside from God</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God considers His law as His requirement upon sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The contents of the law mainly are the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first three commandments require us to have only God and not have any idols aside from God Exo 20:3-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They charge us repeatedly not to have graven images or other gods besides Jehovah, nor make images or worship them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In other words, we should have only God, and besides Him, we should not have any other object which we worship and by which we are occupied.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If someone loves a pair of shoes, that pair of shoes is an idol on his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If someone loves his hairstyle, that hairstyle is an idol on his head.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If someone loves having a Ph.D., that degree is the idol in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some people love their houses and possessions, others love their bank accounts, and still others love their reputation and position all these things are idols.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you look from this angle, who among those living on earth today does not have idols?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone has idols, and there are not very many who want God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Very few are those who simply want nothing but God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Quite often I am afraid that if I like a certain thing, I might love that thing more than I love God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many people shed tears today for various reasons, but I have rarely seen some brothers or sisters shed tears for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Almost all of those who have been close to me have shed tears in front of me, but who has shed tears for the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am afraid that you have not once shed tears for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have shed tears before the Lord but not for Him; you wept because you did not graduate from college, because you failed to obtain a Ph.D., or because the promotion that you pursued went to another person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You should know that this kind of shedding of tears contradicts the first three commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You have violated God s law, you have desired other gods, and you have created idols.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Fourth Commandment Requiring Man</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>to Take Only God and All That God</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Has Accomplished for Man</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>as Man s Satisfaction and Rest</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The fourth commandment requires man to take only God and all that God has accomplished for man as man s satisfaction and rest Exo 20:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This commandment concerns the keeping of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I read the Bible for several decades, but I did not quite understand why in His Ten Commandments God made such a commandment to set up a day and require man to keep it as the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is the meaning of this?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, when the Lord Jesus came, He did not want man to keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before the Lord Jesus came, God wanted man to keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then when the Lord Jesus came, although man still desired to keep the Sabbath, the Lord did not want man to keep it any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was not until these last six years that I began to understand what it means to keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The keeping of the Sabbath means that you can take only God and all that He has done for you as your satisfaction, enjoyment, and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Keeping the Sabbath indicates that you have nothing on earth other than God; you take only God Himself and all that He has accomplished for you as your enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Your God is your everything, and He has accomplished everything for you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All you need to do is enjoy Him and take Him as your satisfaction and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let me give you an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I remember my old mother, who was a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She loved her children very much and often cooked good food for us during holidays or on the Lord s Days.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She had a peculiarity that while she loved to cook good meals for us, she had to do it all by herself and did not want us to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we would sit there and watch her doing everything and then praise her for doing such an excellent job, she would be very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we would say, Mother, you have been too busy; let me help you, she would be unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She did not want us to help because she considered that an insult to her.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, we children knew that we just needed to wait for our mother to prepare the food for us and that we did not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the dumplings were done, we just praised her that her dumplings were really delicious; then she was very satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>While all of us were eating, she did not eat but just watched us and waited on us that we might have the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When I was young, I could not understand her, but now that I look back, I realize that this is the way God deals with us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is doing things for us, but if we try to help Him, the more we help, the more work He has to do.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He does not want our help.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, He wants to do everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today everything is ready, and all we need to do is to come to the feast and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What does it mean to keep the Sabbath?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To keep the Sabbath is to take God and everything that He has done for us as our satisfaction, enjoyment, and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Otherwise, we violate the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the Lord Jesus came, the Sabbath was simply the Lord, for the Lord is the real Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, there is no longer the need for us to keep the Sabbath as a ritual.</S>
