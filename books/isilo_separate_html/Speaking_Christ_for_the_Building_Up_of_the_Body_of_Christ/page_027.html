<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICE OF MEETING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship concerning the practice of meeting. In particular, we want to cover some crucial points concerning our need to pay full attention to the way of speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GETTING YOURSELF PREPARED<br />
TO SPEAK IN THE MEETING</h2>
<p>We must pay our full attention to the way of speaking. If we are going to speak properly, we must get ourselves prepared to speak in the meeting. Unless we are burdened to speak or assigned to speak, we may not have any thought to speak in the meeting. Our thought is that somebody else will speak and that we do not need to speak. If you have been a Christian for twenty years and have attended three meetings a week, you have been in about three thousand meetings. On these three thousand occasions, how many times did you consider speaking in the meeting? Possibly you never once considered that you needed to speak. There was always someone there to speak for you. For this reason it is hard for us to change our way today. Our speaking function has been annulled. If a child is not given any opportunity to speak for twenty years, he will be dumb. His speaking function will be annulled by his lack of speaking and practicing. This illustrates our problem today. We have so many saints among us today who love the Lord and are faithful to the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. However, some who have been among us for many years have been annulled due to the old way of meeting.</p>
<p>When we do speak, we must learn how to speak properly. We must all practice and learn. Over fifty years ago Brother Watchman Nee, the pioneer in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery among us, saw the light concerning the way to meet. He put what he saw into printed messages, yet we did not find a way to practice it. We had nothing with which to replace our old way of one man speaking in the meetings. Now we have been in the line of the recovery for over sixty years, and we have had much practice and experience. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we have published a number of books concerning the scriptural way of meeting. Now we have a way. We also have many publications in truth and in life. These publications are a great storage of &ldquo;groceries.&rdquo; Our only need is to learn how to cook them.</p>
<p>Whenever you attend a meeting, the first thought you should have is to speak. Get prepared to speak. Whether the actual time for you to speak will come or not is another matter, but you must have the thought to speak. To go to the meeting is to go to speak. To go to a meeting is not to go to listen. To go to a feast is not to go to look at the feast or talk about the feast. At a feast the main thing is to eat. Therefore, the first item of the proper way of speaking is to get yourself prepared to speak in the meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT OVERLAPPING OTHERS&rsquo; SPEAKING</h2>
<p>When we speak, we should not overlap others&rsquo; speaking. There should be no overlapping but rather a good continuation from one person&rsquo;s speaking to the next person&rsquo;s speaking. One speaks while all the others wait; then the next one speaks. Between the preceding speaking and your speaking there must be a little <em>selah</em> as in the Psalms. Stop for a while; it is more meaningful. Then you will have a good continuation. There will not be noise, but a proper voice in a good continuation. Although this may not be too easy with a hundred or a thousand meeting together, the meeting should still have a good sequence and a good continuation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT TOO LOW OR TOO SLOW,<br />
NEITHER TOO LOUD NOR TOO FAST</h2>
<p>Our speaking should not be too low without loving the audience&rsquo;s ears. You may love your throat too much. Instead, you should love others&rsquo; ears. Learn to speak audibly. You must sound out your voice that it may be audible. You are not speaking to yourself; you are speaking to others. We should also not speak too slow to exhaust the audience&rsquo;s patience. To speak too low or too slow is not good. We all have to hate these two ways of speaking. Furthermore, we should not speak too loud to hurt the audience&rsquo;s ears, nor should we speak too fast to puzzle the audience. Often I was puzzled at someone&rsquo;s speaking. I could not follow it.</p>
<p>We must learn not to speak too low or too slow; neither should we speak too loud nor too fast. We may learn to speak properly in our homes by ourselves. We mean business in these matters. Our Christian life is altogether focused on the meeting life. If there were no meeting life, there would be no Christian life. These matters are quite important and are worthy of our study.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
