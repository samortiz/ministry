<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Los Angeles, California in the Summer Training of 1965. These messages were not reviewed by the speaker. The subject of the Summer Training was the inner life and the church life. The messages in this book were given concurrently with other messages on life and the church, including <em>Christ as the Content of the Church and the Church as the Expression of Christ</em> and <em>Dealing with Our Inward Parts for the Growth of Life.</em></p>
