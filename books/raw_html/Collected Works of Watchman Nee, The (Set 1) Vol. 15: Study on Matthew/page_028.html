<H1 CLASS=MSG>MATTHEW CHAPTER NINE</H1><P>Verse 1:"And stepping into a boat, He crossed over and came to His own city." The city was Capernaum.</P><P>Verse 2:"And behold, they brought to Him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Take courage, child; your sins are forgiven." Mark 2:1 says that people heard that the Lord was at home, so they brought the paralytic to Him. The account of Matthew is more simple because he presents the Lord as the King. Therefore, he does not record the trivial things or the details. Rather, he writes with a style of broadness. This verse shows us wherever the Lord is, He cannot be hidden.</P><P>"Jesus, seeing their faith." Faith is something that can be seen. The Lord had manifested His authority among the disciples, He had manifested His authority in the realm of nature, and He had manifested His authority among the demons. If the Lord can manifest His authority among sinners, then the demonstration of His authority is completed. All foundations are overthrown. Therefore, He must deal with sinners. Hence, 9:1-8 and chapter eight are inseparable. " Take courage." If your sins are not forgiven, you cannot take courage. By reading the Old Testament, the scribes knew the doctrine concerning forgiveness of sins, yet they did not know the actual forgiveness of sins. They had the teaching of forgiveness but not the experience of forgiveness.</P><P>Verse 3:"Some of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes." This was the first rejection of the Lord. The scribes' heart was exposed by what the Lord did.</P><P>Verse 4:"And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why are you thinking evil things in your hearts?" The Lord is not slack with regard to the thoughts in our hearts. Therefore, we need to pray that the meditation of our hearts may be acceptable to God (Psa. 19:14).</P><P>Verse 5:"For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and walk?" On the Lord's side, both are easy. The Jews thought in their hearts that it was easy for the Lord to speak words such as "your sins are forgiven." However, by telling the man to "rise and walk," the Lord wanted to prove that His forgiveness of sins was a sure thing.</P><P>Verse 6:"But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sinsâ€”then He said to the paralytic, Rise, take up your bed and go to your house." The Lord's enabling the paralytic to rise and walk shows that the Lord's words are trustworthy. If what is seen is true, then what is not seen also is true.</P><P>Verse 7:"And he rose and went away to his house." The great principle of the gospel is first forgiveness and then walking. The sinner cannot go to the Lord, but the sinner can go from the Lord. In the Old Testament the principle is to walk and live; in the New Testament it is to live and walk. One is by works; the other is by grace.</P><P>Verse 8:"And when the crowds saw this, they feared and glorified God, who had given such authority to men." Prior to Matthew 16, the Lord never called Himself the Son of God. Rather, after the temptation, He always called Himself the Son of Man.</P><P>The strongest part of the backbone of the entire Gospel of Matthew is found in chapter sixteen. Although the Lord did not reveal who He was, people could tell who He was from what He did. In chapter sixteen, after Peter had confessed the Lord as the Son of God and the Christ, the Lord began to speak of His death and resurrection.</P><P>The people's glorifying God here is altogether different from the believers' glorifying God, since those people had not repented.</P><P>Verses 9-13:This small section manifests God's grace. Now it is the Lord Himself who came to seek man. Other Gospels give more details concerning the calling of Matthew. As a whole, because Matthew presented the Lord as the King, he did not record the trivial things. In particular, because Matthew was the author of this book, he did not want to reveal too many details related to himself.</P><P>Verse 9:"He saw a man...called Matthew." According to the way this verse was written, it seems to indicate that before that time Matthew had never met the Lord. When the Lord called him, he followed immediately. There must have been something special either in the Lord's voice or in His eyes that caused people to be willing to follow Him. The Lord did not say, "Believe in Me"; rather, He said, "Follow Me." This is because believing in the Lord is included in following the Lord. The Christian life is a life of following the Lord. Christ requires us not only to believe but also to follow, that is, to do the will of God in the way of the cross. To follow the Lord is to partake of the Lord's tribulation, kingdom, and endurance (Rev. 1:9). To endure is not to use our own strength. God cannot use those who only believe in the Lord and do not follow the Lord.</P><P>Verse 10:"And as He was reclining at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined together with Jesus and His disciples." This feast was prepared by Matthew (Luke 5:29).</P><P>Verse 11:"And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?" Although men themselves are not righteous, they like to see God deal with man according to righteousness. Because men do not know the grace of God, they blame God for showing grace to people. Therefore, an attitude of being gracious is often criticized and blamed.</P>
