Those Who Have Perished Being Resurrected<br>after the Kingdom Age and Suffering<br>Eternal Reproach and Contempt in Eternity</H2><P>Those who have perished will be resurrected after the kingdom age and suffer eternal reproach and contempt in eternity forever and ever (v. 2; John 5:29b; Rev. 20:15).</P><P>God has a plan, an economy. In this economy God decided in eternity to have a people created by Him and regenerated by Him to be His sons, then to be sanctified, renewed, transformed, and conformed to the image of His firstborn Son. This group of people will be the Body of Christ. When the millennial kingdom comes, the overcomers in this Body will be married to Christ; that is, they will go to Christ to be attached to Him and thus to be one with Him. They will be the co-kings with Christ in the heavenly section of the thousand-year kingdom. They will also be priests with Christ to serve God.</P><P>When Christ comes back to set up the kingdom, the small number of remaining Jews, the remnant of Israel, will also be saved and regenerated. However, because they will be the later believers, they will not participate in the heavenly section of the kingdom as kings and priests, but will rather be kept on the earth to be the priests of God in the earthly section of the thousand-year kingdom.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_077.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_079.html">Next</a> </body></html>
