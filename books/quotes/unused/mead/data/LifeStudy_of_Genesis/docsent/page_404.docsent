   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b Sleeping Homelessly with a Stone as His Pillow</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Speaking of Jacob, Genesis 28:11 says, "He lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took one of the stones of that place, and made it his pillow, and lay down in that place to sleep" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jacob was in the wilderness and had no lodging place.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Needing something on which to rest his head as he slept, he took a stone and made it his pillow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the meaning of this?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It means that all human doing had been put away.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There was no house, no lodging, nor anything made by man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everything there in that place was God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Jacob was at home, the situation was very different.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There everything was made by man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But that night in the wilderness, there was nothing man-made.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everything in that environment had been made by God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you examine your past experience, you will see that the first dream of your spiritual life came at a time when nearly everything man-made had been crossed out and put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All that remained was the heaven and the earth created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Jacob lived at home, he could lodge in a man-made dwelling and rest on a man-made pillow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in the wilderness he had to rest on a God-created stone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I had been Jacob, I would have been more clever, using either wood or clay instead of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do not think that I could have rested on a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But Jacob did not use either wood or clay.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we shall see, it is very meaningful that he used a stone for a pillow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you had been Jacob, would you have used clay or stone?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I would have made a pillow out of clay and rested my head upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But this would have been something man-made.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The stone which Jacob used for a pillow, on the contrary, was something created and prepared by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As nearly all the called ones can testify, before they were saved, they were forced to suffer, to be lonesome, and to be in an environment in which everything man-made had become nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to their understanding, everything man-made was useless, and they trusted in God's creation, in the things made by God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was at such a time that the dream from heaven came.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The principle is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you want another heavenly vision, then you must have some suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the brothers give you a difficult time or when your wife troubles you, the heavenly dream will probably come once again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are always happy and in a pleasant situation, maybe no dream will come.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Most heavenly visions come at a time when you are suffering or ill-treated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nearly all the visions I have seen have come in times of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No one likes to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But when suffering comes to us under God's sovereign hand, we cannot reject it, saying, "Suffering, I don't like you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Go away."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more we say this, the faster the sufferings will pursue us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I know from my own experience that the vision does not often come when we are happy; it comes when we are suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we are happy in the wonderful church life, the heavenly dream may not come.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when we are troubled by the brothers, the sisters, and the elders, the dream comes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you have not had a heavenly dream since you were saved, this may prove that you have not been suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If there is no suffering, there may be no dream.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But whenever we are deprived of so many man-made things and are brought to the place where there are only the God-created things, that is, when we are cut off from what is of man and put our trust in what is of God, the vision comes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The heavenly vision comes in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Consider Jacob's experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He had been chosen and predestinated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But because he was struggling and striving to get what God intended to give him, he found himself in difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then God sovereignly came in to force him to leave his home, bringing him into a situation where he was lonely and without the help of man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Suppose you had been Jacob, having to leave your home and family and being so lonely.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How would you have felt?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If I had been he, I would have been completely disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nevertheless, at that very time, the dream came.</S>
