   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Transformation is for the mass reproduction of the firstborn Son of God as the prototype of a God-man so that we may be shaped in the divine image to be exactly like the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29; Heb 2:10.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Renewing issues in transformation, and transformation issues in building up; the building up of the jasper wall of the New Jerusalem goes along with transformation Rom 12:2; Rev 21:18a.</S>
