   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Their Hair Being Cut Short</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another item concerning the priests who came near to the Lord is their hair.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads" Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>44:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to this verse, the priests should neither shave their head, cutting off all their hair, nor should they let their hair grow long.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather they should poll their hair, which means to cut it short.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to 1 Corinthians 11:5, to cut off or to shave off all the hair signifies rebellion against the Lord's headship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we serve the Lord, we should not be rebellious against His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all must learn to submit ourselves to the Lord's headship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, we need some amount of hair upon our head, signifying our submission to His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the other hand the same chapter tells us that to have long hair indicates self-glory and self-dignity 1 Cor 11:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may even use another term self-enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is some subtlety of the enemy within the long hair styles of today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not think that this is simply a hippy-type hair cut.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Satan, in his subtlety, is behind all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the Bible, long hair signifies beauty and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a man keeps his hair long, it means that he is keeping his self-glory and self-dignity; he is fulfilling his self-pleasure and self-enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He simply enjoys his long hair.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let us apply these two points.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose a brother says that he is not under anyone, that he is independent, and that he is equal to every other member in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Perhaps he even quotes Matthew 23:8 where the Lord Jesus said that we are all brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For him to have such an attitude means that, spiritually speaking, he shaves off every bit of his hair and does not submit himself to the headship of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yes, Matthew does say that we are all brethren, but 1 Peter 5:5 says that the younger should submit to the elder and that we all should submit to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To shave or to cut off all the hair signifies there is no submission in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need the proper submission.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand to have long hair, signifying self-glory, is to desire and seek for leadership in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are the two problems in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One is a shortage of submission, and the other is a kind of hunger and seeking for position and leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a seeking for self-dignity and self-glory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some are seeking to be an elder or to be a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You have to realize that such seeking is not a glory; it is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To seek after leadership, to hunt any kind of self-glory is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This will kill us spiritually, and this will disqualify us from serving the Lord properly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we want to be qualified to serve the Lord, we should not shave our head, meaning that we should have a proper submission.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Likewise, we should not let our hair grow long, meaning that we should not seek after self-glory, self-dignity, position, and leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To have long hair signifies seeking and hunting for a position.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Both the lack of submission and the seeking after a position damage the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whoever is seeking leadership in the church life is fully disqualified and finished with the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Satan is so subtle!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Spiritually speaking, we need to keep a moderate cut of hair: on the one hand we are under the proper authority submitting ourselves to the headship of Christ, and on the other hand we do not seek to be a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We simply minister life to others and support the church life by His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do everything we can for the church, and yet we do not seek a position of leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such an attitude is really marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is a shame for us to seek to be an elder or a leader in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This kind of seeking will cause us to lose our qualification to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to poll our hair, that is, to have a moderate cut.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not Drinking Wine</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The priests who were qualified to minister to the Lord directly in His presence should not drink wine 44:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Wine signifies worldly, physical pleasure, and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should have nothing to do with worldly pleasure lest we lose our qualification to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Having Only God as Their Possession</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, all these priests have only God Himself as their inheritance, their possession 44:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not be content to have merely some physical, material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In our concepts, our heart, our mind, our realization, and even in our practical living, we must consider that our God whom we serve is our only possession.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is our real possession, and He is our real inheritance.</S>
