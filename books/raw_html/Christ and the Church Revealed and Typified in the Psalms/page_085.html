<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>CONSUMMATE PRAISE</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 146 to 150</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 146:1-2, 10; 147:1-2a, 12-14, 20b; 148:1-5, 7a, 11-14; 149:1-3, 5-9; 150:1-6; Rev. 19:1-9</h1><p>After passing through the first one hundred and forty-five Psalms, we are now on the peak. All we have to do now is to shout “Hallelujah!” The last five Psalms—146, 147, 148, 149, and 150—begin and end in every case with Hallelujah. In these five Psalms there are ten instances of Hallelujahs. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah! In these five Psalms, nothing new is presented. There is only praise, consummate praise.<h2 class=head1>PRAISE FOR THE CITY AND FOR THE LORD’S REIGN</h2><p>Firstly there is praise in Psalm 146 for God’s reigning in Christ through Zion. “Praise ye the Lord. Praise the Lord, O my soul. While I live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being” (vv. 1-2). Regardless of what kind of being I am, though I am weak or strong, I will still sing praises to God. In verse 10 the Psalmist gives the reason for his praise: “The Lord shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.” This is the main point of Psalm 146. “The Lord shall reign for ever…O Zion.” Zion is the city, and the Lord’s reigning is for the earth. There is nothing new; there is just praise for the city and for the Lord’s reign in the earth. This is Psalm 146.<p>In Psalm 147 we have praise for God’s building of Jerusalem: “Praise ye the Lord: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely. The Lord doth build up Jerusalem” (vv. 1-2a). Again we have praise for the city. Verse 7: “Sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God.” Verse 12: “Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.” It does not say, “Praise the Lord, O saints,” or, “Praise thy God, O David.” It says, “Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.” This is the city. Verses 13 and 14: “For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee. He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.” Here in the city we have the strengthening, the blessing, the peacemaking, and an abundant supply of the best food. Then in the last part of verse 20 we have, “Hallelujah.” Hallelujah for the city! Hallelujah for Jerusalem! Hallelujah for Zion! Hallelujah for the strengthening of the bars of the gates! Hallelujah for the blessing of all the children within the gates! Hallelujah for peace in the city! Hallelujah for the rich and best food! Psalm 147 is a Psalm of the city. It is really marvelous.<h2 class=head1>PRAISE FROM THE HEAVENS TO THE EARTH</h2><p>In Psalm 148 the praise starts from the heavens and transfers to the earth. “Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord from the heavens: praise him in the heights. Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts. Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens. Let them praise the name of the Lord” (vv. 1-5). In verses 7 and 11 to 14 the praise moves to the earth: “Praise the Lord from the earth…Kings of the earth, and all peoples; princes, and all judges of the earth: both young men, and maidens; old men, and children: let them praise the name of the Lord: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven. (Now Psalm 8 is fulfilled: ‘O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth.’) He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the Lord.” Verse 14 mentions that the Lord exalts two things: the horn of His people, and the praise of all His saints. Do not say that we are too loud in our praising. When we praise, the Lord exalts our praises. We must be even more loud in extolling Him, “for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.” There are no new points in Psalm 148. It is a Psalm of praise beginning from the heavens and coming to the earth.<p>Psalm 149 is another Psalm concerning the city and the earth. “Praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints. Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King” (vv. 1-2). Zion is the city, and the King (Christ) is for the earth. Verses 3 and 5: “Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp…Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.” The saints are joyful in glory because now they are in the Kingdom, now they are reigning. Let them sing aloud upon their beds—in the night, not only in the day; in the bedroom, not only in the living room or in the meeting hall. “Let the high praises of God be in their mouth (not the low praises), and a two-edged sword in their hand; to execute vengeance upon the nations, and punishments upon the peoples; to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgment written: this honor have all his saints. Hallelujah” (vv. 6-9). At this time the saints are reigning over the earth and executing the judgment of the Lord. Again, there is no new concept presented in this Psalm. Psalm 149 is another Psalm of the city and of the earth.<p>These last five Psalms are all Psalms of praise for the house, the city and the earth, and mostly for the city, because it has come to its ultimate consummation. Revelation 21 describes the final scene in the entire Bible—it is a revelation of the city for the earth, the New Jerusalem and the earth, with all the kings bringing their presents into it. Eventually we just have the city and the earth.
