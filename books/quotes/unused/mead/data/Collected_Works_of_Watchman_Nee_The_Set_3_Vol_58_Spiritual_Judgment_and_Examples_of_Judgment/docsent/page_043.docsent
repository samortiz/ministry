   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 24 Date:July 26, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER P. S.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was saved in a clear way in a prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I was very happy about my salvation, yet I suffered persecution from others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although I suffered outwardly, I was still rejoicing inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have also learned some lessons about divine healing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many times I was weak, and I prayed to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He became my strength and power, breaking through my problems to bring me to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord wanted me to work in the kitchen, but I felt that I was behind in my spirituality, and I wanted to serve the Lord in a spiritual way like other sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the past I did not like to visit the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the Lord empowered me, and I have been able to go out to visit others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This has actually brought profit to me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the past I felt that I was completely useless and that there was nothing in me that I could hand over or offer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later I felt that I should hand myself over to Him because I belong to Him, whether or not I am useful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From your testimony I can see that your spiritual life is a very simple one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you are willing to hand yourself over to the Lord and commit yourself to His hand, He will take you up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But you have to be stronger than you now are before you can become more useful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One does not necessarily have to be in a spiritual environment before he can be useful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The main thing is to accept God's limitations and the Spirit's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In pursuing spirituality, we should not overlook the limitations that God has placed upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many people think that the only way they can receive spiritual blessing is through the meetings and through listening to messages.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet many times the Lord grants us great blessings through the environment He arranges.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many people have the concept that they will know God more as long as they can attend more meetings, listen to more messages, and remain in a certain spiritual environment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Little do they realize that they have more opportunity to know the Lord in a constricted environment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a man rejects God's limitations, he will lose his usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A man becomes useful in God's hand by accepting the discipline placed upon him in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Holy Spirit disciplines and perfects man through the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A man should not pray just for opportunities to experience direct grace, while refusing the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Limitations in the environment often are great opportunities to receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Working in the kitchen and doing housework for others are both means through which the Spirit disciplines a person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many people want bright and glorious prospects but are not willing to humble themselves under the mighty hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, one often receives more grace through humbling himself under God's mighty hand which lies behind the disciplining environment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A young person may find this lesson hard to take.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is full of self in his spiritual pursuit, and it is hard for him to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit in his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But nothing affords us better opportunity in the spiritual pathway than the environment that the Holy Spirit has arranged for us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the Holy Spirit operates in us, He must also arrange outward circumstances to match this operation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the only way for us to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The inward operation is part of the Spirit's work, and the arrangement in our outward circumstances is also part of the Spirit's work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot eliminate the element of circumstantial arrangement from our Christian life just because we do not like it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Strictly speaking, a believer does not have many so-called "circumstances"; he only has the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nothing happens to us by accident when we are under men's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everything that happens to us is part of the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit arranges circumstances for us according to our need.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The inward working of the Holy Spirit is accomplished only in conjunction with the environment He arranges for us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As the Spirit operates within us, He knows the environment we need, and He arranges the most profitable environment for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have no way of knowing ahead of time what kind of environment the Spirit will arrange for us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, we cannot choose our pathway according to our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Holy Spirit works within us on the one hand and arranges our environment on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, a Christian must submit to the inward working of the Holy Spirit as well as to His arrangement in the outward environment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our sister has been learning spiritual lessons in the kitchen and at home during the past years.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is better to serve the Lord in the kitchen than to seek for freedom from the kitchen in order to work as a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If God wants us to remain in the kitchen, no place, not even the meetings, can match its excellence.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The kind of spiritual training each person needs is different.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some need to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Others need to go through sickness, troubles, calamities at home, or other things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All these things are the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all need God's limitations, and we all need to be disciplined by the Spirit before we can become useful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should learn to reap profit from all the discipline in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We often try to push away the environment, but we should learn to humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The term environment may not be too good; we should call it God's limitations or, still better, the Spirit's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Brothers and sisters, do not learn rebellion; learn obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If the time has not come, do not seek to be free from your environment.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some feel that they cannot serve the Lord in a constricted environment.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Actually, this is the preparation that God has ordained for their future service.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After we have learned our lesson through discipline, God will first release us inwardly and then change our environment outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we are not released inwardly, we should not argue with the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we do, we are arguing with God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have to obey the Lord according to the environment that He has arranged for us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The environment often is a chain provided by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>These sufferings and pressures are meant to train us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should not complain, murmur, or rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Instead, we should accept the discipline that the Lord has measured for us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When God places us in situations where we cannot receive grace in a direct way, we should never struggle, complain, or murmur.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Struggling, complaining, and murmuring have destroyed many people.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are like a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When we are placed in a certain environment, we are being molded.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Once we complain, the vessel cracks.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we continue to allow such complaints to come out of our mouth, the vessel actually will break and become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that the benefit we reap from submitting to the discipline of the Holy Spirit is far greater than we can fathom.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What a pity that most of us have spent half of our lives fighting our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If a man does not have any argument with the Lord, everything that comes his way will become a spiritual blessing to him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A person who does not know God's acts will curse the day of his birth Job 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But one who knows the Lord's acts will praise Him for everything that befalls him in his daily life and will reckon it as a God-allotted blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must learn to make our inner world the same as our outer world.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should be able to thank and praise the Lord for everything that we experience.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Bible says that in everything we should give thanks, because every environment is measured by the Lord for our greatest training.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is the reason we can give thanks in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Although we were not able to fellowship with each other for years because of the war, we have to confess that this was a discipline of the Holy Spirit under the Lord's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Lord's Spirit worked within us, and He also worked around us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we have not experienced the former, we should have experienced the latter at least.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The one thing that disappoints me the most is that I do not find much progress in the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we are willing to learn our lessons and submit ourselves to the disciplining circumstances arranged by the Holy Spirit, we will receive light and abundant life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Otherwise, we will remain poor.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God's children should realize that the persons, things, and events that are around them are environments arranged by the Holy Spirit for their discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Let me repeat: We should not complain, murmur, or rebel under such circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We have to realize that everything God has arranged is for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We have to bow our heads, fall in the dust, and worship God, saying, "God, all the environments that You have arranged are for me to experience Your grace."</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we do not stand on God's side, we will not receive anything, and we will eventually become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>There are two ways for us to receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>First, we can receive it directly from the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Second, we can receive it through the disciplining environment arranged by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If we fight against the latter, we will lose our chance of receiving grace.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>But if we obey, we will find grace.</S>
