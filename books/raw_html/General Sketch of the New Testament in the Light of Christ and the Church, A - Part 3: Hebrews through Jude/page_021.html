<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY</h1><h1 class=msg>THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD IN 1 AND 2 PETER</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 1:17; 4:17; 2:12; 2 Pet. 2:9; 3:7; 1 Pet. 1:2-4, 18-19, 22-23; 2:2-5, 9; 5:1-5; 2 Pet. 1:1-7</h1><p>As we have seen, the books of the New Testament are arranged according to the sovereignty of the Lord. The eight books from Hebrews to Jude are supplementary to the other Epistles. Hebrews is the first supplement, James is the second, the two Epistles of Peter are the third, the three Epistles of John are the fourth, and Jude is the fifth. As a supplement to the teaching of the previous Epistles, Hebrews tells us the difference between Christ and Judaism. James, although written before the other Epistles such as Romans and Galatians, is a supplement to the teaching of faith, containing much wisdom.<h2 class=head1>THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD</h2><p>The third supplement, the two Epistles of Peter, deals with the government of God. First Peter 1:17 says, “And if you call as Father the One who without respect of persons judges according to each one’s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear.” It is not easy to understand this passage because we may consider that the judgment mentioned here is in the future. However, the judgment spoken of here is not the judgment in the future, at the coming back of the Lord Jesus Christ and at the end of the millennium. Strictly speaking, those judgments will not be in the hands of the Father. John 5:22 tells us, “For neither does the Father judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son.” The judgments in the future will be in the hands of the Son. First Peter 1:17 says that it is the Father who judges. The judgment here, therefore, is not in the future. It is the dealing of God’s government in the present time. While we pass the time of our sojourning here on earth, God as the Father has apportioned a certain amount of dealing for His people. This is a judgment in the present time, in the present course of this age. While we are passing our earthly journey, God is exercising His judgment, His government.<p>First Peter 4:17 says, “For it is time for the judgment to begin from the house of God; and if first from us, what will be the end of those who disobey the gospel of God?” Again, the judgment mentioned here is not the ultimate judgment in the future, but a temporary judgment during the course of this age.<p>First Peter 2:12 says, “Having your manner of life excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the matter concerning which they speak against you as evildoers they may, by your good works, as they see them with their own eyes, glorify God in the day of His visitation.” The Greek word for visitation here implies God’s intervening, God’s coming in to deal with man.<p>Second Peter 2:9 says, “The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of trial and how to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment.” Verse 7 of chapter three says, “But the heavens and the earth now, by the same word, have been stored up for fire, being kept unto the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.” These verses also speak concerning the government of God in this present time, showing us the subject of these two books.<p>In the two Epistles of Peter, the Holy Spirit clearly reveals to us God’s present government. The other Epistles contain something related to God’s government, but not so clearly as in these two Epistles. All humans on the earth are under the government of God. With any kind of government there are always rules and regulations. If we keep these regulations, we will be at peace, but if we trespass them, we will be in trouble. We may illustrate this by the government of a city carried out through the city hall. When we drive a car, we must obey all the traffic signs; otherwise, we will be issued a traffic citation or even have our driver’s license suspended. We must abide by the rules because a government is here. We should not think that today in the universe and on the earth among men there is no government of God. There is a government of God over humans on this earth.<p>It is due to the judgment and dealing of God in the present time, as revealed in the two books of Peter, that many of God’s people suffer. They suffer because they do something against God’s rule. Again, we may illustrate this principle with a policeman. Even if we break a law unconsciously, we cannot excuse ourselves in this way to a policeman. A policeman does not regard whether we violate the law consciously or unconsciously; he still will issue us a ticket. This illustrates that although God may seem to be loose with the unbelievers, He is not loose with His own children. First Peter 4:17 says that the judgment begins from the house of God. We should not think that because we are the children of God, He will favor us. Rather, He is very strict with us. Even before God’s final and ultimate judgment comes upon man, He still exercises His government over His children. Therefore, we as the children of God must be careful to keep all the rules in His government.<p>Peter’s first Epistle tells us that God’s government is for the profit of the believers, whereas his second Epistle tells us that God’s government is His punishment on the unbelievers. God’s dealing with His own children is for their profit, but God’s dealing with the unbelievers, the unrighteous, is for their punishment. God has a present, divine government in this universe and on this earth among men. We must learn to be governed by the many divine rules of this government. This is the subject of the two Epistles of Peter as books of supplementary teaching.
