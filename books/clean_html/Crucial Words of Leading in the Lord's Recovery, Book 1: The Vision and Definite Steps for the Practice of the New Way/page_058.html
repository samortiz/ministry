<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BRINGING THE CHURCH TO THE HOMES<br />
AND BRINGING THE SAINTS INTO THE TRUTH</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will speak about the principles of the home meetings, which are everyone speaking, no one assuming the headship, and every home having a meeting. In order to have everyone speaking, we need to begin with the training meetings of the co-workers and elders. This training of the co-workers and elders has continued for five or six weeks, yet the more we have met, the more silent many of us have become, and I have become the <em>de facto</em> &ldquo;head.&rdquo; It would be contrary to spiritual principle to ask all the saints to speak when we ourselves remain silent in the co-workers&rsquo; and elders&rsquo; meetings. If the co-workers and elders say nothing in these meetings, yet speak much when they return to their own localities, their speaking is a kind of performance. This is hypocrisy.</p>
<p>In translating the book of Matthew, we found out from the original language that the word <em>hypocrisy</em> actually means &ldquo;the putting on of a mask.&rdquo; This indicates a performance. In Greek this word means not merely a false show or pretense but the putting on of a mask or make-up; hence, it is a performance. For example, a young man can put on a mask of an old man and thus present himself as an old man. I hope that the co-workers and elders are not performing or putting on masks. Instead, everyone should be speaking. Instead of making me the &ldquo;head,&rdquo; all of us should forget about being the &ldquo;head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a person opens his mouth, he is immediately exposed. Matthew 26:73 tells us that after Peter denied the Lord three times, someone identified him, saying, &ldquo;You also are one of them, for your speech also makes it clear that you are.&rdquo; The best way to hide oneself and remain anonymous is to remain silent. But remaining silent is actually the putting on of a mask. Once we open our mouth, our real self is exposed. This should in fact be the way we are in the home meetings. We should be open to one another. There should not be any masks. We should come simply as we are. Once we come as we are, we are no longer pretentious, and it becomes easy to mutually support one another in spirit, to supply one another, and to be built up together. We must drop our masks and speak the truth in love. This is one secret to the home meetings.</p>
<p>At present, we are in &ldquo;the season of speaking&rdquo;; everyone should speak. If we do not speak, it is like a rainy season with no rain. I beg the elders and co-workers to open their mouths to speak because I want to know how we are all doing in the above three matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW WAY BEING THE LORD&rsquo;S LEADING<br />
IN HIS RECOVERY TODAY</h2>
<p>I hope we will understand that the new way is the Lord&rsquo;s leading among all the churches in His recovery today. We should not consider this matter to be merely my burden or concern. All of us need to change our concept and accept this burden as our burden. It will be difficult to carry out the new way if we do not have the same burden and feeling.</p>
<p>In order to have a feeling for this matter, we must first have a clear picture. Christianity has made all the life matters unclear and muddled, including the operation of the Spirit and the function of the Lord&rsquo;s word. Christianity has taken on many kinds of ways. For example, organization is one of their ways. Control is a way; outward arrangement is a way; fund-raising is another way. The effectiveness of Christianity today depends fully on these four ways: organization, control, arrangement, and fund-raising. If these four things are taken away from Christianity, nothing will be left.</p>
<p>We should examine the present condition of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the light of these four things. If we take away organization, control, arrangement, and fund-raising, will the church still exist? Before the Lord we have received a concern and burden to rid ourselves of these four things in His recovery. We want only the Lord&rsquo;s life, His Spirit, and His word. We do not want any organization, control, arrangement, or fund-raising.</p>
<p>In mainland China the Communists took these four things away from Christianity. They thought that by doing so, Christianity would be through. It is true that Christianity as a religion was through, but Christ is not through. The Lord&rsquo;s life, His Spirit, and His word are not through. The taking away of the above four matters actually provided an opportunity for greater growth. This surprised the Communists, so they began to organize their own kind of &ldquo;Christianity.&rdquo; Actually, they are atheists; they do not believe in Christ. Their purpose in organizing was to control, restrict, and thus curb Christianity. The enemy knows that if he fails to destroy the Lord&rsquo;s work through persecution, he can still resort to control through organization. Among the so-called Christian countries, the result of the development of such organization in Christianity has been the evolution of the clergy-laity system.</p>
<p>I would like to point out that we are not blind. The Lord has shown us clearly that while He was on earth, there was no organization, control, arrangement, or fund-raising. When He had needs, some of the women gave their money to minister to those needs and those of His disciples (Luke 8:2-3). In Acts the apostles did not resort to any kind of organization, control, arrangement, or fund-raising. However, I am afraid that the brothers and sisters are still under the influence of old concepts. They may have heard the truth, but the old concepts still remain with them. I hope that all the co-workers, elders, and full-time serving ones would rid themselves completely of these old concepts and fully pick up the new way that the Lord has led us to take in His recovery.</p>
<p>In the Bible we do not find such things as organization, control, arrangement, and fund-raising. The Bible reveals to us that God gave man life and breath, and He wants man to receive Him as life by taking the tree of life. Although man fell, Christ came to accomplish redemption. Furthermore, He became the Spirit to reach man and to speak to man. Life, the Spirit, and the word&mdash;these are the three precious things that God has given to man. From the beginning of the Old Testament, we find these three things, but Judaism came in and gradually developed a kind of organization. God sent the prophets to the Jews to speak to them, and the Spirit followed the prophets. Once the prophets spoke through the inspiration of the Spirit, life followed and worked on man. The picture is even clearer in the New Testament. The Lord Jesus came as life (John 11:25), and He came to speak God&rsquo;s word. Moreover, He gives to us the Spirit without measure (3:34). We need to preserve and maintain these three precious things&mdash;life, the Spirit, and the word. We must reject anything apart from these three things.</p>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;Do we still need the meeting halls?&rdquo; Strictly speaking, we can do without the meeting halls. The meeting halls are dispensable. We can meet even if we do not have the meeting halls. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He did not have any meeting hall, yet He met with the disciples all the same. A genuine church will increase continuously even when it does not have a meeting hall.</p>
<p>The four Gospels tell us that when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He used the Jewish synagogues. He was not there to participate in the so-called &ldquo;services&rdquo;; He went to call men out from the fold. He led people out of the Sabbath tradition on the Sabbath day. Christianity, however, has created another, new Sabbath; it has invented its modern &ldquo;synagogue.&rdquo; We also see this with the disciples of John the Baptist. John came out of Judaism and rejected the legal Jewish formalities, but his disciples created a new religion based on his work. This is regrettable. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;John came neither eating nor drinking&rdquo; (Matt. 11:18). John the Baptist did not eat or drink because he was for life, and he had the Spirit with him. However, his disciples preached abstinence as a religion. When they saw that the Lord dined and drank with sinners, they interrogated Him, saying, &ldquo;Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?&rdquo; (9:14).</p>
<p>Today we need to change our concept. For two thousand years God has been doing the work of recovery, the goal of which is to reject everything that is not of life, the Spirit, and the word. Eventually, however, man again has come up with an organization and a way of control. When John Wesley was raised up, he was full of the Spirit and life. But later, when the person was gone, the Spirit, the life, and the word left also, and all that remained was the Methodist Church. One hundred seventy years ago, the Brethren were raised up by the Lord in England. They rejected everything and upheld only the Lord&rsquo;s word. Brother Nee said that the light that came through their exposition of the Word poured out like a cascading waterfall, but among them today life is gone, the Spirit is gone, and the word is gone. The things that remain are the organizations, such as the &ldquo;Closed Brethren&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Open Brethren.&rdquo; We are fearful that we could end up the same way. We should learn the lessons from those who have gone before us.</p>
<p>This is the reason that I am fully determined to risk everything to knock down the old ways practiced by Christianity today and to &ldquo;sink them under the sea.&rdquo; I hope that the co-workers and elders could see this and respond to this burden. We should change our concept. We are not here for the big meetings, because the big meetings can take care of only some of the people. We must see that it is not enough to depend on the big meetings alone. This is not the way. There is no prospect and no future in this. The Lord Jesus did not go to the synagogue to build up the synagogue. He knew that there was no prospect and no future in such work. He went to the synagogue to gain a group of people. The apostle Paul did the same thing. He was clear that he was sent by God not to build up the synagogue but to bring people out of it. Dear brothers, if we see this, we need to preach this faithfully with all boldness.</p>
<p>In the book <em>Church Affairs</em> Brother Nee stressed that our Sunday morning message meeting is absolutely a practice of Catholicism and Protestantism. For us to continue in this way is to walk &ldquo;in the statutes of the nations&rdquo; (2 Kings 17:8). He proposed that we overturn this tradition of having a Sunday morning message meeting and change it instead to a gospel meeting. Although he spoke about this, the churches did not respond, and no church took the lead to do anything. If I were to ask today whether or not we want to maintain the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting as we have in the past, we may all say yes. However, if we do this, it will be difficult to promote the practice of the new way.</p>
<p>I do not mean that we should drop the big meetings or that we should disband them. It is good to utilize them, but it is not good to consciously build them up. This is similar to what the Lord Jesus and the apostles did. They utilized the synagogues, but they did not build up the synagogues. Brothers, we should all be clear about this, and we should pick up this burden to return to our localities to speak and promote this. The first task of a revolution is the work of propaganda. In the same way, in practicing the new way, we must first have the promotion. Recently I heard at least three brothers who stood up and said, &ldquo;We need to propagate Brother Lee&rsquo;s burden. We need to work out Brother Lee&rsquo;s burden.&rdquo; I beg you not to say this again. We must say, &ldquo;We need to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s burden. We need to propagate the things that God has entrusted to us.&rdquo; I hope that we all will have this concern and burden and that we will settle for nothing less than the complete overturn of all the old things.</p>
<p>Of course, we must still take care of the big Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting because there are still some people who prefer the big meetings. If we do not take care of the big meetings, these people will be lost. However, we must be clear that there is no future or prospect in building up the big meetings. We thank the Lord that recently all the big meetings have been changed to small meetings; each meeting has been split into different places. According to our old concept we wanted to see as many people as possible coming to the big meetings in order to gain new ones. But now in terms of practicing the new way, we would like to see fewer people in such meetings. If a day comes when only five people are left in the big meetings, we should jump for joy. Of course, if there is not an increase in the other meetings, we would mourn in sorrow. What I mean is this: If a day comes when we have five to six hundred people learning the truth in classes of forty or fifty each, but there are only five people left in the so-called big meetings, we should consider this a cause for celebration.</p>
<p>Today we still need to keep the door open to the big meetings. One day when no one &ldquo;comes to the shop&rdquo; any longer, we can &ldquo;close the shop.&rdquo; If, however, the big meetings become bigger and bigger in number, we should find the reason that they are increasing. Let me repeat: The practice of the new way takes care of all aspects of the church life. This is similar to what the Lord Jesus and the apostles did while on the earth. When Paul was in Philippi, he went to a place of prayer by the river (Acts 16:13). This was the place where the Jews and devout Gentiles would go for prayer. Paul did not go there to build up something. He was merely using that place to achieve his purpose. Today we need to do the same. We must use the big meetings, but we are not here to build up the big meetings. Sometimes when the saints have friends and relatives whom they want to bring into the church life, they prefer to bring them to the big meetings. The big meetings are still a place for gaining people. We still need to take care of these meetings, but our emphasis is the home meetings, and we must build up the home meetings.</p>
