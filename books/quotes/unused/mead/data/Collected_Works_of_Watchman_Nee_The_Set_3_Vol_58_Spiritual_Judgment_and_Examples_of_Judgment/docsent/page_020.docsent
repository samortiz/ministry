   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 7 Date:June 26, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER F. L.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a non-Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I heard the gospel in Chefoo and believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After I was saved I became very hungry for God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But I lived a vacillating and unsteady life for about half a year.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I worked in the courthouse and often was ridiculed by others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet I loved my Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is so glorious, rich, and real to me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand, I saw the perfection of the Lord, and on the other hand, I saw my own imperfections.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord did some stripping work in me, and for a few years I lived in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sister Peace Wang once said that poverty is necessary and that one does not know God's riches without poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I intended to migrate to northwest China for the gospel, but I was hindered by the outbreak of the war with Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During the subsequent years, I touched the Lord's love and could not stay away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At that time I understood how we can live with or without many things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The most important thing is to have the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as I have the Lord, I am satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the only satisfaction of my life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My relationship with the Lord is like that of a fish with water.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I cannot leave Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As soon as I leave Him, I will be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thank the Lord that I was granted permission to come to the mountain to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have a few questions, and I wonder whether Brother Nee can answer them for me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>1 What is the difference between dying with the Lord and the killing of the Lord's light?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2 If we want to preach the gospel, do we ask the Lord to give us a love for man's soul?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>3 Can we serve the Lord by taking up a secular profession?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>4 How do we separate the inner man from the outer man?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT Dying with the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>and Being Killed by His Light</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All of our experiences are of the Lord; they all are part of the Lord's experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is like saying that the experiences of a pregnant mother are the experiences of the fetus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Wherever the mother goes, the baby follows inside her womb.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hebrews speaks of the Lord being a priest superior to Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord was of the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to the flesh, He could not even be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Judah was the tribe of the king.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the Lord was made a priest according to the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the reason He was greater than Aaron, who was a priest according to the order of the tribe of Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Abraham was an ancestor of Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Melchisedec offered up sacrifices on behalf of Abraham, Aaron was still in Abraham's loins Heb 7:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This proves that Melchisedec was greater than Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In being a priest after the order of Melchisedec, Christ is greater than Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Levi offered one tenth of what he had to Melchisedec through Abraham because he was in Abraham's loins.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is like saying that the entire human race was in Adam's loins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When Adam sinned, the entire human race sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are included in the same act of sin; we have taken the same fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Individually speaking, I have never been to the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But in Adam I was there.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I was in Singapore, I met a pregnant sister.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>She visited Amoy for some time and later returned to Singapore.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When I visited Singapore a second time, her child had grown very much.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I asked the child if he had ever been to Amoy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The child said no. He had never been there as an individual, but he had been there in his mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is what it means to be crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although the child never saw Amoy while he was in his mother's womb, he was there in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Individually speaking he was never there.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But jointly speaking he was there.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Just as the death of Christ is a reality, our death in Him is also a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because I am in Adam, I do not have to commit the same sin as Adam; yet I am still as much a sinner as Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now I am in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Just as Christ was crucified, I was crucified as well.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Just as the Lord Jesus died, I have died also.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is what God has done through the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is what it means to be crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This answers half of your first question.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The killing of the Lord's light is something subjective in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When a man receives light, the death of the cross begins to work on him and strip him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When God takes away this and that from him, it is death operating in him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the meaning of 2 Corinthians 4:10, which says, "Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Everything human that has its origin in the self must be gradually removed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This work of the Lord is progressive and cumulative, with the result being "that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake....So then death operates in us, but life in you" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The first death relates to our crucifixion with the Lord; through this the problem of sin is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The second death relates to the self and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It strips the self and has nothing to do with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This conforms us to Christ more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is the killing work of the Lord's light.</S>
