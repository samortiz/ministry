   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE FORTY-FIVE FLOWING THE WATER OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Exo 17:6; John 4:14; 7:38; Rev 22:2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Bible we see that the drinking of the water of life and the flowing of the water of life go together.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The drinking is connected to the flowing, and the flowing is one with the drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In John 4:14 the Lord Jesus says, But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we see that if we drink the water of life, this water will become a spring within us welling up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This welling up is what we mean by the flowing of the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We find the same principle in John 7:37 and 38, where the Lord Jesus said of the one who believes in Him and drinks of Him, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The drinking and the flowing are thus two aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>DRINKING AND FLOWING</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without the flowing of the water of life, our drinking is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In fact, if we do not flow, we shall not be able to continue drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Drinking is nullified by the lack of flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The genuine drinking of the water of life depends on the flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let us use a water hose as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the one hand, the hose takes in water from the faucet; on the other hand, it flows out water.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Both the inflow and the outflow are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The receiving and the flowing take place simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we do not drink, we cannot flow; and if we do not flow, we cannot continue to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is a serious matter to have our drinking nullified by the lack of flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of the many genuine believers in Christ who have drunk of the living water, not many experience the flowing of this water.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, this causes their drinking to cease.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If there is no outflow from within you, you cannot continue to take in the living water by drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only the flowing can keep the inner current moving.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not the drinking, the taking in, that keeps the current going; it is the outflow of water which does this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many Christians either do not drink at all or find that their drinking avails nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The reason for this is that, even though they may drink, they do not flow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The lack of flowing causes the drinking to be of no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, in this message I am burdened to point out that concerning the experience of the living water the flowing of the water is even more important than the drinking of it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yes, our experience of the living water begins with drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if there is no flowing, there is no way for us to continue drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the flowing does not follow our drinking, our drinking will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our experience testifies that this is true.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE SERIOUSNESS OF LOSING OUR THIRST</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, the lack of flowing may cause our thirst to disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before we first drank of the living water, there was a thirst within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is very good to have such a thirst, but it is dreadful to lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The proper gospel preaching is not mainly to minister the water of life to others; it is to stir up a sense of thirst within them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When people are thirsty, it is easy to convince them to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Good salesmen know how to arouse in people the aspiration and desire to buy the product they are selling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Without such an aspiration or desire, people will have no interest, even in the most precious items.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This illustrates the fact that thirst is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By the Lord s mercy we have been made thirsty for Him through the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I can never forget how my thirst was aroused through hearing a certain gospel message more than fifty-five years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I was so thirsty that I could have drunk an ocean of water.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One message created a thirst within me that has lasted even until now.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although fifty-five years have passed since I heard that marvelous message, I still thirst for the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to be impressed how crucial it is to flow the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the flowing stops, our drinking will stop; and if our drinking stops, we shall lose our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then, before our thirst can be revived and recovered, we shall have to pass through a period of spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After passing through such a time of dryness, we shall be stirred up by the Lord in His sovereign mercy to repent and return to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our thirst will revive, and we shall begin to drink once more.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am deeply concerned about the degree of our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many among us have had the experience of losing our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we wish to maintain our thirst, we need to keep flowing and to keep drinking.</S>
