   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>NOVEMBER 1935 CHAPTER TEN HE FILLS THE HUNGRY</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>WITH GOOD THINGS Date: November 11, 1935, evening</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Place: Chuenchow</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Scripture Reading: Luke 1:53; Mark 10:51 GOD'S RICHES BEING RESERVED FOR THE HUNGRY</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must realize that God's blessing to man is based on one condition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order for God to bless a man, he must satisfy one condition: he must be hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"The hungry He has filled with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty" Luke 1:53 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are not hungry, we cannot expect to receive anything from God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's riches and grace are reserved for only one kind of people: those who are hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many people are often dissatisfied and unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, dissatisfaction and unhappiness are not necessarily the same as hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A man may be unhappy and dissatisfied, yet at the same time, refuse to seek for more because he is not hungry even though he is dissatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What does it mean to be hungry?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is being empty before God and feeling unfulfilled within.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>An empty and unfulfilled feeling is an impetus for a person to seek after God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, if a person is not hungry, he can sit in the same place for days without doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has promised to fill only those who are hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He has not promised to fill those who are dissatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who are full, that is, who think that they are rich, will be sent away empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>MISS BARBER'S EXAMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Miss Barber used to tell others that from her youth through her old age she had an eternal hunger for God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She told others that whenever her eyes were not set on the Lord, she would not feel hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But whenever her eyes were set on the Lord, she would be continually hungry before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She was hungry continually, and the Lord filled her continually.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today we find many believers who are dissatisfied, but we find very few who are hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The prodigal son in Luke 15 returned home because he was hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He could have filled himself with carob pods.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This would not have satisfied him, but neither would he have gone hungry, and he would not have thought about returning home.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the condition with many people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They live daily in dissatisfaction, yet their stomachs are filled with carob pods.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, we see that dissatisfaction is one thing, while hunger is another.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many believers know the doctrine of overcoming; they may even be able to give a message on overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They can lay out the doctrine on the overcoming life from the first point to the last and do a clear analysis of the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet they still have not overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is one thing to have the doctrine of the overcoming life, it is another thing to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The doctrine of the overcoming life is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who are smart and have a good memory can understand and remember it readily.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when they are faced with various circumstances, they find that they cannot overcome at all.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hearing a message on overcoming is not an end in itself; one does not overcome simply by listening to a message on overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only one kind of people will overcome: those who are hungry to experience it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God grants the overcoming experience to those who are hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a man is not hungry, he cannot live an overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today we need a hunger for God, because all those whom God uses and blesses are desperate ones.</S>
