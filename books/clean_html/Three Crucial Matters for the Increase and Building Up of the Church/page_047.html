<h2 class="head1">CHANGING THE SYSTEM TO LEARN THE TRUTH<br />
AND TO MEET THE NEED OF THE WHOLE EARTH</h2>
<p>The purpose of changing the system is so that every brother and sister will learn the truth. If any of the older saints are sixty years old and begin reading two verses from the Bible a day, they will only be seventy-one years old when they finish reading the New Testament, and they will still be very useful to the Lord. As a short-term benefit, if we read two verses a day, what we read will become very useful by the time we begin a home meeting in six months. We also hope to see the young generation gained by the Lord in this age.</p>
<p>Presently, there are about one thousand churches on six continents. The whole world is open to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, because the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has the proper ground and is full of the truth. Five hundred young saints who can speak Spanish and who can go to Central and South America would not be enough to meet the needs there. There is a need everywhere&mdash;in the United States, Canada, East Africa, West Africa, South Africa, and North Africa. Therefore, we must learn the truth. We should not take the easy way of listening to &ldquo;famous&rdquo; speakers. We need to take classes and be educated by learning the Bible word by word and item by item. If we practice this, we will achieve a definite educational standard in twenty years.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHANGING THE SYSTEM BEING RELATED TO<br />
CONTACTING THE LORD EVERY MORNING</h2>
<p>Changing the system is to help us to speak for the Lord; hence, we must cooperate. Previously, the brothers and sisters came to the meeting hall for morning watch every morning. We do not deny that having morning watch corporately is helpful. However, it is not sufficient to have morning watch without fellowshipping with the Lord in His presence. The blessing we receive from having corporate morning watch can never replace the personal contact we have with the Lord. We need to spend five to ten minutes to contact the Lord every morning. No matter how busy we are, we should grasp every opportunity to contact the Lord. Even while we bathe or take a walk, we can consider and meditate on the verses we read. This will be a great benefit to us. We should not contact any person, thing, or matter before we contact the Lord in the morning. This practice is included in our learning the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING A RESOLUTION TO LEARN THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>We need to make a resolution to learn the truth. We should not say, &ldquo;It is useless to make a resolution, because the result will be as Paul says: &lsquo;To will is present with me, but to work out the good is not.&rsquo;&rdquo; The Lord who is living in us will help us. Everything depends on whether we are willing to learn. The Lord said to Jerusalem, &ldquo;I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!&rdquo; (Matt. 23:37). Now the Lord is asking us, &ldquo;Will you contact Me for a few minutes every morning? Will you pray-read two verses? Will you learn <em>Truth Lessons</em> in the church meetings?&rdquo; Many people can testify that reading any kind of book, newspaper, or magazine cannot compare with reading the Bible. At my present age, I am still alert and sharp without any confusion because I have the words of the Lord in me all the time; His words in me are everything to me. I have joy whenever I read the Bible. Reading the Bible is good medicine for healing. The Lord&rsquo;s word is the factor of our happiness. If we speak the Lord&rsquo;s word every day, we will be healthy.</p>
<p>It is even more necessary for the older brothers and sisters to learn the truth. If we know the truth, we can teach our children and grandchildren, and when they live with us, our conduct and behavior will be proper. If the tongue of a grandfather is the pen of a ready writer (Psa. 45:1) and that home is filled with a scholarly atmosphere, the children and grandchildren who are living together will benefit greatly even if they have little contact with the grandfather. Similarly, the most basic requirement for all the brothers and sisters in the church to manifest their function is to learn and know the truth. Without an education in the truth, it is difficult for us to develop or manifest our function. This is the problem in today&rsquo;s Christianity, and it is also a big lack among us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING <em>TRUTH LESSONS</em> TO LEARN THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>I hope that after such fellowship, we will all learn the truth. The Lord has prepared <em>Truth Lessons</em> for us, and it is the best means for us to learn the truth. In order to use <em>Truth Lessons,</em> we must be prepared before we come to the meeting. There will be no need for us to pray as we did in the past: &ldquo;Lord, today Brother So-and-so will speak the message. Please strengthen him so that his words will penetrate our hearts. O Lord, touch all the brothers and sisters so that they will come to listen to the message.&rdquo; Such prayers are for listening to famous speakers; they are not prayers for the brothers and sisters to speak in the meetings. Instead, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I will learn the truth. Lord, bring new ones to us so that we can learn the truth together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We should not come to the meeting with the expectation of listening to a speech. When we come to a meeting, we should not wait for someone to lead us. When it is time to begin, we can open <em>Truth Lessons</em> and read. We do not even need to wait until everyone is present. When the latecomers arrive, they can join in the reading. During the meeting we can read with emphasis; we can also pray-read and sing-read. All the brothers and sisters should open their mouths. We should change our old concepts and not long for messages given by famous, eloquent speakers who use good stories and examples. We no longer have famous speakers. Every one of us is a small member, and none of us can speak well. Nevertheless, we cannot sit in a meeting and look at each other. We should exercise to call hymns and read the lessons. Everything should be carried out by the brothers and sisters themselves. We can give testimonies, pray, and pray-read. Such a meeting in which everyone functions is much better than a meeting by a famous speaker. May all the gatherings in the churches in Taiwan be like this in two or three years. May every gathering be living, with everyone speaking. We do not have idle talk in the meetings; neither do we consider everyday matters. In the meetings we speak concerning the Lord, the truth, and the gospel.</p>
