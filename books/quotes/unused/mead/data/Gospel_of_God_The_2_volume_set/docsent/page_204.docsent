   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ARGUMENT BASED ON HEBREWS 6:6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we have to consider Hebrews 6:1-8.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This passage presents the greatest problem in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Almost all the ones who doubt that salvation is eternal take Hebrews 6 as their city of refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All of them dig their support material from here.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They argue that if a man was saved and now has fallen away, it will be impossible for him to be renewed again to repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Would that not mean that such a person is through and is doomed to perish?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because many are not clear, they take this passage as reason for man's perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But we have to realize that the subject of Hebrews 6 is not salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It has nothing to do with salvation at all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If one wants to understand this passage, he must begin from the end of chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There it says that many who should be eating solid food are still taking milk.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to their age, this group of believers should have been the teachers already.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But they were still like babes and were not progressing, but were staying at the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, chapter six begins by saying, "Therefore leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us be brought on to maturity."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The subject of Hebrews 6:1 is therefore progress, and not salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you put the subject of salvation in, surely you will encounter difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The purpose of this chapter is to tell others how to progress, and not to tell us how to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first thing we must take note of is that the topic here is on progress to maturity, not regressing to perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The apostle was here talking about being brought on to maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verses 1 through 8 can be divided into three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can use three words to represent these three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first section is on having no need, the second section is on having no possibility, and the third section is on having no right.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This portion tells the Hebrew believers from these three standpoints that they have to progress.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, they have to leave the word of the beginning of Christ and should not lay again a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word of the beginning of Christ is like the cornerstone in a building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In building a wall, a person does not need two foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The apostle said that these ones had been talking about foundational things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the foundation was laid already; there was no need to lay the foundation again.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word of the beginning of Christ are teachings such as repentance from dead works, faith in God, baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All these are the words of the beginning of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The apostle said that these need to be done only once.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There was no need to do them again.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was exhorting them to go on to perfection.</S>
