<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(47)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 27, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER C. S.</h2><p>I was saved in 1938. For two years after I was saved, I was a prodigal son. I went into business in my own zeal but did not accomplish anything. Then I became sick for a few months. In desperation I knelt down to pray and confessed my sins with tears. Later I went to Chefoo and was touched by Brother Lee when he spoke on the kingdom of the heavens. I began to experience the discipline of the Holy Spirit. As a result, I resolved to choose Jesus and nothing else. At the time the Japanese surrendered, I also surrendered myself to the Lord. The Lord lives for me, and the brothers and sisters also lived for me. They sold their possessions, lent me money, and helped my business. Later I was able to return all the money. When I was in a bread-breaking meeting in Peking, I saw the Body life. I knew that I could not live without the Lord. As soon as I live unto myself, I lose my peace, but as soon as I live to the Lord, my peace comes back.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Brother Sun is a frank and zealous person. His words are bold, and he loves God. His pathway in the past has been straight. There are two ways in front of our brother. These two ways will result in two different kinds of Christians. Today I can advise Brother Sun to take either of these two ways. One is to soften himself before God and to restrain his speaking a little. This will cool our brother down a little and bridle his tongue. Once his tongue is bridled, his spirit will be purified. But if our brother takes this advice, he may lose his zeal as well as his boldness. Now he is released, but if he restrains himself, his thoughts may not be able to meet his needs. Now he is released, and his spirit is strong. These factors somewhat mitigate the poverty in his thoughts. If he restrains himself, his spirit will not be as strong, and his thoughts will not be able to meet his needs. The other advice I can give to our brother is to tell him to continue to be strong, zealous, released, and bold. (It is a delicate thing to help the brothers. The responsibility is great. There is always the danger of emphasizing one thing while neglecting something else.) If we advise him to be zealous, bold, and released, we must tell him that he must also match these things with a greater and purer spirit. But how can such a matching be accomplished? I do not have a ready answer. I will instead point out a way&mdash;the way of passing from death to resurrection.</p><p>The way that I will point out is the way of passing through death to resurrection. We all know that Peter was a strong and bold person. His words could influence others. He was a born leader. Yet he had not learned the adequate lessons before the Lord. God allowed him to fail miserably, even to the point of denying the Lord in front of a maid. Then his boldness was gone. A man who had boasted that he would die for the Lord denied Him with a curse. After the Lord resurrected, He went to Peter and restored him. He asked Peter three times, "Do you love Me?" Peter had lost all of his confidence. Yet he passed through death to resurrection. At Pentecost he was the one among the twelve disciples who stood up to speak. It was he who spoke at the Beautiful Gate in the temple to the lame man, saying, "Stand up and walk." It was he who spoke at the house of Cornelius. How bold he was when he spoke! Moses in the Old Testament was an able speaker. Yet at first he only had a fleshly boldness. He killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew. He was dealt with by the Egyptians and ran away into the wilderness. After a long period of time, he became weak. When God called him, he had lost all confidence in himself. He once considered himself very qualified to save the people of Israel, but when God sent him to Pharaoh, he was reluctant to take up the commission. He said that he was slow in speech. God comforted him and told him that Aaron would be his mouth. Yet in Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy, we do not hear Aaron speaking; Moses always did the speaking.</p><p>The stories of both Peter and Moses show us that something died within them. However, there was also something that did not die, something which rose from the dead. This is resurrection. If everything had died, there would have been no resurrection. However, if everything remained alive, there would have been no death. Resurrection means passing through death but not being held by death. Something comes out of death. Moses died completely to his speaking. He said that he was slow in speech. In resurrection, however, he did all the speaking. When the Lord asked Peter, "Do you love Me?", Peter dared not answer. It seemed as if everything had died. Yet eventually this same Peter fed the Lord's lambs and loved Him. If we bury a book in the ground, it will remain there until the Lord comes back; it will remain dead. If we bury a seed in the ground, however, part of it will die, but part of it will not die. The part that does not die will sprout because it has life in it. The same principle applies to those who have God's life; there is a part in them which will not die. This part is the resurrection life, the life of God. Resurrection means allowing the parts that can die to die and allowing the parts that will not die to live.</p><p>In Brother Sun's case, if by weakening himself a little, he ends up being truly weakened, we could only say that there is death but no resurrection. Therefore, it is not a simple thing to exhort others to accept the dealings of the cross. If a brother who is full of the flesh is dealt with, everything with him will be terminated; nothing will remain, because everything will have died. If anything in him is after God's will, it will remain after passing through the cross. This is resurrection. Some are very zealous in the work, in the gospel, and in their love for the Lord. But as soon as they are dealt with, they sink into the ground and give up everything. Yet in Peter and Moses, we see many things which did not die. They passed through the cross and came out on the other side. What emerges from resurrection is something totally different because it bears the mark of the cross; something fresh and living emerges that is pleasing to God. We can exhort Brother Sun to accept the cross so that his natural strong points can be eliminated. Anything in him that passes through death and resurrection will be accepted by God. He still will be as bold and zealous as before, but it will be accompanied by the wound of the cross. Some people have said that those who are good at conducting revival meetings in the denominations become powerless and quiet once they join us. We need to ask such ones how much of what they have is beyond death. This is a good test. Peter's boldness after his experience of death and resurrection was many times greater than his boldness before death. Previously, he was afraid of a little maid. But eventually he was not afraid of even Roman soldiers and prison.</p>
