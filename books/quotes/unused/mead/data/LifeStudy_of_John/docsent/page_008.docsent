   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Word the Definition, Explanation,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Expression of God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Word is the definition, explanation, and expression of God; hence, it is God defined, explained, and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He needs the Word to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you want to appear mysterious, the best way to do it is to be silent, for the more silent you are, the more mysterious you become.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the more you talk, the more you expose yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All that is deep within you is revealed by your words.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the meaning of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although God is a mystery, Christ as the Word of God defines, explains, and expresses Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, this Word is the definition, explanation, and expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, this Word is God Himself, not God hidden, concealed, and mysterious, but God defined, explained, and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Word is not the invisible God, but the very God who is visible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the beginning this Word was with God; it was not separate from God, but always had God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. The Word with God</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John 1:1 says that the Word was with God, and verse 2 says, He was in the beginning with God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Word was always with God and always had God in Him; He was never separate from God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When many of the young people are away from home, they receive loving letters from their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These letters are a word from their mother or father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Suppose you receive a letter from your father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That letter is your father s word coming to you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, when that word comes to you, it cannot be a word with your father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although the letter is the word of your father, it is not a word with your father, for you and your father are actually far away from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that the word of your father is separate from your father himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is different with Christ as the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Never think that this Word was separate from God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No, this Word was and always is with God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Word comes, God comes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Word is present, God is present.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Word is with God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, we have another clause in 1:1 telling us that the Word was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>C. The Word Being God</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The last clause of 1:1 says, The Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Never try to understand the Bible merely according to the black and white letters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This verse says that, as the Word, Christ was both with God and was God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Are Christ and God one or two?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If He and God are one, why does the Bible say that He was with God?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How can these two statements be reconciled?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot reconcile them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this verse we find the secret to understanding the whole Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In subsequent messages we shall see many points similar to this one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, the Lord said to Nicodemus, And no one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Where is He in heaven or on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should simply say, Hallelujah, He is both here and there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He can be both here and there because He is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although we cannot figure it out, we nevertheless have a clear word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Just accept the word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although we cannot reconcile all the clauses in this verse, we should simply accept this verse as God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>John s writings were brief, but he was very careful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was aware that some might argue with him, saying, He was with God and He was God, but He was probably not with God from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the beginning He was the Word, but He was not with God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At a later time the Word came to be with God and eventually became God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you read church history, you will discover that even in the first century there was a school of thought which claimed that originally Christ was not God and that only at a certain time did He become God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, John added verse 2, not as a mere repetition of a part of verse 1, but as a confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He was in the beginning with God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ was with God, and was God from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the beginning, that is, from eternity past, the Word was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is not, as supposed by some, that Christ was not with God and was not God from eternity past, and that at a certain time Christ became God and was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christ s deity is eternal and absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>From eternity past to eternity future, He is with God, and He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is why in this gospel there is no genealogy regarding Him as in Matthew 1 and Luke 3.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this gospel He is without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life Heb 7:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We all must be very clear that our Christ was with God and was God from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He was the Word with God from the beginning.</S>
