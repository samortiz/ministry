   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PRAISING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verses 24 through 28 we have the matter of praising God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. Praising God That His Enemies</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Have Seen His Goings in the Sanctuary</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"They have seen Your goings, O God,/The goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary" v. 24 . Here "they" refers to the enemies, to the unbelievers; "goings" refers to God's activities; and the "sanctuary" signifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to appreciate this part of Psalm 68, we need to be familiar with the background.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At Mount Sinai God decreed the law and charged Moses to build the tabernacle with the ark and all the various furnishings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The erecting of the tabernacle was a kind of ceremony.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the children of Israel were assembled and, after everything had been arranged, the ark was brought in. I believe that, as verse 25 indicates, while the ark was being carried into the tabernacle, there was a procession of virgins and singers who went before the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the rear there might have been another group composed not of virgins but of males from the tribes of Benjamin, Judah, Zebulun, and Naphtali v. 27 . This move of the ark was an activity of God, for God was with the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, the ark's activity was God's activity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, since Israel had been at Sinai for a long time, the peoples in the surrounding regions must have heard that something important was taking place and might have come to see what was happening.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, this ceremony might have been observed not only by the children of Israel but also by a number of Gentiles who had come to witness the ceremony.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. By the Virgins Sounding the Tambourines</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Singers go before; players after;/In the midst of virgins sounding the tambourines" v. 25 . Here the praise is by the females, by the virgins as singers going before and players after.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this verse "virgins" signifies the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>C. Blessing God in the Congregations</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>by Men Who Are of the Fountain of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"Bless God in the congregations,/Even Jehovah, O you who are of the fountain of Israel./There are little Benjamin, who rules them,/And the princes of Judah in their company, /The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali./Your God has commanded your strength;/Strengthen, O God, that which You have done for us" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we have the blessing of God by the men, signifying the strong ones.</S>
