   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Implanted Word and the Saving of the Soul</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>James 1:21 says, "Therefore putting away all filthiness and the abundance of malice, receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our spirit needs to be regenerated, and our soul needs to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The way for our soul to be saved is by the implanted, grafted word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Coming of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>James 5:7-8 says, "Therefore be long-suffering, brothers, until the coming of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Behold, the farmer eagerly awaits the precious fruit of the earth, exercising long-suffering over it until it receives the early and late rain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You also be long-suffering; establish your hearts because the coming of the Lord has drawn near."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Greek word for coming here is not the common word for coming.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is parousia, meaning the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All of the foregoing matters regeneration, every perfect gift, the crown of life, the kingdom, the indwelling Spirit, grace, the devil, the church, the implanted word, the saving of the soul, and the coming of the Lord are the major items of this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Under the Influence of Judaism but Still Touching the Line of Life</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, James was still under the influence of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Acts 21:18-21 helps us to realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These verses say, "And on the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And having greeted them, he related one by one the things which God did among the Gentiles through his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And when they heard it, they glorified God and said to him, You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed; and all are zealous for the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And they have been informed concerning you that you are teaching all the Jews throughout the nations apostasy from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At this time James advised the apostle Paul to keep the formalities of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul agreed to do that, and due to this he was subsequently arrested.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From this portion of Acts we can see that even James and perhaps the elders with him were still zealous for Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>James is the earliest of all the Epistles, written around A.D. 50, before the time of Acts 21.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although this book has the background of Judaism, the writer still stresses things such as the new birth, every perfect gift, the crown of life, the kingdom of God, the indwelling Spirit, the devil, the church, the saving of the soul, and the coming of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In principle, the teaching in this book is the same as the New Testament teaching; it is still in the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When reading this book, however, many Christians are distracted by the background and do not see that this is also a book concerning life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>TWELVE ISSUES OF LIVING FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From the point of view of the whole New Testament, the book of James is a supplement to the teaching of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many believe that as long as they have faith, that is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, living faith must be confirmed by its issue, its result.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Living faith must have fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If someone claims that he has living faith, he must bring forth fruit from this faith as a confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the main purpose of the book of James.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>James gives us twelve particular items as the issue of living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Having a Faith That Is Living</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First of all, our faith must be a living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is particularly dealt with in chapters one and two 1:3, 6; 2:1, 5, 14-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Having a Prayer Life</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Second, if we have living faith, we will have a prayer life; we will pray much 5:13-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>History tells us that James was a man of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more faith we have, the more we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Prayer is an issue, the fruit, of living faith.</S>
