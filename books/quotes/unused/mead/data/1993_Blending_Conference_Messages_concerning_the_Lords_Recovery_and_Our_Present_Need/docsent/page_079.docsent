   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Endeavoring to Be Vitalized</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second thing we need is to be vital.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need the proper speaking, the proper prophesying, but we cannot be dead or lukewarm.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to be vital, which means that we have to be living and active.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second point of my loving word to you dear ones is this: learn to be vital.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You should not be passive.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thank the Lord and praise God that we could have this big blending conference.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this short time, by His mercy and grace, we have covered six crucial points of the major items in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We believe that we are in the Lord's up-to-date recovery, and we believe that we are this recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But I feel very regretful to say that according to our present practical condition we are not vital, not living or active to the extent that we should be.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is of a certainty that we have the light and the truth concerning the Lord's up-to-date recovery, which is very rich and very high.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, we have to humbly admit that we are not vital, not living or active to the extent that we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because we are not vital, we feel deeply that our situation is not satisfactory to the Lord either.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So we have to look to the Lord's mercy and grace desperately to get ourselves vitalized and to help others be vitalized.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be vitalized is our need today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whether we pray or fast, whether we pursue by ourselves or seek with others, at any rate, we must be vitalized.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I believe that we have overcome many items of today's degradation in the churches, but we cannot escape the condemnation that we have tolerated and still are tolerating the deadness of Sardis and the lukewarmness of Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the beginning of the messages given in this blending conference, I gave an opening word concerning this crucial matter, a matter of life or death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not know how much you have been touched by that short, opening word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you have not been touched by that begging word, regardless of how much you would appreciate the following six messages, the outcome will mean nothing to you and to the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>So today, the crucial point is that you have to be vitalized.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To have the vital groups should not be taken as a kind of movement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be vital, to be vitalized, is an extremely personal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is only possible to be vitalized if you yourself are pressed by the Lord to pursue Him desperately and absolutely in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After being vitalized, you should not have a gathering of many saints to promote or to push this matter as a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After being vitalized, the only thing you should do is to seek the Lord's leading concerning whom you should contact among so many saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You should absolutely follow the Lord's leading, and even His guidance, to contact others and fellowship with them, not more than two or three at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You have to give your testimony of how you have been pressed by the Lord to seek Him in the matter of vitalization.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have to initiate a thorough and intimate fellowship with your contact, which will usher you and your contact into prayers of desperation, which will be honored by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You should also lead your contact to make thorough confessions to the Lord and also help him to pay the price at any cost as you have done.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By this way a small group would spontaneously come into existence which will be vital, living, and active in the Lord's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the number of such a vital group increases to ten or more, you should split it into two groups and charge every member in this kind of group to practice the vitalization along the same track as you have been doing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since you have been vitalized and have raised up such vital groups, you should pray for the church and the leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the Lord leads, you should give testimonies in the church meetings, but not in the way of condemning or of promoting or pushing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Avoid the thought to change the church's way of meeting and service.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not initiate any movement of changes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Prayer is needed, but any thought for any radical change must be avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After you get vitalized, do not despise anyone, especially the leading ones, the elderly ones, and the ones who are used to rendering help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not look down on the weaker ones, the indifferent ones, and the ones that seem to be without any care for spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In conclusion, you should not expect to see that the church is altogether uniform and unified according to your view and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church is not artificial by man's doing, but organic in the growth of the divine life with the growth of Christ in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is my burden in this concluding word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please pay attention to these two matters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First, learn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second, endeavor to be vitalized.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Speaking and vitalization are the crucial need among us today for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>W.L.</S>
