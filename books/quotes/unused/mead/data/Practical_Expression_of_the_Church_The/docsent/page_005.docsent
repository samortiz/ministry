   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen the purpose of God in chapter one, and we must now see the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God planned the church for the purpose of expressing Christ; thus, the church is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But how can the church be the expression of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In what way can the church express Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The only way is by the church being the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE CHURCH THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you consider yourself, you will realize that your body is your expression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without a body, we cannot express ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In like manner, there is no way for Christ to be expressed by the church except by it being His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And in saying that the body is the expression, we must realize that the body is always one with the head in life and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our body is one life and one nature with our head.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This tells us that the church is one with Christ in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, according to life and nature, Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is not only the Head, but He is also the Body, because the Body's life is Christ and the Body's nature is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Body is Christ, and Christ is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Bible there is an excellent type regarding Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is the type of Adam and Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Strictly speaking, God did not create a man and a woman; He only created one man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then how did the woman come into being?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The wife was just a part of the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God put Adam to sleep, broke his side, and took out a rib.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was a part of Adam, and this part became his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What, then, is Eve?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eve is only a part of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, it is absolutely right to say that Adam is Eve, because Eve is a part of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all know, according to Ephesians 5, that this is a type.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ was the last Adam, and God put Him to sleep on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His side was broken, and out of His side came blood and water John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Blood signifies redemption and water life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Both are needed to produce the spiritual Eve, the spiritual bride, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need this vision and revelation to see what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church is simply the counterpart of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church is a part of Christ, a product of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She is something that came out of Christ, something produced of Christ and something which is a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Body can never be separated from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A complete person has both a head and a body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today the church is simply the Body to Christ, a Body that is produced out of Christ and a Body that is part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why Ephesians 1:22-23 tells us that the church is the Body, and the Body is the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ is the One who fills all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is universally great, and this universally great Christ needs a Body to be His fullness, His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE RICHES OF CHRIST AND THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Ephesians 1:23, we have "the fullness of Him that filleth all in all."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then in Ephesians 3:8 we see "the unsearchable riches of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is the difference between the fullness of Christ and the riches of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not difficult for us to realize the meaning of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This must be all the items of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As God, He is the Father, the Son, the Spirit, the Lord, the Christ, and other items.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As man, Christ is the Apostle, the Teacher, the Leader, etc. He is really much more than all this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is the light, the life, the air, the water, the food, the clothing and the lodging.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is all of this and more to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are countless items of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What then is the fullness?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The fullness is the issue of the enjoyment of all the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When all the riches of Christ have been enjoyed and assimilated by us, then we will have the issue of the enjoyment of Christ's riches.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The issue is the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have used the riches of America to illustrate this many times: the milk, the cows, the eggs, the chickens, the peaches, the plums and many other things are the riches of America.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But the fullness of America is the issue of enjoying these riches.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, consider some men who are physically very large.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In a sense they are not the riches of America, but the fullness of the riches of America.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How could they be so large?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is because they are composed of so many American chickens, cows, eggs, milk, and so forth.</S>
