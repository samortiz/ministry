[2]  13-36 Forsaking Jerusalem with its temple 23:37-39 The prophecy of the kingdom 24:1 25:46 Concerning Israel 24:1-31 From Christ's ascension to the consummation of the age vv.
[3]  24 And Jesus answered and said to the chief priests and elders of the people , I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.
[4]  There was a man, a 1 householder, who planted a 1 vineyard and put a hedge around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower; and he leased it out to 1 vinedressers and went abroad.
[5]  2 The 1 kingdom of the heavens has become like a 2 king who prepared a 3 wedding feast for his 2 son.
[6]  3 And he sent his 1 slaves to call those who had been called to the wedding feast, yet they would not come.
[7]  In the foregoing parable 21:33-46 the Lord illustrated how the Jews, who were in the kingdom of God, would be punished, and how the kingdom of God would be taken from them and given to the kingdom people.
[8]  He has received Christ as his righteousness that he might be justified before God 1 Cor 1:30; Rom 3:26 , but he has not lived Christ out as his subjective righteousness Phil 3:9 that he might participate in the enjoyment of the kingdom of the heavens.
[9]  1 Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples,
[10]  2-3 ; 2 binding heavy burdens and laying them on the shoulders of others, but not moving them with their finger v. 4 ; 3 doing all their works to be seen by men v. 5a ; 4 broadening their phylacteries and enlarging the fringes of their garments v. 5b ; 5 loving the place of honor at the dinners and the chief seats in the synagogues v. 6 ; 6 loving the salutations in the market places and being called Rabbi by men v. 7 ; and 7 a behavior that is in contrast to the humility of the kingdom people vv.
[11]  39 For I say to you, You shall by no means see Me from now on until you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.
[12]  1 And Jesus came out 1 from the 2 temple and was going away, and His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the 2 temple.
[13]  3 And as He sat on the 1 Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us, 2 When will these things be?
[14]  During the period of His parousia there will be the great tribulation v. 21; Rev 9:1-21; 11:14; 16:1-21 , which will begin with supernatural calamities Rev 6:12-17; 8:7-12 ; Christ's descending to the air Rev 14:14 ; the rapture of the majority of the believers to the air 1 Thes 4:15-17 ; the judgment seat of Christ 2 Cor 5:10 ; and the marriage of the Lamb Rev 19:7-9 . See the chart "The Seventy Weeks and the Coming of Christ, with the Rapture of the Saints" at the end of the New Testament.
[15]  6 And you will be hearing of 1 wars and rumors of wars.
[16]  These tribulations, along with the preaching of the gospel v. 14 , are used by God to produce His many sons so that He can constitute the church in this age, accomplish the kingdom in the coming age, and produce the New Jerusalem in eternity as the ultimate consummation of the church and the kingdom that He may have an eternal expression in eternity future.
[17]  15 1 Therefore when you see the 2 abomination of 3 desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the 4 holy place let him who reads understand ,
[18]  27 For just as the 1 lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
[19]  30 And at that time the 1 sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the 2 tribes of the 2 land will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming 3 on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
[20]  The evil slave in verse 48 is a saved believer, as seen in the fact that 1 he was appointed by the Lord v. 45 , 2 he called the Lord "my Master," and 3 he believed that the Lord was coming.
[21]  51 1 Referring to being cut off from the glorious Christ, from the glory of His kingdom, and from His glorious presence in His kingdom, unable to participate in Christ and the glory of His kingdom in the manifestation of the kingdom, which the faithful slaves will enjoy v. 45; 25:21, 23 . This corresponds with cast out into the outer darkness in the conclusion of the parable of the talents 25:14-30 , which completes this section, vv.
[22]  Outline The King's being rejected 12:1 27:66 The prophecy of the kingdom 24:1 25:46 Concerning Israel 24:1-31 From Christ's ascension to the consummation of the age vv.
[23]  1 At that time the 1 kingdom of the heavens will be likened to 2 ten 3 virgins, who took their 4 lamps and 5 went forth to meet the 6 bridegroom.
[24]  2 And 1 five of them were 2 foolish and 1 five were prudent.
[25]  14 For the kingdom of the heavens is just like a 1 man about to go 1 abroad, who called his own 2 slaves and delivered to them 3 his possessions.
[26]  20 And he who had received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, Master, you delivered to me five talents; behold, I have gained another five talents.
[27]  31 But when the Son of Man comes in His glory and all the angels with Him, at that time He will sit on the throne of His glory.
[28]  32 And all the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
[29]  In the millennium there will be three sections: 1 the earth, where the blessing of God's creation will be, as mentioned in Genesis 1:28-30; 2 the nation of Israel in Canaan, from the Nile to the Euphrates, from which the saved Jews will rule over the whole earth Isa 60:10-12; Zech 14:16-18 ; and 3 the heavenly and spiritual section 1 Cor 15:50-52 , the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, where the overcoming believers will enjoy the kingdom reward Matt 5:20; 7:21 .
[30]  35 For I was 1 hungry and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me a drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in,
[31]  37 Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, Lord, when have we seen You hungry and have fed You, or thirsty and have given You a drink?
[32]  Outline The King's being rejected 12:1 27:66 The prophecy of the kingdom 24:1 25:46 Concerning the church 24:32 25:30 A parable for watchfulness 25:1-13 A parable for faithfulness 25:14-30 Concerning the nations 25:31-46 Christ coming to be enthroned in glory v. 31 Gathering all the nations for the exercising of judgment vv.
[33]  We have seen that the section of the prophecy of the kingdom concerning the church covers two aspects: life and service.
[34]  1 And when Jesus finished all these words, He said to His disciples,
[35]  6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the 1 leper,
[36]  7 A woman came to Him, having an alabaster flask of ointment of great value, and she poured it on His head as He reclined at table.
[37]  Being grateful to the Lord and loving Him, he spread a feast v. 7 in his house for the Lord and His disciples in order to enjoy His presence.
[38]  17 Now on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the passover?
[39]  31 Then Jesus said to them, You will all be stumbled because of Me this night, for it is written, "I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered."
[40]  When He returned from praying the first time, He found the disciples sleeping v. 40 . The Lord Jesus had told them seriously that His soul was "exceedingly sorrowful, even to death," and He had asked them to watch with Him v. 38 . When the Lord came back after praying the third time, the disciples were still sleeping.
[41]  49 And immediately he Judas came to Jesus and said, 1 Rejoice, Rabbi, and kissed Him affectionately.
[42]  The Lord was the Son of Man on the earth before His crucifixion, has been the Son of Man in the heavens at the right hand of God since His resurrection Acts 7:56 , and will be the Son of Man even at His coming back on the clouds.
[43]  69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a 1 servant girl came to him and said, You also were with Jesus the Galilean.
[44]  Outline The King's being rejected 12:1 27:66 The completion of rejection 26:1 27:66 The fourth unveiling of the crucifixion 26:1-2 Plotted against by religion 26:3-5 Loved by the beloved disciples 26:6-13 Betrayed by the false disciple 26:14-16 Keeping the last passover 26:17-25 Establishing the King's feast 26:26-30 Warning the disciples 26:31-35 Pressed in Gethsemane 26:36-46 Arrested by religion 26:47-56 Judged by the Sanhedrin 26:57-68 Denied by Peter 26:69-75 Crucial Points
[45]  After the prophecy of the kingdom, the Lord told His disciples that in two days the Passover was coming and that the Son of Man was being delivered up to be crucified.
[46]  Matthew 26:3-5 reveals that the Lord Jesus was plotted against by religion.
[47]  Although the religionists hated the Lord Jesus, His disciples loved Him vv.
[48]  1 Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.
[49]  2 And having bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to 1 Pilate the governor.
[50]  Matthew 27:34-35, 38-40, 42, 45-46, 48, 50
[51]  51 And behold, the veil of the temple was split in two from top to bottom, and the earth was shaken and the rocks were split,
[52]  54 Now the centurion and those with him guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that happened, became greatly frightened, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
[53]  Matt 5:10 Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
[54]  20 For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
[55]  6:33 But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
[56]  1 Now late on the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the 1 first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave.
[57]  2 And behold, there was a great 1 earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended out of heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.
[58]  16 And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus directed them.
[59]  17 And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him, though some doubted.
[60]  The disciples baptized the new converts Acts 2:38 not only into water but also into the death of Christ Rom 6:3-4 , into Christ Himself Gal 3:27 , into the Triune God v. 19 , and into the Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:13 . Hence, the baptism ordained by the Lord here baptizes people out of their life into the Body life for the kingdom of the heavens.
[61]  Outline The King's being rejected 12:1 27:66 The completion of rejection 26:1 27:66 Judged by Pilate 27:1-26 Mocked by the heathen soldiers 27:27-32 Crucified 27:33-56 Killed and mocked by men vv.
