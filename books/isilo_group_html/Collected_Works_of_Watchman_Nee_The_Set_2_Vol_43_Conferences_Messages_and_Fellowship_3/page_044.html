Paul knew of Christ according to the flesh, but in 2 Corinthians 5:16, he said that "now we know Him so no longer." Christ was God putting on the flesh. He was the Word incarnated on the earth to become a man. The flesh was like a garment to the Lord. In His incarnation, He put on the flesh. After His death and resurrection, He put on the Holy Spirit. He put on the flesh; then He put on the Holy Spirit. Before His death the Holy Spirit was in Him; after His resurrection He was in the Holy Spirit. When He was on the earth, the Holy Spirit was present with the disciples through Christ; after His resurrection, Christ was present with the believers through the Holy Spirit. First, the Holy Spirit came through Christ. Now Christ has come through the Holy Spirit. First, Christ was in the flesh. Now Christ is in the Holy Spirit. Paul knew of Christ according to the flesh. This means that he only knew of the Christ who had put on the flesh. But in 2 Corinthians, he no longer knew of Him in this way. This means that he knew the Christ who had put on the Holy Spirit.</p><p>There is a big difference between putting on the flesh and putting on the Holy Spirit. When Christ was living in the flesh, He was always limited by time and space. When He was in Galilee, He could not be in Bethsaida. If He was in one place, He could not be in another place at the same time. By putting on the flesh, Christ became a Savior outwardly. If He was by the sea, He could not be in an inland region. The disciples were at times close to Him and at times far away from Him; they could not be with Him all the time. If Christ were in Judea and we were in Singapore, we could not follow Him every day. When He became Christ in the flesh, He became a Savior outwardly. If He had remained this way, what could we do? We could go to worship Him in Jerusalem three times a year. We could draw near to Him in this way, but once we left Jerusalem, we would be far away from Him again. When we were in the right place, we could be with Him, but when we were not in the right place, we could not be with Him. This is the Christ in the flesh.</p><p>But Christ is no longer in the flesh. Through His death He put off the flesh, and in resurrection He took on a spiritual body. After His resurrection, He put on another garment; He put on the Holy Spirit, and He is now in the Holy Spirit. His birth in Bethlehem was His first coming. During the first coming He put on the flesh. After His death and resurrection, He put on the Holy Spirit, and He is now living within us. The Holy Spirit is Christ. At one time the Holy Spirit lived in the earthly Christ; now the resurrected Christ lives in the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is not physical; He is omnipresent. Since Christ is in the Spirit, He can live in us. Since Christ resurrected for us, we can receive Him through faith and regeneration.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, have you seen this? The tree of life has now produced fruit. Originally, it was a tree; there was life, but no one could eat it. No one can take in the life of a tree. But once a tree bears fruit, the life of the tree gets into the fruit, and when one eats the fruit, he takes in the life of the tree. When the Lord was a man, we could not receive Him into our spirit. But now that He is in the Holy Spirit, we can receive Him into us as our life. Thank the Lord that Christ is no longer an outward, objective Savior; He is our life within. The descending of the Holy Spirit is crucial. Without the descending of the Holy Spirit, Christ could not be in the Spirit, and man could never be one with Him. Thank the Lord that today we are in Christ and that we are one spirit with Him. God's salvation is complete. He caused Christ to die and resurrect. Now Christ can live within us. This completes what He did not complete in Adam.</p><p>This is the meaning of "another Comforter" (John 14:16). What does the word another mean? It means that there is a second one. It implies that there is a first and a second. The Lord was the first Comforter, and the Holy Spirit is another Comforter. Christ has become our Comforter in the Holy Spirit. We no longer have to be orphans (vv. 17-18). He has given us the strength for our journey and has made us sons of God. Today every believer can be in Christ and receive God's life into him. Not only have we been forgiven and not only has the old man been crucified, but God's life is now living within us. In the Bible this life is represented by the flesh.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 43: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (3) &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
