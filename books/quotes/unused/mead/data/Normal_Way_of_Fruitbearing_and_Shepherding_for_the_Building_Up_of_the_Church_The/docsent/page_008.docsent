   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING A CHANGE IN OUR DISPOSITION TO CARE FOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE YOUNGER ONES IN THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Having a burden to care for others requires us to have a change in our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Too many of us still hold on to our natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not contact people and invite them to our homes because they are not the same as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since we are the only ones who match our disposition, we only invite ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, all nursing mothers are forced by their children to change their ways.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A certain proverb says, No mother can change her children, but all the children can change the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, some mothers who can be changed by their children resist being changed by others in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first time the Lord met Peter and Andrew, He told them, Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men Matt 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From that time on, their business was no longer fish; it was men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the Lord was resurrected, He came back to Peter and said, Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?...Feed My lambs John 21:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord made the disciples fishers of men and feeders of lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is to bear a burden to care for people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Song of Songs the Lord s seeker asked Him, Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>/ Where do you make it lie down at noon?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord answered, If you yourself do not know, / You fairest among women, / Go forth on the footsteps of the flock, / And pasture your young goats / By the shepherds tents 1:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While we are seeking after the Lord, He will still remind us to follow the church and take care of the young goats.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not be a seeker of the Lord without any young goats.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Too many of us do not have younger ones under our care in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a great shortcoming, and we must look to the Lord for the remedy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one should take the excuse that he is not gifted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although no woman is gifted to be a mother, as a female, she is qualified to be a mother.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As long as we are Christians, we all have a talent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the parable of the talents in Matthew 25:14-30, the Lord said that there are three kinds of servants one with five talents, one with two, and one with one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The least number of talents is one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have at least one talent, and we need to use it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everyone can take care of three or four younger Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This word is not a rebuke; it is the speaking of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since you love the Lord and His recovery, I would beg you to bring this matter to the Lord and pray for the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All our other concepts and dissenting thoughts are of no value.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should let the elders bear their responsibility and take the lead, and we should simply follow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What we need to do is pick up the burden to care for the younger ones, to feed the lambs in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord s recovery is not the recovery of the elders; it is the recovery of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If all the saints function in this way, we do not need to worry about how good and capable the elders are.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>DENYING OUR DISPOSITION AND CARING</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>ONLY TO BEAR A BURDEN FOR PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to our disposition, we like to contact people who match our taste.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, in order to invite people and care for them, we should not have a particular taste.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must receive the believers because the Lord has received them Rom 14:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This requires us to deal much with our natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our disposition must be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not merely a change of our behavior; this kind of change is short-lived.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, we need the Lord to touch our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some of us are too quick, and some of us are too slow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some are too strict, and some are too loose.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we mean business to love the Lord and be for His recovery, we must first have a heart for the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should pray, Lord, if I cannot bring one sinner to You in one year, I simply cannot go on.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lord, I am desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You need to give me at least one sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Second, we must care for the young ones, and if there are no young ones, we can still fellowship with the other saints for mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In order to have this kind of heart and burden, we desperately need our disposition to be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The greatest hindrance to our usefulness is our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to let the Lord touch our disposition, and we need to deny it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Practically speaking, to deny the self is simply to deny the disposition Matt 16:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are useless and out of function mainly due to our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we deny our disposition, we will become very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may be very accustomed to our disposition and have no consciousness of it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the church life there are many kinds of dispositions.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Someone may never do anything unless the elders ask him to.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He may take the excuse that he does not want to act independently, but deep in his heart he actually desires the honor of being asked by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a shame, not an honor.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the heavenly account this may be a debit instead of a credit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Romans 14:10 says that we must give an account to the Lord at the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord will ask us to show Him the credits in our account, but when we show Him something, He may say, No, this is a debit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You did this only to gain respect and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Others, however, are at the other extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They will do many things as long as the elders do not touch them, but as soon as the elders touch them, they will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They will not do something simply because the elders asked them to.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They ask, Why must I be asked by the elders?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do I not have the right to do things?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Do I not have a spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Everyone has his excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even bank robbers claim that because the government is not fair, it is right to balance the wealth in society by robbery.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>With the Lord and in the church life, however, there are no excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Every excuse, regardless of how reasonable and fair it seems, will only cause a debit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must be burdened for people, not caring for any excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Whether someone praises us or condemns us, we should have no feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We care only to bear people as our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Let others gain glory, honor, and respect.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We care only for people.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Brother Nee once told us that if we do not keep the proper spiritual principles, our prayers will not be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The law in the spiritual realm is that we must care for people.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we do not care for people, our prayers for increase cannot be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we pick up a heart to care for the unbelievers, the Lord will honor that care, and the increase will come.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Likewise, if we pick up a burden to care for the other saints, the Lord will honor this care also.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We all need to go to the Lord and ask Him to burden us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should not care about our age or any position in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We do not even like to use the word position with respect to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We simply need to be useful, and this usefulness is altogether in our care for people, not in doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>To do things successfully in the affairs of the church does not mean much.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The basic need in the church service is to care for people.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>LEARNING TO LISTEN TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>SO THAT WE MAY SPEAK A TIMELY WORD TO OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We have many lessons to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If a brother has a problem, we need to pray for him and seek the Lord for a timely word to speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We need a word in season to sustain him, not gossip or vain talk.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In order to have such a word, we need the tongue of the instructed, the tongue of the one dealt with by the Lord Isa 50:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we have been dealt with by the Lord, we will have a tongue that can offer a word to rescue others and sustain the weary ones.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This all depends on how much we have been disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Such a tongue is not that of a teacher, a professor, or a learned one but of the instructed, the taught one, the one who has been disciplined by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Only those who listen to the Lord can speak a word in season to others.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is why, in type, the slave who chose not to go out freely was brought to the doorpost so that the master could bore his ear through with an awl Exo 21:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In order to be a good slave, our position must be at the post, listening to the master s voice.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We need an opened ear, an ear that has been bored through; then we can have a proper word to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Even according to the physical law, one who cannot hear cannot speak well.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The proper speaking comes from the proper hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If we do not listen to the Lord in His dealings with us, it will be difficult for us to speak a timely word to sustain the weary ones.</S>
