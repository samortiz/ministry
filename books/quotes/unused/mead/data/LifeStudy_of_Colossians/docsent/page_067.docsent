   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO PLACE FOR THE LAW OR THE ANGELS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By mentioning the enlivening of those who are dead in offenses together with the ordinances of the law and the angels, Paul s intention is to point out that the concept held by the Colossians was altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Colossians still regarded the law and the angels very highly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They placed a high value on the ordinances of the law, and they were even worshipping certain of the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although God has used both the law and the angels, in the economy of His salvation there is no place either for the law or for the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Angels are not admitted into the sphere of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every believer has an angel, but these angels do not share in God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ s redemption has nothing to do with angels.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the realm of God s economy in His salvation, both the law and the angels are ruled out.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the eyes of God, the ordinances, rituals, and ceremonies of the law have been crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, not many Christians realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only were sin, the natural man, the world, and Satan crucified on the cross; the law was also crucified there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason, in 2:14 Paul says that God wiped out the handwriting in ordinances by nailing it to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because Paul s vision was so clear, his word was very definite.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As evil men were putting Christ on the cross, God was nailing the law to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although the law had been given by God through angels, God Himself nailed it to the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 14 is a powerful weapon to counteract the teaching of the Seventh-Day Adventists about the observance of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Observing the Sabbath is one of the ordinances, or rituals, of the law that has been nailed to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to 2:14, the ordinances have been taken out of the way and nailed to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the Seventh-Day Adventists need to see that the Sabbath-keeping ordinances have been wiped out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The very thing they treasure God has taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, the ordinance of keeping the Sabbath was against us and contrary to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because God loves us, He has taken away this ordinance for our sake.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, the Seventh-Day Adventists seek to restore the very thing God has removed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not argue with Seventh-Day Adventists about which day, the seventh or the eighth, should be observed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, point out that the keeping of the Sabbath is part of the handwriting in ordinances which has been taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may use 2:14 boldly as a weapon to annihilate the ordinance concerning observing the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In God s economy of His salvation, there is no room for the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as sin has been crucified on the cross, so the law has been crucified also.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both have been nailed to the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God does not want either sin or the law to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What He desires is for us to exist together with the risen Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>STRIPPING OFF THE RULERS AND AUTHORITIES</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have pointed out that at the time of Christ s crucifixion God stripped off, put off, the rulers and authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Christ was crucified, the leading evil angels attempted to surround God when Christ was on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But God used the cross to strip off these angels.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is Paul s concept in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a very real sense, the cross of Christ is the center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After God created the heavens, the earth, and the billions of items in the universe, an archangel rebelled, and many angels followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This archangel became Satan, and his followers became the evil rulers, powers, and authorities in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, the man created by God fell and became sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The rebellion of the angels and the fall of man put God into a difficult situation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God s way to deal with this difficulty is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Firstly, God became a man, thereby putting humanity on Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then Christ, God incarnate, went to the cross and was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>During the thirty-three and a half years of His earthly life, Christ walked from the manger to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When He was crucified, many things took place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the cross God judged sin and the sinful old man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through the cross, our sinful nature was terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the very time God was judging sin and sinful man, He also nailed the law to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When God was nailing the law to the cross, the evil angels also were present and very active.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But, according to verse 15, God stripped them off through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have pointed out that, according to 2:15, God stripped off the rulers and authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>From what or from where did He strip them off?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we would answer this question, we must see that while Christ was on the cross, God was working.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At that time, the cross was the center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Savior, sin, Satan, we, and God all were there.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God was there judging sin and nailing the law to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As He was doing this, the rulers and authorities gathered around God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have pointed out that, according to grammar, the subject of verses 13 through 15 is God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thus, the He in verse 15 denotes God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God made us alive together with Christ, nailed the ordinances to the cross, stripped off the rulers and authorities, made a display of them openly, and triumphed over them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No doubt, the rulers and authorities had swarmed around Christ as He was being crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Both God and Christ were working.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Christ s work was His crucifixion, whereas God s work was to judge sin and all the negative things and to nail the law with its ordinances to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The rulers and authorities who had gathered around God and Christ were also working.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If they had not pressed in closely, how could God have stripped them off?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The words stripping off indicate that they were very close, as close as our garments are to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>By stripping off the rulers and authorities, God made a display of them openly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He openly put them to shame and triumphed over them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What a great matter this is!</S>
