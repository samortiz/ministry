   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING EQUIPPED IN THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND GROWING IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN ORDER TO FEED THE LAMBS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Gospel of John is a book on life, but John was also particularly fond of using the word truth in his writings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, in his Epistles, just as in his Gospel, he first mentions the truth and then presents the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This shows us a spiritual principle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If there is no truth, there will be no life; and if there is no life, there will be no truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In John 14:6 the Lord put life and truth together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then in chapter fifteen the Lord spoke of the matter of fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that fruit-bearing has a great deal to do with life and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Experientially, our barrenness exposes our shortage in life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why are we barren?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is because we are not rich in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we have an abundance of life, we will spontaneously bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we would pay attention to fruit-bearing, we surely must pay attention to the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we would pay attention to the growth in life, we must also pay attention to pursuing the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once we have the truth, we will be led into the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this way we will be able to shepherd our lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Otherwise, we will have nothing to feed our lambs with and no way to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without knowing the truth or growing in life, we may still be able to lead people to be saved and baptized; however, if we lack the knowledge of the truth and the experience of Christ, we will not be able to properly fulfill the responsibility of feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Parents feed their children by giving them food to eat and milk to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Similarly, in order to feed our lambs, we must prepare spiritual food and milk.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord s word is the bread of life John 6:35, 63 and the spiritual milk 1 Pet 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we know the truth in the Bible and the word of the Lord, we will be able to give our lambs much nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, we can use the Gospel of John to feed others, saying, John chapter one says that the Lord was God, and as God He became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, with Him came the truth, which is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then chapter eight says that the truth shall set us free, and chapter seventeen says that we are sanctified in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In actuality, the truth is nothing less the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, we have to love the Lord, pray to Him all the time, and read His word every day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How good this is!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Gospel of John speaks of life and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This life and truth are just the Lord Jesus, and today He is the Spirit who lives in us and supplies us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, chapter six tells us that the Lord is the bread of life for us to eat vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>35, 48 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we eat Him, we live because of Him v. 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we have a rich knowledge of the truth and a considerable measure of the experience of life, when we go to visit our lambs, we will be able to supply them with the milk of the word according to their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the proper practice of feeding the lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regrettably, when most of us see our lambs, usually we can only say, Do you attend the Lord s Day meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why don t you come to the meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The meeting is really good; you surely have to come.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We only know to say this to our lambs over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, they get so tired of us, and gradually they do not like to see us anymore because they know that we have nothing to say except, The meeting is really good; please come.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not feeding them; rather, it is like serving them a summons to appear in court.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, they not only are not supplied, but they even grow tired of us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, when we see our lambs, we should not say, The meeting is really good; please come.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead, we have to speak the truth to them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The truth is the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Perhaps some saints will say, There are many places in the Word which I do not understand; I cannot even comprehend the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord has already opened the entire New Testament to us in the life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If someone does not understand the Gospel of John, he should read the Life-study of John where all the truths are opened.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once he reads the life-study messages, he will be able to understand the intrinsic significance of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After we have learned the truth and we see our lambs again, we should not say, The meeting is really good; please come.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Instead, we should invite them to read John 1:14 with us: And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then we may explain to them, The reality here is the truth, and the truth is the explanation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This explanation is found in the entire Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verses 31 to 36 of chapter eight tell us that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The truth, however, shall set us free.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>So we have to pursue the truth, and when we have the truth, the truth shall set us free.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This simple word will supply them with a cup of the milk of the word and two small pieces of solid food that they may be nourished substantially.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When they go back, the Holy Spirit will surely work through our speaking, because the Lord s word is spirit, and they will have the Spirit operating in them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even though we may not ask them to come to the meeting, they will surely come the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Later, we may further speak to them, The truth not only shall set us free, but it is also an explanation of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord is life and is inside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>John 15 says that we have to learn to abide in the Lord and that the Lord will also abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then we will abide with the Lord mutually.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We can enjoy Him, and He can be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Eventually, we will be able to bear fruit for the Father to be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we feed them in this way over and over again, after two or three months they will grow in life, overflow life, bear fruit, and bring people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Their fruit will then become their lambs, and they will feed their lambs according to the way they were supplied by us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In this way one link is connected to another we take care of them as our lambs, they take care of others as their lambs, and their lambs take care of still others as lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What a glorious situation this will be.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the overflow of life and the feeding of life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>THE PRACTICE OF SERVING FULL-TIME</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The churches in America have already started a practice in which the college students set apart two years right after their graduation to serve the church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Of course, this is not a regulation but something of the saints own free will.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Once they graduate from college, they learn how to serve in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They spend four hours in the morning, five days a week, to focus on reading the life-study messages in order to study the truths in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After two years they will have studied the entire New Testament once.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the afternoons they either go to visit people in the homes or to contact students at the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the evenings they may join the meetings or go out to do the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This kind of practice is very effective, and those who serve this way also receive much benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After two years the church will decide, according to their performance and desire, as well as according to the Lord s leading, whether or not they should remain full-time or go to get a job.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If the college young people in the Lord s recovery would dedicate two years after their graduation to go forth for the preaching of the gospel and to receive spiritual edification, the future of the Lord s recovery will be immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In the church there should be some who serve the Lord full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In the Lord s recovery, serving full-time does not mean that you enter the profession of preaching and earn your livelihood by preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Bible clearly shows us that this is not necessarily so.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>For example, Paul was one who served full-time, but in times of need he also made tents Acts 18:3; 20:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Aquila and Priscilla were also tentmakers by trade like Paul, but they were like full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Wherever they went, they opened their homes entirely for the church and the saints Rom 16:3-5a; 1 Cor 16:19b .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Thus, serving full-time is a practice, not a profession.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The college graduates can set apart two years and then get a job.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>After a period of time, if the church has the need or they feel that they should acquire further learning, they can come out to serve full-time again.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This kind of practice is living and organic, without any element of regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>As a rule, we all should consecrate our time to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The more time that we consecrate, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In particular, there are many housewives among us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>During the day most people have to go to work or to school, but these housewives have a lot of time.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Thus, they should give their time for the Lord s use.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>A definite way to do this would be for them to open their homes and invite their relatives and friends to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>However, they should not invite the elders to come and preach; instead, they should preach the gospel themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Perhaps many of them will try to make an excuse, saying that they are not able to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>However, their inability is the exact reason that they need to learn the truth and be equipped with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Please bear in mind that if you invite the elders or the gifted ones to preach the gospel, the result may not be good.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Only when you yourself preach and speak will the gospel be living and effective.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If all the saints would serve and function not relying on the gifted ones but diligently learning the truth, experiencing Christ, endeavoring to give their time, opening their homes, and trying their best to preach the gospel the impact would be great.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In Taipei we also mentioned the burden of serving full-time, and surprisingly, many people immediately responded.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Now there are about six hundred who have the desire to serve full-time and another six hundred who want to serve part-time.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We are full of joy concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>These one thousand two hundred saints may be considered the future of the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In the same principle, I hope that there would be an adequate number of people everywhere willing to serve full-time, so that the Lord would have a free way to do whatever He wants to do in every place.</S>
