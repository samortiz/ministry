   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF DANIEL MESSAGE ELEVEN THE VISIONS OF THE OVERCOMING DANIEL 2 THE VISION CONCERNING A RAM</S>

   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In chapter seven Daniel saw a vision of the four beasts out of the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That vision was a brief sketch without much detail.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But chapters eight and eleven give many details concerning the second and third beasts, which correspond respectively to the Medo-Persian and Grecian Empires.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we will cover the vision of a ram and a male goat with its successors recorded in chapter eight of Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we read Daniel 8, we may wonder what this chapter has to do with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Medo-Persian Empire, the Grecian Empire, and the Roman Empire were on the three continents of Asia, Africa, and Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the intersection of these three continents is Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Throughout the ages Israel has suffered a great deal because of the fighting between these empires on these three continents, of which Israel is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Israel has often been the battleground.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Due to the trouble and damage caused by this fighting, it has been difficult for Israel, God's elect, to be something truly according to God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the reason that God came in to show Daniel vision after vision concerning the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whereas chapters nine and twelve are concerned with Israel directly, chapter eight with its vision regarding Medo-Persia and Greece and chapter eleven with its vision regarding the successors of Alexander the Great are concerned with Israel indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I. THE YEAR OF THIS VISION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The year of this vision is given in 8:1.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that appeared to me at the beginning."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was about 552 B.C.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE PLACE OF THIS VISION</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Daniel 8:2 tells of the place of this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"I watched in the vision, and it happened that while I watched, I was in the fortress of Shushan, which is in the province of Elam; and I watched in the vision, and I was beside the river Ulai."</S>
