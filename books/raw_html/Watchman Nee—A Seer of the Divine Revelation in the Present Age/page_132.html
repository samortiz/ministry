<P>This paper, after its nineteenth issue in September 1939, was suspended until it was replaced by The Ministers in 1948. It was eventually resumed in June 1950.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Glad Tidings</H2><P>Besides the papers which have already been mentioned, a paper on the gospel was also published. The following announcement concerning this paper appeared in the seventh issue of Collection of Newsletters in June 1934 and reveals its purpose and contents:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>After the third overcomer conference this past January, the co-workers from the various localities had a meeting in Shanghai. In that meeting most of the co-workers expressed the hope that a written testimony could be issued solely for the preaching of the gospel.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Recently, several co-workers in Shanghai also increasingly felt the burden to publish such a written testimony. We have, therefore, decided to publish a paper entitled The Glad Tidings beginning in July of this year. This publication will be solely for the preaching of the gospel to sinners.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>The contents of this paper will include three columns: messages, stories, and testimonies. The messages will be simple gospel messages, the stories will be salvation stories of believers from the past, and the testimonies will be salvation testimonies of today's believers.</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>This author was asked to bear the burden to write the messages and to edit the paper. The first issue of The Glad Tidings was published in July 1934. The gospel message for the third issue, entitled "There is a God" was one of Watchman Nee's spoken messages. This paper had only three issues and was discontinued in 1936.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. The Replacement Periodicals</H2><P>Immediately following the 1948 conference in Shanghai, when Watchman resumed his ministry and the brothers handed over their possessions to the work, he made arrangements with us to put out four papers to replace those which had been temporarily suspended.</P><P>1)The Testimony was to replace The Present Testimony. The subject of this paper was to be specifically the messages of life. The content of it was to be the light received and the lessons learned before God and help for the children of the Lord to have the real growth in life.</P><P>2)The Way was to replace The Christian. The subject matter of The Way was to be the biblical truth showing the spiritual way. The content of this paper was to be the way of the gospel, the way of life, the way of Bible study, and the people of the way.</P>
