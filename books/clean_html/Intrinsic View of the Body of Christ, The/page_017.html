<P>Christ's death was different from anyone else's death. No human being works when he is dying, but Christ was different. While Christ was being crucified, He was working. The Jews crucified Him, but the Bible says that Christ abolished and created. Christ abolished the ordinances and created the Jewish and the Gentile believers in Himself into one new man. Christ did a work on the cross. While He was dying, He was working. When He was working there to terminate us, He put into us something of Himself, which is His element of the resurrection life. Resurrection life could never be applied to any natural man. Resurrection life could only be applied to the crucified ones. When we were crucified, Christ as the resurrection life, as the divine element, was applied to us. Now the ones who have been terminated through Christ's cross have something of Christ as the element in resurrection.</P><P>While He was on the cross terminating us, He was also putting something of Himself as the divine element in resurrection into our being. When we passed through termination on the cross, we became a new man with Christ as the element in resurrection. His cross could terminate us, but His cross in itself could not make us one. There must be something in addition to the cross. This is His resurrection life. His resurrection life is the best "glue" that sticks us all together. The cross clears up and terminates all the negative things, while His resurrection life is the best glue to stick us together. Then we all become one new man. Through the cross we became clean, and in His resurrection life we were glued together. Nothing can separate us in resurrection.</P><P>On the cross Christ crossed all of us out. He purged us, cleansed us. We are clean. Then He put this clean material into His resurrection life, and this resurrection life glued us together to make us one entity. First, this one entity is the Body; second, it is the new man. This is Christ's creation. By doing this, He "hit two birds with one stone." First, He created a new man; second, by creating us, the Jews and Gentiles, into one new man, He reconciled us all, Jews and Gentiles, in one Body (v. 16). This indicates that the one new man is the one Body.</P><P>Ephesians 4 says that all the members, all the parts, of the Body are joined together by the joints of supply and knit together by every part functioning in its measure (v. 16). We are doubly stuck together through the joints and the parts of the Body of Christ, the new man. The new man is composed of the Head and the Body. The Head is Christ; the Body is the church. The Head and the Body joined together are the new man.</P>
