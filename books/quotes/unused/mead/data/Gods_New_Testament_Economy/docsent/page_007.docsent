   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I received this teaching sixty years ago, but after my personal study of the Bible, I discovered that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit were all in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Isaiah 9:6 refers to the eternal Father.</S>

   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must learn to know this Person, to describe this wonderful Person, and to present this excellent Person to others.</S>
