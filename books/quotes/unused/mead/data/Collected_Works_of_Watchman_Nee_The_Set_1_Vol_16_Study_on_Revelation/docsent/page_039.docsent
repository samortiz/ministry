   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THREE-IN-ONE SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 12:1 13:18 I. THE GREAT SIGN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>REVELATION 12:1-6</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When a sign is revealed, it causes men to know what will come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Beginning from Revelation 12:1, the apostle John prophesies again because 10:11 says, "You must prophesy again."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Following Revelation 11:15-18, we see the situation after the sounding of the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, Revelation 12:1 22:21 is his prophesying again; it supplements the first section chapters six through eleven .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Chapters six through eleven provide the outline, arranged in sequence, whereas chapters twelve through twenty-two give the details.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first section ends with 11:15: "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because it says that the kingdom goes on forever and ever, this section covers all the things through the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, this is not speaking about the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we can say that chapters six through eleven cover everything through the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then chapters twelve through twenty-two speak again in detail about all the crucial things in the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is like Genesis 1, which speaks of God's work in six days, while chapter two speaks again about what was done on the sixth day in specific detail.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chapters six through eleven of Revelation are in the principle of Genesis 1, and chapters twelve through twenty-two follow the example of Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Revelation 9:1 a great star falls from heaven to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the great red dragon in 12:3.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Chapters twelve through fourteen are written symbolically, chapters fifteen through sixteen are written literally, and chapters seventeen through eighteen are again written symbolically.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's wrath and judgment are never written symbolically; they are always written literally.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A. Revelation 12:1</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"And a great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some people say that the "woman" here refers to the church, but this is not correct because: 1 before the second coming of the Lord, the position of the church before Christ is that of a virgin 2 Cor 11:2 ; 2 the church has never been typified as a mother, and it has never had any daughters names like "mother church" cannot be found in the Bible ; and 3 the church is raptured at the end, but this woman is never raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some people say that this woman is Mary, but this is also incorrect.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1 How could Mary be depicted by the description in Revelation 12:1?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2 The Lord Jesus was the firstborn Son, but this woman already has other children 12:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>3 This does not agree with the prophetic nature of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the woman were Mary and the man-child were the Lord, then this description would be historical and would be contrary to the prophetic nature of this book because this book is the revelation of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Who then is this woman?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let us consider a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, every woman singular in number in this book refers to a city 17:18; 21:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second, J.K. Seiss says that the sun refers to the Lord, the moon to the devil, and the twelve stars to the twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While it is possible to say that the sun represents the Lord and the twelve stars, the twelve tribes, how can one infer that the moon stands for the devil?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Third, Robert Govett says that the sun refers to grace this is possible , the moon refers to the law how does he explain this?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>, and that the stars refer to the twelve tribes which is correct .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A third school says that the sun, moon, and stars refer to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Their basis for such an interpretation is 1 Corinthians 15:41.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, the stars in 1 Corinthians 15:41 are general, while the "twelve stars" in Revelation 12:1 are specific.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our answer is that the "woman" refers to Jerusalem in the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The reasons for this are:</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>1 By reading Genesis 37:9-10, we immediately know that the sun refers to Jacob, the moon to the mother of Israel, and the twelve stars to the twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Explained in this way, we realize that what is described here is the city of Jerusalem, which represents the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These three, the sun, the moon, and the stars, cannot be explained separately; they have to be viewed together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>2 The one "clothed with the sun" is obviously the mother of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She is only clothed with the sun; she is not the sun itself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"The moon was underneath her feet."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that she is being forgotten.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"On her head was a crown of twelve stars"; these are obviously the twelve tribes Gen 37:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>3 "Travailing in birth" 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Isaiah 26:17-18; Jeremiah 6:22-25 Zion is Jerusalem ; 13:19-21; 30:6-7; Micah 4:8-10; and 5:1-3, the prophets clearly say that Jerusalem will suffer a tribulation just as a woman travails in giving birth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>4 In Revelation 12:7 the angel, Michael, helps her.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Daniel 12:1 clearly says that Michael will rise up to help Israel during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>5 This woman typifies Jerusalem in the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God commands her to flee to the wilderness Rev 12:6, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Matthew 24:16-20 the Lord expressly says that they would flee.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Luke 21:20-24 also states this very clearly.</S>
