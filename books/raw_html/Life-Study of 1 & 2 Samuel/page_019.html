<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. SAMUEL MINISTERING IN FIVE STATUSES</H2><P>Samuel, who was by nature a Levite born of one of the descendants of the great rebel Korah (1 Chron. 6:33-38; cf. Num. 16:1-33), ministered in five statuses.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. As a Nazarite Consecrated to God Absolutely<br>for God's Fulfillment of His Economy</H2><P>First, Samuel ministered as a Nazarite consecrated to God absolutely for God's fulfillment of His economy, a volunteer to replace any official and formal serving ones of God (1 Sam. 1:11, 28a). The Nazarite vow was initiated by his mother and completed by Samuel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. As a Priest</H2><P>Second, Samuel ministered as a priest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Not by Birth<br>but by God Raising Him Up Particularly</H2><P>Samuel was a priest not by birth but by God raising him up particularly. Referring to Samuel, God says in 2:35, "I shall raise up for Myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in My heart and in My mind; and I shall build him a sure house; and he shall go before My anointed continually." This indicates that Samuel would be a faithful priest to act on behalf of God, even to appoint and establish kings for the divine government on earth. David was appointed and anointed by him. From this we see that Samuel was high in qualifications and great in capacity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Faithful to God to Do<br>What Was in God's Heart and in His Mind</H2><P>Samuel was faithful to God to do according to what was in God's heart and mind. His whole being and person, not just his doing, living, and work, were according to God. Samuel's being and God's heart were one. For this reason it is not too much to say that Samuel, a man according to God, was the acting God on earth. God's mind was Samuel's consideration. He had no other thought, consideration, or thinking. His living and working were for the carrying out of whatever was in God's heart. As a consequence, Samuel was one who turned the age.</P>
