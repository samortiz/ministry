<p>In addition, Revelation 21 tells us that the wall of the city has twelve foundations (vv. 14, 19-20). Someone once arranged the colors of the twelve precious stones of the foundation in sequence according to their names in Greek, and the result was a picture resembling a rainbow. Therefore, here we can see two very similar pictures. In the picture at the beginning of Revelation there is a throne with God sitting upon it as jasper and a rainbow around it. In the picture at the end of Revelation there is a city which also has a throne at its center. The One on the throne is also the same God. In addition, the city looks like jasper all around, and the foundations under the wall of jasper also appear like a rainbow. When you compare these two pictures, you see that in the former there is a throne, and in the latter there is also a throne. In the former the appearance is like jasper, and in the latter the appearance is also like jasper. In the former there is a rainbow around the throne, and in the latter there is also a rainbow around the throne. Thus, in principle these two pictures are exactly the same. The transparent city is altogether the same as God on the throne in Revelation 4. However, in chapter four the appearance of jasper is smaller, whereas in chapter twenty-one the appearance of jasper has been enlarged. The appearance of jasper in chapter four is the expression of God in Himself, whereas the appearance of jasper in chapter twenty-one is the expression of God in all those who have been redeemed and built up throughout the ages.<p>Now let us consider the shape of the city. The city lies square, and its length and breadth both are twelve thousand stadia (Rev. 21:16). The area surrounding the city, calculated by multiplying twelve thousand by twelve thousand, is one hundred and forty-four million stadia. In the Scriptures twelve is the most perfect number. That the area surrounding the city is twelve thousand times twelve thousand means that the city is infinitely perfect. The height of this city is also twelve thousand stadia. These numbers together tell us that in this city the expression of God is limitless. It is the fullness of fullness. Previously, on the throne God was not fully expressed, but now in the city He is expressed in full.<p>Revelation 21 includes everything in the Scriptures; it is the crystallization of the entire Bible. The issue of God’s work in the human race for six thousand years is the New Jerusalem. All the positive things in the Scriptures are consummated in her. Therefore, what this city includes is exceedingly rich.<p>Simply speaking, the story of the New Jerusalem is the story of the enlargement of God in man. I believe that this statement best describes the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the enlargement and full expression of God in man. In principle, this enlargement, this full manifestation, is the same as God Himself. God’s appearance is like jasper, and the appearance of the city is also like jasper. The two are exactly alike without any difference. Eventually, the first picture in Revelation 4 is included in the second picture in Revelation 21. When the city in Revelation 21 comes into being, the throne in Revelation 4 is included in the city. Therefore, this city is the expression of God Himself.<p>I believe that after reading these chapters we should be able to easily recall the story in Genesis chapter one. We should remember that in the beginning God created man in His image. Then at the end of Revelation we see the manifestation of the New Jerusalem as the crystallized product of God’s work throughout the ages. Everything in the city expresses God, and the entire city itself expresses the image of God. Therefore, at the end of Revelation the goal of God’s creation of man is reached. Man has completely become the expression of God and is full of the image of God. Moreover, the light of this city is like jasper indicating that its shining is altogether the expression of the image of God. People can both touch God and see God. We should all remember that this should be the condition of a church that has been built up by God.<p>If a church has really been built up, it will not only have the presence of God, the throne of God, the flowing and supply of the life of God, and the shining of the light of God, it will also have the expression of God. Look at the church at the time of Pentecost. One hundred and twenty people had genuinely been built together by God and were in harmony and one accord. If you were to touch them, you would have sensed that God was with them. Among them there was an expression, which was the shining of God. They were the jasper city. Like transparent crystals, they shone forth the jasper God who was within them.<p>Conversely, if you go into the midst of the saints in a church which has not been built up by God, you cannot see the expression of God. Rather, what you meet or see will be either fallen people or wicked Satan. They will express man and Satan instead of God. The church in Corinth was a very obvious example of this. The apostle Paul said that the Corinthians were fleshly, that they walked according to the manner of the fashion of the world, and that there were strifes and divisions among them. Thus, what they manifested was the flesh of man. The image of God was completely covered up by them.
