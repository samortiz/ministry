[1]  In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ as revealed in Hebrews, one of the greatest books in the New Testament.
[2]  Every aspect of Christ revealed in this book is significant.
[3]  In creation He is 1 the means through which the universe was made 1:2 ; 2 the power that upholds and bears all things v. 3 ; and 3 the Heir appointed to inherit all things v. 2 . In redemption He accomplished the purification of man s sins and is now sitting on the right hand of God in the heavens v. 3 .
[4]  As the Creator, Christ the Son will remain forever.
[5]  The Son is also the impress, the express image, of the substance of God 1:3 .
[6]  The Son is the expression of what God the Father is.
[7]  In the New Testament God speaks in Christ as His firstborn Son, indicating that all the brothers of His firstborn Son as His many sons, the members of the Body of Christ, should be the word of God, speaking for God.
[8]  In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son of God who is better than the angels.
[9]  Christ made purification of sins and sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high until God makes His enemies a footstool for His feet Heb 1:3 .
[10]  Christ is sitting at the right hand of God until God makes all His enemies and adversaries serve Christ as a footstool for His rest.
[11]  And again, I will be a Father to Him, and He will be a Son to Me ? v. 5 . Romans 1:4 says that Christ was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.
[12]  Regrettably, some Christians seem to love the angels more than Christ, but we need to see that Christ has inherited a more distinguished name the name of the Son of God than they.
[13]  Hebrews 1:9, which is addressed to Christ the Son says, You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners.
[14]  Hebrews 1 reveals Christ as the Son of God being much better than the angels, whereas chapter 2 reveals Christ as the Son of Man becoming better than the angels.
[15]  When the Pharisees heard that the Lord Jesus called Himself the Son of God, they accused Him of blasphemy because, in their understanding, He made Himself equal with God.
[16]  We are the house of God, in which the heavenly ladder joins us to God and brings God to us, while the angels are ministering spirits ascending and descending upon this ladder as they render their service to us.
[17]  a.God Having Set Him over the Works of God s Hands and Having Subjected All Things under His Feet
[18]  Hebrews 2:7-8, which is addressed to God, says, You...have set Him over the works of Your hands; You have subjected all things under His feet.
[19]  This indicates that Adam, as the head of God s creation, was a prefigure of Christ Rom 5:14 .
[20]  God s subjecting all things under the feet of Adam typifies God s subjecting all things under the feet of Christ, the reality of Adam as the head of God s creation.
[21]  According to Hebrews 2:9, God made Christ a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death so that by the grace of God He might taste death on behalf of everything.
[22]  Him Who Has the Might of Death, the Devil,
[23]  Christ s death also released us from the slavery under the fear of death v. 15 . Since through His death Christ tasted death for us and destroyed the devil who has the might of death, His death released us from the slavery in which we were held because of the fear of death.
[24]  According to Hebrews 2:10, God made Christ the Author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
[25]  Jesus, as the Pioneer, the Forerunner 6:20 , took the lead to enter into glory, and we, His followers, are taking the same way to be brought into the same glory, which was ordained by God for us 1 Cor 2:7; 1 Thes 2:12 .
[26]  Being All of One Father; Hence, He Calling Them Brothers and Declaring the Father s Name to Them, and in Their Midst Singing Hymns unto God the Father
[27]  Hebrews 2:11-12 says, For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers, saying, I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.
[28]  Christ the Sanctifier is of the Father, and the believers as those being sanctified are also of the Father.
[29]  For this reason, He called them brothers, declared the Father s name to them, and sang hymns of praise unto God the Father.
[30]  According to John 20, the resurrected Christ as the firstborn Son of God came to meet with the disciples as His brothers.
[31]  He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God.
[32]  2 Declaring the Father s Name to the Brothers
[33]  Verse 12 goes on to say, I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.
[34]  The firstborn Son declared the Father s name to His brothers after He resurrected from the dead, when He met with the Father s many sons John 20:17, 19-23 .
[35]  The church mentioned in Hebrews 2:12 is referred to as a corporate composition of the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God.
[36]  His death released the divine life from within Him, and His resurrection imparted the life of God into us in order that we might become the many sons of God and His many brothers.
[37]  g. He Being Made Like His Brothers in All Things
[38]  Hebrews 2:17 says, Hence He should have been made like His brothers in all things that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in the things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
[39]  The Son of God was made like us, His brothers, in that He partook of blood and flesh v. 14 . This was done for two purposes, one negative and the other positive.
[40]  The first two chapters of Hebrews reveal that Christ as the Son of God, God Himself, through His incarnation, ascension, and glorification made Himself the same as we are and made us the same as He is.
[41]  In Hebrews 3:1-6 we see that Christ is the One better than Moses.
[42]  In Hebrews 4 through 7, we see that Christ is the One better than Aaron, who as a high priest is a type of Christ.
[43]  The Lord Jesus first was sent from God to us through incarnation 2:14 to be our Apostle 3:1 , our Author, our Leader 2:10 , the One superior to Moses 3:3 , and our real Joshua 4:8 to bring us, His partners 1:9; 3:14 , into glory and rest 2:10; 4:11 .
[44]  He then went back from us to God through resurrection and ascension 5:5-6 to be our High Priest to bear us in the presence of God and to care for all our needs 2:17-18; 4:15 .
[45]  This experience of Christ as our High Priest who bears us on His shoulder and breast and ministers God into us is an experience in the Holy of Holies, where we enjoy God Himself and all His riches.
[46]  a. A Great High Priest of the Good Things
[47]  Hebrews 4:14 says, Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God.
[48]  In this verse the title Jesus refers to His humanity, whereas the title Son of God refers to His Godhead.
[49]  Verse 11 of chapter 9 speaks of Christ as a High Priest of the good things; 10:21 speaks of Christ as the great Priest over the house of God.
[50]  These verses reveal that Christ is a great High Priest of the good things, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, having become higher than the heavens, and perfected forever.
[51]  Verse 28 of Hebrews 9 tells us that Christ has been offered once to bear the sins of many v. 14; 10:12 . In the eyes of God, sin is gone and has become history.
[52]  Hebrews 7:20-21 say of Christ, Inasmuch as He was not made a Priest without the taking of an oath for they are appointed priests without the taking of an oath, but He, with the taking of an oath by Him who said to Him, The Lord has sworn and will not regret it, You are a Priest forever .
[53]  2 According to the Power of an Indestructible Life
[54]  Christ has not been constituted the High Priest according to the powerless letters of the law but according to the powerful element of an indestructible life 7:16 .
[55]  As the only begotten Son and the firstborn Son of God, Christ became the High Priest with the taking of an oath by God vv.
[56]  Not one of the Levitical priests was ever established by God s oath.
[57]  According to Psalm 110, God swore to make Christ a Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
[58]  This is very weighty, proving that Christ s becoming the divine High Priest was consummated by God s oath.
[59]  Although in His divinity Christ was the Son of God, in His humanity He learned obedience through His sufferings.
[60]  At the Lord s table meeting, Christ as Melchizedek comes to us with the processed Triune God as bread and wine for our enjoyment.
[61]  Today Christ, our High Priest, is interceding for us in a hidden way Rom 8:34b; Heb 7:25b that we may be His overcomers to defeat God s enemies so that through our victory Christ can be manifested openly in His second coming.
[62]  Having the qualifications of His divinity and His resurrected life, Christ as the High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek is able to minister the processed God with the divine blessing, not to sinners but to those who fight for God s interest, as Abraham did vv.
[63]  2 The King of Righteousness and the King of Peace
[64]  As Melchizedek, Christ is not only a Priest but also a King; hence, He is a kingly, royal Priest.
[65]  As the King of righteousness, Christ has made all things right with God and with one another.
[66]  In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the One better than Aaron.
[67]  Hebrews 7:25 tells us that Christ is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them.
[68]  Christ is able to save us because He intercedes for us Heb 7:25b .
[69]  As our High Priest, Christ undertakes our case by interceding for us.
[70]  Appearing to Those Who Wait for Him a Second Time, apart from Sin, unto Salvation
[71]  Hebrews 9:28 tells us that Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him, apart from sin, unto salvation.
[72]  In the previous messages we have seen that according to the book of Hebrews, Christ is the One superior to the angels both as the Son of God and the Son of Man chs.
[73]  In Hebrews 6:20 we are told that as the Forerunner, Christ has entered within the veil, having become forever a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
[74]  By contrast, the order according to Melchizedek was a matter of coming from God to man, imparting God to man.
[75]  The order of Melchizedek is revealed in Genesis 14:18-20, where we see that Melchizedek came from God with bread and wine to meet and bless Abraham who had fought in battle for God.
[76]  10-12 , but also was consummated with Christ s better sacrifices 9:23 , which accomplished for us an eternal redemption v. 12 , and the better blood of Christ, which purifies our conscience v. 14 . Even more, the High Priest of this better covenant, the eternal Son of the living God, ministers with a more excellent ministry 8:6 and in the greater and more perfect tabernacle 9:11 .
[77]  a. A Priest Forever with the Taking of an Oath
[78]  In Hebrews 7:21, we see that Christ as the Mediator of the new covenant became the living and perpetual High Priest with the taking of an oath.
[79]  As the Minister of the true heavenly tabernacle, Christ obtained in His ascension a more excellent ministry to minister heaven, which is not only a place but a condition of life, into us that we may have the heavenly life and power to live a heavenly life on earth, as He did while He was here, to fulfill our heavenly calling 3:1 .
[80]  In this message we will continue to consider our experience and enjoyment of Christ as the surety and Mediator of a better covenant, the new covenant.
[81]  The new covenant, a better covenant, was enacted upon better promises v. 6 . The better promises, which are given in Jeremiah 31:31-34 and quoted in Hebrews 8:8-13 and 10:16-17, cover four major things: 1 propitiation for our unrighteousnesses and the forgetting forgiveness of our sins 8:12 ; 2 the imparting of the law of life by the imparting of the divine life into us v. 10a ; 3 the privilege of having God as our God and of being His people the divine life s enabling us to participate in the enjoyment of God in fellowship with Him v. 10b ; and 4 the function of life that enables us to know Him in the inward way of life v. 11 .
[82]  Hebrews 9:14 says, How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
[83]  The blood by which the new covenant was enacted purifies our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.
[84]  Since the Lord s blood cleanses us from our sins before God and His law, it purifies our conscience, thus enabling us to serve our living God with boldness.
[85]  Hebrews 9:15-16 says of Christ, He is the Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
[86]  This indicates that Christ s death took place for redemption in order that we, the called ones, might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
[87]  This is according to the New Testament, which is based upon the new covenant in which God promised to us the eternal inheritance, that is, God Himself for our eternal enjoyment.
[88]  This precious blood speaks to God for us, saying that by it the new covenant, which is eternal, has been enacted, and that in this new covenant God must give Himself and all His blessings to the believers in Christ, who receive this covenant by faith.
[89]  In Hebrews 10:5-10 we see that Christ is the unique sacrifice and offering.
[90]  The prophecy in Psalm 40:6-8 is one of the greatest revelations concerning the all-inclusive Christ in the commission that God committed to Christ in His first coming through incarnation, which was to put away the animal sacrifices of the old covenant and to establish Himself, in His body, as the sacrifice of the new covenant.
[91]  In the prophecy in Psalm 40:6-8, Christ comes through His incarnation to terminate God s old economy and initiate God s new economy, His New Testament economy, by replacing the animal sacrifices and establishing Himself as the unique sacrifice of the new covenant.
[92]  Psalm 40:6 says, You have prepared ears for Me. This was quoted by the apostle Paul in Hebrews 10:5 as a body You have prepared for Me. The boring of the slave s ears indicates that the master required the slave s obedience Exo 21:6 . It signifies that God required obedience of Christ, who in His humanity was God s slave Phil 2:7 . This obedience, spoken of by Paul in Philippians 2:8, was for Him to do the will of God by being the sacrifice and the offering in His crucifixion in the flesh, the body Col 1:22; Heb 10:7-10 . Based on this, Paul interpreted the boring of the ears as the preparing of a body, in which Christ offered Himself to God as the sacrifice and the offering to replace the sacrifice and the offering of animals in the Old Testament.
[93]  Verse 7 also says, In the scroll of the book / It is written concerning Me. This indicates that Christ was prophesied in the Scriptures of the Old Testament and that Christ will do God s will for the accomplishment of God s New Testament economy according to the Old Testament prophecies concerning Him.
[94]  In Hebrews 10:5-9, after quoting this prophecy concerning Christ in Psalm 40:6-8, Paul commented that Christ s coming to do God s will is to take away the first that He may establish the second Heb 10:9 .
[95]  The first in Paul s comment refers to the sacrifices and offerings of the first covenant, the old covenant; the second refers to the sacrifice of the second covenant, the new covenant, which sacrifice is Christ.
[96]  Christ is our sacrifice to deal with sin and sins, and He is our offering, our gift, presented to God for God s satisfaction.
[97]  God s will is to have a Body as the enlargement and expression of the processed Triune God and to have Christ as the replacement for all the sacrifices and offerings that we may enjoy Him as our all in all.
[98]  If we would be a part of the Body of Christ, which is the enlargement and expression of Christ, we need to take Christ as our everything and enjoy Him.
[99]  The peace offering typifies Christ as the Peacemaker, the One who became the peace and the fellowship between God and us by shedding His blood and dying for us, enabling us to enjoy Christ with God and to have fellowship with God in Christ for our mutual satisfaction with God Lev 3:1; Eph 2:14-15; John 12:1-3; 20:21; Rev 21:2 .
[100]  This is for the fulfillment of the great will of God, which is to have Christ as the replacement for all the offerings in the Old Testament in order that we may enjoy Him as everything in living and practicing the Body life for the building up of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God Eph 1:5, 9, 11; Heb 10:7-10; Rom 12:2 .
[101]  Hebrews 10:10 tells us that by the will of God we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
[102]  Christ offered His body once for all to replace all the sacrifices and offerings in the Old Testament with Himself in order to sanctify us unto God.
[103]  As the Initiator of a new and living way, Christ opened the way for us to enter the Holy of Holies by His blood through the veil, His flesh v. 20 . This refers to His death on the cross, which rent the veil in the temple to open a new and living way for Him to enter through His own blood into the Holy of Holies, where He is in the direct presence of God, ministering as our High Priest all that God is into our being as our life and life supply in the heavenly atmosphere.
[104]  Therefore, we must discern our spirit from our soul 4:12 so that we may enter into the Holy of Holies, where Christ, the shekinah glory of God, and the presence of God are, where we can contact God, obtain mercy, and find grace as the flowing, living water for us to enjoy.
[105]  In Old Testament times only the high priest could enter into the Holy of Holies.
[106]  When Christ s flesh was crucified, this veil was rent Matt 27:51 , thus opening the way for us, who were alienated from God, who is signified by the tree of life Gen 3:22-24 , to enter into the Holy of Holies to contact Him and take Him as the tree of life for our enjoyment.
[107]  In Hebrews 12:2-3, Christ is revealed as the Author and Perfecter of faith.
[108]  Looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God.
[109]  Because Christ Himself is faith, the apostle Paul speaks of the faith of Jesus Christ Rom 3:22 , the faith of the Son of God Gal 2:20 , or faith in Christ Phil 3:9 .
[110]  According to Hebrews 12:2, for the joy set before Him, Jesus endured the cross, despising the shame.
[111]  The Lord Jesus knew that through His death He would be glorified in resurrection Luke 24:25-26 and that His divine life would be released to produce many brothers for His expression John 12:23-24; Rom 8:29 .
[112]  Therefore, God exalted Him to the heavens, seated Him at His right hand Mark 16:19; Acts 2:33-35 , gave Him the name which is above every name Phil 2:9-10 , made Him both Lord and Christ Acts 2:36 , and crowned Him with glory and honor Heb 2:9 .
[113]  Now in His ascension He is sitting in the heavens, in the person of the Son of God Heb 1:5 and the Son of Man 2:6 , in the person of God 1:8 and man 2:6 , as the appointed Heir of all things 1:2 , the anointed One of God v. 9 , the Author of our salvation 2:10 , the Sanctifier v. 11 , the constant Succor v. 16 , the instant Helper 4:16 , the Apostle from God 3:1 , the High Priest 2:17; 4:14; 7:26 , the Minister of the true tabernacle 8:2 with a more excellent ministry v. 6 , the surety and the Mediator of a better covenant 7:22; 8:6; 12:24 , the Executor of the new testament 9:16-17 , the Forerunner 6:20 , the Author and Perfecter of faith 12:2 , and the great Shepherd of the sheep 13:20 . If we look to Him as such a wonderful and all-inclusive One, He will minister heaven, life, and strength to us, transfusing and infusing us with all that He is, that we may be able to run the heavenly race and live the heavenly life on earth.
[114]  In Hebrews 13, Christ is presented as the One who remains the same.
[115]  Hebrews 13:13 says, Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.
[116]  Hebrews 13:15 says, Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name.
[117]  When we bear the reproach of Jesus and suffer on His behalf, we often groan and do not offer any praise to God.
[118]  Since in the church life we enjoy the unchanging Christ as grace and follow Him outside religion, we should offer through Him spiritual sacrifices to God.
[119]  Although 1 Peter is a short book, it reveals many rich aspects of Christ for our experience and enjoyment.
[120]  First Peter 1:2 tells us that we were chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father in the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.
[121]  In eternity past God the Father chose us Eph 1:4 , exercising His foreknowledge, and the sanctification of the Spirit followed unto the obedience of faith in Christ.
[122]  First Peter 1:3-4 goes on to say, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for you.
[123]  In His resurrection not only was Jesus, the Son of Man, begotten to be the firstborn Son of God, but also all His believers were regenerated to be the many sons of God unto a living hope, that is, unto an inheritance, incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading, kept in the heavens for us.
[124]  His Being Revealed; Whom Having Not Seen, We Love, and in Whom, Not Seeing at Present yet Believing,
[125]  In 1 Peter 1:20, Peter tells us that Christ was foreknown before the foundation of the world but has been manifested in the last of times for your sake.
[126]  Christ was foreordained, prepared, by God to be the redeeming Lamb John 1:29 for His elect according to His foreknowledge before the foundation of the world.
[127]  Hence, in the eternal view of God, from the foundation of the world, that is, since the fall of man as a part of the world, Christ was slain Rev 13:8 .
[128]  The incarnation, the crucifixion, the resurrection, and the constitution of the Spirit of Christ exist eternally in the sight of God, but for our sake it was necessary for Christ to be manifested through incarnation and to pass through human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension so that the Spirit of Christ could be constituted dispensationally John 7:39 .
[129]  First Peter 1 reveals various aspects of Christ as the element of Christian experience: His sprinkling blood, which ushers us into the full enjoyment of the Triune God; His all-inclusive resurrection, through which we were regenerated unto a living hope; His unveiling for the salvation of our soul; His precious blood, which has redeemed us from our vain manner of life; and His being foreknown before the foundation of the world, manifested in the New Testament age, raised from the dead, and given glory by God.
[130]  OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY-THREE EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN THE EPISTLES 89 105.
[131]  1n 1 Peter 2:4-8 Christ is unveiled as the living stone.
[132]  Although Christ as the living stone was rejected by the leaders of God s people, this stone was chosen by God.
[133]  However, on the third day Christ was resurrected, and that resurrection is a sign of God s choosing, a proof that God had chosen Christ to be the stone for His building.
[134]  Coming to Him as Living Stones to Be Built Up
[135]  Peter took the lead to declare, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 . In His response to Peter, the Lord said, I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church v. 18 . Here the name Peter means a stone, which is material for God s building.
[136]  2 To Be Built Up as a Spiritual house
[137]  In 1 Peter 2:5 the word spiritual denotes the capacity of the divine life to live and grow; holy , the capacity of the divine nature to separate and sanctify.
[138]  The house of God subsists mainly by the divine life; hence, it is spiritual.
[139]  3 To Offer Up Spiritual Sacrifices Acceptable to God through Jesus Christ
[140]  The spiritual sacrifices that the believers offer in the New Testament age according to God s economy are: 1 Christ as the reality of all the sacrifices of the Old Testament types, such as the burnt offering, meal offering, peace offering, sin offering, and trespass offering Lev 1 5 ; 2 the sinners saved by our gospel preaching, offered as members of Christ Rom 15:16 ; and 3 our body, our praises, and the things that we do for God 12:1; Heb 13:15-16; Phil 4:18 .
[141]  In God s New Testament economy Christ as the cornerstone, in His saving us Acts 4:11-12 , first makes us living stones for the building up of God s spiritual house Matt 16:16-18; John 1:42; 1 Pet 2:2-6 , and then, in the process of His transforming us Rom 12:2a; 2 Cor 3:18 , builds us up into a dwelling place of God Eph 2:19-22 , that He may carry out God s eternal economy for God s good pleasure 1:9; 3:9-11 .
[142]  It is by His being the cornerstone that He could die for us, that we could be crucified with Him, made alive with Him, resurrected with Him, and seated with Him in the heavenlies, and that He could save us, transform us into precious stones, and build us together to be God s habitation, God s unique temple in the universe.
[143]  In 1 Peter 2:21-25 we see that Christ is our Substitute, our Shepherd and Overseer, and our model.
[144]  First Peter 2:25 says, You were like sheep being led astray, but you have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your soul.
[145]  This verse reveals Christ as the Shepherd and Overseer of our soul, our inner being.
[146]  Christ was our Redeemer in His death on the tree v. 24 . Now He is our soul s Shepherd and Overseer in the resurrection life within us.
[147]  As such, He is able to guide us and supply us with life that we may follow in His steps according to the model of His suffering v. 21 .
[148]  According to the word in 1 Peter 2:25, Christ is also the Overseer of our souls.
[149]  As the Overseer of our soul, our being, He is looking after us and watching over us.
[150]  1n 1 Peter 3:14-22 Christ is revealed as the body of the shadow of the ark.
[151]  On the cross He was our Substitute and bore our sins; He, the righteous One, was judged on behalf of us, the unrighteous, by the righteous God according to His righteousness, that He might remove the barrier of our sins and bring us to God.
[152]  While Christ was being crucified on the cross, the Roman soldiers were putting Him to death in His flesh, and the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit was making Him alive, strengthening Him, and empowering Him.
[153]  Romans 1:3-4 reveals when He became the firstborn Son of God: Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.
[154]  After His death in the flesh, Christ in the empowered Spirit went to the spirits, rebellious angels, in prison to proclaim God s victory over their leader Satan.
[155]  The Lord s going here indicates and proves that Christ, after dying in His flesh, was still active in this Spirit.
[156]  Christ s proclaiming to the spirits in prison was not to preach the good news but to proclaim the victory achieved by God, that is, that through Christ s death on the cross God destroyed Satan and his power of darkness Heb 2:14; Col 2:15 .
[157]  After His death in the flesh, Christ in His living Spirit as His divinity went probably to the abyss Rom 10:7 to these rebellious angels to proclaim, perhaps, God s victory, accomplished through His incarnation in Christ and Christ s death in the flesh, over Satan s scheme to derange the divine plan.
[158]  Baptism testifies that we have been baptized into the Triune God Matt 28:19 and have been organically united with Him through the resurrection of Christ, that is, by Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of life.
[159]  First Peter 3:22 tells us that Christ is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to Him.
[160]  This additional word not only unveils to us the glorious result of the suffering of Christ His exaltation after His resurrection and the high and honorable position He now holds in the heavens at the right hand of God but also indicates how glorious and honorable is the organic union we have entered into with Him through baptism, for we were baptized into Him Rom 6:3; Gal 3:27 .
[161]  In 1 Peter 4 Christ is presented as the One whose sufferings we share.
[162]  To live a life that follows the footsteps of Christ, we need a renewed mind Rom 12:2 to understand and realize the way Christ lived to fulfill God s purpose.
[163]  First Peter 4:5 tells us that Christ is ready to judge the living and the dead.
[164]  When the Lord comes back, He will judge the living among the nations at His throne of glory and establish His millennial kingdom Matt 25:31-46 , and He will judge all the dead at the great white throne after the millennium Rev 20:11-15 .
[165]  It is significant that after Peter tells us to have the same mind that Christ had in His suffering, he mentions that Christ will judge the living and the dead.
[166]  This indicates that all our ministry of grace, whether in speaking or in serving, should be full of Christ, so that God may be glorified through Christ in all things.
[167]  Because we believe in Christ, love Christ, live Christ, and bear testimony to Christ, witnessing of Him in this age, the world rises up against us.
[168]  e. If We Are Reproached in the Name of Christ,
[169]  First Peter 4:14 goes on to say, If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.
[170]  To be in the name of Christ is actually to be in the person of Christ, in Christ Himself.
[171]  The believers, having believed into Christ John 3:15 and having been baptized into His name Acts 19:5 , that is, into Himself Gal 3:27 , are in Christ 1 Cor 1:30 and are one with Him 6:17 .
[172]  The reason the persecutions we suffer are the sufferings of Christ is that we suffer in the name of Christ.
[173]  Peter tells us in verse 14 that if we are reproached in the name of Christ, the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon us.
[174]  Today the term Christian should bear a positive meaning, that is, a man of Christ, one who is one with Christ, not only belonging to Him but also having His life and nature in an organic union with Him, and who is living by Him, even living Him, in his daily life.
[175]  In 1 Peter 5 Christ is presented as the Chief Shepherd.
[176]  Today we should be witnesses and partakers of Christ s sufferings so that we will be partakers of His glory to be revealed.
[177]  Peter and the early apostles were witnesses of Christ Acts 1:8 , not only as eyewitnesses testifying of what they had seen of Christ s suffering 5:32; 10:39 but also as martyrs vindicating their testimony by suffering martyrdom for Him 22:20; 2 Cor 1:8-9; 4:10-11; 11:23; 1 Cor 15:31 .
[178]  Today we are following the steps of Christ as the Chief Shepherd, suffering what He has suffered.
[179]  He leads us to feed, look after, teach, and guide the flock of God according to God s intention and to become patterns of the flock vv.
[180]  It is in this Christ, through His all-inclusive redemption and based on all His achievements, that God can be the God of all grace to call us into His eternal glory and to perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us in the Triune God 1:1-2 as the solid foundation, thus enabling us to attain to His glorious goal.
