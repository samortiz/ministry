   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION THIRTY-ONE CONCERNING OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE UNION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When were we united with Christ on the objective side, and when were we united with Him on the subjective side?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We were united with Christ objectively at the time Christ died on the cross: "One died for all, therefore all died" 2 Cor 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Christ died He brought the whole world to the cross with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, all men died in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We were united with Christ subjectively when we were regenerated in the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By reading Romans 6:3-5 and 8, we can see one thing: our subjective union with Christ is altogether in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What does baptism signify?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It signifies burial.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we are baptized, we are objectively declaring that we have died, because only dead people are buried.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We acknowledge that our death is real.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we agree to our burial.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Resurrection comes after a burial.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we rise up again after our burial, we are resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In our daily life, we are not seeking death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, we acknowledge that we have died in Christ, and we daily allow the resurrection life to be lived out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 6 requires us to do one thing, which is to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many people focus their attention on death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why they can never die.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After we believe in the Lord, the first thing we should do is be buried, not die.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to acknowledge our death instead of begging for death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should pay attention to another point.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose someone talks about the cross and says, "First, the Lord died on the cross for me; second, the Lord died on the cross in my place; and third, the Lord died on the cross with me."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Is such a statement scriptural?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let us lay aside the first and second points and focus on the third point: the Lord died on the cross with me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Is it wrong to say this?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we search the entire New Testament, it does not mention that Christ died with me; instead, it says, "I am crucified with Christ" Gal 2:20 , and "Through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world" 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just by reading these two verses, we should know that we died with Christ and not that Christ died with us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is because our union with Christ's death is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ's death is accomplished once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We died in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Saying that Christ died with us would be turning from the objective to the subjective side and would imply that Christ has to be offered up several times.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, Christ dies with Mr. Chang today, and tomorrow He dies with Mr. Yu.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a thousand people believed in Him, He would need to die a thousand times.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must remember that the Bible only tells us the truth: "We have died with Christ," not "Christ died with us."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not think that reversing the order is a trivial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By reversing the order, the truth is no longer the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord's word must not be twisted or reversed.</S>
