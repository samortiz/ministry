   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR SPIRITUAL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING TAKING THE LORD S WAY HAVING AN ABSOLUTE CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH NO BACK DOOR FOR OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Question: What is consecration, and what does it mean to take the Lord s way?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Answer: A believer s genuine consecration is to allow God to come into him and to work in him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to allow God to work in this way, you must learn to follow the sense in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When you sense in your spirit that God has a demand on you, you must go along with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When you sense in your spirit that God wants you to get rid of something, you must obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When you sense in your spirit that God wants you to be broken in a certain aspect, you need to accept His breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is consecration, and this is what it means to take God s way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not difficult to know God s way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is only when we truly want God to work in us and desire to take His way that we feel troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We human beings are crooked by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever there is a demand within, we usually reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When there is a certain feeling, we consider it awhile and then annul it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When a lesson comes to us for our breaking, we put it off and then escape it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some believers have many such experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some do not let God pass through them or work in them even one day of the entire year.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps some have never let God pass through them or work in them in all their Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some brothers and sisters consecrate themselves often, and their consecration is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, whenever they encounter a demand from God, they push it away by making excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>More than ten years ago a brother who was also a co-worker asked me, Do you see any problem in me?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After carefully looking at him for a moment, I said, Do you want me to tell you the truth?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He smilingly nodded.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I said forthrightly, You have one problem, and it is reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He said, I admit I have this problem, but...</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I immediately pointed at him and said, This but of yours is your problem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is seldom that you truly receive into you what others say to you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the surface you receive it, but eventually you have a but, yet, or however.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is your problem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rarely have you absolutely received God s speaking and obeyed any feeling He gives you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the surface you agree with Him, but eventually you always have a nevertheless or however.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You receive whatever leading God gives you, but in the end you always have a however.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Your reasoning is your big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He replied, Brother Lee, I admit this, but...</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is very difficult for a person s natural problems to be broken before God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That day I spoke with that brother for at least two hours, but in the end he still said, Brother Lee, I admit that all you have said is right, but...</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the end of every admission there was a you are right, but...</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After talking for two hours, he was still saying however, but, nevertheless, and yet.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I hope that this illustration gives you some light to realize how difficult it is for us to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many brothers and sisters desire to walk on the Lord s way, but when the time actually comes to walk on it, they almost always have a but, nevertheless, however, or yet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result, they are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That day I finally said strongly, Brother, you are like a smooth pebble.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When you are touched on this side, you roll to the other side; when you are touched on the other side, you roll to this side.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is not a single hammer that can hold you in place.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Others are square and can easily be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You are the only one who is round.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Regardless of the light you have received, you can always roll away with a nevertheless and then roll back with a but.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some saints have been before the Lord for many years but have never been dealt with and have never submitted themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It seems that they really mean business to take the Lord s way, but whenever they encounter a demand, they roll away.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Their rolling is not intentional.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For example, if I have a cubic piece of stone, it will remain in place no matter what I use to strike it from above.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But if I have a marble, it will roll away after I strike it only once.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The marble s rolling is not up to the marble itself; it rolls simply because it is round.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The saints who are like marbles may say that they are willing to be dealt with, but once a practical situation arises, they automatically avoid it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In principle this is a problem that many of us have.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is difficult to find a brother or sister who can genuinely say, O Lord, go ahead and strike me; I will always remain here.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even if Your striking is wrong, I will still accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Very few Christians are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Most Christians would ask, When we follow the inner sense, is it not possible for us to make mistakes?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Should we not consider carefully before we follow the inner sense?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When you begin to consider, you open a back door for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As you consider further, the back door becomes wider.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Indeed, it is not easy for you to consecrate yourself on the altar and accept the breaking, because when God comes to lead you and break you, you have many considerations.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Actually, these considerations are simply nevertheless, but, or however.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A person who truly consecrates himself does not have considerations once he has a sense within.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>His only consideration is that he is afraid of losing God s feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Madame Guyon s autobiography is very helpful in at least two points.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Most people recognize that she accepted the work of the cross, but there is another point.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>She not only accepted the cross but also welcomed it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Today when most Christians have a certain feeling, they consider and reconsider, claiming that they fear the difficulties that might arise if they make a mistake in obeying the feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This kind of consideration apparently comes from a fear of making mistakes, but it actually comes from a fear of difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have only a small fear of obeying wrongly and thus offending God; our great fear is that if we obey wrongly, we might have sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Most of our considerations are not a result of our being afraid of losing our fellowship with God if we make a mistake; rather, they are a result of our being afraid of suffering loss to ourselves if we make a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Madame Guyon s most worthy point before the Lord was that she was not afraid that her feeling would be wrong; she feared only that her self would not suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we have this kind of motive, we will not have considerations when God s feelings come.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All the leading brothers should see that although many saints are perhaps genuine in their consecration, when God s leading truly comes, they shirk it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This kind of shirking is very easy, just as losing God s presence is very easy.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There is only one wall, but there are many back doors but, however, perhaps, and yet.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>May we all exercise to shut the back doors.</S>
