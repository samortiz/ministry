   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE GOD'S WORK OF RECOVERY 1 CO-WORKERS' MEETING 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:6:30 a.m., April 12, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE BEGINNING OF THE RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>MARTIN LUTHER</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's work of recovery began with Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From that time on, God began to have distinct recoveries on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This, of course, does not mean that the recovery began with Luther alone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the same time that he was raised up, other people saw the same things that he did.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is merely taken as a representative of the recovery in that age.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before his time, the truth had become a kind of tradition, the apostolic ministry had become a system of popery, the oneness of the church had become an ecclesiastical ecumenism, and spiritual authority had become political authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church was taken captive to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The prevailing thought at that time was that the church ruled over the world; it declared that the whole world belonged to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result, the Catholic church brought unconverted people into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as a person was a Roman citizen, he was automatically a member of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Spontaneously, infant baptism came in at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Originally, Christians were people who took the voluntary way of poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christians and poor people are always linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when the church opened its door to the world, voluntary poverty was lost, and the church became rich.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Under normal circumstances, there should be two kinds of poor people in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One kind is the naturally poor ones, and the other kind is the voluntarily poor ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today in the church, we have the first kind of poor people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But there is no second kind of poor people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the contrary, there are rich people in the church, and the church is filled with affluence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, although many people are rich in material goods, they are poor in faith, and the inward spiritual content among them becomes more and more depleted.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE RECOVERY OF VOLUNTARY POVERTY</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since the time of Clement, the truth became less and less clear.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, men became more and more capable of analysis and expositions, but at the same time they lacked life and did not have much grace or righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even at the time of Augustine, the truth was still unclear.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Historically speaking, the church was always on the decline.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually it fell to such a low degree that reactions rose up within the Catholic church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One of these reacting ones was Francis of Assisi.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was dissatisfied with the outward riches of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He himself was originally a rich man, or at least the son of a rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Within a few days, he sold everything and gave to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He himself began to practice a life of voluntary poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, the things he wrote are unreadable.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You may tolerate a line or two of his writings, but by the third line they become intolerable.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although we cannot tolerate his writings, the practice of voluntary poverty is nevertheless a right one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the church, those who receive little should not be in want, and those who receive much should not have an excess 2 Cor 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not a sin to receive much, but it is a sin to receive much and to have excess.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a man knows the Lord, he will invest everything in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a man says that he loves the Lord, yet will not invest in the Lord, his love is false.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord says that the poor we always have with us John 12:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He did not say that we always have the poor brothers with us in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, He says that the poor we always have with us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Among the brothers and sisters, it is not difficult to be without want.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As long as those who have excess would give away, poor brothers will not appear among us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord's principle is not to keep, but to give.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we all give, there will not be unnecessary riches in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is abnormal that some people are too rich in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All excess riches have to be given away.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the world, people would throw away their lives in exchange for money.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But in the Bible, God wants our lives instead of money.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot be a Christian in an uncertain way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our God is not uncertain; He is very specific.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He wants not only our money, but our lives also.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Later, in Moravia God raised up Count Zinzendorf of Saxony.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was originally an aristocrat and a man of learning.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For the Lord's sake, he set aside his estate to receive all kinds of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Through his work, the Moravians were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Out of this group, many people were sent to foreign lands.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The number of those sent out from them exceeds that sent from any other group and ranks highest in terms of percentage.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After this, there was Sister Eva, who was a German.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>She also took the way of voluntary poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the last century, the Brethren were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They were very strong in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although they did not like to talk very much about themselves, a few dozen of their leaders also sold all their possessions at one time to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For a Christian, the question of money must be settled once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If it is not settled, the Lord cannot have a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What is the meaning of degradation in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It means that the principle of economy has come into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Once the principle of economy comes in, everything will be reckoned according to value, and the Lord will have no way to go on.</S>
