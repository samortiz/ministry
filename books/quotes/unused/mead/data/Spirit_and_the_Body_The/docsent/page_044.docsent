   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPEAKING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The seven Spirits are also the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 2:7 says, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today we are hearing the speaking of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Christianity many sermons are given from many platforms, but I wonder how much of this speaking is the speaking of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The speaking of the Spirit to the churches is in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can those not in the churches hear what the Spirit is speaking to the churches?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The speaking of the Spirit always turns us to the infusing of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit's speaking is Christ's infusing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you listen to His speaking, you will immediately be under Christ's transfusing and infusing, and you will be immersed into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today the seven Spirits are speaking to the churches, and anyone who has an ear and listens to this speaking will be turned to Christ's infusing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not analyze this with your mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, check with your spirit and with your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever you listen to the speaking of the seven Spirits of God to the churches, you are immediately under a precious, sweet, and dear transfusing, an infusing that changes you, transforms you, makes you the proper material, and builds you into God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whatever must go to the lake of fire is burned away by the seven lamps, and now you are under the seven eyes, being infused with all that Christ is to become part of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE SEVEN SPIRITS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BECOMING THE ONE RIVER</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually the seven Spirits become one river Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the first chapter of Revelation we have the seven Spirits before the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the last chapter the seven Spirits as the seven lamps and the seven eyes become the one river of water of life flowing out from God's administrative throne.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This river contains the tree of life to supply the entire city of New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a sense, even today the seven lamps and the seven eyes become the river of life in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The seven Spirits are either for searching and judging or for transfusing and infusing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But eventually these seven Spirits become the river of life flowing throughout God's building to supply the life that is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the book of Revelation we have a clear picture.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we look at this picture, we shall see that today the life-giving Spirit is the seven Spirits of God, who are the seven lamps burning to search and judge the negative things and the seven eyes to infuse us with the positive things and with Christ's essence for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we are under the infusing of these seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually, the seven Spirits become the river of life flowing through the churches to bring us the life supply so that we may be nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How wonderful and marvelous this is!</S>
