   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE CHURCH BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD S PLAN IN ETERNITY AN EXPLANATION OF</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE TRAINING REGULATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to have some explanation regarding this training.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, I hope that we can all be adjusted in our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every time we come together, it seems as if we are coming to a meeting, but during this training we must all be clear that we are coming for a class, not a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even in our prayers we should not say that this is a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to consider our meeting hall as a classroom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are not coming here to meet but to attend class.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even when we sing, praise, and worship God, we should not have the feeling that this is a meeting; rather, we should realize that this is a class.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, we did not expect that so many would participate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are approximately three hundred seventy saints, which is nearly double the number that we expected.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All those who have enrolled, especially the ones from Taipei, were recommended by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, some saints repeatedly entreated us for permission to come; as a result, there is now a large number of brothers and sisters participating.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, there are some who have not been saved for a sufficient period of time and some who are a bit too old.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are afraid that they may not be able to keep up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the training the trainees need to listen in class, take notes, do their homework, take the tests, and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of these requirements, the elderly saints may be able to fulfill the first only with much effort.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In regard to the second requirement, we expect the trainees to take notes of at least seven hundred to one thousand words per class.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am afraid that many elderly saints may not be able to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The third requirement is to do the homework.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The trainees must spend three hours in the afternoon, putting everything aside to concentrate on the homework.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fourth requirement is that the trainees must take the tests.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this they will need to memorize all the teaching materials and be able to apply them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fifth requirement is that they must practice and exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes the trainees will be required to stand up and speak in front of the class, and sometimes they will speak in the church meetings according to our arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The last four items may be quite difficult for the elderly saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet because we respect their portion and function in the church, it is difficult to reject them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even though spiritual matters are not based upon knowledge or a certain level of education, this training will deal with spiritual matters in the way of education.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since this is a matter of education, there is a requirement for a certain level of education.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, we originally hoped that all the participants would be at least high school graduates; nevertheless, in this training there are many who have not attained to the high school level.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We treasure the spiritual condition of these saints before the Lord and their desperateness for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we reject them, we will not feel right; moreover, we are fearful of interfering with the Lord s work in them and hurting their feeling toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For this reason we are allowing them to participate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are fellowshipping regarding all these matters because we desire that everyone would understand the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, we hope that everyone attending this training will be more serious, pursue the Lord to a greater degree, and have more prayer before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We require everyone attending the classes to take notes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This, of course, excludes the few elderly co-workers who have been invited to come as guests and not as trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They may or may not take notes as they wish.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The rest of the brothers and sisters, who have been given permission to attend the training, must take notes of at least seven hundred words per class.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The notes must have clear headings, and every word of each outline must be copied in the notes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They can take notes of the lectures, based on their understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, we need to assign people to check everyone s notes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There should be one note-checker for every five or ten trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>During the training some will live in the dormitory, and some will commute.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All those who live in the dormitory must do their homework from 3:00 to 5:30 P.M. This is mandatory.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If anyone violates this regulation, we will ask him not to come to class the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Also, during this period of time, the trainees will not be allowed to receive visitors.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have particularly charged those given responsibility for the dormitory to turn away all visitors.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have prepared a desk for each of the trainees who live in the dormitory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They must use the two and a half hours in the afternoon to do homework, either studying their notes from the morning session or organizing their notes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They must learn to apply and memorize what they have heard in order to prepare for the next day s testing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The testing will be carried out in the following manner: Today s classes will be tested tomorrow; every class will be tested once.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After the trainees finish the first morning session, they will need to do the homework in the afternoon, and then they will be tested the next morning.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They not only must be serious; they must also practice and exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They must exercise in the class.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Sometimes we will ask a trainee to speak to the class concerning what was heard the previous day, and sometimes we will arrange for a brother to speak in a particular church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a practical training and exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Moreover, everyone must strictly abide by the rules and regulations of the training.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>First, if a trainee is a few minutes late to class, he will be considered tardy; after being tardy three times, he will be dropped automatically from the class.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Second, being absent and being tardy are both violations of the regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If a trainee has something important to do and cannot make the class, he must ask for a formal leave of absence.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Third, if a trainee fails the testing three times, we will ask that he please drop the class voluntarily.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Every trainee must be absolutely obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If a trainee is disobedient even one time, we ask that he please drop the class.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For example, if a trainee is called to be tested, and he is shy and asks to be tested the next time, this is being disobedient.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Regardless of whether or not he knows the answer, when a trainee is called on for a test, he must take it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Fourth, the trainees in this training can be divided into three groups.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The first group is made up of those who came from other cities and who have received hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These brothers and sisters will have free time only on the Lord s Day afternoons; they may use this time to buy things, visit friends, or do other things.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>For the rest of the six and a half days, they must stay in the dormitory.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>During the training no one is allowed to speak of anything other than spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should not discuss things such as international, financial, political, or personal affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Only spiritual fellowship and pursuit are allowed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everyone has paid a great price to come to this training.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Most of us have given up our jobs, temporarily left our families, and spent time and money to come.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hence, we want to make the most of every moment in order to obtain a good result.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I hope that the brothers and sisters will cooperate by not wasting any time.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The second group consists of those who are serving full-time in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I hope that they can also do the homework from 3:00 to 5:30 P.M. For the rest of the time, because they are serving in different places, they may freely serve, but they cannot do other things.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The third group consists of those who live in the workers home.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Some of them are serving in the Taiwan Gospel Book Room, and some are local working saints who need to go to work after the training classes.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I hope all of them can spend at least two hours on the homework every day.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They can decide what time they will use for this.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I think we need some explanation regarding the seating arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The brothers and sisters who attend every class have been seated at the front.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Those who attend some of the courses will be seated in the back.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, there are a few exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The life-study training in the evening is open to all the saints, but the trainees should sit in their assigned seats because it is still a class.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>For the rest of the brothers and sisters it is simply a meeting; thus, they can sit in seats without numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Since we are attending a class, we should sit in our assigned seats.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Moreover, the outlines for the life-study training will be printed and distributed as a help to get into the messages.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Nevertheless, the outlines cannot replace our notes.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The trainees must still take notes.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In addition, the brothers and sisters from out of town are not permitted to leave freely during the eight weeks of this training.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>All those who need to leave must first submit a letter and obtain permission.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Only those who fulfill one of the following qualifications may leave: First, if a trainee is summoned by his locality to go back and serve, we will consider and see if that locality truly has a desperate need.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Second, some of the saints who are from out of town have asked for leave from their jobs for three days per week and need to go back to work for the remainder of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We are sympathetic toward this kind of situation and have decided to allow these brothers and sisters to go back.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>These two groups of brothers and sisters can leave after the evening class on Thursday.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>But they must be in their seats before eight o clock on Tuesday morning; otherwise, they will be considered tardy.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>In this training there will be three sessions every morning from Tuesday to Thursday; this will result in nine sessions per week, totaling seventy-two sessions over a period of eight weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>In addition, we may also have classes on Friday during the final week; thus, we may have as many as seventy-five sessions.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>However, in these seventy-some sessions we will cover only one topic: the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The content of the life-study training in the evening will cover the five books in the Old Testament that we did not finish last year.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This will include Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>These five books were written in Hebrew in a poetic style; thus, the Bible expositors call them the books of poetry.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>They belong to a special category.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I hope that we will spend much time to study these five books during the next eight weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We must familiarize ourselves with the main ideas of these books.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If we do not, I am afraid that we may not be able to keep up with the class.</S>
