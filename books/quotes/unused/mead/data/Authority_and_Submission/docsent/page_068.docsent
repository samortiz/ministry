   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW GOD DEALS WITH THE MISTAKES OF THE DEPUTY AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Numbers 30:13 tells us how God upholds His appointed deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It says that a husband can establish the vow his wife vows, or make it void.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, God tells the wife to submit to the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the other hand, He upholds the authority of the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even if the husband voids both the vow and the oath of the wife, she has to submit, and it is not reckoned to her as a sin if she breaks them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the husband voids the vow of the wife, he will have to bear his wife's iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We who are deputy authorities may propose something.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who are under us should submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They may be wrong, but the sin is not reckoned upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, we who make the proposal will have to bear their iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we should never propose or suggest anything rashly, because we will have to bear the consequence of it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The most dangerous thing is to be a counselor of the church and to propose something lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can find no clearer picture of man's requirement to submit to deputy authority in the Bible than in Numbers 30.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There we see God asking man to submit to deputy authority unconditionally.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same way, there is no clearer picture of the serious responsibility that an authority bears before God than in Numbers 30.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more proposals a deputy authority makes, the more trouble he is asking for himself, and the more he will invite God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to learn to not control others' lives presumptuously.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not subject others to our own ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before we have the full assurance, we should not take the burden of others upon ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only a broken and pliable man will be free from iniquity before God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A hard and opinionated man will bear much iniquity before God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Body life is the basis of guidance in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to live in the Body life, to fellowship with the Lord, and to fellowship with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not be individualistic in our decisions, and we should not be so self-assured.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more we present our decision to the church and the more we fellowship with the members, the more assurance we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should never bear the name of the Body while occupying ourselves with activities of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do, we should expect nothing except the bearing of our own iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should wait before the Lord, understand His will, and be open to others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not speak before we are taught or relate things to others before we see them ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do, we will lay up iniquity for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A deputy authority must be meek and humble.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This will save him from getting into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Otherwise, God will have strong words for him because he will bear the iniquity of others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a sober matter.</S>
