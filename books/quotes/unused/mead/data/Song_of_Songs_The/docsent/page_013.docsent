   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE KING'S REPLY 2:2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 2 says, "As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The King is saying that she is indeed a lily, not in contrast to the valleys, but in contrast to the thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that the maiden is a lily, whereas everyone else is just thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the Bible, thorns refer to two things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, they refer to man's natural life after Adam's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The basis for saying this is Genesis 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There the thorns grew by themselves and did not come out as a result of sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Another basis for saying this is in Exodus 3, the chapter on the thornbush.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The fire was burning, yet the thornbush was not consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fire and the light did not come from the thorns themselves, but from God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God used the thorns, but He did not cause any loss to the thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that God would use Moses to deal with the Israelites and the Gentiles according to Himself, and not according to man's natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A proper testimony has, as its capital, not things from man, but things from God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God did not use anything that came from Moses; He only used that which issued from Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, the thorns signify that which grows out of the natural realm.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This refers to the results of sin and the natural self.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is typified by the thorns in Matthew 13:7.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The thorns in Hebrews 6:8 signify the fruit that comes out of a person's own self-will, whose end is to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word "daughters" is "maidens" RSV ; it is plural in number.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These maidens are not the daughters of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord considers those who pursue after Him as lilies, unlike those who are born of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord declares them to be different from those who live in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is sinful living and the natural life all around them, but these ones are different.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are the ones who have faith the lilies .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the same time, this hints at the sufferings a seeker endures in the midst of an environment of natural and sinful living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>X. THE MAIDEN'S PRAISE AND ENJOYMENT 2:3-6</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 3 says, "As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now she takes her turn to compare the King to the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"The sons" refer to all the things that capture one's heart, everything that is desired Gen 3:6 , everything that can serve as the master of one's heart, and everyone to whom the believer's heart would turn.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Notice the words "apple tree among the trees."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the original language "apple" is "bergamot orange."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is an evergreen plant and does not shed its leaves in winter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Outwardly, it looks somewhat like a pomegranate, and it tastes somewhat like an orange and lemon.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"The sons" can only be compared to ordinary trees, whereas the beloved has three characteristics: 1 He can become a forest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Emphasis is placed on the word "wood," which denotes tallness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2 His overshadowing never fails.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is an evergreen and therefore provides shade all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>3 He bears fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many trees are green but do not bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is tall, overshadowing, and fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The maiden has come to realize the Lord as the One who is all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Prior to this, she has given herself fully to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But now she declares her testimony; these are the words out of her mouth, what she says publicly to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She not only acknowledges that He is the wine, but she praises the wine itself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At this time no person or thing can usurp her heart any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are no longer divisions in the church into those of Paul and those of Apollos, which divisions are but things of the flesh 1 Cor 3:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now the Lord has filled her sight.</S>
