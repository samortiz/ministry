   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Do not think that it is enough to have a bath once and be cleansed by the blood of the Lord once.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do not think that we can get by loosely when we are defiled by the dirt on our way through the world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord said that if our feet are not washed, we will have no part with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means His fellowship with us today will be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His fellowship with us in the future kingdom will also be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How important are the daily cleansings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must allow the Lord to wash our feet every day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to come back every day to be recovered and to get the application of the power of Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not need the blood of the Lord Jesus to wash us again before God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord's work before God has been finished once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But we can experience the washing many times.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The blood of His Son washes our sins again and again continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we must have our feet washed every day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to take care of the cleanliness of our feet every day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Peter was like we are.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He always went to extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He went to one end at one time and then to the other end at another time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At one moment he said that the Lord would never wash his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then when he heard the Lord say that he would have no part with Him if there were no foot-washing, he asked that his head and his hands be washed as well.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus showed him that this other extreme is wrong also.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord said that he who is bathed has no need except to wash his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one can repent and believe in the Lord twice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No one can be regenerated twice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No one can receive the Savior twice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once you come to the Lord Jesus and accept Him as Savior, that is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Perhaps you doubt for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps you think that when you accepted Him as Savior the last time, you did not do a good enough job, and perhaps you begin to doubt after a few days; you want to accept Him again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the Lord said that there is no need.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The head does not need to be washed again, and the hands do not need to be washed again.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus said that those who have taken a bath only need to have their feet washed in order to be wholly clean.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We only need one bath for the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although we touch the world and dirty our feet often, this does not affect the cleanliness of our whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There needs to be only one bath for the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The bath cannot be repeated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even if you walk in the mud and your feet become black, it will not affect the cleanliness of your whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Your body does not need to be cleansed again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once you have received the Lord Jesus as the Savior, your body is cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From then on, you do not need to wash your body again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When a man is cleansed once, he is cleansed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No one can deny this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One's feet can get dirty, and he can be cut off from the fellowship of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He can have no share in the kingdom, but the whole body is still clean.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All those who are bathed need to wash only their feet, and they will be fully clean.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What we are doing day by day is looking back at our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus has done an eternal work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Day by day as we live on earth, we need to keep only our feet clean and free from dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we pick up some dirt by accident, we can still receive a daily washing, so that we can enjoy uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord and reign with Him tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May the Lord keep our feet clean day after day, so that we can glorify His name here on earth.</S>
