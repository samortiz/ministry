   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR A LOVING HEART</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND A RECEIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible reveals that we were made as vessels so that the Lord could be our life and content.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is rather easy to take a cup and to fill it with water.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not so easy, though, for God to fill us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to be filled, we need a heart that loves the Lord and a spirit to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, when we were regenerated, the Lord renewed our heart and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ezekiel 36:26-27 says that the Lord gave us a new heart and a new spirit and that He put His own Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As physical beings, we need food.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, in order to receive the food, we need a heart to desire the food and a mouth and stomach to receive the food.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without a heart to desire the food and a mouth and stomach to receive the food, we could never take in the food.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes we cannot eat because we do not have the appetite, and other times we cannot eat because there is a problem with our mouth or an ulcer in our stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, even though the food may be quite delicious, and though we may truly need it, we may be unable to eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is often the situation in our relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times we simply do not have a heart for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even though we may pray to Him with our mouth, our heart may be far away from Him Matt 15:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, we may not know how to exercise our spirit to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How can we receive the Lord if our heart is far from Him and we do not know how to use our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The real Christian life is not a matter of teaching; it is a matter of Christ Himself as a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not good enough to come to the Lord merely to learn something.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must come to contact the Lord as a living person and take Him as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we come to a meal, there is no need to learn anything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What we need is an appetite and to know how to exercise our mouth and our stomach to take in the food.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whenever we come to a meeting, to the Word, or to the Lord directly, we must exercise our heart to love Him and exercise our spirit to contact, take in, and receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, many times when we come to the meetings or read the Word, we do not have a heart that is turned toward the Lord, or we do not know how to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are like people who are sitting at a dining table spread with delicious food but are only looking at and examining the food, not knowing how to exercise our mouths and stomachs to eat the food.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must ask ourselves whether or not we have a real, sincere heart that loves the Lord and whether or not we know the best way to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may have a brilliant mind, but do we have a loving heart and a seeking spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do we have a sincere heart and a right spirit toward the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our primary responsibility is not to learn about the Lord but to take and receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must take the Lord in first by our heart and then by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must exercise our heart to love the Lord and exercise our spirit to take in, contact, and receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not a doctrine; this is a spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord is so real and living to us because He is the Spirit and is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we know how to exercise our spirit, we will be able to contact the Lord and be in the current of the transmitting Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Holy Spirit as the transmitting current will transmit the essence of the Lord into us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, we must allow our concepts and thoughts to be adjusted and corrected.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not by thinking in our mind that we contact the Lord; rather, it is by loving the Lord with our heart and receiving Him with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must pray again and again that the Lord would enable us to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Day and night, morning and evening, we must pray that the Lord would strengthen us to love Him in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more we love the Lord, the more our heart will be purified and renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>DEALING WITH THE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to have a heart that loves the Lord, we must deal with our heart, which has four parts the conscience, the mind, the will, and the emotion Heb 10:22; Matt 9:4; Heb 4:12; John 16:6, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The conscience must be purified and cleansed by the precious blood of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must have a conscience without offense Acts 24:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If there is any condemnation or offense in our conscience, this will spoil our heart, and our heart will not be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, we must confess all our sins to the Lord and have our conscience sprinkled from every evil thing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we will have a conscience void of offense and will be at peace in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, our mind must be simplified.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we are with the Lord, we should not consider or think too much.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Instead, we should be simple in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must be careful that our thoughts would not be corrupted by the enemy from the simplicity toward Christ 2 Cor 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The brothers must especially be careful not to exercise their mind too much.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you have a brilliant mind and exercise it too much, your mind may be corrupted from the simplicity toward the Lord by too much considering.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Much of the time we are troubled by this kind of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, we must ask the Lord to simplify our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must have a mind like a child s Matt 18:3; Mark 10:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Also, our will must be meek and soft, and our emotion must be full of love.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then our heart will be a right heart, a pure heart, and a heart that loves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This was the kind of heart that Mary had as she poured the precious ointment upon the Lord Matt 26:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Her heart was a heart with a clean conscience, a simple mind, a meek will, and an emotion full of love.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How she loved the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must ask the Lord to give us such a heart and to renew our heart to such a condition.</S>
