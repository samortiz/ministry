Any locality near Hankow that wants to buy publications from our book room can buy them directly from Hankow. Those who live in Hankow should go to Gospel Court, Hsiao Tung 1 Alley. If Hankow does not have a certain book, Shanghai will send it by mail. However, we ask you to forgive us for the time it takes in the mail.</p><h2 class="head2">Two</h2><p>(1) This publication is temporarily being published in Hankow. Therefore, news of the work and the churches, subscription order forms, and requests for information should be sent directly to the Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow.</p><p>(2) Because the mail is often delayed, one or two copies of this publication will be sent by the fastest method to all the localities. We will then send the rest according to our subscription list. At the same time, we will send a large number to the responsible brothers of each locality and ask them to distribute the publication to each brother and sister.</p><p>(3) The Christian is about to be printed in Shanghai. If there is any change to the subscription quantity or address of any reader, we would appreciate you informing the Gospel Book Room in Shanghai as soon as possible. This will save us much wasted money and shipping labor. The brothers and sisters who love us will certainly sympathize with us in this matter! If you can send anything by airmail, it is better that you inform us by airmail. If you cannot send anything by air, a postcard may be faster than a sealed envelope. If you have a change of address, please specify the old address and the old province for our quick reference, and please write the new address as clearly as possible. (We have registered the changes of those who have written already.) Many areas have been turned into war zones, and we cannot send anything to them for now.</p><p>(4) All the letters for The Christian that are received in Hankow will be forwarded to the Shanghai Gospel Book Room to be recorded and answered.</p><p>March 30, 1938, Hankow</p><h1 class="series">* * *</h1><p>If any brother or sister has a letter that they want us to redirect, please send it to Brother Lan Tsi-yi, Gospel Court, Hsiao Tung 1 Alley, Hankow.</p><p>We have a letter for Sun Yu-teh from his family.</p><p>The emphasis of The Open Door is the gospel work in all the localities.
