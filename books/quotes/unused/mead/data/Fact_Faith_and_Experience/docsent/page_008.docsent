   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW WERE MEN SAVED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If the blood of bulls and goats was not able to remove sin, as we mentioned earlier, how then were those in the Old Testament saved?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man had sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, only a man could accomplish the redemption of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although the animals were innocent, and although they were without blemish, they could not redeem man from his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why then did God promise in Leviticus 17 that the blood of creatures was able to redeem one from sin?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There must be some very profound meaning here.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The things of the law are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ Col 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the sacrifices and the offerings in the Old Testament all refer to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although Christ had not yet died at the time of the first covenant, God intended that all the sacrifices offered at that time be a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their death was taken as the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through the blood of many animals, God saw the blood of His beloved Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through many bulls and goats, He saw the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through the many sacrifices, He saw the substitutional death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When He accepted those offerings, it was as if He was accepting the merit of the death of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because of this, man was redeemed from his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God reckoned the innocent bulls and goats as His dear Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, He could forgive the sinners based upon the sacrifices they offered.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every time the offerings were slaughtered, they spoke of the coming sacrifice of the Son of God as the sin offering on Golgotha and of His accomplishment of the eternal work of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the Lord is a man, He is able to redeem man from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because He is God, He is able to redeem all men, past and present, from their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who offered the sacrifices in the Old Testament, consciously or unconsciously, believed in a coming crucified Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All their sacrifices were to turn them to the coming Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the Lord Jesus was not yet born at that time, faith did not look at what could be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, it looked at what could not be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Faith saw a vicarious Savior from afar and trusted in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the time came, the Son of God came and died for men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What had only been a matter of faith then became a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>HOW ARE MEN SAVED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We know that we are in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How are we saved in this age?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ has died and salvation is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we believe in the Lord Jesus, which means that by faith we receive Him as the Savior, we will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some have a hard time understanding how Christ could have died for them before they were even born.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Indeed this presents a problem to the physical senses.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet to faith, this is a glorious truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, we must realize that time cannot restrict God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To us mortals, a few decades is a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But our God is an eternal God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To Him, even a thousand years do not mean much.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although time can restrict us, it cannot restrict Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, even though we believe in a Lord who died once for us many years ago, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible says that the Lord Jesus offered up Himself once and accomplished the work of redemption Heb 7:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why He can transcend time to redeem those who were thousands of years before Him as well as those who are thousands of years after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not only can He redeem those thousands of years after Him; if, unfortunately, the world goes on for millions of years more, His redemption will still be effective.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once He finished His work, it was accomplished forever.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a sinner desires to be saved now, the Lord does not need to die for him again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This one only needs to accept the merit of the Lord s one offering, and he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our faith is not restricted by time either.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Faith can lead one into the reality of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As men in the Old Testament looked to a coming Savior and were saved, in the same way we look to a past Savior and are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The fact that the matter is past does not mean that it is over.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, it means that it is done.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The men in the Old Testament looked forward.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We at the present time look backward.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Faith caused those in the Old Testament to accept a coming Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Will not our faith cause us to accept a past Savior?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In reading Hebrews 9:12-15 it would be very meaningful if we link together the three eternals in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord accomplished an eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By offering up Himself to God through the eternal Spirit, we have obtained an eternal inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, whenever men believe in Him, they receive this redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We ought to realize that the worth of the cross is not determined by man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Rather, it is determined by God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God considers the redemption of the cross as eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, we sinners who have no righteousness of our own should acknowledge God s word as true and should act according to His word and believe in the cross of His Son and be saved.</S>
