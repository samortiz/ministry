   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE DEADNESS OF SARDIS A. To Be Conquered in the Body Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first enemy is the deadness of Sardis Rev 3:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This enemy is conquered in the Body life Rom 12:3-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you are not living in the Body, you are through.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You cannot conquer deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today's Christians are dead because they do not live in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>B. By: 1.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Presenting Our Bodies as a Living Sacrifice to God</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 12:1 says that we need to present our bodies as a living sacrifice to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our body includes our entire person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our spirit and our soul are within our body, so if our body is presented to the Lord, our entire being is presented to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may say that we have already offered ourselves to the Lord, but we need to repeat our consecration every day and even many times throughout the day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This may be likened to eating.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot say that we do not need to eat today because we have eaten yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to eat three meals a day every day in order to stay healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Consecration also is not a once for all matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It should be something continuous, without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every day and every moment in everything, we need to stand on the ground of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Being Transformed from the Fashion of This Age by the Renewing of Our Mind</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We also need to be transformed from the fashion of this age by the renewing of our mind Rom 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To offer our bodies to the Lord is to deal with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be transformed by the renewing of the mind is to deal with this age, the practical world in front of us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to deal with ourselves, and we need to deal with our relationship with and concept concerning the practical world, which is today's age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are deadened because we do not present ourselves to the Lord and because we secretly follow this age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To present our body is to give ourselves to the Lord without any reservation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not keep any part of ourselves for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must give ourselves to the Lord absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Also, we should not secretly follow this age.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The age in front of us is very subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have seen some of the saints unconsciously become deceived by the age to follow it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot conquer deadness if we follow this age even partially.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The age is not hidden, but our following of it is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may still have a pretense that we love the Lord to the uttermost, but actually there is an undercurrent within us to follow the age, to love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we are being secretly fashioned according to this age, how can we be living in the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the United States today there are two very negative things: sin and the age.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These two things are deadening the Christians in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our mind needs to be renewed so that we will not be fashioned according to this age.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE LUKEWARMNESS OF LAODICEA A. To Be Conquered by the Seeking of the Riches of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We also need to conquer the lukewarmness of Laodicea Rev 3:14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can do this by seeking the riches of Christ Rev 3:17-18, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may be enjoying Christ to a certain extent, but we need to enjoy Him in a deeper, higher, broader, and richer way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should tell the Lord that we want to have new experiences of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some among us may be enjoying Christ in the same way that they did ten years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that they have become lukewarm and are self-contented.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>B. By: 1.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Not Being Slothful in Zeal</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Romans 12:11a says that we should not be slothful in zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Being Burning in Spirit, Serving the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Romans 12:11b says that we need to be burning in spirit, serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must seek the riches of Christ continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not be slothful, but we should be burning in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then the lukewarmness will be swallowed up by the burning in our spirit.</S>
