   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-FOUR EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE EPISTLES 60 81.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Mystery of God</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Colossians 2:2-23 reveals that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 2 Paul speaks of the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that, as God s story and God s everything, Christ declares God in full.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the mystery of God, Christ is the Word of God John 1:1; Rev 19:13 ; Christ is the definition, explanation, and expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, as the mystery of God, the mysterious story of God, the all-inclusive Christ is the history of God; the whole story of God is in Christ and is Christ John 1:14; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rev 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although God is infinite and eternal, without beginning or ending, He also has a history, a story.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s history refers to the process through which He passed so that He may come into man and that man may be brought into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to His good pleasure, God created the heavens and the earth and all the billions of items in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, God accomplished the work of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Genesis 1:1 tells us that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, but Matthew 28:19 speaks of baptizing believers into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We know that the Father, Son, and Spirit are the God spoken of in Genesis 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the difference is that at the time of Genesis 1:1, God had not yet been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word in Matthew 28:19 was spoken by the Lord after He had entered into resurrection, having passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After His resurrection, He charged His disciples to disciple the nations and to baptize them, not into the name of the Creator, whom we may call the unprocessed God but to baptize them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is to baptize the believers into the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The processed God is God available to His chosen people, and His people can thus be baptized into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although it is not possible to baptize believers into God as He is revealed in Genesis 1:1, we can baptize them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; that is, we can baptize them into the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today the processed Triune God is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the time of John 7:39, the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He had not yet passed through death and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now that Christ has passed through death and has entered into resurrection, the Spirit is here.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This Spirit is Christ, and Christ is the story of God, the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the story of God, Christ is the processed God, God processed to become the all-inclusive Spirit, who now dwells in our spirit and is one with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Christ whom we have received is the mystery of God and the history of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Christ whom we have received is God with His wonderful history God who passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, glorification, and enthronement.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the history of God, Christ is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because the Jews do not have Christ, the God in whom they believe does not have such a history.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Apart from Christ, there is neither the history of God nor the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the mystery of God, Christ also is both the embodiment of God Col 2:9 and the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to know Christ in reality as the embodiment of God, we need to experience Him as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The reality of Christ as the embodiment of God is in Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the mystery of God, Christ is not only the embodiment of the fullness of God but also the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit to be one spirit with us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should tell the Lord, I care only for You as the embodiment of God and as the life-giving Spirit in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because You are so real, living, and practical in my spirit, I can live by You and with You.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lord, my only desire is to experience You in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to focus our attention upon Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As the mystery of God, the all-inclusive Christ is the embodiment of God and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the mystery of Christ, the church is the Body of Christ, His fullness, and the new man to be the full expression of Christ 1:23; Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As Christ is the history of God, so the church is the history of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As the history of Christ, the church is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the church we are a continuation of this history.</S>
