   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Encompassed and Surrounded</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>by Evil Men</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While Christ was being crucified on the cross, many fierce men, like the mighty bulls of Bashan, encompassed Him v. 12 . They opened their mouth at Him like a ravening and roaring lion v. 13 . Evil men, a congregation of evildoers signified by dogs, surrounded and enclosed Him v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Being Pierced on His Hands, Feet, and Side</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Psalm 22:16 also says, They pierce my hands and feet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Zechariah 12:10 prophesies concerning Christ as the One whom they have pierced.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fulfillment of these prophecies is found in the New Testament in John 19:34 cf. v. 37 . Christ s two hands and two feet were nailed to the cross, and His side was pierced with a spear by one of the Roman soldiers who executed Him and immediately there came out blood and water v. 34 . John indicates in verse 37 that this fulfilled Zechariah s prophecy: They will look upon Me, whom they have pierced Zech 12:10 . Two substances came out of the Lord s pierced side: blood and water.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Blood is for redemption, to deal with sins John 1:29; Heb 9:22 for the purchasing of the church Acts 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Water is for imparting life, to deal with death John 12:24; 3:14-15 for the producing of the church Eph 5:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This picture shows that the Lord s death, on the negative side, takes away our sins and, on the positive side, imparts life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His death is not only for terminating the old creation and redeeming sinners from death, but even more, it is for imparting life and producing the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Being Stripped of the Right to Be Clothed and Put to Shame Publicly</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Psalm 22:18 says that they divided His garments to themselves, and for His clothing they cast lots John 19:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In His crucifixion, the Lord s right to be clothed was stripped from Him, along with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They made the Lord Jesus altogether naked in order to have a public, shameful display.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Enduring Great Pain and Agony</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Being Poured Out like Water,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His Bones Being out of Joint,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His Heart Melting like Wax,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His Strength Being Dried Up,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>and His Tongue Being Stuck to His Jaws</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the cross Christ was poured out like water Psa 22:14a .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the pouring out of His soul, His life Isa 53:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All His bones were out of joint, because He could not hold up the weight of His body as it hung on the cross Psa 22:14b .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This caused Him great agony and pain.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His heart was like wax melted within Him v. 14c-d , His strength was dried up like a shard, and His tongue was stuck to His jaws 22:15a-b; John 19:28 . Finally, God put Him into death, that is, put Him in the dust of death Psa 22:15c . Jesus dying was God s putting Him into death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If Jesus had been killed only by man, He could never have been our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He would merely have been a martyr.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But God judged Him and put Him into death for our redemption Isa 53:4, 10a .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>D. Men Giving Him Gall and Vinegar</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Psalm 69:21 David says, They gave me gall for my food, / And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This prophesies that man gave gall and vinegar to Christ on the cross Matt 27:34; John 19:28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to Matthew and Mark, wine mingled with gall was offered to the Lord before crucifixion, but when He tasted it, He would not drink Matt 27:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The wine mingled with gall also had myrrh Mark 15:23 , and it was used as a stupefying drink.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even though the Lord knew that He was going to suffer great pain on the cross, He would not be stupefied; rather, He would drink the bitter cup to the dregs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John 19:28-29 says, Jesus, knowing that all things had now been finished and so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There was lying there a vessel full of vinegar; therefore, they put a sponge full of vinegar on hyssop and brought it to His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thirst is a taste of death Luke 16:24; Rev 21:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord thirsted on the cross, which means that He tasted death on our behalf and on behalf of everything Heb 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even though He thirsted, man gave Him vinegar to mock Him Mark 15:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After Jesus had taken the vinegar, He said, It is finished!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And He bowed His head and delivered up His spirit John 19:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>E. Being Forsaken by God and Put into Death</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Psalm 22:1 prophesied that Christ was forsaken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the end of His crucifixion, Christ cried out, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ was on the cross for six hours, from the third hour, 9:00 A.M., until the ninth hour, 3:00 P.M. In the first three hours He was persecuted by men for doing God s will; in the last three hours He was judged by God to accomplish our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>During the last three hours, God counted Him as our Substitute, who suffered for our sin Isa 53:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While He was on the earth, the Father was with Him all the time John 8:29 , but at the end of His crucifixion, God left Him economically.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Essentially, God could never leave Him, because He and the Father are one 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But economically, God caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him Isa 53:6 , making Christ the righteous One, the Substitute for the unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God considered Christ an offering for sin, making Him sin on our behalf v. 10; 2 Cor 5:21 and judging Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, God economically left Him temporarily so that man s sin and sins and all negative things could be dealt with on the cross.</S>
