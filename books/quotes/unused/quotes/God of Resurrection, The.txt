For our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory'
For they indeed disciplined us for a few days as it seemed good to them, but He for our profit that we might partake of His holiness'
We know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to the purpose
Others go still further and inquire: 'How does it come about that, the more spiritual you become, the more hardship you meet'?
Suffering is needful if we are to comfort others, for only they who themselves have suffered can truly help other people
The discipline of suffering is essential if we are to acquire endurance, for, as Romans 5 says: 'Tribulation works endurance'
That purpose has been revealed to us through the Scriptures, but it can only be realized in us through suffering
Its realization involves an experimental knowledge of God, not only as the living God, but also as the God of resurrection
The Scriptures declared that the Word which became flesh would be called 'Immanuel,' which means, 'God with man'
That name does not merely signify the presence of God in the midst of a multitude of men; it signifies His entry into humanity
They recognized clearly that He was a man, yet because there was so much about Him that was divine, He was a problem to His contemporaries
The incarnation brought divine content into human life; the resurrection brought human content into divine life
Not till after the resurrection was it possible to say: There is a God in heaven in whom there is a human element
Because, while the living God can perform many acts on man's behalf, the nature of the living God cannot blend with the nature of man
The living God can work on behalf of man, but the nature of the living God cannot unite with the nature of man
On the other hand, when the God of resurrection works, He communicates Himself to man by that which He does for him
When the children of Israel were in a hopeless plight in the wilderness, the living God opened a way for them across the Red Sea
In contrast to this, the apostle Paul testifies to knowing not only the living God, but also the God of resurrection
Paul was so sorely tried that he despaired of life, but it was thus he learned to trust in the God who raises the dead
His case is considered hopeless, but God has mercy on him and works a miracle on his behalf so that he recovers
Even when he is living in the world, he still remembers that God is the living God and that God preserved his life from death
Shortly afterwards he learned that the boat by which he had originally planned to send the goods had been sunk
Some time later this same brother contracted tuberculosis, and to complicate matters, he developed digestive trouble as well
His health steadily deteriorated and his financial resources steadily dwindled, till both he and his wife reached the verge of despair
It began to dawn upon him that while he knew God as the living God, he did not know Him as the God of resurrection
He knew in experience that God had come into his life, but he did not know in experience that he had come into the life of God
He became overwhelmingly aware that what he had regarded as his most spiritual service had been something apart from the divine life
Do remember that God allows us to go through all sorts of distresses for this very reason that we may know Him as the God of resurrection
They are distressed about it and pray and yearn for a restoration of their former harmony; but the more they pray, the more it evades them
Though the old creation has come into being by the mighty hand of the living God, He Himself does not reside within it
Brothers and sisters, everything in your life must pass the supreme test of death to make a way for the God of resurrection
You need to know the God of resurrection; and it is only through death that He can cleave a way for Himself into your life
Through a process of outward decay an inward process is taking place that is adding a new constituent to our lives
It is in the death experiences which come through suffering that the life of the creature is blended with the life of the Creator
The Christian's happiness is not to be found in external things, but in learning to enjoy God Himself in the midst of trial
In Paul's short letter to the Philippians, written during his imprisonment, there are over a score of references to joy
In deep distress he could still be joyful because in his affliction he was learning to know Christ, to appropriate Him and to enjoy Him
His outward circumstances were all conducive to sorrow, but it was in sorrow that Christ was imparted to him as the source of his joy
He invariably chooses the lot of each one with this goal in view an increase of the divine content in our lives
