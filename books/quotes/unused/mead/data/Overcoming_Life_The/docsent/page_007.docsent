   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOD-ORDAINED CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last message, we saw our experience in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today we want to consider the kind of life that God has ordained for Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to God, what kind of life should a Christian live?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are not talking about advanced Christians; we are talking about every saved and regenerated Christian, every Christian who has received the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What kind of life should they live?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only after we know this will we see what our shortages are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What does the Bible say about the Christian life?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us consider a few passages in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A Life That Is Free from All Sins</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Matthew 1:21 says, And she will bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I was in Chefoo and Peking recently, a few brothers remarked that in the past they loved calling the Lord the Christ, but that now they like calling Him Jesus, my Savior!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is called Jesus because He save s His people from their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have received Jesus as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have obtained the grace of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thank and praise the Lord that Jesus is now our Savior and our sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But what has Jesus done for us?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He...will save His people from their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is God s ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is Jesus accomplishment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The question now is whether we are still living in sin or whether we are delivered from it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Does our old temper come back to plague us?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Are we still bound by our sins and entangled by our thoughts?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Are we still as proud as before?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Are we still as selfish as before?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Or have we been delivered from our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have mentioned one illustration many times, and I will mention it again: There is a difference between a life-saving ring and a life raft.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When a man falls into the water and is thrown a life-saving ring, he will not drown if he holds onto the ring, but neither will he be delivered out of the water.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He will not sink, but neither will he be lifted out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is neither dying, nor is he living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is different with a life raft.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the case of a life raft, the drowning person is lifted out of the water into the raft.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our Lord s salvation is not the salvation of a life-saving ring but the salvation of a life raft.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He will not stop halfway between dying and living.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He will save His people from their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He does not leave us in sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, biblical salvation saves us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, even though we have believed, we are not yet saved from sin; we still live in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Is the Bible wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No, there is nothing wrong with the Bible; it is our experience that is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What else did Jesus do when He came to us?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What does the Bible say about His work?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us go on.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A Life That Is in Intimate Fellowship with God</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Luke 1:69 says, And raised a horn of salvation for us in the house of David His servant.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verses 74 and 75 say, We, having been delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have this horn of salvation already.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What has this horn of salvation done for us, and to what degree has it delivered us?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He has delivered us out of the hand of our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What kind of life does He want us to live after we are delivered?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After we are delivered out of the hand of our enemies, is He only interested in our serving Him in holiness and righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Is that all He wants?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If this is true, we will only serve Him in righteousness and holiness sometimes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But thank and praise the Lord, His Word says that we should serve Him in holiness and righteousness all our days.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should serve Him in holiness and righteousness for as long as we live on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the kind of life that God has ordained for us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should serve Him in holiness and righteousness all our days.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Of course, to our shame we must admit that we have not served Him in holiness and righteousness all our days, even though God has delivered us from the hand of our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Either the word of the Bible is wrong or our experience is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The only way our experience can be right is for the Bible to be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the past, I always wondered what kind of life the Bible expects from a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>According to the Bible, everyone who is saved by the Lord should serve Him in holiness and righteousness all his days.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If the Bible is wrong, our experience can be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But if the Bible is not wrong, our experience must be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A Life That Is Fully Satisfied in the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>John 4:14 says, But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How precious is this word!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It does not speak of a special kind of Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It does not say that only those who have received special grace from the Lord can have a spring of water gushing up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord said this to a Samaritan woman whom He previously had never met.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He said that if she believed, she would receive living water.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This living water would be in her a spring that gushes up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brothers and sisters, what is the meaning of being thirsty?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When one is thirsty, it means that he is not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Those who drink of the water that the Lord gives will never thirst again.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thank and praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A Christian is not only a contented person but a person who is forever satisfied!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is not enough for a Christian to merely be contented.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Everything that God gives to us makes us eternally satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But how many times have we crossed the main streets without feeling thirsty?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When we pass by the great department stores, are we thirsty?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we crave for this or that, is this not being thirsty?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Are we thirsty when we consider our classmates or colleagues and envy their possessions?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Yet the Lord said, Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>What He gives to us is one kind of life, yet we experience something else.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Lord says that He is all we need, but we say that He is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We need this and that before we can be satisfied, but He said that He alone is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Is what we received from the Lord wrong or is our experience wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>One of the two must be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Lord cannot possibly write us a bad check.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Whatever He promises, He will surely give.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Our experience in the past was, in the words of one hymn, a half salvation Hymns, #513, stanza 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Why does the Lord say that a believer will not be thirsty again?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is because he has become different inside.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Within him, there are new demands and new satisfactions.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Brothers and sisters, are we living before God and serving Him in holiness and righteousness all our days?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Are we living before God every day in holiness and righteousness, as the priest Zachariah spoke of in Luke 1:75?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Do we have something within that gushes forth all the time to quench others thirst?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The Chinese have an expression, wu-wei, which means to do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Christians have to be those who are asking for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We can say that the Lord is enough for us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Are we satisfied with just the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Are we really satisfied with the Lord Jesus alone?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If we are not satisfied, it means that there is something wrong with our living.</S>
