   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KNIT TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Furthermore, in 4:16 we see that we are knit together.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is closely related to the matter of fitting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, it emphasizes the aspect of attachment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to be attached to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we are fitted and knit together, we are built up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once we have been built up in the church life, it will be very difficult for us to leave the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is altogether different from joining a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not join the church; we are built into it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who have been built into the church can be neither pulled out nor pushed out.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>RENEWED</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ephesians 4:23 speaks of being renewed in the spirit of your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all need to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to have the old element discharged, and a new element wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The old element, the element of Adam, is discharged, and the eternal element, the element of Christ, is added to take its place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>SANCTIFIED</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to 5:26, Christ is sanctifying the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be sanctified is to have the divine nature wrought into our human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once again we may use the illustration of making tea.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When tea is added to water, the water is tea-ified.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same principle, when the divine element is added to us, we are sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ as the heavenly tea is wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be sanctified does not mean that we wear certain kinds of clothes or style our hair in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That is mere outward correction or adjustment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am not for long hair or for short hair, but for sanctified hair.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the element of God is worked into our being, we are truly sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>CLEANSED</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 5:26 we see that Christ is cleansing the church by the washing of the water in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Such a washing cleanses us from wrinkles caused by oldness and from spots caused by wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This cleansing is a metabolic cleansing, a cleansing in which a new element is added to replace the old element that is being discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>NOURISHED AND CHERISHED</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 5:29 Paul points out that Christ is also nourishing and cherishing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To nourish is to feed, and to cherish is to nurture with tender love and foster with tender care.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A mother nourishes her child by feeding the child healthy food.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She also cherishes her child by embracing the little one in love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we are cherished by Christ, we are warmed, softened, and comforted, just as a child is soothed by the loving embrace of the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>ARMORED</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Finally, according to 6:11 and 13, we need to be armored.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that we put on the armor of God in order to stand against the stratagems of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To be armored is to be armed for warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we are armed with the whole armor of God, we become God s army to fight the battle for God s purpose and for His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we would have the proper church life, we need to experience every aspect of God s work covered in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to pray concerning all these items, pray-reading the verses that speak of them, until they become our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May we exercise our spirit to apply all the aspects of God s work concerning the church.</S>
