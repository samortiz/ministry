<p>During the Sino-Japanese War, I was led by the Lord to labor in different places in the northwestern provinces in China. While I was laboring, I had the feeling that there was a veil separating me from God. Nothing I did was able to remove the veil. I also felt that the Holy of Holies was far away from me. I wanted to enter the Holy of Holies, but I always failed. Even when I returned to Chefoo, I continued to have this feeling. I felt that I was outside the Holy of Holies. Later I realized that my understanding of the Holy of Holies was not accurate. It was something of my imagination.</p>
<p>I have not arrived at absolute spiritual maturity, and it seems as if no one can reach such a state. We will never reach a condition of complete sanctification. On the contrary, the more we receive grace, the more we will feel that there is an unholy element within us. We will sense an element of imperfection, a veil that cannot be breached, a weakness that cannot be put away. This sense is not abnormal. Quite to the contrary, it is normal. I am not saying that it is normal for a Christian to be weak. Rather, there is a condition of holiness which we always desire to reach but cannot attain to. We desire to live in the Holy of Holies, but we do not fully succeed. There is a veil we want to remove, but we are unable to remove it. This sense will remain with us until we see the Lord face to face.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning to Be Humble and<br />
Not Being Disturbed by Our Condition</h2>
<p>In His wisdom God created man and allowed man to fall repeatedly. He ordained that man would live on the earth, even though the earth had become dark and corrupt, in order to demonstrate His wisdom. In the midst of such a dark situation, God desires to produce many children to be the glorious counterpart of His Son. When the New Jerusalem is manifested, God will be fully expressed. Today, however, this glorious situation is not manifested. On the contrary, we often feel that we are unclean and impotent and that we have many weaknesses and failures. Although we yearn to shine as the stars in heaven, we need to be balanced. We may not be satisfied with our present condition, but we should not be distracted by it. On the one hand, we should learn to be humble and not think that we have arrived at a certain state of spirituality or have seen something. On the other hand, we should not be distracted by the thought that we have not seen or attained to something.</p>
<p>Some of the serving ones are single and do not have the burden of a family. It is easy for them to enjoy the Lord in the morning, and they can also go to bed at a proper time. Other serving ones have a family and children. When a child is sick, his mother may need to get up at night in order to give him medicine. As a result, the next morning she may not be able to rise up and have morning watch. If she can spend some time to enjoy the Lord during the day, her exercise will be genuine.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Circumstances Cultivating<br />
a Genuine Spiritual Life</h2>
<p>The lessons that we learn in our difficult situations are genuine. Abraham was led by God to pitch his tent between Bethel and Ai (Gen. 12:8). On one side was Bethel, which means &ldquo;house of God,&rdquo; and on the other side was Ai, which means &ldquo;a heap of ruins.&rdquo; This means that Abraham faced the house of God on one side and a heap of ruins, that is, desolation, on the other. In our daily life there are many situations that cause us to feel confused and desolate. A husband or a child often causes a sister to feel confused and desolate. Most parents feel that their children&rsquo;s situation is chaotic and desolate, and the young people may also feel that their parents are in a chaotic and desolate situation. This is especially true when we do not have much spiritual pursuit. We often will feel confused and desolate. A brother may feel that his locality is desolate and that the messages are not satisfying him. Even though he knows that he is in Bethel, the house of God, he also has a sense of being near Ai, a heap of ruins. He senses the presence of God on the one hand and desolation on the other.</p>
<p>We cannot say that desolation is according to God&rsquo;s creation, but in His wisdom He permits us to go through numerous desolate situations. A spiritual brother wants his wife to be spiritual, and a spiritual sister wants her husband to be spiritual. Likewise, parents want their children to be spiritual. However, the result is not always according to our desire. Throughout the two thousand years of church history, it is rare to see a situation where children become spiritual simply in response to their parents&rsquo; expectations.</p>
<p>The Lord puts us in desolate situations because He wants us to recognize our situation. There are many examples of people who did not love the Lord but whose children did. There are also examples of parents who were spiritual but had worldly children. Madame Guyon was very spiritual, and she wanted her husband to love God and take the same way with her in the spirit, but her husband was her cross. God allows such situations for the cultivation of genuine growth in life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
