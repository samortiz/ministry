   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Regenerating the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Peter 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Regeneration, like redemption and justification, is an aspect of God's full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Redemption and justification solve our problem with God and reconcile us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Regeneration enlivens us with God's life and brings us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, regeneration issues and results in a living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such regeneration takes place through the resurrection of Christ from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Christ was resurrected, we, His believers, were all included in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, we were resurrected with Him Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In His resurrection the divine life was imparted to us and made us the same as Christ in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the basic factor of our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To be regenerated is to receive another life, God's divine life, in addition to our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through regeneration God imparts His divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all have been born of His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is to be regenerated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>James 1:18 also speaks of God's work in regenerating the believers: "Having purposed, He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a certain firstfruit of His creatures."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God brought us forth, regenerated us, of His own will, by His intention, to carry out His purpose, so that we might be the firstfruit of His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be the firstfruit of God's creatures is to be the vigorous life that matures first.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is by the divine birth, our regeneration John 3:5-6 , which is carried out according to God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God brought us forth, regenerated us, by the word of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word of truth is the word of the divine reality, the word of what the Triune God is John 1:14, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This word is the seed of life by which we have been regenerated 1 Pet 1:23 . g. Washing the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First John 1:9 speaks of God's cleansing, or washing, the believers: "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whereas to be forgiven is to be released from the offense of our sins, to be cleansed is to be washed from the stain of unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this verse "unrighteousness" and "sins" are synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All unrighteousness is sin 1 John 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both refer to our wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Sins" indicates the offense of our wrongdoings against God and man; "unrighteousness" indicates the stain of our wrongdoings, that we are not right either with God or with men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The offense needs God's forgiveness, and the stain requires His cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Both God's forgiveness and God's cleansing are needed for the restoration of our broken fellowship with Him so that we may enjoy Him in uninterrupted fellowship with a good conscience void of offense 1 Tim 1:5; Acts 24:16 . h.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sanctifying the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In his work in the new dispensation God also sanctifies the believers: "The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The God of peace is the Sanctifier.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His sanctification brings in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we are wholly sanctified by Him from within, we have peace with Him in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Greek word for "sanctified" means set apart, separated unto God, from things common or profane.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, to be sanctified involves more than being separated from a common, worldly position to a position that is for God, as illustrated in Matthew 23:17 and 19, where the gold is sanctified by the temple and the gift by the altar in changing their position, and in 1 Timothy 4:3-5, where food is sanctified by the saints' prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be sanctified is also a matter of disposition, that is, a matter of being transformed from the natural disposition to a spiritual one, as indicated in Romans 12:2 and 2 Corinthians 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This involves a long process, beginning from regeneration, passing the whole Christian life 1 Thes 4:3; Heb 12:14; Eph 5:26 , and being completed at the time of rapture, at the maturity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to 1 Thessalonians 5:23, God is sanctifying the believers wholly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that He is sanctifying us entirely, thoroughly, to the consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God sanctifies us wholly so that no part of our being, either of our spirit or soul or body, will be left common or profane.</S>
