   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Being the Living of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The kingdom of God is the living of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A verse that strongly proves this is Romans 14:17.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.''</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to some Bible teachers, the kingdom has not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They claim that now is the dispensation of the church, and the next dispensation will be that of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But in 14:17 Paul does not say that the kingdom of God shall be; he uses the present tense and says that the kingdom of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the context of Romans 14, which speaks of receiving the believers, the kingdom is today's church life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reality of the church life is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 12 speaks of the Body life and Romans 14, of the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that, in Romans, the kingdom life is the reality of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In a sense, it is correct to say that the present age is the church age and that the coming age will be the kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, in another sense, the kingdom of God is here today, for the kingdom is the reality of the church and the living of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the church is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since the church is the kingdom today, it is not correct to say that the kingdom has been suspended altogether until the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 14:17 proves definitely that the kingdom is the living of the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Romans 14:17 we see that the kingdom of God as the living of the church is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the authority of God's kingdom operates in us, righteousness, peace, and joy will characterize our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Righteousness, peace, and joy are actually the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Christ is expressed, He is our righteousness toward ourselves, our peace toward others, and our joy with God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the believers live the kingdom life in the church, they will live righteously toward themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that we must be strict with ourselves and make no excuses for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To live the kingdom life in the church also means that we live peacefully toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our relationships with others must be characterized by peace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Toward others we must endeavor to pursue peace, continually seeking to be at peace with them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This peace is Christ Himself lived out from our being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Living the kingdom life in the church also requires that we live joyfully to God in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Holy Spirit is a Spirit of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are not joyful, this indicates that we are not in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are truly living the kingdom life, we shall be joyful with God, praising Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever we live righteously toward ourselves and peacefully toward others, we shall live joyfully to God in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a living is the kingdom of God as the living of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>B. The Entrance into the Kingdom of God</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 2 Peter 1:3-11 we see that those believers who develop and grow in the life of God in the church life shall be richly and bountifully supplied with the entrance into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After we have entered into the kingdom of God through regeneration, we need to go on to have a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, we have entered the kingdom; on the other hand, we still need a rich entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The initial entry into the kingdom is regeneration, but the rich entrance is through the full growth and development of the divine life revealed in 2 Peter 1:5-11.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 11 says, "For so shall be richly and bountifully supplied to you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.''</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The bountiful supply we enjoy in the development of the divine life and nature vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>3-7 will bountifully supply us a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord, which will be a reward to His faithful believers, who pursue the growth in His life unto maturity and the development of the virtues of His nature, so that they participate, in the millennium, in His kingship in God's glory 2 Tim 2:12; Rev 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to Peter's word in 1:5-11, to grow to maturity is to develop what we have already received.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have been allotted the like precious faith, which is an all-inclusive seed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the divine riches are in this seed, but we must be diligent to develop them into virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then we need to develop in our virtue, knowledge; in knowledge, self-control; in self-control, endurance; in endurance, godliness; in godliness, brotherly love; and in brotherly love, love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through such a growth and development we eventually shall reach maturity and shall have a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The fact that those who develop and grow in the life of God in the church life will have a rich entrance into the coming kingdom implies that certain believers will not have a share in the coming kingdom, because they have not been living in the proper church life and have not had the adequate growth in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason, at the time of the manifestation of the kingdom, they will have no participation in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But those who grow and develop in the divine life to the full extent will be supplied with a rich and bountiful entry into the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have seen three aspects of the status of the church: first, the church as an assembly separated from the world; second, the church as the house of God composed of those who have been born of God; and third, the church as the kingdom of God, which is the reality and living of the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all need to grow in the divine life in the church life so that in the coming age we may have a rich entrance into the kingdom of God.</S>
