THE DEATH AND SUCCESSOR OF MOSES</H2><P>In this message we will consider the death and successor of Moses.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Death of Moses</H2><P>At the time of Numbers 27:12-23, Moses was one hundred twenty years old. Knowing that Moses was very old and that he could die at any time, thoughtful Israelites must have been concerned about God's people and about God's move with His people. They might have said to themselves: "What will happen when Moses is gone? Who will be his successor?"</P><P>Actually, there was no need for the Israelites to worry about this. They could be at peace and enjoy the Lord's presence, confident that He knows everything and that He would take care of the situation. This should also be our attitude in the church life today. Are you worried about the church? Do you think such worry is justified by God? Our kind of concern for the church and worry about the church may not be justified by God. Instead of justifying our worry, He might say: "Be at peace. Do not worry about the turmoil. I know the situation."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Jehovah Telling Moses to Go Up<br>to the Mountain of Abarim and See the Land</H2><P>Jehovah told Moses to go up to the mountain of Abarim and see the land which He had given to the sons of Israel (v. 12). Moses could only see the land; he was not permitted to enter into it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Moses to Be Gathered to His Forefathers</H2><P>The Lord said to Moses, "When you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was gathered" (v. 13; 20:24-29). This verse says not that Moses would die but that he would be gathered. This gathering was somewhat like a harvesting. Moses was "ripe," and soon he was to be "harvested." This gathering, this harvesting, was to be the end of Moses' life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Moses Having Rebelled against God's Word</H2><P>Moses could not enter into the good land because, in the wilderness of Zin, he had rebelled against God's word to sanctify Him at the waters before the eyes of Israel (v. 14; 20:10-13). Moses had acted contrary to God's nature and God's economy. This serious failure caused him to lose the right to enter into the land of Canaan. However, the fact that Moses could not enter into the good land because of this failure does not mean that he will not be in the millennial kingdom. Matthew 16:28&#151;17:4 indicates that Moses will surely be in the kingdom.</P><P>Did Moses have a glorious end? It seems that, because of his mistake, his ending was not glorious. To be sure, there was not a celebration. Due to his failure, his ending was not glorious, but his ministry certainly was glorious.</P>
