In the meeting of the church, a prophet should exercise discernment while others are prophesying, and all should learn from one another the proper way to prophesy. A prophet should not exercise just his personal ministry, but he should minister by coordinating with many others. A prophet should exercise his spiritual senses to discern whether or not a speaker is speaking God's revelation. This is the way to have our teaching, and this is the way to have the church's teaching.</p>
