In addition to these, we have collected some of Watchman Nee's miscellaneous works during the early stage of his ministry in this present volume. Chapters one, two, three, and four are of a deeper nature and are for Christians. Chapters five, six, seven, and eight are defenses of the Christian faith against modernistic teachings. Chapters nine and ten are Bible study materials for new believers.</P><P>Chapter one, "The Word of the Cross," is actually a series of two articles by Watchman Nee, first published in Spiritual Light Journal in Nanking in 1925. The first article, "Dying with the Lord to Sin," appeared in Issue No. 27 on June 10, 1925. The second article, "Dying with the Lord to Self," appeared in Issue No. 28 on August 10, 1925.</P><P>Chapter two, "The Messenger of the Cross," was a book written in Kulangsu near Amoy in Fukien province on January 15, 1926. The book was announced in Issue No. 9 of The Christian. An excerpt of the book was printed as a separate article in Issue No. 7 of The Christian (pp. 849-857 of Volume Six in the Collected Works) under the same title.</P><P>Chapter three, "Walking in God's Will," is an article that first appeared in Spiritual Light Journal in Nanking on November 4, 1924. It is a record of a message delivered by the author to the Quaker Revival Church in Nanking.</P><P>Chapter four, "How to Know God's Will," is a combination of two articles which first appeared in Spiritual Light Journal in Nanking in February and June of 1925. It was later published as a separate book by the Gospel Book Room. In Issue No. 8 of The Christian (June 1926), the book was announced as a new publication. In Issue No. 10 of The Christian (August 1926), there was the following introduction:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Ten cents per copy. One reader said, "This book has taught me to know that in many ways I have been unwilling to obey the Lord." This book answers many questions concerning knowing God's will. All those seeking after the spiritual way must have a copy on hand.</P><P>Chapter five, "Where Is Heaven?" was written on board the Ho Sun Liner on the way to Hong Kong on December 13, 1924. It was first mentioned in the "Announcement" section at the end of Issue No. 3 of The Christian (January 1926). Chapter six, "Universal Fatherhood: a Fallacy," was first mentioned in the "Announcement" section at the end of Issue No. 20 of The Christian (August 1927). Chapter seven, "A Preface to Modern Science and the Long Day in Joshua," is the preface written by Watchman Nee to the Chinese translation of the book Modern Science and the Long Day in Joshua by Harry Rimmer, president of Research Science Bureau, printed by Glendale Printers and published in 1927 by Research Science Bureau, Inc. The actual book was a scientific explanation of the long day in the book of Joshua. Chapter eight, "Is the Higher Criticism of Modern Theology Believable?", is a refutation of modernism. It was published in The Salvation Magazine in February of 1926.</P><P>"Bible Studies for Beginners" forms chapter nine of this volume. It is a compilation of verses into twenty-six topics for beginners and was completed on January 11, 1927. Brief explanations are given for some verses, but the majority of them are quoted without any explanation.</P><P>Chapter ten, "Once a Year through the Bible," was prepared with the intention of helping new believers read through the Bible in a year. It divides all the verses in the Bible into three hundred sixty-five daily readings. The title appeared among a list of books published by the Gospel Book Room on the back of Issue No. 27 of Notes on Scriptural Messages in 1932.</P><P>A few other books and articles published in the 1920s are unavailable to us. These include the following:</P><p>(1) The Work of the Holy Spirit. In Issue No. 3 of The Christian, the following announcement concerning this book was included:</p><p class="indent1">This book explains in depth the three stages of the work of the Holy Spirit-regeneration, sanctification, and baptism. The important thing about this book is that it affords the saints a clear analysis of the work of the Holy Spirit in their pursuit after the Holy Spirit.</p><p>In Issue No. 10 of The Christian, the following additional reference to this book was included:</p><p class="indent1">The worth of this book can be seen from the fact that a few months after its publication, we sold more than one thousand copies. A principal of a Bible college remarked, "This book is the word of the Holy Spirit." There are only a few copies left from the first edition.</p><p>We also have the following excerpt of the book from the notes of Mrs. K.H. Weigh.</p><p class="indent1">The differences between regeneration and filling: (1) Regeneration has to do with salvation, while filling has to do with victory. (2) Regeneration is a matter of life, while filling is a matter of our living. (3) At regeneration we are justified, while at the time of filling we are sanctified. (4) Regeneration is the addition of a new life to that of the old Adamic one, while filling is the development of the new life through the infilling of the Holy Spirit. (5) Regeneration is the result of the accomplishment of the Holy Spirit through the substitutionary death of the cross, while filling is the consequence of the infilling of the human spirit with the realization of the full meaning of the cross. (6) Regeneration is the beginning of life, while filling is the maturity of life.</p><p>(2) A Diagram of Things to Come. This is a diagram on prophecy. In Issue No. 3 of The Christian, the following announcement concerning the diagram appeared:</p><p class="indent1">The order of events in the diagram is designed by the editor of this magazine. It shows an outline of all the prophecies and sketches of the rapture of the believers, the coming of the tribulation, the establishment of the millenium, etc. At the back are explanations to the diagram. The pictures in the diagram are drawn by an artist and are very attractive.</p><p>(3) Bible Exposition in Three Hours. This was a translated work. In Issue No. 11 of The Christian, the following announcement appeared:</p><p class="indent1">This book was written by the great evangelist to Japan, Mr._______. One third of the Christians in Japan today have been saved through his preaching. Every sermon of his lasts for three hours and contains the same message. He is a preacher "with only one sermon." The book has three chapters: (1) God, (2) sin, and (3) salvation. The book is both inspiring and interesting.</p><p>(4) Gleanings from Matthew. This was a series of studies on Matthew chapters one and two published in The Morning Star magazine, Issue Nos. 220 to 239, between August 1924 and May 1926. We do not have the original manuscripts of these articles.</p><p>May the various articles in this volume shed light and impart life to the readers.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
