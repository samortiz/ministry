   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REMEMBERING THE SLAVE-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Mark 14:22 says, And as they were eating He took bread, and blessed and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, Take; this is My body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This was the eating of the Slave-Savior s supper after He and His followers ate the Passover feast in verses 16 through 18.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He initiated this new practice for His believers remembrance of Him to replace the Passover feast, the old testament practice of the elect s remembrance of Jehovah s salvation Exo 12:14; 13:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This new practice of the new testament is to remember the Slave-Savior by eating the bread, which signifies His body given for His believers 1 Cor 11:24 , and drinking the cup, which signifies His blood shed for their sins Matt 26:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The bread denotes life John 6:35 , the life of God, the eternal life, and the cup denotes blessing 1 Cor 10:16 , which is God Himself as their portion Psa 16:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As sinners, their portion should have been the cup of God s wrath Rev 14:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the Slave-Savior has drunk that cup for them John 18:11 , and His salvation becomes their portion, the cup of salvation Psa 116:13 that runs over Psa 23:5 , the content of which is God as their all-inclusive blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such bread and such a cup are the constituents of the Slave-Savior s supper, which is a table 1 Cor 10:21 , a feast, set up by Him that His believers may remember Him by enjoying Him as such a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus they testify of His rich and marvelous salvation to the entire universe, displaying His redeeming and life-imparting death 1 Cor 11:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His blood separated from His body declares His death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verses 23 and 24 say, And having taken a cup, He gave thanks and gave it to them; and they all drank from it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And He said to them, This is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God made a covenant with redeemed Israel in Exodus 24:3-8 Heb 9:18-21 , which became the old testament as a base for Him to deal with His redeemed people in the dispensation of law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Slave-Savior came to accomplish God s eternal redemption for God s chosen people by His death, according to God s will Heb 10:7, 9-10 , and with His blood instituted a new covenant, a better covenant Heb 8:6-13 , which became the new testament after His resurrection Heb 9:16-17 , as a base for God to be one with His redeemed and regenerated people in the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This new covenant replaced the old covenant and simultaneously changed God s old dispensation to His new dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Slave-Savior wanted His followers to know this and to live a life based upon this and according to it after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 14:25 the Lord went on to say, Truly, I tell you, I will by no means drink anymore of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here the Lord is speaking of the manifestation of the kingdom, in which He will drink with us after His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 26 is the conclusion of the section on the Slave-Savior s instituting His supper: And having sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This hymn was a praise to the Father by the Lord with the disciples after the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BECOMING CHRIST S MYSTICAL BODY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have seen that as the Lord and His disciples were eating, He took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them, and said, Take; this is My body v. 22 . First the Lord and His disciples ate the Passover; then the Lord established His table with the bread and the cup to replace the feast of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He did this because He would very soon fulfill the type and become the real Passover to us 1 Cor 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we are keeping the real feast of Unleavened Bread 1 Cor 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The bread of the Lord s table is a symbol signifying the Lord s body broken for us on the cross to release His life that we may participate in it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By participating in this life, we become the mystical Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:27 , which is also signified by the bread of the table 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, by partaking of this bread, we have the fellowship of the Body of Christ 1 Cor 10:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord was broken on the cross in order to release His life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The release of the Lord s life is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, breaking is a matter of death, and releasing is a matter of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through being broken on the cross, the Lord was able to release the divine life from within Him so that we might participate in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By participating in the Lord s divine life, we become the mystical Body of Christ, His enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that by enjoying the bread we become Christ s mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As His enlargement, Christ s mystical Body is also signified by the bread on the table, as indicated in 1 Corinthians 10:17.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, by partaking of this bread we have the fellowship of the Body of Christ.</S>
