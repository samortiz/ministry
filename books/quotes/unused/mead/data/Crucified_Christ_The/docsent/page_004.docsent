   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST NEEDING BROKEN VESSELS TO BE CHANNELS OF LIVING WATER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ does not need whole vessels; instead, He needs broken vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is because only broken vessels can be channels of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whole vessels can only be cisterns of dead water.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The biggest problem today is that it is hard to find any wounds or scars in most Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most of us do not have any wounds, scars, marks of death, or experiences of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even though we have been saved and truly have Christ's life in us, this life has no way to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The reason is not that our behavior is too poor or too good but that we are too whole and too impregnable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because we have no wounds, Christ has no way to be released from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suppose a person is quick-tempered and appears arrogant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It would be relatively easy for such a one to become humble because he may often examine himself and condemn his irritability.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suppose another person is meek by nature and apparently humble.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It would be harder for such a one to know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, it would be easy for him to become proud before God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He may think that the other person is irritable and arrogant while he is meek and humble.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is real pride.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes when we go to visit people, the wife says, "My husband is too quick."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What she means is that her husband is quick but she is not and that she is meek but her husband is troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, she is actually more troublesome before God than her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is hard for many of the saints who have a number of good points to make any spiritual progress.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is due to the fact that they have listened to many messages not for themselves but for others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some of the saints do not seem to have a bad temper; they are as gentle as sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, they always listen to messages not for themselves but for others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When they hear a word concerning breaking, they think, "Brother Chang is quick-tempered, so he surely needs to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sister Wang is not good either, so she also needs to be broken."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It never occurs to them that those who are meek need to be broken even more than those who are quick-tempered.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is often easier for God to deal with a stubborn person than with a pliable person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Someone may seem to be so pliable, like a rubber ball, that God has no way to break him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When a certain situation arises, he does not care.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When he is dealt with by his supervisor, he does not care.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When he is dealt with by some of his family members, he cares even less.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Like a rubber ball, he bounces back whenever he is hit, and he bounces up whenever he is thrown down.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kind of person is indifferent toward everything; he is unbreakable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He cannot be broken by one person, nor by two, three, or even five persons.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, if he were a glass, he could be broken with a single stroke.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a sister cannot be broken by her husband, her son, or her daughter-in-law, people will praise her, saying that she is really spiritual because she cannot be broken by anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, we must realize that because she is not broken and cannot be broken, Christ has no way to live out from her.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What she lives out is her whole self, her smooth and refined self, but not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ has no way to live out of her.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Neither our kindness, our good deeds, nor our morality can represent Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only Christ Himself can represent Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nothing that we have, even if it is good, can represent Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The progress of a Christian's spiritual life does not depend on how much he has changed; rather, it depends on how much he has been broken and to what stature Christ has grown in him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, the growth of a Christian hinges on his being broken and Christ's increasing in him.</S>
