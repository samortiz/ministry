	 <h2 class="head1">ERRORS IN TRUTH CONCERNING<br />
BAPTISM AND SALVATION</h2>
<p>In the second century some people erroneously asserted that a person can be saved through baptism. While baptism is related to salvation, a person cannot be saved through baptism without receiving the Lord. It is wrong to teach that this is possible. However, at the end of the second century some believed that regardless of whether a person believed in the Lord, if he was baptized, he was saved. From that time on, many unsaved ones were added to the church. This went further than causing a transmutation in administration and organization; it resulted in a transmutation of the basic constituents of the church. In the beginning the constituents of the church were the Lord and those who had His life; it consisted only of those who were saved, not unsaved ones. The transmutation of the constituents of the church is significant because it resulted in confusion.</p>
<p>In Taiwan we have baptized many newly saved ones. In principle, we have not done anything wrong, but in the details we have neglected something. I believe that some have been baptized without being saved, because the pre-baptism interviews were not conducted carefully enough. We did not determine whether the candidates for baptism had really contacted Christ. Baptizing unsaved people into the church causes mixture in the constituents of the church.</p>
<p>We should not baptize unsaved ones into the church; therefore, although the pre-baptism interviews are not that demanding, we must use them to touch the spirit of the candidates. The social class of those whom we baptize does not matter, but whether they have been regenerated is a real concern. Those who have not been regenerated should not be baptized into the church, or the church will suffer loss. Before the end of the second century the heresy of salvation through baptism was already prevailing in the church. Because of this erroneous practice, many unsaved ones came into the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRODUCING OF A MEDIATORIAL CLASS</h2>
<p>In the second and third centuries some people thought that not everyone was qualified to break the bread and distribute the cup during the Lord&rsquo;s table&mdash;only a special group of people could do this. Therefore a distinction developed between those who were regarded as the clergy and the laity. During the time of Cyprian, this distinction became the standard rule of the catholic church. Only a special group of people who attended to matters of service to God could distribute the bread and the cup. Thus, Christian priests were produced. The priestly system of Judaism was formally transferred into the church.</p>
<p>Therefore, the organization, administration, and constituents of the church were transmuted before the end of the third century. This transmutation continues in Christianity today&mdash;the constituents of the church are mixed, its administration is hierarchical, and its organization is unified. It is entirely different from the church on the day of Pentecost and from what was practiced in the early church. The constituents of the church on the day of Pentecost included only saved ones, its administration was local and without hierarchy, and its organization was not unified, federated, or catholic. On the day of Pentecost the constituents of the church were regenerated people, the administration of the church was local, and the church was not unified organizationally.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONSTANTINE MIXING POLITICS WITH THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>By the time of Cyprian the administration and organization of the church had been completely transmuted, but the church had not yet been mixed with human government. Although there had been a transmutation, the church was still separate from human government. At Cyprian&rsquo;s time human government still persecuted the church. Several of those who were responsible for the transmutation of the organization of the church were even persecuted and martyred for the Lord. The Roman Empire persecuted the church through the end of the third century, that is, for at least two hundred and fifty years.</p>
<p>In A.D. 312 Constantine began his reign over the Roman Empire. Not long after he ascended to the throne, he accepted Christianity. Originally the Roman Empire persecuted Christianity, but after Constantine accepted Christianity, the Roman Empire changed its tactics. It not only ceased its persecution of the church but also began to welcome and exalt Christianity. Constantine accommodated Christianity and encouraged Roman citizens to participate in it. He introduced elements of Christianity into his government and also extended his political power into Christianity. Constantine even took advantage of the archbishops in order to increase his power, which resulted in a further mixture of the church and the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Constantine interfered a great deal in the matters of the church, even appointing some bishops. He presided over the Council of Nicea that is so famous in church history. There were approximately three hundred bishops present at the council. Constantine sat on a throne of pure gold and observed the debate among the bishops. He favored the orthodox group, that is, Athanasius and his followers, by constantly siding with them. Thus, the Council of Nicea ordained a creed that supported the pure faith. Nevertheless, Constantine meddled in church affairs. After his reign, emperors had the power to send bishops away or recall them; the bishops were under the power of the emperor. Therefore, politics entered the church, and the church entered politics.</p>
<p>Constantine&rsquo;s influence on the church resulted in an alliance between the church and politics. Prior to Constantine, the church had not been involved in politics, although it had been transmuted. After Constantine, the church was united with a government&mdash;the Roman Empire. Constantine&rsquo;s reign marked the beginning of Pergamos. The word <em>pergamos</em> has two meanings: &ldquo;high tower&rdquo; and &ldquo;marriage union.&rdquo; Because Constantine accepted Christianity into the Roman Empire, the church became a high tower; in the same way, the church was also married to the world. After its marriage to the world, the transmutation of the church was complete.</p>
<p>Constantine&rsquo;s acceptance of Christianity strengthened and increased the transmutation. Since then, the transmutation has continually gained strength and spread. By the fifth century, when the Roman Catholic Church became quite prevailing, the transmutation of the organization and administration of the church reached its peak and could not get any worse.</p>
