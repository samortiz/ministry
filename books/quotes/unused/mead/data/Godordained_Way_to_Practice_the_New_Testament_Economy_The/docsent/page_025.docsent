   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN GOD S ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO SPREAD THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Gen 3:8-9, 15, 21; Exo 3:8; 1 Tim 1:15; Luke 19:1-10; John 4:3-15; Matt 10:5-8, 11-13; Luke 10:1-6; Mark 16:15; Matt 28:19 GOD S PATTERN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Bible there is a way ordained by God to spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s pattern of spreading the gospel is seen in Genesis and Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis records the first time in the entire universe that God Himself directly visited fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First God came to find fallen man, then God preached the gospel to fallen man, and finally God ministered salvation to the condemned man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Genesis at Adam s fall, God came to find him 3:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God was the first door-knocker.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He came to knock on Adam s door immediately after Adam sinned by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although Adam hid himself from the presence of God, God came to find him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He came to visit Adam, to knock on the door of Adam s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He called unto Adam and said to him, Where are you? v. 9 . After God found fallen man, He preached the gospel to him Gen 3:15 . God told fallen man that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the damaging serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The seed of the woman was Jesus Christ who was born of a virgin, and He bruised the head of the old serpent, the devil, on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, God ministered salvation to the condemned man Gen 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God made coats of skins to cover fallen man, and those skins came from a slain sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The coats of skins signify Christ as the very righteousness from God to cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before being covered by these coats of skins, Adam and Eve were afraid to be seen by God so they clothed themselves with fig leaves sown together 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But God came in to clothe them in a proper way, signifying that God s salvation clothes fallen man with Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God s clothing of fallen man was a type of God s covering salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s pattern of visiting man can also be seen at the time of Israel s fall.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Israel had fallen deeply into Egyptian bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then God came down to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Exodus 3:8 the Lord said, I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God came down to visit Israel in order to deliver them out of the usurping hand and the tyranny of Pharaoh in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE LORD S EXAMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The New Testament reveals the example of the Lord Jesus Christ in visiting man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He came down from heaven to save sinners 1 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For Him to come down means that He went out to visit the sinful race.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all have to follow the Lord Jesus as our pattern to go out to visit fallen human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, the Lord went to visit Zaccheus with His dynamic salvation Luke 19:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord told Zaccheus, Today I must stay in your house v. 5 , and Today salvation has come to this house v. 9 . The Lord s word shows us that the unit of God s salvation is not an individual person, but the whole family, the whole house.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord also set an example in going to visit the Samaritan woman to bring her the living water John 4:3-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>John 4:4 tells us that the Lord Jesus had to pass through Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord had left Judea and was on His way to Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord had to pass through Samaria because He had to go to Jacob s well to wait for that sinful, Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He went to the well to bring her the real living water of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This story of salvation took place not in a chapel or a cathedral but in the open air near Jacob s well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should follow this pattern of the Lord Jesus in going to visit sinners for their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE LORD S SENDING THE DISCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Also in the Gospels, we can see the Lord sending the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He sent the twelve to go to the cities and villages to visit the lost sheep of the house of Israel and bring them peace Matt 10:5-8, 11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>While the Lord Jesus was physically on this earth, He did not practice calling meetings, but He always went to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He visited Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He visited Martha and Mary s home Luke 10:38-39 and the house of Simon the leper Matt 26:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord carried out His ministry all the time by visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The practice of visiting people to bring them the salvation and riches of the Triune God is absolutely in contrast with the practice of today s deformed and degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must be rescued from that kind of degraded situation back to the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Lord sent the twelve, He charged them to go to cities and villages to visit the lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should follow the Lord to do the same thing by going to new cities and small towns.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The number twelve bears a particular significance in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Twelve is composed of four times three, the Triune God three multiplied by man four .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Twelve refers to the mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we have gospel groups composed of twelve saints, there can be four teams with three saints on each team.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are linked up with the Triune God going out to knock on people s doors.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We go out as people who are mingled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord also sent the seventy to go to every city and place to seek the sons of peace Luke 10:1-6 , and we have to do likewise.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to Luke 10 these sons of peace are in the midst of wolves v. 3 . A person may be a son of rebellion one evening and a son of peace the next.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A husband may have had an argument with his wife, and when you go to visit him, he may be a son of rebellion that evening.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But the next day something might happen to make him happy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When you go to him that evening, he may be a son of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>That may be the right time for you to sow the seed of the divine life into his being.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not be disappointed with being rejected when we go out to visit people by knocking on their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Before we were saved, we also were sons of rebellion, but one day we became sons of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God prepared all of us to receive the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At one time we were rebellious toward God, but one day we changed our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At the right time the gospel came to us, and we repented, believed in the Lord Jesus, and were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we have the patience and endurance to knock on the same door again and again, the ones who live there may eventually become sons of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need to follow the Lord Jesus example to go visit every city and every place to seek the sons of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord Jesus sent all His disciples to go into all the world and preach the gospel to all the creation Mark 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They were charged to disciple all the nations by baptizing them into the Triune God Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All the creation needs to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we do not have men to preach to, we can preach to the flowers and to the animals.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This will increase our faith and cultivate our utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Some people have told me that they do not know what to say when they speak to others.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>My advice to them is to speak to the creation, which includes all the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we do this, we will learn how to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The gospel should be preached to all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we are crazy with the enjoyment of Christ, we will talk to everything we see about the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we are speaking the gospel all the time, we will eventually be prevailing, and our preaching will be full of power.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Soon after I received the Lord, I practiced speaking by the seashore to the ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I did not learn how to preach in a seminary but at the seashore by talking to the sea.</S>
