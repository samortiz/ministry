Standing before the Throne<br />and before the Lamb</h2><p>&ldquo;Standing before the throne&rdquo; indicates that the great multitude of the redeemed ones must have been raptured to the presence of God. &ldquo;Standing before the Lamb&rdquo; corresponds to &ldquo;stand before the Son of Man&rdquo; (Luke 21:36), which clearly indicates the rapture. Since this is mentioned immediately after the opening of the sixth seal, it also implies that the rapture of the believers should begin to transpire before the sixth seal. The record in verses 9 through 17 composes in a general way a scene from the rapture of the believers to their enjoyment in eternity.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Clothed in Blood-washed White Robes</h2><p>In verse 9 we see that this great multitude is &ldquo;clothed in white robes,&rdquo; for they &ldquo;have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb&rdquo; (v. 14). <i>Robes,</i> being plural, signify the righteousness of their conduct. <i>White</i> indicates that their conduct is pure and approved by God through the washing in the blood of the Lamb.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Praising God and the Lamb</h2><p>Verse 10 says, &ldquo;And they cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb.&rdquo; The loud praise mentioning only salvation indicates that the praisers are the saved ones. The great multitude, those who are saved, are grateful for God&rsquo;s salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">H. Serving God Day and Night in His Temple</h2><p>Verse 15 says, &ldquo;Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple.&rdquo; This great multitude has come out of the great tribulation into a heavenly state, into the temple of God where they serve Him day and night.</p><h2 class="head2">I. God Spreading His Tabernacle over Them</h2><p>Verse 15 also says that &ldquo;He who sits upon the throne shall spread His tabernacle over them.&rdquo; The great multitude will enjoy God and His care. He will spread His tabernacle over them, meaning that He will make His dwelling place their dwelling place. God will cause all His redeemed ones to dwell together with Him. In a very positive sense, God will even be our dwelling place, our tabernacle. As He spreads Himself over us as a tabernacle, we shall enjoy Him to the uttermost. Christ is the tabernacle of God (John 1:14), and the New Jerusalem as the ultimate enlargement of Christ will be God&rsquo;s eternal tabernacle (21:2-3) where all God&rsquo;s redeemed ones will dwell with Him forever. God will overshadow them with Himself as embodied in Christ. Christ, as the embodiment of God, will be their tabernacle. The portrait in verses 15 through 17, similar to what is portrayed in 21:3-4 and 22:3-5, is of eternity.</p><h2 class="head2">J. The Lamb Shepherding Them<br />and Guiding Them to Springs of Waters of Life</h2><p>Verses 16 and 17 say, &ldquo;They shall not hunger any more, neither shall they thirst any more, neither shall the sun beat upon them, nor any heat; for the Lamb in the midst of the throne shall shepherd them and shall guide them to springs of waters of life.&rdquo; Here we see that the Lamb will shepherd them and guide them to springs of waters of life. Shepherding includes feeding. Under the shepherding of Christ, &ldquo;I shall not want&rdquo; (Psa. 23:1). The Lamb will also lead us to springs of waters of life. In eternity, we shall drink of many springs and enjoy many different waters. How good this is!</p><h2 class="head2">K. God Wiping away Every Tear from Their Eyes</h2><p>Verse 17 also says that &ldquo;God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.&rdquo; Tears are a sign of dissatisfaction. Waters of life are for satisfaction. Because the Lamb will supply them with waters of life for their satisfaction, they will have no tears of dissatisfaction. The waters of life shall be supplied, and the water of tears shall be wiped away. There will be no tears, hunger, or thirst&mdash;just enjoyment.</p><h2 class="head2">L. The Angels, the Elders, and<br />the Four Living Creatures Worshipping God</h2><p>Verses 11 and 12 say, &ldquo;And all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and fell on their faces before the throne and worshipped God, saying, Amen, blessing and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God forever and ever. Amen.&rdquo; This is similar to the word in Luke 15:7, where there is joy in heaven over one sinner who repents. Here the angels say, &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to the redeemed ones&rsquo; praise of salvation.</p><p>In this chapter we see how God takes care of His people. When He is about to judge the earth, He will seal His earthly people and rapture His heavenly people. While the chosen remnant of Israel is sealed, the believers are regenerated, for God has put Himself into us as life. He does not simply put a mark on our forehead; He puts Himself into us as life. Thus, we are not His earthly people but His heavenly people. Would you rather be a regenerated Christian or a sealed Israelite? We Christians do not have this seal&mdash;we have God in us, which is much better. Unlike the chosen remnant of Israel, we shall not remain on earth. Rather, we shall be preserved by being taken away to the presence of God. We shall be in that eternal state enjoying God&rsquo;s divine and eternal care and also enjoying the Lamb&rsquo;s eternal shepherding. How pleasant that will be! The sealed remnant of Israel will be the better people, but we shall be the best people.</p><p>However, if we would be taken away to God&rsquo;s presence, we must be mature. If we are still tender and unripe, God will not take us away. Instead, He will leave us in the field to suffer until we have ripened. While all the church people will be taken away, there is nonetheless a condition, the condition of maturity and of ripeness. We all must ripen and mature. This is the condition of our being taken away from this earth by God. This is fully and adequately revealed in the book of Revelation. In chapter fourteen, for example, we clearly see the firstfruits and the harvest. In that portion of the Word, we are told definitely that after the field has ripened, the harvest comes. Thus, we all need to grow. It is impossible for people to grow in religion because there is no food or nourishment there. In a sense, there is not even a field there. The only place where Christians can grow today is the church, for in the church is the pasture&mdash;Christ&mdash;for the flock to feed on and receive nourishment for growth. By the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign grace, we are enjoying this pasture. We all can testify that since coming into the church life, we have been in the green pasture with the tender grass. Day by day we are feeding on the tender grass which is Christ Himself. Here in the church life we feed on Christ and grow. Here we take all the tender nourishment into our being. Thank the Lord that we are growing day by day. Praise the Lord that we are growing and that He is preparing us for our rapture. We do not expect to face the tribulation. We are growing into maturity, growing into rapture, growing into His presence. One day, we shall be there.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_091.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_093.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Revelation &nbsp; pg 92</div><br></body></html>
