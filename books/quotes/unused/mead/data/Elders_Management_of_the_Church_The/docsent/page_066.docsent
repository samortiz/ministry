   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>With some, you have to admit that as soon as the Bible is put in their hand, it becomes transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>No matter which book, chapter, or paragraph they expound, it is always clear and enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You may study the same passage a thousand times, but the more you study it, the more your head spins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But when they stand up to say a few words, everything becomes clear.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reason is simple: they have the gift of being a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is useless to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a question of gift.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who are overseeing the house of God should realize that God's house needs all kinds of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I always rejoice in my heart and am thankful to the Lord because there are many members in His house and they have many gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I cannot do many things the brothers are able to do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I cannot help in many things the brothers are able to help in. I am not able to render supply in many things the brothers are able to render supply in. This is coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Dear brothers, the more we understand this matter clearly, the safer our coordination is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should feel it to be a very sweet thing that when our brother preaches the gospel, many are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should feel it to be a very sweet thing that when our brother stands up to say a few words, everyone is enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With all the problems, we should feel it to be a sweet thing that when a few brothers go out to visit and to fellowship, all the problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I cannot say that it is sweet because I did it, and that it is not sweet when others do it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not a question of me doing it or others doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The question is whether or not there is such a thing in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If there is such a thing, whether it is done by me or by others, it is equally sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I should be faithful to contribute my portion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As for others' portions, I should not only honor them, but consider them to be sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I can praise the others' portions and will not despise even the smallest portion among them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the Lord's Day morning, I often see some brothers and sisters cleaning the windows and mopping the floors in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They come all the time from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I feel that this is very sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I feel that their service may be sweeter in the eyes of God than what we do as ministers of the Word on the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have seen some older sisters who come to clean almost every week from the beginning of the year to the end. The Lord can testify for me that I have the utmost respect for these sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the church there is the need for manifold gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since elders are the miniature of the church, the elders must also have manifold gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Under normal conditions, the gifts you can find in the brothers and sisters should also be found among the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The elders are their representatives.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some represent service, some, administration, some, the ministry of the Word, some, the leading in life, and some, teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The elders should have the manifold gifts to represent the others and to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way the blessings will be full in the church, and many spiritual riches will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way, the building of the church will be solid, and the coordination, fitting.</S>
