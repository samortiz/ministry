   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>of the Three and a Half Years,</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These thirteen months plus the five months of the fifth trumpet will be one and a half years of the three and a half years of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The locusts of the fifth trumpet only torment men for five months, whereas the two hundred million horsemen kill the third part of men.</S>
