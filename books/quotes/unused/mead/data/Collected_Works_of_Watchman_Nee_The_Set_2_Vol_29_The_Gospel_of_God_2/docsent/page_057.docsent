   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OLD TESTAMENT TYPE OF THE RED HEIFER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is a kind of cleansing in the Old Testament which is a type of the forgiveness of believers in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The words in 1 John 1 and 2 are typified in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us read what can be considered as the only portion in the Old Testament dealing with the forgiveness of the Christians' sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Numbers 19:1-13 says, "And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah has commanded, saying, Tell the sons of Israel to bring you a red heifer without blemish, in which there is no defect, and upon which a yoke has never come.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And you shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and she shall be taken outside the camp and slaughtered before him; and Eleazar the priest shall take some of her blood with his finger, and shall sprinkle some of her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And the heifer shall be burned in his sight; her skin, her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall be burned; and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet, and cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then the priest shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and afterwards he shall come into the camp; and the priest shall be unclean until evening.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And he who burns it shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until evening.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and place them outside the camp in a clean place; and they shall be kept for the assembly of the sons of Israel for the water for impurity; it is a purification of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And he who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until evening.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And this shall be to the sons of Israel, and to the stranger who sojourns among them, for a perpetual statute.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days; he shall purify himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day, and so be clean; but if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not be clean.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whoever touches a dead person, the body of any man who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of Jehovah, and that person shall be cut off from Israel; because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is still on him."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Numbers 19 a sacrifice is described.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This sacrifice is the most unique sacrifice in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The book of Numbers is not a book on offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The book on offerings is Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But this sacrifice is not mentioned in Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, it is mentioned in Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We know that the Passover lamb was slain in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This typifies the Lord Jesus' death for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At Mount Sinai God showed us again what the Passover lamb is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The five offerings in Leviticus are the Passover lamb analyzed and broken down.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They show us the different aspects of the Lord Jesus and how He satisfies God's requirements in redeeming man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All of these are for the sinners and were spoken of at Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The book of Numbers, however, is a book on the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a history of the children of Israel's wandering in the wilderness of Paran.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There the children of Israel lived as sojourners in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were a nation sojourning in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There God gave them another sacrifice, which is the sacrifice of the red heifer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All offerings are for God, and thus their blood is to be poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the only sacrifice whose blood is first sprinkled directly before the tabernacle and then burnt up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Most offerings are of male bulls and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But this sacrifice alone is a heifer, a female cow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Most sacrifices have no color specification.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But this sacrifice has to be of a specific color; it must be a red heifer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Most sacrifices are offered on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only this sacrifice is burned outside the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Other sacrifices are for the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the second half of this sacrifice is for cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The five offerings of Leviticus describe the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They are prepared for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why they are recorded in Exodus and Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This sacrifice, however, is prepared for the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why it is recorded in Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is a sacrifice for the experience of God's people in the way of the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The other sacrifices are for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only this sacrifice is for the filth in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Other sacrifices are male animals.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This sacrifice is female.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everything that is related to sinners is male, and everything that is related to God's people is female Deut 21:3-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Leviticus 5:6 says that a female goat can be offered up as a trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The trespass offering is not just for sinners, but is frequently for believers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not like the sin offering, which is strictly for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The trespass offering is for both sinners and believers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When something is offered up for God's people, it can be female.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the regulation in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This sacrifice, though dealing with man's offenses toward God, is actually offered up for believers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The color red signifies redemption before God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This sacrifice is not offered on the altar, because it is not for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A sinner has to pass through the altar before he can come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This sacrifice is burned outside the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The camp is the place where the people of God are.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, the camp is a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To be outside the camp is to be cut off from the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But if you are cut off from the fellowship, a sacrifice is waiting for you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is a sacrifice to deal with the believers' sins.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is for the restoration of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Let us now consider the sacrifice itself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This sacrifice is of two parts.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the first part, the blood of the sacrifice is offered.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the second part, the sacrifice is burned.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The first part begins from the second half of Numbers 19:2.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>"Tell the sons of Israel to bring you a red heifer without blemish, in which there is no defect, and upon which a yoke has never come."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All those who understand the Bible know that this refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hebrews 10 indicates that this red heifer refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What are the Lord Jesus' qualifications to become this sacrifice?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Numbers 19:2 says that this sacrifice was to be without spot and without blemish and was never to have come under a yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Being without spot and blemish refers to His life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Never having come under a yoke refers to His work.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In life He is without blemishes.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In work He has never been under a yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In His life and person, the Lord Jesus is without spot and blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Not only is He without blemish, but also in His experience He is clean, that is, He has never been under a yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He is a clean man, and He has a clean experience.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Many people are without blemish, but they have been yoked.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But in His experience, the Lord Jesus was never yoked.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He never touched the things of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He was never oppressed by sin or dominated by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He was never provoked to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He is completely free.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Tonight we cannot say this for ourselves, for we are not free people.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We have been oppressed by sin and have been dominated by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We have been provoked by sin and are not our own masters.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Lord Jesus has no spots.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Only the Lord Jesus has never been put under the yoke of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is a heifer, a female cow, signifying that this sacrifice was offered up for believers.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It is red.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>That means it is offered up for the redemption of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In the Bible, red signifies the redemption of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Every time the Bible mentions scarlet or red, it implies sin.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The woman in Revelation 18 rides on a scarlet beast and wears a scarlet robe.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>These refer to her sins.</S>
