   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To my dear brother in the Lord, Mr. Nee:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I was able to attend only one meeting of the Third Overcomer Conference.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I received the important message on "God's Center" which gave me a deeper knowledge of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I really thank the Lord deeply for His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message, you spoke one word which touched me: "Some people listen to the word of truth secretly, read the books which testify to the word of the truth, and receive some light and then follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But they do not give others the impression that they are following those who preach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord allows this to happen because He wants the preacher to take Him as the Head and so that the preacher himself would not gain anything."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time, I considered myself as one who secretly watched and listened to a preacher of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I began reading The Christian in 1928 and received the light and saw the error of denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, I was still hard-hearted and my faith was weak; I dared not leave the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is more, I was good friends with the leaders of the denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If I left, they would have criticized me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I also saw that the brothers who were already going this way were usually standing alone, oppressed, opposed, and misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For these reasons, I did not come forward.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But God would not let me go.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He led me step by step until I saw the sin of the denominations more clearly and their opposition to the truth more vehemently.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At first I thought I could stand in the middle and be a mediator so that both sides would have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I was hoping that the denominations could change for the better, while the brothers seeking the truth could give in a little, and the two could be one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way they both could work to testify to the truth, and the Body of Christ would not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Much unnecessary criticism would also be avoided and outsiders would not be frustrated in the hearing of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Who would have known that these were my own personal, ignorant thoughts?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were not according to the principles of the Bible and were completely impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The denominations can never be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fleshly have always persecuted the spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The son of the maidservant could not live with the son of the promise in the end. So in the end, the only thing to do was leave the denominations and resign from my post as preacher in a certain church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I relied on the Lord's own leading to do His work and began to learn something of obeying the Lord and walking in His way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The experience described above lasted for about four or five years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I think I am one of the slowest to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have not communicated with you until now.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, I say I am one who secretly gains the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I hope you will pray for me when you receive my letter that I may keep the will of God and walk in His way because I feel that I am an extremely weak person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thank God, I still have some good news to tell you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the place where I used to work, Luan Shan of Nan Kang an Independent Church is there , some brothers received the light of the truth a few years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They have been meeting separately for four or five years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The locality is Chung Tai of Luan Shan; in Collection of Newsletters it was written as the meeting in Luan Shan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the last two years, God has also led brothers in the Independent Church to understand the truth and realize that they must leave the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They have stopped attending the general conventions and the spring and winter conferences and have begun meeting in the Lord's name to break bread for about the last two years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the brothers in the meeting in Chung Tai still do not dare to acknowledge them for fear that they left the denominations for human reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After I left the denomination, the brothers there began to pursue the Lord more ardently and gave the manifestation of leaving the denominations and expressed more and more the reality of leaving the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this reason, the brothers in the meeting in Chung Tai moved to that place Ta Pu Tou, Luan Shan, in the old meeting place two months ago to meet together with them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now there are more than forty brothers and sisters meeting together in the morning to break bread.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There are about two hundred attending the message meeting in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every Wednesday night we have a Bible study.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Friday afternoon is the sisters' meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the evening the brothers meet to pray and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The brother responsible for preaching is Brother Chen Shu Yao.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The brothers responsible for practical affairs are Liu Chien Chung, Tseng P'ing K'ang, and Hsieh Ch'ing Sheng.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May the Lord bless the meeting there.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have described the matters there to you briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May the Lord bless you and your work and bless all the brothers and sisters in Shanghai who are walking in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The smallest in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Lin Cheng Wu</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>July 13</S>
