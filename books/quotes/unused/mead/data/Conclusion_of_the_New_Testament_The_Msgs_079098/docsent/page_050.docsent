   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>23.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Comforting Them</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Another aspect of the Spirit's work in the believers is His comforting them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Acts 9:31 says, "The church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it was multiplied."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the church was suffering affliction through the persecutions, in which she feared the Lord and enjoyed the comfort of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit's work in comforting us is a matter of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are comforted by the Spirit, and encouraged by Him, through His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Triune God is dispensing Himself into us, and this dispensing is the Spirit's comforting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Genuine comfort, therefore, involves the divine dispensing, the dispensing of the riches of the Triune God into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>24.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Giving Them Joy</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The indwelling Spirit gives joy to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans 14:17 says, "The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First Thessalonians 1:6 tells us that the believers "accepted the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because the Holy Spirit is a Spirit of joy, daily we should be joyful in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>25.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Empowering Them to Abound in Hope in God</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 15:13 says, "Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here we see that the Spirit empowers the believers to abound in hope in God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>26.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Giving Them Love</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit also gives love to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Romans 15:30 speaks of the love of the Spirit, and Colossians 1:8 refers to the believers' love in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In these verses the Spirit is revealed as the source, the element, and the sphere of the believers' love toward all the saints in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to our natural understanding, the matter of love is common.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But according to the divine fact it is not common.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Colossians 1:4 refers to the love which the saints in Colosse had unto all the saints; verse 8 reveals that their love to all the saints was the love in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In ourselves we cannot have this kind of love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This love is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit is the source, the element, the very essence and sphere of such a love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our natural, human love is not universal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the Spirit works in us to give us a love for all the different members of the Lord's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We love the brothers in the Lord from all cultures, races, and countries.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not possible by our natural love, but there is this kind of love in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is the source, the element, and the sphere of this love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we live in Him, He will give us the universal love that causes us to love all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>27.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Pouring Out God's Love in Their Hearts</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Romans 5:5 says, "The love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This verse reveals the work of the Spirit in pouring out God's love in the hearts of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Often in our Christian life we need encouragement and confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we pass through periods of suffering, we may have questions and doubts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although doubts arise, we cannot deny that the love of God is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From the day we first called on the Lord Jesus, the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that the Spirit confirms and assures us with the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The indwelling Spirit assures us that God loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, although we may be afflicted, we cannot deny the presence of God's love within us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ died for ungodly sinners such as we.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once we were enemies, but Christ shed His blood on the cross to reconcile us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What love is this!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through the work of the indwelling Spirit we realize afresh that God loves us and that His love has been poured out into our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The best way to be filled with the Holy Spirit is first to make a thorough confession of our sins, failures, and weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then we should ponder God's love, considering how much He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we do this, the Holy Spirit will pour out God's love into our hearts, and we shall be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>28.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Mingling with Their Spirit in Their Faith</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Second Corinthians 4:13 indicates that the indwelling Spirit mingles with the believers in their faith: "Having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke; we also believe, therefore also we speak."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The "same spirit" refers to the same spirit as set forth in the quotation from Psalm 116:10.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Concerning the spirit in 2 Corinthians 4:13, Alford says, "Not distinctly the Holy Spirit, but still not merely a human disposition: the indwelling Holy Spirit penetrates and characterizes the whole renewed man."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Vincent says, "Spirit of faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human faculty or disposition, but blending both."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means it is a mingling of the Holy Spirit with our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must exercise such a spirit to believe and to speak, as the psalmist did, the things we have experienced of the Lord, especially His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Faith is in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit, not in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Doubts are in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The "spirit" here indicates that it is by the mingled spirit that the apostles lived a crucified life in resurrection for carrying out their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we would have the boldness to speak concerning Christ and of our experience of Christ in His death and resurrection, we need the spirit of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This means that in order to testify of what we have experienced of Christ, we need such a mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As long as we have this mingled spirit, we shall have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then we shall have the boldness to speak to others about our experience of Christ in His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As those who love the Lord Jesus, we need to practice being one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we do this, we shall have the spirit of faith, for the indwelling Spirit will be mingled with our spirit in our faith.</S>
