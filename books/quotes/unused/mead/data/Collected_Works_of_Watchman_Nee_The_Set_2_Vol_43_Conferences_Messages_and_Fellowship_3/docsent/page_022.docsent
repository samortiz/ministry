   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S FORGIVENESS BEING BASED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ON RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is God's way of removing man's sins before Him?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His way is through the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He sent the Lord to the earth, who put on the human body, died on the cross, and shed His blood for the redemption of our sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through the blood our sins before God are taken away, and our conscience is at peace Heb 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once I went with a friend to Kiukiang for some business.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We met a Moslem missionary on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>My friend asked him what hope his faith afforded him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He said, "If a person is sorry for his sins, Allah in heaven i.e., God will forgive him, and he will go to heaven one day."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>My friend asked, "What will happen if a person sins again after repenting?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After he repents, what happens to his sins?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The man could only respond, "God is not that strict.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once He sees that I have truly repented, He will consider the matter closed."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>My friend said to him, "Is your God so loose?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My God is not that loose."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Repentance is one thing, and sin is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose I beat up Mr. Tang and suppose he has bruises all over his body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I may regret it later and feel guilty about beating him up, but his body will still be swollen from my beating.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The fact will remain; it will not have gone away.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Suppose you borrow a thousand dollars from someone and afterward regret it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Does this mean that the matter is over?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No. Having regret is one thing, but your debt will still exist no matter how much regret you have.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, God cannot forgive us by brushing aside our sins casually.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God must punish the sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the sins have been punished, then they can be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let me give you another illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose someone was arrested by the governor, and suppose the governor sympathized with the person because that person had an eighty-year-old mother and a three-year-old child at home, and therefore decided to let him go.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the governor sympathizes with others in this way, he eventually will not be the governor, because the whole city will be full of robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a person has violated the law, he should come under the verdict of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even the governor has to submit to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although he has the power to release you, it would make him unlawful to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God wants to forgive our sins, but He has to maintain His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have a friend whose father was the magistrate of a county for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In that county there were many bandits, and he used some of the public funds from the county to clean up the bandits.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He spent three hundred thousand dollars of public funds.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He did not take this money home.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He only redirected the money from one place to another.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Soon after, the government issued a warrant to arrest him, and he was going to be executed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Any civil servant who commits a fraud involving ten thousand dollars or more will be executed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since my friend's father had taken so much more, he surely would be executed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was actually the father of one of my co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The co-worker was very anxious because her father was about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since I knew several officials in the government, I felt that I needed to help.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I wrote several letters to his superior and followed up personally with eight or nine visits to the government office.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I gave the officials the guarantee that the co-worker's father did not take any money home and that he had not spent it for his own personal use.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But they said to me, "Mr. Nee, we know the situation very well.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We also want to help, but we cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We could let him go; we have the authority to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But it would not be proper procedure if we released him like that.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to think of a way which is procedurally proper before we can let him go.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only in this way will we not violate the law ourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God wants to forgive our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, He cannot get Himself into trouble for forgiving us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God charges us to observe the law, so He should also observe the law.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He said to Adam, "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" Gen 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After Adam and Eve ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, God would have become a liar if He had told them that they did not need to die.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are sinners, and we may care very little about which method God uses to save us as long as we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We think that He can forgive our sins or He can just let us go; we think that any method is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are not concerned with righteousness or with the law, but God cannot be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In order for God to forgive our sins and save us, He must find a way that does not come into conflict with His nature, His righteousness, or His law.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God cannot just let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This would make Him unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God cannot create a problem for Himself in the process of saving us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A year ago there was a sister in Shanghai who was a head nurse at a hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>She controlled all the drugs and medicine in the hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One day another sister came and talked to me about this sister.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When I commented on how good she was, the other sister replied, "I do not think so.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>She is only an ordinary sister."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I said, "But she loves the Lord, and she also bears a very good testimony in the hospital."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>She said, "Yes, but she does not know anything about righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Two days ago my child was sick, and I did not have enough money to take him to the doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I brought the child to see this sister.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>She was very eager to give us all the help she could.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>She applied medicine on my child's wound and bandaged the wound carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I asked her how much I had to pay for the medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>She would not take my money.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Instead, she told me that the hospital had a great deal of drugs.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>She insisted on not taking my money.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Eventually, I gave up and went home.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Although she helped me, I still feel uneasy because the bandages and supplies belonged to the hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>She cannot steal things from the hospital just because she wants to help me."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Likewise, if God were loose in the way He saved us, we would say to ourselves, "Even though You have saved man, You have violated the law."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If a policeman catches someone who has violated the law, he cannot let him go on the way to the police station.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Once we sin, we need to be punished and judged.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If God does not punish us, He will become unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>What then should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Suppose Mr. Tang is a rich man, and I borrow ten thousand dollars from him, agreeing to repay him in twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>After twenty years suppose I go to Mr. Tang, saying, "I am now very poor; I cannot repay the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Please have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Please forgive my debt and return the contract to me."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He will say, "Twenty years ago we made an agreement that you would repay the loan.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is our contract, and it was signed by both of us.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Twenty years have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If you do not repay the loan, I can only resolve the matter legally."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I may say, "Please be merciful to me because I cannot afford to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Please give me back the contract!"</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Brothers and sisters, would this be right?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Please remember that my failure to repay the loan has breached the agreement.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It would also be a breach of the agreement if he did not ask for the money.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If the debt is not resolved according to the proper procedure, both the debtor and the loaner have violated the law.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The only difference is that one has violated the law in a bad way, while the other has violated the law in a more noble way.</S>
