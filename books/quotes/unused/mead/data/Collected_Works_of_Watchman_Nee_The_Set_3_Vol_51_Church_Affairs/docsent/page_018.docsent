   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Number of Priests Determining</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Number of God's People</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let me repeat something that I have said for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have a particularly deep feeling about this today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The number of people serving determines the number of people in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a locality the number in the church is the number of people serving.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The number of priests determines the number of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You should not turn it around and say that the number of God's people determines the number of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The number of priests determines the number of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The number of serving ones determines the number of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No Useless Members</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I was in England, I met a brother who was very knowledgeable.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He said that there were many members with a function and there were also many members without a function.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But I said that in the Bible all the members have a function and that there are no members without a function.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there is a member without a function, it is probably the appendix.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When he heard that, he laughed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many people think that some members have a function and that other members do not.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Can you tell me which member does not have a function?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Where is the member that does not have a function?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the whole body the only member without a function is the appendix, and you should not consider that it refers to you by coincidence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The appendix is the member of the body which is most frequently removed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Please remember that all the members have a function.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May we see today that the number of members with a function is the number of members in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A Body of Priests</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to change our way of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today we must see that serving means that the whole church serves and preaching the gospel means that the whole church preaches the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To serve as priests involves everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The number of brothers and sisters serving determines the number of members in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The number of people serving determines the number of brothers and sisters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should always determine the number of brothers and sisters in the church based upon the number of serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, there should not be one thousand or five thousand brothers in a locality and only a few serving.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Among us we cannot tolerate any members being functionless.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot have even one member without a function.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Please remember that as a member of the Body of Christ, you have a function.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is impossible for you not to have a function.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you do not see this basic principle, you will not do the work well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brothers and sisters, frankly speaking, you cannot do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That is not the New Testament; that is deformed Catholicism with the system of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We do not have a system of priests; rather, we are a body of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everyone is a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Caring for New Believers The Meeting for Edifying New Believers</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After a person has believed, is baptized, and becomes a new believer, we should bring him to our prearranged meeting for edifying new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this meeting we will have a special topic for them to get into every week.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Making Up Lessons and Rendering the Care</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once a person has started coming to the meeting for edifying new believers, he should be placed under the care of those believers in the church who are more mature than he.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How should this care be rendered?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who take care of the new believers must make sure that the new believers are practicing the lessons presented every week.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If they do not come to a meeting, you must immediately visit them and give them a make-up lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Of those who come to the meetings, during the week you must seek out the five or ten under your care and see whether they understand the lesson that was shared that week.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At this point I want to have a little fellowship with you brothers, especially with those who are ministers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I think that we all have had many experiences which may have been heartbreaking, shameful, and embarrassing, and even some experiences which made us angry.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today you may have shared a message that was quite high, but if you check with the brothers, the message was like a wind passing over the rooftop.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There was not even a breeze next to their ears or even above their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you do not believe it, just ask them to raise questions after your speaking and see what kind of questions they have.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have always said that the questions asked reveal how the listeners are doing; the preaching reveals how the preacher is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After a most spiritual message is presented and the listeners are given opportunity to ask questions, you often see that they have veered off considerably, even to the extent that it is beyond what you could imagine.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, we should not think that the new believers will understand simply because the message was spoken from the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You need to go and visit these new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the visitation of the new believers or the care for the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You have to make the message up for anyone who has not heard it, and you have to see how it was received by anyone who did hear it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They do not have it simply by hearing the sound or by counting the number of times per second my voice vibrates in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We want them to hear clearly the words of the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, concerning this matter, the brothers responsible for the care of the new believers need to labor in a careful way.</S>
