   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Salvation Being a Matter of Position</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because Adam sinned and became a sinner, all men became sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man need not sin to be qualified as a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All have become sinners through one man's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today God has saved you from among many men.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you are on the world's side, no matter what kind of person you are, you are opposed to God, and you are God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Your position is wrong; it is a perishing position, one that leads to perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you are a person in the world, you are perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word salvation has been used freely among us and with much confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is a distinction between salvation and obtaining eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Obtaining eternal life is a personal matter, but salvation is a matter not only of receiving the eternal life personally but also of coming out from a wrong corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brothers and sisters, are you clear about this distinction?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Receiving eternal life is a personal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Salvation, however, is not just a personal matter; it has to do with the corporate body to which you formerly belonged.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Salvation means coming out of one corporate body into another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The receiving of eternal life speaks of what one has entered into; it does not speak of what one has come out of.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Salvation includes both a coming out of and an entering in. Therefore, the scope of salvation is wider than that of receiving eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It includes being delivered from the world, that is, coming out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Four Major Facts Concerning</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>the World before God</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are four major facts concerning the world as shown in the Bible: 1 The world is condemned in the eyes of God, 2 the world lies in the evil one, 3 the world has crucified the Lord Jesus, and 4 the world is at enmity with God; it is God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These are the four major facts concerning the world before God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As long as a person is in the world, he is already condemned and will perish regardless of his conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Please remember that the salvation of men is not a matter of personal conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are wrong because their position is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We know that it is not easy to be delivered from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How can I forsake the world if it is still attractive to me?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, when I realize that the world is in a wrong position with respect to God, I will have to forsake it no matter how lovely it may be to me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, salvation is not just a matter of our personal conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The corporate body to which we belong is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to be saved from our relationship with and our position in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Jews tried to do away with the Lord Jesus, they cried, "His blood be upon us and upon our children!"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Matt 27:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although we are not the ones who killed the Lord Jesus, our forefathers did.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even though we did not commit the act, the corporate body to which we belong did.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The corporate body to which we belong is an enemy of God and is condemned to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whether we are right or wrong individually is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I hope you can see not only that we are sinners individually and need to be saved individually, but that we also belong to a corporate body which is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The world to which we belong is God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The world we are in is condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to be delivered from that relationship and that position.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Salvation Being to Come Out of the World</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Salvation is a deliverance from a certain corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is a deliverance from a certain position and certain relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In other words, it means to come out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Most people pay much attention to their personal salvation, but the question before us is what are they saved from.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The salvation highlighted in the Bible involves being saved from the world, not from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The world as a whole is condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is no doubt that he who believes has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have been preaching this for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once a person believes in the Lord Jesus, he has eternal life and is saved forever.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But please remember that if a person believes but is not baptized, he is still not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Indeed, you may have believed and you may have eternal life, but are you saved in the eyes of the world?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you are not baptized, you are not saved, because no one knows that you are different.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You must rise up and be baptized, declaring that you have terminated your relationship with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only then will you be saved.</S>
