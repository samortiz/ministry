On that day, we had our storm disaster. A few days before that, Mr. Chi and I had the intention to visit the brothers and sisters in Shanghai. The reason for our visit was that we were co-workers in the Lord and we felt this was something we should do. On the afternoon of March 22nd, Mr. Chi's eldest son came to Yi-lin from Su Chia-chui and told me that Mr. Chi would come that day, or at the latest by the next day, to join me to travel to Shanghai. But the same afternoon at 6 p.m., the temperature suddenly rose and a great storm with rain came. Thunder, lightning, and hail appeared. It was like a great earthquake. I wondered if the Lord was coming and began to pray with my family, saying, "Lord, are You coming? If You are coming, will we be raptured?" Later, when I realized that it was not the Lord's coming, I began to be concerned if the brothers and sisters would suffer from the storm.</P><P>Within a short time, men from my shop came and told me that four of the houses on my street had blown down. My shop was outside the city, while my house was on a street inside the city. I could not take care of much. I knew that the storm would go away the next day. But the next morning, some people came again from my shop and said that many more houses had collapsed and insisted that I should go and take a look. I had to go. At the same time, I was afraid that the houses of Brother Chi and Brother Chiu had suffered from the same disaster. Soon, some came with the report that the houses of these two brothers had completely collapsed, and that the three-year-old son of Brother Chi had been killed in the collapse. I wanted to visit them and take a look at the area after the disaster, but the wind was still strong. I still could not travel there with my bicycle, so I waited until the next day. On the morning of the 24th, I arrived in Su Chia-chui and saw the terrible condition, and I comforted them a little.</P><P>Had we left for Shanghai during this storm, it would have been more unbearable for the others. Fortunately we remained at home. At that time we prayed together to seek God's will and consider what to do concerning the damaged houses. Those who prayed with me were Brother Ding Yi-yuen and Brother Hsu Shou-yue. At the end of our prayer, we became clear that these houses could be repaired and did not need to be torn down. I moved the wives and children of Brother Chi and Brother Chiu to my home, for they all had some minor injuries. Brother Chi can give you details of the storm disaster because he went through it himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. MR. CHI YUNG-TUNG'S TESTIMONY</H2><P>Why do I have to mention the condition in our area today? There are three reasons: (1) we are brothers and sisters in the Lord together, (2) we have the same faith, and (3) we want to express our gratitude for the help of love you have rendered to us. Hence, we would like to give you a report.</P><P>The storm has passed. Why then do we have to mention it again? It is to thank the Lord and consider the lessons He has taught us in the past. Although what we experienced was the attack of the devil, it also was something that God permitted. The story of Job is our example.</P><P>Personally, I felt two things concerning this episode. First, I inquired before God as to what mistakes I have made and what sins I have committed. If I had some mistakes or sins, it was God's chastisement of me. It is better to suffer God's chastisement now than to be judged by Him later. Second, this episode relates to the message we preach. We have to preach the coming of the Lord more. In the future we should preach this message even more.</P><P>Our experience at that time was similar to that of the coming of the Lord. According to our study of the coming of the Lord, there will be a great tribulation on earth, and some believers will be raptured before the tribulation comes. During the tribulation, some believers will have to go through calamities and some will die in them. When I consider my family and the suffering they suffered in this disaster, the picture was similar to the Lord's coming. Our teaching of the Bible and our last experience has all the more confirmed the condition of the Lord's coming.</P><P>On that evening, our whole family was eating together happily. After dinner I felt to go and visit someone. Two minutes after I left home, I saw a black cloud in the west. Following this, a black wind mixed with straw and hay blew this way. I knew that a storm disaster was coming, but I went ahead, thinking of my family all the time. When I looked back, the black wind had reached us, and the whole sky was darkened. It was like the picture described in the exodus from Egypt. My ears could only hear the sound of the wind and the rumbling of houses blown under the sand and the hay. I could not touch the ground with my hands. At that time I could only pray, "Lord, save me!" Not only was I praying, even those who usually did not pray began to pray. This is the normal reaction of men in peril. I knew the streets in that area very well, and so I fumbled in darkness on my way home. The houses around where we lived were very shaken.</P><P>Later I tried to return home. But just then, the wind blew off the roof of my home and the house where we were meeting. Both my house as well as Mr. Chiu's house collapsed. When I arrived at the front door, I saw that the roof was gone. Upon entering the house, I heard crying everywhere. The house had fallen and was in shambles, and my wife and the children were huddled together. Mrs. Chiu was trapped under the debris. The roof of the meeting hall was gone. At that time, my wife told me that our youngest one was still trapped under the debris in the house. I tried to look for him under the pile with a lamp, and eventually, I found my child dead.</P><P>At that time there were over ten people in the house. One was killed. I believe that God's will was in the matter; otherwise, my son would not have died. I asked my wife and children how they had escaped. They said that they did not know. By the time they heard the sound of the wind, the house had already collapsed, and they were all trapped. My youngest son was killed by a beam that fell on him. I consider that two sparrows are worth more than an assarion and not one of them falls to the earth apart from the Father. My son's death was surely of the Father's will. At that time Mr. Chiu was standing by his door. When the wind came, the house fell back and did not crush him; he was only slightly injured. Mrs. Chiu was afraid that the house would be torn down and was jumping out of the bed with the baby in her arms when the house collapsed. She was trapped inside. But the amazing thing was that they were not hurt because there was a pole next to her bed, and the falling beam fell right on the pole. They were trapped under the two poles and were unharmed. Brothers and sisters, this is the real story. The Lord has blessed us. Indeed, He has blessed us. The God whom we serve is a living God. He is with us in everything.</P><P>After this incident, we had strong winds coming our way many times. Every night, everyone was afraid of the wind, but Mrs. Chiu had much faith. She said that had she not trusted in God, she would not have been able to sleep for fear of the collapse of the house. Mr. Chiu has a daughter who became very fearful of the wind after this incident. As soon as she hears the wind, she says, "The storm is here, the storm is here." Even now she is still not mentally sound. I was different because I did not experience the damage. Mr. Chiu was also slightly injured. Personally, I was taught and comforted at the thought of the possibility of being raptured before the tribulation! Before I left my house, my whole family was happily together. A few minutes later, I returned home and saw the wreckage. The house was originally quite well built, but after the wind came, it was totally damaged. This was similar to the verses in the Bible that say when men say peace and security, sudden destruction comes upon them. At a time when we are not prepared, the Lord will come. If we are not prepared, we will not be raptured. What good are the things which we love and crave in this world? Others were afraid of the wind, but I was not afraid of it. The reason is that they passed through the damage, but I did not pass through any damage. They did not die in the disaster, but they came through the disaster. I consider the fact that some believers will be saved, though as through the fire. During the tribulation the world will suffer calamities and dangers. When the Lord comes back, there will be believers who will be raptured. Some will go through the tribulation, and some will die in the tribulation. This is a picture of the church of God.</P><P>After that incident, I said to my family and children, not in the way of teaching, that the Lord has kept them on earth because they have grown up and have a will to choose to believe in the Lord Jesus and receive life. If they would not accept the Lord and receive life, they might not have another chance for salvation. The Lord allowed them to pass through the disaster in order that they would become fearful and consider what they would do during the few years of the great tribulation which is coming. This is why they have to hurry and receive the Lord. As for my dead child, he was only three years old and was not able to make his own choice. As such, even though he is dead, he is saved. Was it not God's grace that the children who have the ability to make a choice are not dead?</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 17: Notes on Scriptural Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 48</div><br></body></html>
