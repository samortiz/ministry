[2]  The first two volumes cover different matters between a believer and God which he should know, understand, and practice immediately after his salvation.
[3]  Then the last two volumes cover the full salvation which God has prepared in Christ for us who have believed into Him, the riches which we have obtained in Christ, the experience which we should have in Christ, the things which we should accomplish in Christ, and the goal which we should attain in Christ.
[4]  The five great items mentioned in the previous six lessons are positive items which we should know; they are the most fundamental truths realities revealed by the Bible.
[5]  Since the church is the assembly called out by God from the world, it should meet continually.
[6]  THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEETINGS FOR BELIEVERS A. Bread Breaking Meeting
[7]  1 "And having gathered the multitude together, they handed them the letter written by the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem .
[8]  1 "We gathered together to break bread " Acts 20:7 .
[9]  Whenever we see or receive this cup which we drink, we should consider how the Lord partook of flesh and blood for us Heb 2:14 , how He not only gave His body for us that we may have His life, but how He also shed His blood for us that we may have the topmost blessing, that is, to be delivered from sin and obtain God and all that is of Him.
[10]  1 "Jesus took the bread broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat" Matt 26:26 ; "This is My body which is given for you; do this unto the remembrance of Me" Luke 22:19 ; "And taking the cup He gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you; for this is My blood of the covenant" Matt 26:27-28 ; " which is being poured out for you" Luke 22:20 ; "This do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me" 1 Cor 11:24-25 .
[11]  LESSON SEVENTEEN THE BREAD BREAKING MEETING 2 B. Attending the Lord's Table
[12]  1 "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a fellowship of the blood of Christ?
[13]  When the Lord established the breaking of bread, He gave the bread and the cup to His disciples, that is, to those who have believed into Him, have His life, and belong to Him.
[14]  Of course, only those who have such a relationship with the Lord and who know the Lord as their personal Savior can remember the Lord by eating His bread and drinking His cup and can display the Lord's death by His bread and His cup.
[15]  1 "Breaking bread from house to house" Acts 2:46 .
[16]  For us, the saved persons, to consecrate ourselves is a positive reaction to the Lord's salvation.
[17]  When we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, we allow the Lord to gain us as our repayment to Him.
[18]  LESSON NINETEEN BEING FILLED INWARDLY AND OUTWARDLY WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT 1
[19]  We have already seen in lesson ten that the Holy Spirit is the ultimate expression of the Triune God and that He is the Triune God reaching and entering into the believers.
[20]  1 "When therefore it was evening on that day, the first day of the week Jesus came and stood in the midst He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:19 22 .
[21]  This is the Lord, on the evening of the day of His resurrection, coming among the disciples and breathing into them for them to receive the Holy Spirit.
[22]  But this He said concerning the Spirit the inward Holy Spirit of life , whom those who believed in Him were about to receive" John 7:38-39 .
[23]  Speaking of the inward filling of the Holy Spirit, it uses the word pleroo, and speaking of the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, it uses the word pletho.
[24]  D. The Manifestation of the Believers Being Filled Inwardly with the Holy Spirit 1.
[25]  2 The Holy Spirit has filled us since the Holy Spirit lives in us and longs and waits to fill us, once we empty ourselves and offer ourselves to Him, not only will He fill us, but He has already filled us.
[26]  The Holy Spirit of God in His two aspects meets this twofold need of the believers.
[27]  1 Being baptized in the Holy Spirit upon believing "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks" 1 Cor 12:13 .
[28]  Since Christ baptized all the believers throughout the ages in the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius, He has already accomplished the baptism of the church in the Spirit through these two instances.
[29]  We who have believed into the Lord and belong to the church are not baptized one by one and time after time in the Holy Spirit; rather, we have received the entire baptism in the Spirit, which includes all the believers and is once for all.
[30]  1 To be filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit is to experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit "But you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now" Acts 1:5 ; "And when the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled they were all filled with the Holy Spirit" Acts 2:1-4 ; "The Holy Spirit fell on them And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit" Acts 11:15-16 .
[31]  C. The Manifestation of the Outward Filling of the Holy Spirit
[32]  1 Speaking in tongues Acts 2:4; 10:44-46; 19:6 .
[33]  Three groups of people the disciples at Pentecost, the people in the house of Cornelius, and the disciples in Ephesus spoke in tongues when they were filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly.
[34]  After we have fully dealt with our sins, we have to believe that since the baptism in the Spirit is a fact accomplished by the Lord on the church and that since we are a part of the church, the outward filling with the Holy Spirit from the baptism in the Spirit is now our portion.
[35]  Every saved person, having believed into the Lord, must preach the gospel and delights to preach the gospel.
[36]  The life of God in us, which we have received, is such a life.
[37]  V. THE SPIRIT OF GOSPEL PREACHING REVEALING THE ATTITUDE IN PREACHING THE GOSPEL
[38]  1 Burning in spirit "Being fervent in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus" Acts 18:25 .
[39]  From the time that man developed a problem with God because of the fall and left the position where he took God as everything, material riches have become a critical matter in the life of fallen man.
[40]  In his fallen condition, man fell into the darkness of acknowledging only material riches and not God, of trusting only in material riches and not in God, and even of serving material riches, taking material riches as God, and allowing material riches to replace God.
[41]  1 For the need of the church In the Old Testament, God wanted each of His people, the Israelites, to offer to Him a ransom for his soul.
[42]  1 "With much entreaty beseeching of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints; and they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us through the will of God" 2 Cor 8:4-5 .
[43]  This shows us that the offering of material riches which is most acceptable to the Lord is the offering of ourselves first to the Lord and then to the apostles, who are concerned for us, eventually asking them for a share in such grace and fellowship.
