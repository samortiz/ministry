   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAW BEING A TYPE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Based upon the fact that the law is the testimony of God, a picture of God, we may say that the law is also a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can the law be a type of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The law is a type of Christ because Christ is God s portrait, God s picture, God s image Col 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE LAW BEING LINKED TO GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we need to see how the law is linked to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In studying the books of history in the Old Testament, we need to learn how to link these books to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In His economy God chose Israel, established them as a people, formed them as a nation, and gave them the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How can we link this with God s economy?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s economy is God becoming a man that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead to produce the organic Body of Christ, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is the center, the reality, and the goal of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The law seems to have nothing to do with such an economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How, then, can the law be linked to God s economy?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The law is linked to God s economy because the law was given as God s portrait, God s picture, God s image, and God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As God s testimony the law is a type of Christ, who, being the image of God, is God s portrait, God s picture, God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>TO KEEP THE LAW BEING TO EXPRESS GOD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God charged Israel to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In typology, to keep the law means to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Keeping the law by not killing, not committing adultery, not stealing, not lying, and not coveting is the living of a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who have the living of a God-man bear the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are a portrait of God and even a duplication of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The situation of today s world is utterly different from this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the world we see not the life of a God-man but murder, adultery, fornication, stealing, lying, and coveting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who tells the truth today?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is common for people to lie in a court of law in order to get money and then to boast about their lying.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many compete with others in business or at school because of their coveting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the competitive ones are covetous.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some will even kill to get what they covet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, instead of being full of God-men, the earth is full of scorpions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>LIVING THE LIFE OF A GOD-MAN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>IN OUR MARRIED LIFE AND IN THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us now consider the situation in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all are believers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have repented and come back to the Lord, and we have been saved, even dynamically saved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet in our daily life we may not have the living of a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have pointed out that for the children of Israel to keep the law was to live God and express God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, they did not keep the law, and therefore they did not live God and express God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The situation is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For the most part, we do not express God in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to have a God-man living in our married life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a married brother would live the life of a God-man in his married life, he would surely be a good husband, for he would be a real God-man in loving his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Likewise, if a married sister would live the life of a God-man in her married life, she would be a good wife, submitting herself to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We also need to have a God-man living in the church life, especially in relation to what we call the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How can we have a vital group if we ourselves are not vital?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Suppose at dinner a brother and his wife are not happy with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They even exchange words and argue for quite a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Suddenly they remember that later that evening they must attend a meeting of their vital group.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But how could this couple be vital in the meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because they are not vital at home in their married life, they have no way to be vital in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>OUR NEED FOR A REAL REVIVAL</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because we are short of the God-man living, we need a real revival.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The children of Israel had only an outward law, but today we have something much stronger and much higher than the law.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have the all-inclusive, life-giving, compounded, consummated Spirit in us, who is the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to live Christ by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>20-21a .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have such a Spirit within us, but what do we live and how do we live?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do we live Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the church meetings we may live Christ, but do we live Christ at home with our husband or wife and with our children?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need a real revival to be God-men who live a life of always denying ourselves and being crucified to live Christ for the expression of God.</S>
