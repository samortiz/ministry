<li>There is only one God

<li>There is only one mediator

	<li>In human history there have been many wise and famous men, yet not one has claimed to be, nor has been recognized as, a mediator between God and man.</li>
	<li>Only Jesus Christ said that He is the mediator between God and man. The Bible says that He is the one, the only mediator.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How Jesus became the mediator
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>He was God coming as man. He had both divinity and humanity, so He was qualified to be the mediator between God and man.</li>
	<li>He was crucified and His blood was shed for our sins to remove the hindrance between God and man. So He became the mediator between God and man.</li>
	<li>He resurrected and imparted His life to man so that man could have God&rsquo;s life and be one with God. Through this process He became the mediator between God and man.</li>
