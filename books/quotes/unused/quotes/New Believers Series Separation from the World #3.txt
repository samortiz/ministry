The Bible uses four different places to represent the world and shows how God's people come out from these different aspects of the world
Whether or not you will perish does not depend on your family's status or your behavior; it depends on whether you have the blood
They ate their meal quickly, with their loins girded and their staff in their hands, because they had to leave immediately
Once the angel of destruction has done his work of separating the saved from the perishing, the saved ones must leave
When they need salvation, they trust in the blood of the Lamb; but after they are saved by the blood, they settle down firmly in Egypt
The separation of the blood separates the living from the dead; it also separates the children of God from the people of the world
When the Israelites first wanted to leave Egypt, Pharaoh only allowed the strong men to go; the young and the old had to stay back
He knew that if a person served God in Egypt, he would not have a testimony and he would have to serve Pharaoh in the end
Satan is quite familiar with the words in Matthew 6:21: 'For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also'
Just to confess the Lord with our mouth and say, 'I have believed in the Lord today,' is not enough for a testimony
While a believer is living on this earth, the world is a journey to him; when he dies, the world is only a tomb in which he is buried
The world wants to be closer to us, but if we allow it to come too close to us, it will be impossible for us to serve God
The world wants to keep our people and our treasure, but if these things are kept in the world, we will not be able to serve our God
Before we touch any specific item, we should realize that our heart and spirit are the first things that need separation from the world
We must stay away from things that the worldly people, the Egyptians, consider inappropriate for Christians to do
If we are not treated the same as our Master something is wrong with us and something is definitely wrong in our relationship with the Lord
Our relationship with the world must be compatible with our Lord's relationship with the world; we cannot take a different way
We only need to ask What is my relationship with this matter and what was the Lord Jesus relationship with it while He was on the earth
Anything that is not on the same ground as the Lord or that stands against the Lord is the world, and we must depart from it
Many things appear to be very good to our eyes, but they quench the fire within us after we touch them once or twice
Any kind of social function, communication, or activity that causes us to hide our lamp under the bushel is the world
Many of God's children are gradually sucked into the world through indiscriminate social activities and contacts
It is not the words of the strong Christian but the words of the weak Christian that should determine what we should or should not do
He might have been clear about what he was doing, but others who followed him may not have known what he was doing
The words Almighty God in the Old Testament are also Elshadai, which should be translated as 'the All-sufficient God'
Many people do not feel the excellency of the Lord when they come to Him because they have not counted all things as refuse
