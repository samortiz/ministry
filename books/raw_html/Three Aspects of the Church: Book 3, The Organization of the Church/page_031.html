	 <h2 class="head1">THE PROPER ATTITUDE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being Individualistic or Loose</h2>
<p>Strictly speaking, the church should not have a unification of administration and practice; however, it is dangerous to overemphasize this to the point that there is no oneness. Doing so gives people the opportunity to become proud and unruly and causes them to act recklessly. In order to maintain a universal unification, the Roman Catholic Church uses human hands to restrain man&rsquo;s unruliness. However, we do not desire to stretch out our hand. On our part, we would rather let unruliness run rampant than restrain it by human hands. Thus, there is a need that each of us would be on the alert to guard against and be watchful of the danger of unruliness. In other words, we need to be dealt with and to live in resurrection. We should not take the matter of not having an organizational unification as an excuse to say that we can act independently and recklessly. We should never be unruly and loose. Rather, we must turn to the Holy Spirit and learn to live in the Holy Spirit. In this way, each one of us will be led by the Holy Spirit. The result of being led by the Spirit is that we will have fellowship and will not act independently. In this way, our oneness will be the oneness of the Spirit, not the oneness of unification.</p>
<p>The way for the church to be built up is to be in resurrection. On the one hand, there should not be an outward unification among the churches; on the other hand, there is a danger of losing the oneness among the churches. This situation requires us to be delivered from the self and to live in the Holy Spirit and in resurrection. Some people may complain, saying, &ldquo;This is so difficult. You say that we should not be unified and that we also should not act independently. Why do you make things difficult for us?&rdquo; Awhile ago some young brothers came to me, asking, &ldquo;Brother Lee, is it all right if we do something a certain way?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then they asked, &ldquo;What if we do it another way?&rdquo; I still said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then they asked, &ldquo;How shall we do it?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I will not tell you.&rdquo; Two days later they came and asked me again, &ldquo;What do you think if we do it this way?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;It is not good.&rdquo; Then they asked, &ldquo;What if we do it another way?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;It still is not good.&rdquo; Finally they asked, &ldquo;Then what shall we do?&rdquo; I told them, &ldquo;I will not tell you.&rdquo; As a result, some were angry and said, &ldquo;What is the matter with Brother Lee? He said no to whatever we proposed, yet he will not tell us what to do.&rdquo; This is the church. I should not tell you what to do; rather, you must prostrate yourself before the Lord and ask Him, &ldquo;Lord, what should I do?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Seek Confirmation</h2>
<p>If a person comes to fellowship with me, saying, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I have truly been dealt with by the Lord and have waited on Him for some time. As a result, I genuinely feel that this matter should be done in this way, but what do you think?&rdquo; At this point, my spirit within will surely rise up and respond positively. If you have fellowship with the Lord first, and then seek confirmation, this is acceptable. This is genuine fellowship. You should not ask me to &ldquo;unify&rdquo; you. There is a great difference between these two ways of seeking fellowship.</p>
<p>Once some brothers from a certain local church came to ask me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, what do you think we should do about a certain matter?&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I do not know. This is your business. Why do you ask me?&rdquo; They thought that I was angry, but actually I said this so that they would realize that there are certain things that they do not need to ask me about. Apparently, it seems that I am a difficult person and that I always make things difficult for people. Actually, I make things difficult for people in order to impress them that anyone who participates in God&rsquo;s service should have neither the concept of unification nor the habit of being careless.</p>
<p>The reason I say that it is not right to do a certain thing one way or another way is so that you will learn to put yourself aside and live in the Spirit of resurrection. You must go to the Lord and say to Him, &ldquo;O Lord, the meeting hall does not have the capacity to seat everyone. What shall we do?&rdquo; Do not ask other people or other local churches. You yourselves must go to the Lord and ask Him. This does not mean that others do not have a concern for you or that other local churches do not care for you. What it does mean is that essentially this matter is between you and the Lord. Others&rsquo; concern for you is another matter. These are two separate matters. Some young people have even asked me about the day of their marriage. They asked, &ldquo;Brother Lee, on what day do you think we should get married?&rdquo; Instead of asking me, they should ask the Lord. It is not acceptable to have unification, but it is proper to have spiritual fellowship in love.</p>
<p>In the church some unconsciously bring in errors because they are short of light or without light. Many times I am strict with the ones serving with me because I hope that among us none will bring in error due to a lack of light. Although the administration of a church is local, every saint in a local church should live directly before God. No elder should decide a matter for a saint. They should only bring the saints to the Lord. In the church life we often tend toward the extreme of acting individualistically and becoming loose and disorderly, or we go to the other extreme and bring in an atmosphere of unification. This is not only true in regard to one local church but in regard to all the local churches. Both extremes are wrong.</p>
<p>For example, in the matter of helping young people find a spouse, saints often hold an organizational concept and say, &ldquo;We should not touch this matter. We must wait until the responsible brothers make a decision. Then everything will be all right.&rdquo; What kind of truth is this? The Bible never says that the saints cannot touch the matter of the young people&rsquo;s marriage and that only the elders can decide this matter. Perhaps some brothers will respond, &ldquo;We did not intend to be this way.&rdquo; Yes, they may not have intended to be this way, but in their way of doing things, people can sense the flavor of organization.</p>
<p>Since there should be no organizational arrangement, some might say, &ldquo;This is wonderful! Now it is all right for me to interfere in regard to others&rsquo; marriage.&rdquo; If they do this, they will bring in confusion and the flesh. In all such matters, there should not be organizational arrangement, but there should be fellowship. There should be many older saints who love and fear the Lord and are concerned about the marriage of the young people. They can help introduce young people to one another. This is proper, and there is no need for the elders to exercise control in this matter. Nonetheless, this does not mean that the saints can act carelessly. Whoever has a desire to touch this matter should fear the Lord, learn to wait and pray in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and seek others&rsquo; fellowship.</p>
<p>We do not need unification, but we do need the oneness of fellowship. For example, when we have a feeling about something, we should go to the elders and fellowship with them. The elders will then fellowship with us concerning their feeling before the Lord. Thus, in such a way, inwardly we can become brighter, clearer, and more assured. This is real fellowship. Real fellowship is not to rule or to unify. This also applies to preaching the gospel. We should not say that if the elders have not decided that the church will preach the gospel, we should not have any gospel activity. This concept is wrong, and it limits the work of the Holy Spirit. If we have the feeling to preach the gospel, we should pray earnestly and look to the Lord to receive the burden. On the other hand, we need to also learn to fellowship with the responsible brothers.</p>
<p>Both unification and independent action are wrong. The proper way is to learn to live before the Lord. Every one of us should give ground to the Head and allow the Holy Spirit the opportunity to work in us.</p>
<p>After we have received a burden from the Holy Spirit, we should fellowship with those who are experienced and who are in coordination with us. The responsible brothers should not have the attitude that if they have not made a decision concerning gospel preaching, the saints are not allowed to do it. This attitude is wrong. It is the error of unification, which should not be among us. Rather, the responsible brothers should have the attitude of looking to the Lord, praying to the Lord, and thanking the Lord for stirring up so many of the saints to have a burden for the gospel in the various districts. The responsible brothers should be spiritually observant so that whenever the saints receive this burden, they would fellowship with the saints, confirm the saints, bless the saints, and help the saints. The responsible brothers should never keep the church in their hands and turn the church into something unified. To do so is a serious degradation and error.</p>
<p>The church should not be in any person&rsquo;s hands. The church is in the hands of the Holy Spirit. I hope that all the saints would learn the lesson to withdraw their hand instead of stretching it out in the church. We must learn not to have confidence in ourselves, not to do things by ourselves, and not to walk according to ourselves but to fellowship with our companions in coordination and to fellowship with the leading brothers. We must learn to reject our independent activities, our moves according to human will, and our activities that are according to our insight and capability. Not only so, we must learn to place ourselves in the Lord&rsquo;s hand and fellowship with those in the church and with those with whom we serve. In this way we will receive help in the fellowship of the Body, from the Holy Spirit and from those who are ahead of us and more experienced than us. In other words, we must live in the Spirit of the Body and not live in our own feelings and flesh. We should keep this principle not only in one matter but in every matter.</p>
