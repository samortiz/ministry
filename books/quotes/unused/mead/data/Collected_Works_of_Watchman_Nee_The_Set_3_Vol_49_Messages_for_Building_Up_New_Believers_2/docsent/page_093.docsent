   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>X. THE NEED FOR CONFESSION AND FORGIVENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Between the two persons in the family, there must be confession and forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many mistakes need to be confessed, not just ignored.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do not be careless about your own faults; you must always confess them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As for the faults of the other party, you must forgive them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When a Christian does something wrong, the basic principle is to not cover it up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not enough to just repent for it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When a Christian does something wrong, the basic principle is to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A Christian does not cover up or turn away from a sin; this is not enough to be called a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When a Christian does something wrong, he must confess and say, "I was wrong in this."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every wrong must be confessed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever there is any wrong between the husband and wife, there must be confession.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One must acknowledge, "I have done wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You confess when you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But what happens when the other person is wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You have to treat it the same way that you treat all Christian relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When there is any wrongdoing, learn to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not delve into the matter and do not be vindictive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Love does not take account of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that it does not remember the sins of others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Learn to forgive them before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once you forgive, you should forget.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You have to lay aside what you have forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not be like Peter, who tried to count the number of times others offended him Matt 18:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As long as you are counting, you are not forgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Real forgiveness does not count the number of times one forgives.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As soon as you forgive, the matter is over.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order for a family to go on, there must be forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CONSENT OF BOTH PARTIES</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>IN SEEKING HELP FROM THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When a family has a problem, it must try to solve it first by calling a family meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In some cases one should forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In other cases one should confess.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is difficult for a third party to settle disputes within a family.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The disputes between two persons are most easily solved between themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When a third party is involved, the situation becomes complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should try to settle any dispute in as simple a way as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not look for complicated solutions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Referring a dispute to a third party is like adding mud to an injured leg.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>An injured leg without any mud is easily treated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But when mud is added, it is hard to deal with the wound.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Disputes between two persons are more easily solved when a third party is not involved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As soon as a third party is informed, the problem is complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, a couple should learn to solve their own problems and should not try to inform a third party about it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, sometimes one needs to refer a certain matter to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Please remember that a person should not bring the matter to the church alone.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The husband must seek the consent of the wife and vice versa before they can bring their dispute to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The two persons must have exhausted their means of handling the situation, and they now want the church to step in to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They should not come with their quarrels, but as those who are seeking help from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Both must come, and both must speak.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Suppose both are willing to come to the church and say, "We are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is something between us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We would like the church to point out what is wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One will tell the church how he feels, and the other will tell the church how she feels as well.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When both do this, it is easy for the church to step in to solve the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is not an occasion for vindication.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not the time for each person to expose the other's faults.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Neither is it a time to get into a brawl.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The purpose of telling the church is for both parties to sincerely discover where the problem lies.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>XII.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>LIVING TOGETHER BEFORE THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In order to settle family problems and to have a good family life, there is also the need of positive influence.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In particular, families with children should set aside a time for prayer together, a time for waiting upon the Lord and for fellowshipping about spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Both the wife and the husband should be open to judgment from God's light concerning many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Neither the husband nor the wife should try to save his or her "face."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Both should be willing to come under the judgment of God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There should be many spiritual transactions in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The members of the family should spend much time in prayer and spiritual fellowship together.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is especially true for families with children.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They must seek opportunities to come more often to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In order for a family to go on properly, the husband and the wife should both live before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As soon as they do not live before the Lord, their family will have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>XIII.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>THE PROPER CHURCH LIFE BEING MAINTAINED</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>THROUGH A PROPER FAMILY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I have mentioned twelve items.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I hope that you will learn these lessons in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Do not be careless or foolish in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you do not learn your lessons well, family problems will soon become church problems.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If a man cannot live together with his wife at home and cannot be one with her, he can never be one with the brothers and sisters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A person cannot possibly fight at home with his wife and come to the church with hallelujahs in his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>One can only be a good brother in the church when he is a good husband and father at home.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>A good church life is maintained through good families.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The husbands have to be good and the wives also have to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then the church life will be free of problems.</S>
