   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Misrepresentation concerning the History of Modalism</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The speaker at Melodyland on October 2, 1977, said:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Witness Lee has perverted the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and has adopted an ancient church heresy known as Monarchianistic Modalism.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That's a fifty-cent word, but translated it boils down to this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are two types of modalism, the logical person who realizes that God cannot be both Father, Son, and Holy Spirit at the same time and then they say God was first the Father, became the Son, and then became the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The illogical ones recognize that the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit are spoken of at the same time and therefore try to say that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit somehow exist at the same time and yet are each other.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That's the two classic modes of modalistic theology...</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With the above statement the speaker then charged Witness Lee with both of the classic heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first classic mode is surely that type of modalism represented by Sabellius.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second classic mode of modalism which the speaker calls "illogical" is in fact not the second classic mode of modalism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All students of Christian doctrine know that the other classic mode of modalism is called dynamic modalism represented in the unitarian, Paul of Samosata, who denied the preexistence of Christ and reduced the Son and the Spirit to "virtues" or "powers" rather than "Persons" in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The speaker, however, misrepresented a man named Callistus as one who represented one of the classic modes of modalism, and utilized him to charge Witness Lee with a so-called classic heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The section that the speaker twisted for his own use is found in Philip Schaff's History of the Christian Church, Volume II, page 579.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The following is what was referred to over the radio, October 8, 1977, by the speaker and his associates:</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Callistus differed from the ditheistic separation of the Logos from God, but also from the Sabellian confusion of the Father and the Son, and insisted on the mutual indwelling perichoresis of the divine Persons; in other words, he sought the way from modalistic unitarianism to the Nicene trinitarianism; but he was not explicit and consistent in his statements.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He excommunicated both Sabellius and Hippolytus; the Roman church sided with him, and made his name one of the most prominent among the ancient popes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Firstly, according to Philip Schaff, Callistus is surely not represented here as one of the "classic modes of modalistic theology," but on the contrary "sought the way from modalistic unitarianism to the Nicene Trinitarianism."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In fact, J. F. Bethune-Baker's book The Early History of Christian Doctrine, pages 103-104, indicates that, with Callistus' statements related to the distinction of the Father and the Son, the essential principle of modalism is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, this is a direct misrepresentation of historical facts in the name of scholarship and research in order to label Witness Lee and the local churches with heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Secondly, the speaker indicated that Callistus represented the illogical ones who recognize that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit somehow exist at the same time and yet are each other.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is an outright falsehood in relation to what Callistus actually believed according to Schaff.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Callistus "insisted on the mutual indwelling perichoresis of the divine Persons."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The speaker represented Callistus as believing that the Father, Son, and Spirit are each other, but Callistus actually believed that the Father, Son, and Spirit are indwelling each other.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The omission of the word "indwelling" by the speaker was a subtle falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To say "are each other" is modalism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To say the divine Persons mutually indwell each other is the proper biblical understanding of the relationship between the Persons in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the speaker's so-called classic mode of illogical modalism is exposed as a fabrication of his own mind and not a fact in the history of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is irresponsible misrepresentation in the name of research and scholarship in order to falsely charge Witness Lee and the local churches.</S>
