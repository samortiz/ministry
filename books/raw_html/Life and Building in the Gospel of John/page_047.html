<h1 class="title">BUILDING UP IN THREE DAYS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 2:13-22</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the Lord&rsquo;s words in John 2:19, which says, &ldquo;In three days I will raise it up.&rdquo; These words refer to the building up of the church in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN<br />
BEING LIFE AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>Every book in the Bible has a central thought, and it is very important to touch the central thought of a book when reading the Bible. If we can touch the central thought of a book, we can touch the spirit of the book. The Gospel of John occupies a special place in the Bible because it focuses on life. The Gospel of John reveals that God is manifested as the Word and becomes the Spirit to enter into man. In the first half of the Gospel, God is manifested as the Word, and in the second half, God, as the Spirit, enters into man. The manifestation of God and His entering into man are for Him to be man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>However, God being manifested as the Word and becoming the Spirit to enter into man as life is not the goal of the Gospel of John. God being life in us is but a procedure to achieve an ultimate goal. This goal is explained in the first two chapters of John. John 1 says that the Word, who is God, became flesh and tabernacled among men (vv. 1, 14). Life is the procedure, and the tabernacle is the goal. God came to be our life so that He might tabernacle in man and among men. The end of chapter 1 speaks of Bethel with a universal ladder that joins earth and heaven (v. 51). This is the house of God that was revealed in Jacob&rsquo;s dream (Gen. 28:16-17). The Lord came as the Lamb with the dove for man to receive Him as life so that He can join earth to heaven for the building up of Bethel, the house of God.</p>
<p>There are two cases in John 2. The first case involves the changing of water into wine, showing that the Lord came to change death into life. The second case involves the cleansing of the temple. After changing water into wine, the Lord cleansed the temple, showing that He changes death into life in order to build up the temple of God.</p>
<p>The link between these two cases are the words <em>the third day</em> and <em>three days.</em> The Lord went to Cana, a place of weak and fragile people, on the third day in order to change death into life, and He also said that He would raise up the temple in three days (vv. 1-11, 19). The words <em>the third day</em> and <em>three days</em> have a special meaning. If we count the days in chapter 1, we see that the Lord went to Cana on the fifth day. However, John records His coming as being on the third day. This shows that in each of these cases the Lord was in resurrection. Resurrection links the two cases in chapter 2. The Lord went in resurrection to weak and fragile people to change death into life, and in resurrection the Lord will build up the temple, the house of God.</p>
<p>John 1 is an introduction, and chapter 2 shows that the Lord Jesus changes death into life for the building up of God&rsquo;s house in resurrection. Chapter 2 concerns the changing of water into wine and the building up of the temple. To change water into wine is a matter of life, but to build up the temple is a matter of building. Hence, this chapter concerns life and building.</p>
<p>The central thought of the Gospel of John is life and building, and the spirit of the Gospel of John is the spirit of life and building. This Gospel speaks of God coming forth as the Word and becoming the Spirit to enter into us as life so that He can gain His building in the universe. This building is the vision that Jacob saw at Bethel. Jacob&rsquo;s vision, however, was not fulfilled until the Gospel of John. The fulfillment of Jacob&rsquo;s dream was realized by God coming forth as the Word and becoming the Spirit so that He could enter into man as life. This is the central thought and the spirit of the Gospel of John. If we do not touch this thought, we cannot enter into the depths of this Gospel.</p>
<p>In chapter 6 the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (v. 63). Of the sixty-six books of the Bible, only the Gospel of John speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s words as being spirit and life. This verse shows that the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit for life. The Lord&rsquo;s coming forth in the Word and His becoming the Spirit are for Him to be life to us. Moreover, His being life is for the purpose of building Bethel, the tabernacle, as God&rsquo;s house. In 14:2 the Lord speaks of abodes, saying, &ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house are many abodes.&rdquo; The Father&rsquo;s house in both chapters 2 and 14 refers to His spiritual building. According to the interpretation in 2:16 and 21, <em>My Father&rsquo;s house</em> refers to the temple, the body of Christ, as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. However, many people mistakenly interpret the Father&rsquo;s house in chapter 14 as a heavenly mansion. Just as the Father&rsquo;s house in chapter 2 does not refer to a heavenly mansion but to His spiritual building, the Father&rsquo;s house in chapter 14 does not refer to a heavenly mansion but to God&rsquo;s mysterious spiritual building. This building is the issue of God building Himself into man and of God building man into Himself so that He becomes man&rsquo;s dwelling place and man becomes His dwelling place.</p>
<p>In 14:2 the Lord said, &ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house are many abodes.&rdquo; In verse 23 He said, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; These verses speak of abodes.</p>
<p>In chapter 15 the Lord said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you&rdquo; (v. 4). The Gospel of John speaks of the mutual abiding of God and man. Of all the writers of the Bible, only John speaks so clearly concerning God abiding in man and man abiding in God, that is, concerning the mutual abiding of God and man. John speaks of this mutual abiding of God and man not only in his Gospel, but also in his Epistles (1 John 3:24; 4:12-13). In the book of Revelation John writes also of the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God with men (21:2-3). The New Jerusalem has the names of the twelve apostles on its foundations and the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on its gates (vv. 14, 12). Those who read the Bible understand this to mean that the city is a spiritual building built up with all the redeemed ones of the Old Testament and the New Testament.</p>
<p>If we see this revelation, we will understand that the central thought of the Gospel of John, the Epistles of John, and Revelation is that God has come to be man&rsquo;s life so that He can build those who receive Him and enjoy Him into His eternal habitation. This building is in life, that is, in resurrection. If we do not see this thought, we will not understand John&rsquo;s writings.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
