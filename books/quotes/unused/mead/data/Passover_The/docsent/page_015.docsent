   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Purchased and Circumcised Servants Qualified to Eat</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although strangers and hired servants could not partake of the Passover, the purchased and circumcised servants were qualified to eat of it 12:44, 48 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To be purchased is to be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are not hired servants, but we have been purchased by the Lord to be His slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We were lost, but the Lord paid the price to buy us back.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that we have been redeemed, purchased, bought back.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, we are no longer strangers we are redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are no longer the natural man we are purchased ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ's redemption does not include the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather His redemption deals with the natural man by putting him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ redeems only those who have been dealt with by His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such a dealing is signified by circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do you regard yourself as a hired one or as a purchased one?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Few like to think of themselves as those who have been purchased.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A purchased one is actually a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the reason that in ourselves we all prefer to be hired ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are hired by a certain person to work for him, we are willing to work as long as we are happy with our employer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if we are not happy, we can resign and work for someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But a purchased one, a slave has no right to resign.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once again we see that the way of the natural man contradicts God's principle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In God's redemption we are not hired ones; we are purchased ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Anyone who thinks of himself as a hired one has no share in God's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we want to enjoy God's redemption, we must take our standing as those who have been purchased by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is easy to say in a doctrinal way that we are purchased ones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But in our actual daily practice we may live as if we were hired ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Apostle Paul knew that he was a slave of Christ Jesus Rom 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He did not regard himself as one who had been hired to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In contrast to many pastors or ministers, Paul knew he had no right to resign from serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be a hired one is, spiritually speaking, to work in our natural life for the purpose of receiving recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But according to the spiritual principle, to be a purchased one is to serve the Lord in redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A purchased one is a person who has been lost, who has been bought back, and who has been dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the kind of person who has been redeemed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a one is qualified to partake of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Exodus 12:44 says, "But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 48 also speaks of circumcision: "And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the redeemed ones must be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Spiritually speaking, to be circumcised is to have the natural life dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Apart from this kind of circumcision, there is no redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this reason, the redeemed ones are related to circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who have been redeemed have been dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Paul's words, they are the true circumcision Phil 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The strangers are the hired ones, whereas the purchased ones are the circumcised ones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who are circumcised do not exercise the natural life to work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God does not want us to work for Him; He wants us to be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The work according to our natural life can only produce Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our strength to produce Ishmael must be cut off through circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we would receive God's salvation in a proper way, we need to be purchased and circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the time of conversion, a sinner should repent, confess, and believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Simultaneously, he should begin to hate his natural life and to realize that this life needs to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the reason that as soon as someone believes in the Lord Jesus, he should be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be baptized is to realize that the natural life is good for nothing except burial.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When a new believer has this realization, he is conscious of the fact that he has been purchased and circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, many of today's Christians have received God's salvation blindly, not realizing that they have been purchased and circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All these details related to the Passover show the proper and adequate way to apply the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If these details were not necessary, the Bible would not include them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although these details are also in the New Testament, it is rather difficult for us to find them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, they are vividly portrayed in the picture of the Passover in the book of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thank the Lord that we are the purchased and circumcised ones and that we eat the Passover according to God's principles.</S>
