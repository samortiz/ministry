   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Gospel Visitation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Visitation of the New Believers 1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being Baptized as soon as One Is Saved</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The responsibility of visiting the new believers is quite heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the church assigns a certain brother to visit someone, this brother should take along with him the one who introduced that new one to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As soon as a person is saved, he should be baptized right away.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many people were quite alive when they first believed, but after waiting for a while to be baptized, they became dead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As soon as a person believes, he should be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If he is baptized, and if something happens later, he will not feel so free to deny his faith any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Whole Church Working,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Bringing Increase in Quantity and Quality</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In arranging the visitation, we should divide up the city into districts according to the map.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once the time is ripe, and there is a certain number of ones desiring to be baptized, we should baptize them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we do this, in a short time, we will double our investments.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No other period of time affords as much opportunity as today for the work to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the whole church rises up, there will be no place to hold the blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Foochow, within one to two months, a thousand people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the whole church is involved in this kind of work, everyone who comes into the church will be up to the proper standard.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everyone who is born this way will be an eight-to nine-pound baby, and no one will be a twelve-ounce baby that has to be kept in an incubator.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Teaching Others to Serve God</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Properly and Conscientiously</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here I have to speak a frank word to you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have to speak honest words to others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the past, a certain person may have been loose, and you may have let it go.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But you cannot do that any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a person does not do his job, you cannot let him go; you have to compel him to work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After he has agreed to work, you still have to tell him, "Why are you so loose?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why would you not be careful in taking care of the things of God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You need to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Who told you to hand over yourself to be a child of God in the first place?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But now, and as long as you are His child, you have to serve, and you have to serve in a conscientious way."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>C. The Perfecting of the New Believers 1.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Conducting the New Believers' Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>by Districts</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to conduct the new believers' meetings in the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The reason for this is that many live too far away and cannot otherwise attend this kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At present, we have considered everyone a new believer, and we are giving make-up lessons to all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Among the brothers, we have selected twenty brothers to do the teaching work in the thirteen districts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The subjects covered in the thirteen districts are the same, and their contents are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This meeting is set up specifically for the perfecting of the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those Who Are Absent</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Needing to Receive Make-up Lessons</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The ones who are responsible for visiting the new believers should go out on Friday evening to give make-up lessons to those who were absent the previous week.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In giving the make-up lessons, you have to do a detailed job.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way, whether or not a person comes to the meeting, he will receive the same teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, Brother Cheng may give a message here for two hours with sweat all over him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After he finishes his message, he still has to go to the home of a brother who is absent from the meeting to give him a make-up lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Someone besides that other brother may say, "Look, Brother Cheng has put in so much effort to give his message already.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now when others do not come to the meeting, he still has to spend time to give make-up lessons."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By saying this, the one who has been absent from the meeting will say, "That is right.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Next time I think I have to come to the meeting."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This kind of work is most definite and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Everywhere you go, you will find out right away the things that are wrong with that place, and right away you will be able to make up the lack.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we practice this, our work will not be as confused and uncoordinated as it is today.</S>
