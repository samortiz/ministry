[2]  I. GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE A. A People to Express God
[3]  According to Ephesians 3, in eternity past God planned to work Himself into His chosen people.
[4]  His eternal purpose is to have a people with Him as life.
[5]  The Spirit as the third in the Godhead is God being our realization and experience.
[6]  The Spirit of God is like the heavenly radio waves.
[7]  It is in our spirit that we were born again John 3:6 ; it is in our spirit that we were made alive Eph 2:5; Rom 8:10 ; it is in our spirit that God dwells Eph 2:22; 2 Tim 4:22; Rom 8:16 ; it is in our spirit that we are joined to the Lord 1 Cor 6:17 ; and it is in our spirit that we contact and worship God John 4:24 .
[8]  Outline The progressive revelation of the divine Spirit The Spirit of God The Spirit of Jehovah The Holy Spirit The Spirit being "not yet" The Spirit of Jesus The Spirit of Christ The Spirit of Jesus Christ The Spirit the all-inclusive, processed Triune God Saved by the bountiful supply of the Spirit Text
[9]  The first divine title given to the Spirit in the New Testament is the "Holy Spirit."
[10]  Andrew Murray in his masterpiece, The Spirit of Christ, points out that the divine title, the Holy Spirit, is not used in the Old Testament.
[11]  Romans 8:9 says, "But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.
[12]  But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him."
[13]  This Spirit is the Spirit of God mentioned in the same verse and also the Spirit of life mentioned in verse 2.
[14]  Lesson Three THE COMPOUND SPIRIT Scripture Reading Exo 30: 22-25; Psa 45:7; Isa 61:1; Col 3:5;
[15]  Outline The compound ointment in Exodus 30 The significance of the ingredients Olive oil Myrrh Cinnamon Calamus Cassia The significance of the numbers and measurements One hin of oil with four spices Three units of five hundred Five elements The compounded Spirit Text I. THE COMPOUND OINTMENT IN EXODUS 30
[16]  Flowing myrrh, smelling sweet but tasting bitter, signifies the precious death of Christ.
[17]  In the Bible myrrh is used mostly for burial.
[18]  The fourth spice, cassia, signifies the power of Christ's resurrection.
[19]  1:1, 14; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; Jn.
[20]  Outline The processed God Becoming a life-giving Spirit A definite process Christ and the Spirit being one Christ as the indwelling Spirit Christ never leaving the believers Text
[21]  Some find fault with the word "processed" and argue that it is impossible for God to be processed because He is eternal and unchanging.
[22]  Although God is eternal and unchanging, He has nevertheless passed through a process.
[23]  John 20 is the first account of the Lord coming to the believers as the life-giving Spirit.
[24]  Lesson Five THE SEVENFOLD INTENSIFIED SPIRIT Scripture Reading Rev 1:4-5; Zech 4:2; Rev 4:5; Exo 25:37; Rev 5:6;
[25]  Zech 3:9; Matt 16:18; 21:42; 1 Pet 2:4-5.
[26]  Outline The seven Spirits of God Not seven different spirits Intensified for God's move The seven lamps of fire burning before the throne The seven eyes of the Lamb For moving and transfusing Not separate from Christ The seven Spirits, seven lamps, and seven eyes for God's building The lamps and the building The stone with seven eyes Cleansing and infusing Purifying and transforming Text I. THE SEVEN SPIRITS OF GOD
[27]  Seven is the number of completion in God's dispensational move, while twelve is the number of completion in God's eternal administration.
[28]  For example, God created the earth in six days plus one Sabbath day.
[29]  The Holy Spirit today is the seven eyes of Christ.
[30]  First Peter 2:4 and 5 say, "To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, ye also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house" Gk.
[31]  . The way for us to become living stones is to come to Him and to be seen by Him.
[32]  Lesson Six THE ESSENTIAL AND ECONOMICAL SPIRIT Scripture Reading Jn.
[33]  20:22; Acts 1:5,8; 2:1-4; Matt 1:18-20;
[34]  Outline Two aspects of the Holy Spirit As breath for life As wind for power In the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Only one Spirit The proper aim outward power for inward life The baptism in the Holy Spirit Tongues not necessary evidence Experiencing the accomplished fact Accomplished once for all No need to analyze In relation to the Body Experiencing the two aspects by calling on the Lord Text
[35]  The Lord's word to the disciples concerning the Holy Spirit in chapter one of Acts was fulfilled in chapter two.
[36]  On the day of Pentecost "suddenly there came a noise out of heaven like a rushing violent wind," and it filled the house where the disciples were sitting.
[37]  Some Christians always insist that speaking in tongues is a necessary manifestation evidence of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.
[38]  But with two of the five cases in Acts the Samaritans and Saul of Tarsus nothing is mentioned about speaking in tongues.
[39]  Today we need to learn to call upon the name of the Lord.
[40]  Lesson Seven THE SPIRIT'S WORK IN THE BELIEVERS 1 REGENERATION Scripture Reading John 3:3-6; Eph 2:1; 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:16; Jer 17:9; 13:23;
[41]  Outline Regeneration Born of the Spirit Born again The way to be regenerated The need of regeneration Because we are corrupted Because we lack God's life Regeneration versus the natural concept Receiving the life and nature of God Not outward decoration Living as sons of God The constant receiving of the Spirit Text I. REGENERATION
[42]  When man hears the Gospel or reads the word of the Scripture, God's Spirit works in him and causes him to feel that he has sinned and is corrupted; hence, he is reproved for sin and righteousness and judgment John 16:8 .
[43]  When man sees himself as a sinner, recognizes his corruption, and is willing to repent, then God's Spirit causes him to see that the Lord Jesus is his Savior, and that He died on the cross to shed His blood for the remission of sin.
[44]  Using the illustration of a dog receiving a human life, we see that the natural concept is merely that a dog can be cleansed and beautified.
[45]  Outline Sanctification The two aspects of sanctification Before justification After justification Positional sanctification Dispositional sanctification Sanctification by the Word and the Spirit Text I. SANCTIFICATION
[46]  First Peter 1:1-2 says that we were chosen "according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ."
[47]  Peter says that sanctification comes after the Father's selection and before Christ's redemption.
[48]  According to this verse, the sanctification of the Spirit is unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Christ.
[49]  In subjective sanctification we are saturated with God dispositionally.
[50]  Outline Transformation The result of sanctification A metabolic change Discharging the old element and adding the new By taking in the all-inclusive Spirit The way to be transformed Not conformed but transformed by the renewing of the mind Beholding and reflecting the Lord Text I. TRANSFORMATION A. The Result of Sanctification
[51]  In the previous lesson we saw the matter of sanctification, the imparting of the divine life into our entire being.
[52]  In all the churches the saints should be concerned about this metabolic change in life through the spreading of the divine Spirit.
[53]  Second Corinthians 3:18 tells us how we can be transformed: "And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."
[54]  Lesson Ten THE SPIRIT'S WORK IN THE BELIEVERS 4
[55]  THE ANOINTING, SEALING, AND PLEDGING Scripture Reading 2 Cor 1:21-22; 1 Jn.
[56]  Outline The anointing The moving of the Spirit in us Adding the diving element The sealing Indicating ownership Bearing the image of God The pledging A sample and a foretaste Given for our enjoyment A mutual inheritance Text
[57]  When the Triune God reaches us today, He comes as the Spirit.
[58]  The moving of this Spirit is the anointing within 1 John 2:27 .
[59]  The Triune God dwells in us as the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit, and this Spirit is the ointment moving within....He is not dormant within us; rather, He is living, moving, acting.
[60]  After the anointing, 2 Corinthians 1 mentions the sealing.
[61]  Lesson Eleven THE SPIRIT'S WORK IN THE BELIEVERS 5 EMPOWERING AND SUPPLYING THEM TO SPEAK CHRIST Scripture Reading 1 Cor 9:16; Acts 1:8; 1 Cor 2:4; 1 Thes 1:5; Acts 4:31.
[62]  Outline Christians being a speaking people Witnesses of the living Christ With the Spirit upon us and within us Preaching the gospel In power, in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance Our power the Triune God as the Spirit With prayer, the Spirit, and boldness With a deposit of the living and rich Word The young saints preaching with power Speaking Christ To all our relatives To everyone, everywhere Text I. CHRISTIANS BEING A SPEAKING PEOPLE
[63]  In the previous four lessons we have seen the essential work of the Spirit within the believers.
[64]  But we know that there is the economical aspect of the Spirit as well.
[65]  PREACHING THE GOSPEL A. In Power, in the Holy Spirit,
[66]  In 1 Thessalonians 1:5 he said, "Our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, even as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake."
[67]  Perhaps you would say, "Brother Lee, you have been in the Word for over fifty years.
[68]  How can we be powerful in preaching the gospel if we are still young in the Lord?"
[69]  Let me testify to you that even when I was young my speaking was powerful because of these three matters of prayer, the Word, and the Spirit, the anointing.
[70]  Lesson Twelve THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD Scripture Reading Jn.
[71]  Outline Receiving the Spirit through the Word Two extremes Fundamentalists Pentecostalists The Spirit embodied in the Word The spoken words being the embodiment of the life-giving Spirit The Scripture being God's breath The Spirit and the Word being one Experiencing the fire in the Word by pray-reading Ministering the Word by the Spirit The word growing and multiplying The need to be full of the Word The Spirit within and the Word outside The daily need to touch the Spirit in the Word Text I. RECEIVING THE SPIRIT THROUGH THE WORD
[72]  They may neglect the Word and emphasize the Spirit in an abnormal, unbalanced way.
[73]  In the last lesson we pointed out that in order to preach the gospel effectively we must gain a rich deposit from the Word.
[74]  Now we see more clearly why this is so crucial.
[75]  Lesson Thirteen THE HUMAN SPIRIT Scripture Reading Prov 20:27; Job 32:8; Zech 12:1; Mal 2:15; Rom 1:9;
[76]  THE HUMAN SPIRIT A. Being the Dwelling Place of the Holy Spirit
[77]  Why are we emphasizing the difference between the Holy Spirit and the human spirit?
[78]  It is because our greatest problem is that we do not know the indwelling Spirit or realize that the human spirit is the very dwelling place of the Holy Spirit; neither do we know that these two spirits are being mingled together as one Spirit.
[79]  THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONSCIENCE A. Maintaining a Transparent Conscience
[80]  After such a confession, you will not want to go back home.
[81]  You will be afraid you may hear more gossip.
[82]  THE SPIRIT AND THE SOUL Scripture Reading 1 Cor 2:14-15; 1 Thes 5:23; Gen 2:7; Prov 20:27; Heb 4:12;
[83]  Outline The soul being different from the spirit Spirit and soul and body Joints and marrow Trichotomy and dichotomy The parts of man At creation After the fall In salvation The Spirit as the new person Text
[84]  We must open to the Word and read it.
[85]  When man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan entered into the body of man through the fruit of that tree Gen 3:6 , for the fruit, we know, entered man's body.
[86]  Often we Christians are not very clear about the little revelation we have received.
[87]  Lesson Fifteen DENYING THE SOUL AND TURNING TO THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading Heb 4:12; Rom 8:4; Matt 10:38-39; 16:24-26; 2 Cor 11:2;
[88]  Outline Denying the soul Denying the mind, emotion, and will Practicing to deny the self The life and faculties of the soul Giving up the natural life The mind, emotion, and will renewed and uplifted An uplifted understanding A spiritual emotion A strong, renewed will Faculties to express the Lord A life of denying the soul and turning to the spirit Taking the Lord as life Under the control of the spirit Text
[89]  The soul is comprised of three parts the mind, the emotion, and the will see The Economy of God, pp.
[90]  The natural life, the life of the soul, has been crucified on the cross Gal 2:20 .
[91]  Now we have to take the Lord as our life.
[92]  We must give up the natural life, the life of the soul, and take the Lord in the spirit as our life.
[93]  A spiritual person is one who is so keen in the understanding of the mind, so emotional in his love and affection, and so strong in his will.
[94]  The faculties of the soul are organs used by the Spirit to express the Lord.
[95]  Lesson Sixteen KNOWING OUR SPIRIT Scripture Reading Daniel 7:15; Rom 8:6.
[96]  Outline The sense of the spirit Setting the mind on the spirit the key to death or life The sense of life The sense of peace The sense of death Living in the spirit Taking care of the inner sense The Christian life according to the spirit Text
[97]  To speak of the body is very easy, because we can see it and touch it.
[98]  The Apostle says that the result of minding the flesh is death, whereas the result of minding the spirit is life and peace.
[99]  This word reveals that just as the flesh is versus the spirit, so also the result of minding the flesh, which is death, is opposite to the results of minding the spirit, which are life and peace.
[100]  Lesson Seventeen THE MINGLED SPIRIT Scripture Reading 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:4; 2 Tim 4:22; 2 Cor 3:17; Rom 8:16.
[101]  Outline One spirit with the Lord Two spirits mingled as one No third nature produced The Spirit witnessing with our spirit Walking according to the mingled spirit Text
[102]  Physically we were born of our parents, but when we were regenerated, we were "born of the Spirit" John 3:6 .
[103]  By believing in the Lord Jesus, our spirit was born of the Spirit.
[104]  Some Bible students and even some Bible teachers have failed to understand the matter of mingling.
[105]  In ancient times there was a debate regarding the mingling of the divine essence and the human essence in the Person of the Lord Jesus.
[106]  Even a young student has to learn how to experience Christ in the study of his lesson books.
[107]  Lesson Eighteen BEING FILLED IN SPIRIT Scripture Reading Eph 5:18; 3:19; Acts 2:2-4; 13:52; Jn.
[108]  To be filled in spirit v. 18 is to be filled in our regenerated spirit, the human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God.
[109]  We should, however, say a word regarding the outward filling.
[110]  Actually, if from the beginning all those who are saved would be willing to abandon everything for the Lord to be used by Him, then upon being saved each one would be in a position to receive both aspects of the filling of the Holy Spirit simultaneously, as occurred in the house of Cornelius.
[111]  This filling is not only for your nourishment, it is for you to dispense.
[112]  Lesson Nineteen EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT Scripture Reading 1 Tim 4:7; 2 Tim 1:7; 4:22; 1 Tim 1:5; Heb 10:22;
[113]  Outline Exercise unto godliness The exercise of the spirit More profitable than bodily exercise Taking care of our conscience A good conscience The need of the cleansing blood Exercising by praying Praying without ceasing by calling Pray-reading the Word Exercising our spirit in the meetings Text I. EXERCISE UNTO GODLINESS A. The Exercise of the Spirit
[114]  In order to be able to exercise our spirit it is vital to take care of our conscience.
[115]  In 1 Thessalonians 5:17 Paul charges us to pray without ceasing.
[116]  Outline Walking according to spirit Being led by the Spirit Two kinds of walk by the Spirit Walking about the first walk Walking in line the second walk Walking by the Spirit as the rule Text I. WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT
[117]  If you read through your Bible, going on from the Old Testament through to the end of the New Testament, you will see that the Lord's ultimate charge to you is not that you follow laws or teachings, but that you walk according to spirit.
[118]  In Galatians 5 Paul speaks twice about walking by the Spirit.
[119]  If we consider Galatians 5:25 in light of the other verses where the Greek word stoicheo is used for walk Rom 4:12; Phil 3:16 , we shall see that to walk by the Spirit is to walk by the Spirit as our rule.
[120]  The Spirit Himself is the way, the rule, the line, the principle, leading toward God's goal.
[121]  If we would have the second walk by the Spirit, we must take the Spirit as our rule, our way.
[122]  Outline Life and service The service being the ministering of Christ The basis of our service By the growth in life In the Body In the spirit Not in oldness of letter In newness of our regenerated spirit Ministering Christ in the practical service Text
[123]  The Apostle Paul said in Romans 1:9, "For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers."
[124]  Then he said in Romans 7:6, "But now we are discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, that we should serve as slaves in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter."
[125]  The service we are talking about is certainly not the so-called "Sunday morning service" to which many Christians are accustomed.
[126]  Now we come to a crucial point; that is, we need to learn how to serve in the spirit.
[127]  Romans 7:6 says, "But now we are discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter."
[128]  The purpose of all we do in the church service is to minister Christ to others.
[129]  Lesson Twenty-Two THE TRIUNE GOD AS THE SPIRIT
[130]  SATURATING THE TRIPARTITE MAN Scripture Reading Rom 8:1-11; Jn.
[131]  Outline The Triune God Revealed in Romans eight Three-one The tripartite man Body and soul and spirit The spirit making man unique Regenerated with the divine seed The imparting of life to every part of our being Our spirit being life Our soul becoming life Life imparted to our mortal bodies Our whole being saturated with God The need to see the vision Text I. THE TRIUNE GOD A. Revealed in Romans Eight
[132]  The Spirit that we are referring to is the Spirit; that is, it is the Triune God who has been processed and has become the life-giving Spirit.
[133]  The second aspect is found in verse 6: "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."
[134]  The mind is the leading part of our soul.
[135]  We all need to see the vision of the dispensing of the life of the Triune God into the three parts of our being.
[136]  The matter of seeing the church is in the spirit, and the building up of the church is also in the spirit.
[137]  Finally, in chapter six of Ephesians, Paul says that we need to pray at every time in spirit v. 18 . This prayer is the prayer of a member of the Body identified with Christ on the throne, all the time claiming, proclaiming, giving command to the Lord, and binding the enemy.
[138]  Lesson Twenty-Four THE CONSUMMATE ISSUE OF THE TWO SPIRITS Scripture Reading Rev 1:12, 20; Jn.
[139]  Rev 22:17a; 1:2, 9; 19:7-10; 21:2, 9, 11, 18-21; 22: 1-2, 14.
[140]  Outline The church The mingling of the divine life and the human life The lampstands the embodiment of Christ and the reproduction of the Spirit The New Jerusalem the Spirit being one with the bride The universal marriage The mingling of the Trinity with His redeemed The Father's nature, the Son's redemption, and the Spirit's transformation The consummation of the divine dispensing To express God fully for eternity Text I. THE CHURCH A. The Mingling of the Divine Life
[141]  In Revelation 1 the churches are seen as the seven golden lampstands.
[142]  Such a composition of the Triune God with His redeemed people will express God fully for eternity Rev 21:11a .
[143]  So at the end of the sixty-six books of the Bible, the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.
[144]  Now we can see why John says that the Son comes in the Father's name, and the Spirit comes in the Son's name.
