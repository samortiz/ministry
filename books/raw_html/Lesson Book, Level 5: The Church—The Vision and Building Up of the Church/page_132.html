<h2 class=head1>V. PRAYING AND SEEKING THE TRUTH WITH COMPANIONS</h2><p>What do companions do when they get together? If they talk about worldly things, they will be distracted from the Lord. If they insult one another with offensive words, they destroy one another. [The five companions should always call on the name of the Lord together (2 Tim. 2:22). They should always come together to fellowship, pray-read, pray, and take care of new ones. One brother’s new ones should be another brother’s new ones also. In this way one group of five saints will have fifteen new ones under their care. All these new ones will be saved. The principle for the saints in both the Old and New Testaments is that they should be grouped together. The young people need to flee youthful lusts and pursue the Lord with some companions.]<p>They need to pray. Prayer strengthens their spirit. Prayer will move the Lord to work. Prayer will give them the guidance on how to go on with the Lord. Paul said in 1 Tim. 2:1, “I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men.’’ Prayer is the first thing we must do. We like to talk; we do not like to pray. We need to develop a habit of praying. Daniel prayed three times a day kneeling before God. That was his habit. Therefore, young people should pray together to develop such a holy habit. Paul also charged the saints to pray unceasingly. The young people need to develop a spiritual habit to pray unceasingly. The best way to develop such a habit is to pray every time we think about someone and every time we have to do something or say something. If the young people will pray together, they will afford the Lord a chance to perfect them for the work of the ministry and for the building up of the church.<p>They should research [the things concerning Christ and the church. When a group comes together, one brother may ask the others if they can speak something concerning the assurance of salvation. The young people in the church may know how to call on the name of the Lord, and they have been saved. However, some may not know assuredly that they are saved. Eventually, their assurance of salvation will be tested. The young people should thoroughly fellowship matters such as the assurance of salvation and regeneration in their groups.<p>There has not been enough time for the church as a whole to cover these matters. As a result, the knowledge and experience of the young people is too general. The young people should take care of their own needs in their groups of five. If they do not, we may eventually have a good number of saints among us, but they will not be thoroughly rooted in spiritual matters. If five young people cannot speak clearly to each other about the assurance of salvation, how can they help others? They may only be able to help them to call on the name of the Lord in a general way. In their groups the young ones should help each other to be clear about the life experiences.]<p>[We need to lay a foundation for the young people’s work. The young ones should be helped to know what the assurance of salvation is, what regeneration is, and what eternal life is. If each group covers one or two points a week, after half a year they will have covered thirty or forty basic points. This will lay a good foundation. It is not enough to come together and pray in a general way. The young people must do something specific, just as we eat something specific and definite at every meal.<p>To practice meeting in small groups is not a difficult thing to do. Every week after a church meeting, five young people could go to a brother’s home for fellowship. To spend even only fifteen minutes will be a help to them. They should not fellowship there in a general way. This is the time to cover two or three specific points.]<h2 class=head1>CONCLUSION</h2><p>We hope that all the young people will have a burden for the building up of the church. In order to do the building-up work, they need to be caught and occupied by God, to purpose in their heart not to be defiled, and to flee youthful lusts with their companions. The companions need to fellowship with one another, pray, seek the Lord in the Word, and preach the gospel together. The Lord will prepare these young ones for His move, His recovery, and for the building up of His church.<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Name three people from the Old Testament who were called by God in their youth.
