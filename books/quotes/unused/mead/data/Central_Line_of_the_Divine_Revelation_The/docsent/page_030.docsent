   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S CREATION OF MAN IN HIS IMAGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND ACCORDING TO HIS LIKENESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AS A TRIPARTITE VESSEL</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are two crucial points in God's creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first crucial point is that God made man in His own image and after His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man was made according to God, just as a photograph of a person is taken according to that person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, man's image and likeness are according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The second crucial point in God's creation of man is that man was created with three parts Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, man is tripartite.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man's body was formed of dust, and his spirit was formed of the breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The breath of life out from God was not God's being, but it was close to God's being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The breath that came out of God formed man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is proven by comparing Genesis 2:7 with Proverbs 20:27.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In both verses the Hebrew word neshamah is used, indicating that the breath of life out from God became man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The body is physical, but the spirit is not physical.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the study of medicine, medical doctors study mainly our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But man has not only a physical part but also a metaphysical part his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word metaphysics, in its popular usage, refers to the study of matters that transcend material reality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The spirit of man is above material reality, and thus it is very difficult for people to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The study of the spirit is more difficult than the study of medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the medical doctors were to ask me about the body, I could not say very much.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if I were to ask them about the spirit, I do not think that they could answer me very well.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Medical doctors know about the human body, but many of them do not know or even believe that man has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The body is the outward organ of man, having physical consciousness to contact the physical world Gen 2:7a .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The spirit is our inward organ not only to contact God but also to be the recipient of God 2:7b .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is like our stomach, which is a receiver of food and is also the place where our food remains until it is digested.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our spirit is for us to contact God, to receive God, and to retain God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This morning I was very serious with myself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I considered that every minute, even every second, the Lord Jesus is in my spirit, yet my conversation was very careless.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The way that I spoke made it seem as if the Lord was not in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that I lacked the fear of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Philippians 2:12-13 Paul says, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must be full of fear and trembling because God is operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the President of the United States were to visit us, we would immediately have a change and would adjust ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to realize that the Lord Jesus who is with our spirit is much higher than the President.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus should have our highest regard.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should be full of fear whenever we assemble together with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But often we are not fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are not fearful in everything that we do, this shows that our realization that Christ is within us is not very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we had a serious feeling concerning this matter, we could not exchange words with our spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever we lose our temper, this indicates that we have forgotten that the Lord Jesus lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is a sign that we are not fearful and trembling, knowing that He is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ lives in us, and He even lives for us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is in us not in an occasional way, but every minute and in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why we have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our spirit as our inward organ is conscious of the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The body is our outward organ, and the spirit is our inward organ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet neither of these two organs is our person, our self.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our person, our self, is our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The soul was not formed of any element.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The soul was brought forth by the combination of the two organs, the body and the spirit.</S>
