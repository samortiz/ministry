THE BENEFIT OF REVIEWING THE PAST</H2><P>Reviewing the past has a threefold benefit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Bringing Us New Light and New Revelation</H2><P>Reviewing the past brings us new light and new revelation. If we would have this light and revelation, we need to be in the presence of the Lord as we are reviewing our past. Otherwise, we will simply have a kind of retrospection, and this will not be helpful. If we view our past in the presence of the Lord, He may give us new light and new revelation according to what we were in the past.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Helping Us to Know<br>God's Heart and God's Hand</H2><P>Reviewing the past also helps us to know God's heart and God's hand. God's heart is loving and His hand is righteous. According to His heart, God is loving; according to His hand, He is righteous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Helping Us to Know Ourselves,<br>to Condemn the Flesh, and to Learn<br>to Reject the Self and the Flesh</H2><P>Reviewing the past helps us to know ourselves, to condemn the flesh, and to learn to reject the self and the flesh.
