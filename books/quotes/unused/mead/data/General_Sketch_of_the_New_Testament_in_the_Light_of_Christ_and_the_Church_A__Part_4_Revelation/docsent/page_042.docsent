   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR THE NEW JERUSALEM 3 Scripture Reading: Rev 21:12-21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we shall consider further aspects and applications of the structure and measurement of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Having a Great and High Wall</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>for Separation and Protection</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Revelation 21:12a says of the New Jerusalem, It had a great and high wall.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first item of the structure and measurement of the New Jerusalem is the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A wall is for separation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Within the wall is something of God, while outside the wall is everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As Christians and as the church, we must be separated unto God, that is, holy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Holiness is our separation, and the separation is our protection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Where there is a wall, there is protection for everything within it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many Christians and Christian churches, however, have no separation, so they do not have the protection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to verse 18 the building work of the wall is jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we have seen clearly, jasper signifies the appearance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that the appearance, likeness, and holiness of God in His glory are the separating wall for our Christian life and for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In our Christian life and church life we must have God s appearance, God s likeness, and God s holiness in His glory as our separating wall.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the garden of Eden there was no wall to protect it; Adam himself was the only protection, so the serpent came in. The holy city, however, has a wall, which is the appearance, likeness, and holiness of God in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the separation for the church and the protection for our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being a Living Composition</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>of the Old and New Testament Saints</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 12b says that on the twelve gates of the New Jerusalem there were names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that this city includes all the redeemed saints of Israel in the Old Testament times.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In addition, verse 14 says that the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This proves that this city also includes the New Testament believers, who are represented by the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the gates are the names of the twelve tribes, and on the foundations are the names of the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Putting those names together, it is easy to realize that this city is a composition of all the redeemed saints of the Old Testament and the believers of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Luke 13:28-29 tells us that in the coming kingdom of God, there will be not only Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and other Old Testament saints but also believers who will come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many New Testament believers and Old Testament saints will be together in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hebrews 11:8-10, 13, and 16 tell us that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the other Old Testament saints eagerly waited for the city which has the foundations, which is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to these verses, it seems that the New Jerusalem will be for only the Old Testament saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, verses 39 and 40 tell us that the saints in the Old Testament times could not obtain the promise of the city which has the foundations apart from us, the New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hebrews 11, therefore, corresponds with Revelation 21, showing us that the New Jerusalem is a living composition of both the Old Testament saints and New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The bride, the wife of the Lamb, is a living person, and God s tabernacle and temple are also a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This city, therefore, is a corporate person, a living composition of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Just as the church today is not a physical building but a building composed of living persons, in the same principle the New Jerusalem to come will be a living composition of redeemed, regenerated, and transformed persons built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Measured by the Standard of the Divine Nature Mingled with Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 15 says, And he who spoke with me had a golden reed as a measure that he might measure the city and its gates and its wall.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A golden reed was used as the measure.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The measuring instrument was in the form of a reed, but its nature and material was gold.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we have seen, gold signifies the divine nature of God, but what is a reed?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Isaiah 42:3 and Matthew 12:20 speak of the Lord Jesus, saying, A bruised reed He will not break, and in Matthew 11:7 Jesus spoke to the crowds concerning John the Baptist, saying, What did you go out into the wilderness to look at?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A reed shaken by the wind?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to these verses, a reed signifies humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The golden reed, therefore, signifies the divine nature in human form as the standard of the measurement of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since the entire New Jerusalem is the manifestation of the divine nature in humanity, it is in harmony with the measure of the golden reed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The city is measured not by gold alone nor by a reed alone, but by a golden reed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that it has not only the divine nature and not only humanity, but the divine nature and humanity mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church is the mingling of God with man, that is, the divine nature in the human form.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A brother may be a typical American with a typical human life, living, and form, but he can still be full of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the principle of the golden reed, something human in form but divine in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today some believers seem to have the gold only without the reed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It seems that they are no longer human.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If someone has no more human form, he has become like the monks in Buddhism or the nuns in Roman Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What kind of creature is this?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The four living creatures in Revelation 4 have only the face of a lion, the face of a calf, the face of a man, and the face of an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Not one has the face of an inhuman monk.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The more truly spiritual we are, the more human we are; the more we become a genuine human.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The sisters, for example, should not be worldly and modern, but neither should they be peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They should be as human as God created them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the significance of the golden reed the divine nature manifested in the human form.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If the brothers and sisters among us are peculiar and so spiritual that they are not truly spiritual, the church will be strange.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The brothers may be so spiritual that they do not know how to be fathers, and the sisters may be so spiritual that they do not know how to be wives.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They may say it is too human to be a husband or wife; they think that they should be divine and not human.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not think that such a church is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is not a wonderful church; it is a peculiar church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It can only be measured by the gold but not by a golden reed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How much is the Lord expressed in a full way among us in our living as wives, husbands, students, teachers, and businessmen?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No Christian should be a monk or nun; everyone should be very human.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All the fathers, mothers, children, in-laws, brothers, sisters, students, teachers, businessmen, and laborers must be very human, yet full of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They must have the divine nature expressed in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is according to the measure of the golden reed in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When I was a young student in college, I did not want to be human in any aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I did not want to be like ordinary people in the way I cut my hair or in the clothes and shoes I wore.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I thought that the more peculiar I was, the more spiritual I would be.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Eventually other people did not know what kind of creature I was.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Later I was adjusted by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I realized that this was not spirituality but peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>True spirituality is the divine nature manifested in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Consider the Lord Jesus while He was on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>With Him there was nothing peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He was very ordinary in His human life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is the divine nature manifested in the human life as the measure of the holy city.</S>
