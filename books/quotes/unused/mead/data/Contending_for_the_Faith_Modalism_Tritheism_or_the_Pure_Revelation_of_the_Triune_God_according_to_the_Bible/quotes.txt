[1]  According to the modalistic concept of the Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not equally and eternally co-existent, but are merely three successive manifestations of God, or three temporary modes of His activity.
[2]  Rather, it claims that the Father, Son, and Spirit are either temporary or successive roles adopted by God in carrying out the divine plan of redemption and that they in no way correspond to anything in the ultimate nature of the Godhead.
[3]  2 For the modalists, the Father, Son, and Spirit only refer to the way in which God reveals Himself, but bear no relation to His inner being.
[4]  As a sharp contrast to modalism, tritheism is the belief in three Gods, especially in the doctrine that the three Persons of the Trinity are three distinct Gods.
[5]  Even today, some say that the Father is one God, that the Son is one God, and that the Spirit is also one God.
[6]  330-395 was attacked both for being modalistic and also for being tritheistic, depending upon what Scriptures he used in expounding the incomprehensible mystery of the Triune God.
[7]  Athenagoras was a second century philosopher who set out to write against the Christians.
[8]  However, studying the Scriptures in order to carry on the contest with greater accuracy, he himself was caught by the Spirit.
[9]  The one ambition that urges us Christians on is the desire to know the true God and the Word that is from Him what is the unity of the Son with the Father, what is the fellowship of the Father with the Son, what is the Spirit; what is the unity of these mighty Powers; and the distinction that exists between them, united as they are the Spirit, the Son, the Father.
[10]  Modalism takes one aspect of the truth that there is only one unique God and pushes it to a heretical extreme; tritheism, on the contrary, takes another aspect of the truth of God's revelation that He is one-in-three and pushes it to the opposite heretical extreme.
[11]  Before we come to the revelation of the Triune God contained in the Bible, we need to stress a very important point: Our stand with respect to the Triune God is the Holy Scriptures, not according to traditional interpretations, but according to the pure Word of God.
[12]  The Scriptures unfold two aspects of the revelation of the Triune God the aspect of the Three being one and the aspect of the One being three.
[13]  John 1:1 says, "The Word was with God," and it also says, "The Word was God."
[14]  Coming to the New Testament, we see that 1 Corinthians 8:4 says, "There is no God but one"; that Romans 3:30 says, "If indeed God is one, who will justify the circumcision out of faith"; that Galatians 3:20 says, "God is one"; and that 1 Timothy 2:5 says, "There is one God."
[15]  The threefold distinction in God, which is expressed by the word Trinity,' is the attempt of man to conceive and express the meaning of the Infinite God in the terms of Jesus Christ, and we believe that the use of the phrase, The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,' is the very best rendering of the mystery that can be given.
[16]  The modalistic doctrine that the Father, Son, and Spirit do not co-exist equally from eternity to eternity but are merely three temporary manifestations of the one Person of God is easily disproved from the clear statements of the pure Word of God.
[17]  The Bible reveals that all Three the Father, Son, and Spirit are God.
[18]  That the Son is God is proved by Hebrews 1:8 where the Son is addressed as God.
[19]  That the Spirit is God is proved by Acts 5:3-4 which says that Ananias, in lying to the Holy Spirit, actually lied to God.
[20]  The simultaneous existence of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is also proved by John 14:16-17, where the Lord says that He, the Son, will pray the Father, who will give us another Comforter, the Spirit of truth.
[21]  The same is also clearly revealed in Ephesians 3:16-17, where Paul prays that the Father will strengthen us through His Spirit that Christ may make His home in our hearts; in 1 Corinthians 12:4-6, which speaks of "the same Spirit," "the same Lord," and "the same God"; in 2 Corinthians 13:14, where we read that the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit all Three are with us at the same time; and in Revelation 1:4-5, where grace and peace come simultaneously from God, the Spirit, and Christ.
[22]  The Bible declares that all Three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one.
[23]  In this verse we see two lines: that the child is called the Mighty God, and that the Son is called the Everlasting Father.
[24]  In John 14:8-11 we see that the Father is in the Son, that the Son is in the Father, that the Father dwells in the Son, and that he who sees the Son sees the Father.
[25]  GOD'S INTENTION IN REVEALING HIMSELF AS THE UNIQUE TRIUNE GOD
[26]  After this consideration of the pure revelation of the Triune God according to the Bible, it should be evident to any fair-minded reader that the biblical revelation of the Triune God is twofold: He is the Three being one, and He is the One being three.
