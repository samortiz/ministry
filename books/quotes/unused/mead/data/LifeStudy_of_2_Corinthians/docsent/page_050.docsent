   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE NINETEEN COMPETENT OF CHRIST AS THE ALPHABET</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO WRITE LIVING LETTERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF THE LIVING GOD 1 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:3-6</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the book of 2 Corinthians, a very deep book, Paul presents himself as a pattern of living Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this Epistle Paul presents us his living, the way he lives.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul s life is a pattern for all Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was a young Christian, I heard again and again that Christ is our example and that we should imitate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I was also taught that the Apostle Paul is an example for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1 Timothy 1:15 and 16 Paul says that he was the greatest sinner, the chief of sinners, but he received mercy in order to become an example, a pattern, for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, I never heard that in 2 Corinthians Paul presents himself as a pattern of living Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul is a pattern not only of living Christ, but of living Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As God s new creation, we are destined to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, we are to live Christ not merely for salvation, spirituality, power, or evangelical work, but for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To live Christ for the church is the destiny God has appointed to His new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>JUSTIFICATION UNTO LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The matter of living Christ for the church is something that has been lost and that needs to be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the time of the Reformation, Martin Luther recovered justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By God s grace, Luther was willing to risk his life for the recovery of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Justification by faith in an objective way can be compared to the skin of a chicken; it is not the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to Romans and Galatians, justification by faith must have a result.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These books reveal that justification by faith is unto life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that justification is with a view to life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It should not stand by itself; rather, it must result in life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Caspar Schwenckfeld saw that justification must result in life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He may be regarded as one who touched not only the skin of the revelation in the Bible, but also began to see the meat under the skin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One day I was very surprised to learn that Schwenckfeld used some of the expressions we use today to speak of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He even spoke of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>My point in referring to Luther and Schwenckfeld is to say that the Lord wants to recover not only the skin, that is, certain fundamental doctrines; He also wants to recover the meat under the skin of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CHRIST AS OUR NOURISHING PORTION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In message seventeen of this Life-study I pointed out that the truths of the Bible can be compared to the feathers, skin, and meat of a chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In reading 1 Corinthians 1, for example, we may pay attention to the feathers and neglect the skin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1 Corinthians 1:12 Paul says, Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this verse we have feathers, not meat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Readers of 1 Corinthians 1 often pay attention to the feathers in this verse; however, they neglect the meat in verse 9.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There Paul says, God is faithful, through Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many read 1 Corinthians 1 without paying adequate attention to this verse and to the meat contained in it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Others may study this verse, but without an adequate understanding of the word fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They may think that to have fellowship with the Son is merely to contact the Son of God in a prayerful way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not many believers realize that the fellowship of the Son refers to the enjoyment of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Son of God here is rich meat to be our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The thought of enjoying the Lord as rich, nourishing meat is found in Luke 15.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the parable of the prodigal son, the prodigal repented and came back home.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The father received him and had the best robe put upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some Bible teachers use this parable to teach that salvation is by grace, not by works.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The son planned to tell the father to make him like one of the hired servants.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The father, however, interrupted him and told the servants to put the best robe upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This robe signifies Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We received this robe not by our working, but by grace, the free gift, of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I myself preached gospel messages from Luke 15 emphasizing this point.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But there is more in this parable than the robe.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is the fatted calf.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The robe can be likened to the skin, and the fatted calf to the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For years, I preached a robe gospel, that is, the message that salvation is by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But eventually I came to see that Luke 15 also speaks of the fatted calf.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The robe is outward; it is something that covers us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The fatted calf is related to something inward; it is food for nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After I saw this, I began to preach the gospel in a somewhat different way, emphasizing the fatted calf as well as the robe.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, certain ones who saw only the robe and not the fatted calf, only the skin and not the meat, were not happy with this kind of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They did not agree with the teaching concerning the eating of the fatted calf.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sometimes in my preaching from Luke 15 I said that the prodigal son repented and returned not because his clothes were dirty but because of hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The son came back home because he was hungry, so hungry that he was even willing to feed on the husks that were given to swine.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Luke 15:17 says of the prodigal, And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, he resolved: I will arise and go to my father v. 18 . He did not say to himself that in his father s house were many robes.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>No, he remembered that there was bread enough and to spare.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Instead of remaining where he was and starving to death, he decided to return home.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Suppose the father had said, Poor son, you look like a beggar.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I ll tell the servants to get the robe I have prepared for you and put it on you so that you may have a proper appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If the father had provided only a robe to cover him, the son might have said, Father, I m hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You are satisfied with the robe, but I need something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Please give me some food.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The father, however, did not care only for the robe.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After telling the servants to bring forth the best robe, the father said, And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry v. 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Furthermore, the elder son was jealous not because of the robe, but because of the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He complained to his father: Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment; and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends v. 29 . The elder son did not say that the prodigal son had the best robe.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He was jealous because the fatted calf had been prepared for his younger brother.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In certain points the teaching in the Lord s recovery is different from that common among today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Some who care only for the robe and not for the fatted calf go so far as to say that our teaching is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the recovery we have both the robe and the fatted calf.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Luther recovered the robe, but now we are also enjoying the recovery of the fatted calf.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>By the Lord s mercy we are in His recovery enjoying Christ, the fatted calf, as our rich, nourishing portion.</S>
