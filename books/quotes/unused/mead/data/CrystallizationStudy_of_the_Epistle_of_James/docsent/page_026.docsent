   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>on the Positive Side</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the New Testament, whenever God's economy is mentioned, its application is always on the positive side for the heading up of all things in Christ Eph 1:10 , for the ministering of the unsearchable riches of Christ to God's chosen people for the producing of the church Eph 3:8-10 , and for the unique teaching of the New Testament, the stress and the center of which are Christ, the church as the organic Body of Christ, and the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God's eternal economy 1 Tim 1:3-4 .</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord said that anyone who wants to follow Him should deny himself his soul and take up his cross, indicating that the self or the soul of the Lord's followers should be denied by being crucified with Him that they could live not by themselves but by Christ as their life Matt 16:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. In the Christian Life It Should No Longer</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Be Our Old Crucified "I" That Lives</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>but Christ Who Lives in Us</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me," indicating that the old "I" of the believers has been crucified, crossed out; in the Christian life it should no longer be their old crucified "I" that lives but Christ who lives in them Gal 2:20 .</S>
