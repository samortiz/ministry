   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE ONE THING, THE UNIQUE THING,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The one thing that should be focused on, stressed, and ministered in the Lord s recovery is the New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s New Testament economy is the thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The content of the New Testament economy of God is a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the chart on pages 22 and 23 there are three sections concerning this wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, this Person is the Son with the Father by the Spirit in the first four books of the New Testament, the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the second section of God s New Testament economy is the Spirit, as the Son, with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This section covers the twenty-two books from Acts through Jude.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The last section of God s New Testament economy is covered by the final book of the New Testament, Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Revelation are the seven Spirits, out from the eternal One of the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Over the last sixty years the Lord, by His mercy, has opened up His holy Word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have studied the Bible thoroughly and we have read the leading classical Christian writings, including the church fathers writings, church history, Christian biographies, and the central messages given by the spiritual giants.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first thing we saw was the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I consider the fifty-one messages I gave on God s New Testament economy in 1984 as a consummation of what the Lord has shown us in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I would like to present a brief conclusion of all the things that the Lord has shown us through these past sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE TRIUNE GOD EMBODIED,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>REALIZED, AND CONSUMMATED</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first aspect of the vision of the Lord s recovery is concerning the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Triune God is embodied in the Son, Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our Savior, Christ Jesus, is nothing less than the very embodiment, not only of the Father, but of the entire God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Colossians 2:9 says, For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Godhead is the very divine Trinity, comprising the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our Savior, Jesus Christ, is the very embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This wonderful Christ, who is the embodiment of the divine Trinity, is realized by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In John 14 the embodiment of God tells us that He would ask the Father to send another Comforter v. 16 . This another Comforter is the very realization of the embodiment of God, so He is called the Spirit of reality v. 17 . He is the realization of the Lord Jesus Christ who is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In John 16:13-15 the embodiment of the Triune God, Jesus, tells us clearly that in the divine Trinity whatever the Father is and has is embodied in the Son, whatever the Son is and has is received by the Spirit, and whatever the Spirit receives is disclosed to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Triune God is embodied in the Son and this embodiment is realized by the Spirit who is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The processed Triune God is ultimately consummated in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The all-inclusive Spirit as the realization of Christ and as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaches us in two ways: in the essential way He comes into us and in the economical way He comes upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the first aspect of the vision in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow to reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without a flow, the river can never reach anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With a flow there will surely be a reaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Spirit reaches us, the entire God reaches us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This reaching is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God in our experience of His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Triune God is dispensing Himself into us by the Father being embodied in the Son and the Son being realized by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Spirit becomes the very reaching to us of the Triune God as His consummation for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE SEVEN MAJOR PROCESSES OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>TO PRODUCE THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the second point of the vision we have received of the Lord, the Triune God has gone through seven major processes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Son is the embodiment of God, the Spirit is the realization of the Son, and the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the divine Trinity by seven major steps taken by the processed Triune God: incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, the breathing of the life-giving Spirit into His chosen people, ascension, and the pouring out of Himself as the consummated Spirit upon His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By these seven steps the Triune God, being embodied, realized, and consummated, is dispensed into us for the producing of a unique thing in this universe the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With the eternal God, there is no element of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With Him the Body has already been produced.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Triune God consummated in the all-inclusive Spirit is in the Body, and as such a Spirit He is upon the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all need to see this great vision.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By God being embodied, realized, and consummated through these seven steps, the Triune God has been dispensed into His chosen people who have been regenerated and built up together to form the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This Body is carrying out one thing the propagation of the processed and consummated Triune God through the gospel for the increase of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The New Testament says that the Word who was God became flesh John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The entire God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Triune God was in the womb of a human virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Triune God was a babe born and put into a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No wonder Isaiah 9:6 tells us that a child is born to us whose name is the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The mighty God is the entire God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Triune God was living in a carpenter s home for thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>While Jesus, the embodiment of the Triune God, was being crucified on the cross, essentially speaking the Triune God was passing through death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There are some strong implications in the New Testament which show us that while Jesus was dying on the cross, the Triune God was going through death Acts 20:28; 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What was accomplished by His wonderful death is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This wonderful One died on the cross with at least seven qualifications: as the Lamb of God John 1:29 He died to deal with our sin and sins 1 Pet 2:24; Heb 9:26, 28; 1 Cor 15:3 ; as a man in the flesh John 1:14 He died in the form of fallen man, in the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 , to condemn sin in the flesh and deal with the flesh; as the brass serpent John 3:14; Num 21:4-9 He died to bruise the serpent s head Gen 3:15 and to destroy him Heb 2:14 , along with his satanic world John 12:31 , that all His believers may have eternal life John 3:15-16 ; as the last Adam 1 Cor 15:45 , the representative of the old man, He died to crucify our old man Rom 6:6 ; as the Firstborn of all creation Col 1:15 He died on the cross as part of the old creation to terminate the entire old creation; as the Peacemaker Eph 2:14-15 He died to abolish all the ordinances and differences in living, customs, and habits between all kinds of peoples for the creation of the new man; finally, He died as a grain of wheat to release the divine life for His reproduction John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All the negative things were crucified on the cross, through which God, the Triune God, went through death and did something to defeat His enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Colossians 2:14-15 indicates that while Jesus was dying on the cross, the evil angelic powers were struggling to frustrate that death.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But the Triune God stripped them off and gained a victory over them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This wonderful One then entered into resurrection and by this one action He became the life-giving Spirit, which He breathed essentially into His chosen people on the evening of His resurrection John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then He ascended to the heavens to be inaugurated into His universal position as the Head of all things Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He was made both Lord and Christ Acts 2:36 , He was crowned with glory and honor Heb 2:9 , and enthroned and given the kingship Heb 1:3; 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He received all the authority of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then He poured out the economical Spirit, which actually is just Himself as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, upon His chosen ones who had already received Him essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This pouring out of Himself as the wonderful all-inclusive Spirit was the final step for the accomplishment of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we receive this wonderful One, we receive all of the seven major processes He passed through.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We receive His incarnation, His human living, His crucifixion, His resurrection, His breathing of Himself into us as the Spirit, His ascension, and His pouring out of Himself as the wonderful all-inclusive Spirit upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Does He need to become a man again for you?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Does He need to live on this earth for you again?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Does He need to die for you again?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Does He need to resurrect for you again?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Does He need to breathe the Spirit again for you?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Does He need to ascend for you again?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Does He need to pour out the Spirit upon you again?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The answer to these seven questions is all no. We all have to see this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Blessed are they who see such a vision!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>A person who has received such a vision has to be excited.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>My Savior is the embodiment of the entire God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He became a man for me, He lived on this earth for me, He died on the cross for me, He resurrected for me, and He breathed the wonderful Spirit into me before I was born John 20:22; 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He ascended into heaven for me and I ascended with Him before I was born Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Then He poured Himself out upon me as the Spirit before I was born Acts 2:17-18, 33; 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>These seven wonderful processes are the bequests of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He has bequeathed all of these items as a great blessing of His divine New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>As believers, we have received all of these bequests.</S>
