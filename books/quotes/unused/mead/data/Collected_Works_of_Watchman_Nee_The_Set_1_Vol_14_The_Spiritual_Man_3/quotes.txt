[3]  SECTION EIGHT THE ANALYSIS OF THE SOUL 2 THE MIND CHAPTER ONE THE MIND A BATTLEFIELD
[4]  The apostle said, "For though we walk in flesh, we do not war according to flesh; for the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful before God for the overthrowing of strongholds, as we overthrow reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ" 2 Cor 10:3-5 .
[5]  After a believer repents, his mind is not completely delivered from Satan's workings.
[6]  As Satan previously worked through the mind, he still works now through the mind.
[7]  If we examine all the experiences in the minds of the believers, we will realize that the minds of the believers are not just narrow; they also have many other sicknesses.
[8]  For example, the mind is affected by thoughts and imaginations that cannot be controlled, filthy pictures, wandering and chaotic recollections, sudden loss of memory, prejudices that come from nowhere, lack of concentration, thoughts that are stagnant and obstructed as if the mind is chained, or fanatical thoughts that turn uncontrollably.
[9]  Why are the believers' minds so attacked by evil spirits?
[10]  One answer is that the believers themselves afford evil spirits also called demons an opportunity to attack in their minds.
[11]  All sins arise when one gives ground to evil spirits.
[12]  When a believer pays attention to sin in his mind, it means he has loaned his mind to the evil spirits because all sins come from evil spirits.
[13]  If we misconstrue the efforts of evil spirits in us, in our environment, and in our work by considering them to be natural, obvious, spontaneous, or caused by ourselves, we have given ground to evil spirits and allowed them to continue their works in these matters.
[14]  God created a mind for man; it was not meant to fall into disuse.
[15]  From the beginning God wanted man to hear the word and understand it Matt 13:23 .
[16]  Evil spirits know that when the believer's mind is empty, he will not be able to think and will lose his reason and sense and will indiscriminately accept the "teachings" of evil spirits.
[17]  Little do they realize that when they do not use their minds, God does not use their minds either, and He does not give them His thoughts, because His principle is that man would use his own will to control his own faculties and co-labor with Him.
[18]  Any ground given by the believers to evil spirits induces the work of evil spirits.
[19]  There is another matter that we should know about: the condition for evil spirits to work.
[20]  One thing is certain if only the believers can remember this one thing : there is a basic difference between the work of evil spirits and the work of the Holy Spirit.
[21]  Only when a man fulfills the condition for the working of the Holy Spirit will the Holy Spirit work.
[22]  Therefore, an ordinary believer need not be concerned if he cannot distinguish between something from God and something that counterfeits God; he only needs to examine the conditions under which he received these things initially.
[23]  If he initially fulfilled the conditions for the working of evil spirits, even though he was outwardly pursuing the Holy Spirit, what he has received must be from the evil spirits.
[24]  This is because "the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets" v. 32 . Is this the case with tongue-speakers today? Is it not true that they have completely lost control of themselves and are completely ignorant of what they are doing? Is it not true that the spirits of the prophets are not subject to the prophets, and instead that the prophets are subject to the spirits? Here we can see the basic distinction between what is from God and what is from demons.
[25]  Without realizing it, they have allowed evil spirits to come in and occupy their minds.
[26]  Now we want to briefly see a mind that is under the attack of evil spirits.
[27]  Evil spirits are not only able to inject thoughts into the believer's mind, but they can also form different kinds of pictures in his mind.
[28]  Some of these pictures are very clean and good, which the believer likes.
[29]  Whether it is something good or bad, something the believer likes or abhors, he has no power to stop these pictures from coming into his own mind.
[30]  A believer should realize that everything that is not produced by his own mind is given to him by supernatural spirits.
[31]  Because of the attack of evil spirits, many believers lose their original power of memory and often have the phenomenon of forgetfulness.
[32]  Words just spoken are forgotten in an instant, work just done is forgotten in an hour, things just put down are forgotten before the day is over, and things just promised are forgotten in a moment.
[33]  The believer acts like a man without a mind; nothing seems to be retained in his mind.
[34]  Little does he realize that this is due to the disturbance of evil spirits in his mind.
[35]  After the believer's mind is controlled by evil spirits, his thoughts become entirely undependable because he is responsible for very few of his own thoughts.
[36]  Most of the thoughts are generated by evil spirits in his mind.
[37]  It is very easy at such a moment for evil spirits to give the believer one kind of thought at one time and give him a completely opposite kind of thought at another time.
[38]  After a believer's mind has fallen into passivity and been occupied by evil spirits, he will never listen to the explanation or evidence of others in any matter in which he has already made a decision.
[39]  If others try to explain something more to him, he will think that they are invading his freedom.
[40]  When the mind of a believer has fallen into the condition mentioned in the preceding chapter, he should seek the way of deliverance.
[41]  Since the extent of each one's passivity is different, the extent of the attack by the evil spirits is different; therefore, the extent of the mind's torment is also different.
[42]  Evil spirits will tell the believer, "Your sudden and good thought is of God...these sudden revelations are the result of being spiritual...your bad memory is caused by something in your physical body...your sudden forgetfulness is natural...oversensitivity is a matter of disposition...a weak memory is hereditary...insomnia is an illness...you are tired...your inability to think is the result of overwork...you cannot stop thinking at night because you have used your mind too much during the day...unclean thoughts come from the sins that you have committed...your inability to listen to others is because of differences in the environment...the blame is altogether on others."
[43]  Indeed, the flesh is always the co-worker of the devil!
[44]  They will cause the believer to think that he can prevent his mind from being occupied by the devil.
[45]  They will tell the believer that he can no longer be free, that he has already fallen too deep into passivity, that God is no longer willing to grant mercy, that it is best if he does not resist, allowing the situation to remain as it is, and that there will never be a day when he will be delivered.
[46]  When the believer understands the reality of the situation, when he knows that his own mind has never been completely free from the bondage of the powers of darkness, and when he knows that he should fight against evil spirits to break down all their strongholds, he will see that the weapons for this warfare must be spiritual.
[47]  We have previously mentioned that evil spirits are able to work in the mind of the believer because he has given them the ground.
[48]  If we sum up these six items, they can be classified into three main groups: 1 the unrenewed mind, 2 accepting or believing in the lies of evil spirits, and 3 a state of passivity.
[49]  The believer must carefully examine what kind of ground he has given to evil spirits and what has led him to his present condition.
[50]  When a believer carries out an examination in the light of God, he will see that in the past he accepted countless lies from evil spirits.
[51]  1 Sometimes he misunderstood God's truth by believing in the lies of evil spirits which resulted in a wrong attitude and behavior.
[52]  2 Sometimes he believed the words which the evil spirits directly spoke to him about his physical health and other matters related to him; consequently, his body and these matters responded according to what the evil spirits told him.
[53]  To understand his own normal condition, the believer must first acknowledge and believe that he has a normal condition.
[54]  Although he has fallen today, he surely had a standard that he experienced before he fell.
[55]  If the believer finds it hard to establish what his proper condition is, he should recall the period of time in his life when his spirit, or soul, or body was "at its best."
[56]  After the believer has regained the ground step by step in this way, a result will gradually be manifested.
[57]  However, after the believer insists on regaining all the ground, he will see evil spirits gradually losing their power, and that they are no longer able to do anything.
[58]  When a believer's mind has reached the point of being renewed, he will marvel at the capability of his mind.
[59]  The believer's concentration is more intensified, his understanding sharper, his memory stronger, his reasoning more precise, his eyesight farther, his work speedier, and his thoughts broader.
[60]  If we analyze the process of the walk of a spiritual believer, it may be divided into the following steps: the Holy Spirit reveals and makes known the will of God to the spirit of a believer; the believer realizes the meaning of this revelation through his mind and then exercises the power of his spirit through the will to move his body to execute this matter.
[61]  The more spiritual a believer is, the more he knows about the importance of walking according to the spirit and the danger of walking according to the flesh.
[62]  Besides revealing the truth directly to us, God often in fact most of the time conveys the truth to us through His other children.
[63]  This kind of truth is first accepted by our mind, and then it reaches our spirit.
[64]  When the mind is working, believers should be careful not to let it work alone.
[65]  This means that it should not work apart from the ruling of the spirit.
[66]  When the mind does not hold its own opinion, it helps the believers know the will of God more clearly.
[67]  This kind of independent action of the mind is very dangerous because this kind of knowledge will just provide more information to one's mind for his thinking and more of a basis for his boasting; however, it will have no effect at all on his life.
[68]  SECTION NINE THE ANALYSIS OF THE SOUL 3 THE WILL CHAPTER ONE THE BELIEVER'S WILL
[69]  Man's will is the organ with which man makes decisions.
[70]  Our willingness or unwillingness, our wanting or not wanting, and our deciding or not deciding are all the functions of our will.
[71]  If man is not saved, his will may aspire for the high things; it may be toward good and toward God, but it is still useless because in God's eyes it is not a matter of how the fallen will wants to work for Him, but a matter of how He wants man to work for Him.
[72]  Salvation is nothing other than God saving man out of himself and into God.
[73]  Although God's children are saved, they have not fully obeyed God's will.
[74]  As a result, God has to use many ways to lead the believers into full submission.
[75]  God moves the believers with His Spirit and stirs them up with His love so that they will submit to His will and not love, pursue, or do anything outside of Himself.
[76]  These two kinds of knowledge are: 1 the condition for evil spirits to work, and 2 the principle of spiritual life.
[77]  Because of ignorance, Satan and his evil spirits are given the greatest advantage, and the church of God experiences the greatest suffering.
[78]  What is the condition for evil spirits to attach themselves to man?
[79]  What must man do before he will be possessed by evil spirits?
[80]  If a believer gives place to evil spirits, relying on the notion that he will not be possessed because he is a Christian, he has already been deeply deceived by evil spirits.
[81]  When a believer has fallen deeply into passivity, he may think that he is submissive to God.
[82]  But he does not realize that evil spirits are utilizing his passive state to accomplish their deceit.
[83]  The believer thinks he must be very passive before he can truly submit to God and before he can be truly in union with God in his will.
[84]  However, if the believer does not know that passivity affords convenience to the evil spirits and does not know that spiritual life requires an active will to work with God, he may allow his will to become passive.
[85]  Because the believers are so ignorant, they are deceived by the power of darkness and unconsciously taken in by Satan's deceit.
[86]  We should note the order in this matter because it is very crucial: 1 the believer becomes ignorant, 2 he is deceived, 3 he becomes passive, and 4 he becomes demon-possessed.
[87]  When he is deceived by evil spirits, he thinks that his entire being should be passive in order for God to live and work through him.
[88]  3 If the believer misreads these activities and does not know that they come from the devil, he will give more place to the evil spirits because he has already believed their lies.
[89]  The authorities of darkness know the present condition of the believer.
[90]  They fashion many difficulties in the believer's environment to persistently bother him.
[91]  Once the believer's will becomes passive and unable to work, evil spirits will put him in a position where he is forced to use his will, in order to discourage him and make him a laughingstock in front of others.
[92]  At this time, the believer becomes a caged bird, and the evil spirits are like naughty children, teasing him as much as they desire.
[93]  At such times, he can 1 believe in evil spirits, 2 rely on them, 3 obey them, 4 consecrate himself to them, 5 listen to them, 6 pray to them, 7 be led and guided by them, 8 accept their message, 9 accept the Scriptures given by them, 10 work with them, 11 work for them, 12 assist them in accomplishing their heart's desires and work, while still thinking that he is turning to God and that he is for God.
[94]  The believer should know that if he does not communicate with God according to the condition of fellowship, but rather communicates according to the condition of demon-possession, his prayer will be a prayer to evil spirits, his consecration will be a consecration to evil spirits, and his trust will be a trust in evil spirits.
[95]  When man does not move and God does not move, evil spirits will move in. The believer should know that after he clearly understands God's will in the intuition of his spirit, his entire being has to rise up to carry out God's will in an active way; he must not be passive.
[96]  A double personality means that there are two personalities or two masters within a man.
[97]  We should not have a misconception that believers who are deceived by evil spirits are very defiled, degenerate, and sinful.
[98]  We need to realize that these believers have completely consecrated themselves to God and are actually more advanced than ordinary believers.
[99]  Because they have wholly consecrated themselves to the Lord but do not know how to cooperate with God, they fall into passivity.
[100]  They may give ground to evil spirits in other matters, but in the matter of obeying God's will, they will not give the ground of passivity to evil spirits.
[101]  If a believer acquires knowledge and thereby realizes that evil spirits love to have and need to have man's passivity before they can work, he will not possibly allow himself to fall into passivity and, consequently, afford evil spirits an opportunity to work.
[102]  The passivity of many believers is due to a misunderstanding of the truth of "dying with Christ."
[103]  The apostle said, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God" Gal 2:20 .
[104]  After a believer accepts the misunderstanding concerning dying with Christ and allows himself to fall into passivity 1 he will no longer be active, 2 God will no longer use him either, because this would go against the principle of His working; and 3 evil spirits will seize the opportunity to attach themselves to him because this situation fits the condition for evil spirits to work.
[105]  If a believer thinks that he should annihilate the existence of his person, that he should not think, feel, or have an opinion, or that he should not have any movement of the body, but instead that he should live his life in a dream, both day and night, without any knowledge of where he is, he will be possessed.
[106]  "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure" Phil 2:13 .
[107]  A believer may think that only God is the One who wills and works, that God puts the willing and the working into him, and that God wills for him and works for him.
[108]  These believers do not know that this verse means that God will only work within us to the extent that we are willing to will and work.
[109]  As a consequence of this action: 1 the believer does not use his own will; 2 God also does not use His will to make any proposal for him, because He wants the believer to actively co-labor with Him; 3 evil spirits take the opportunity to seize his passive will and act on his behalf so that he either becomes paralyzed, without any progress, or burns with the "fire of demons"; and 4 at this time, the believer may think that God is thinking for him.
[110]  There are many believers who have fallen into passivity and possession because of their ignorance of the work of the Holy Spirit.
[111]  The apostle told us in a preceding verse v. 29 that we should "obey God." If the believer takes the Holy Spirit as his object of obedience and forgets God the Father, he will be led to follow a spirit within him or around him and not obey the Father in heaven through the Holy Spirit.
[112]  We have said in another place that God disciplines our spirit through the Holy Spirit and that our spirit governs our body, our entire being, through our soul i.e., will .
[113]  A casual glance at this word does not seem to reveal anything of importance, yet the spiritual relationship it implies is very crucial.
[114]  The consequences of this action are: 1 the believer himself does not speak; 2 neither does God speak, because God does not regard man as a recorder; and 3 evil spirits utilize the believer's passivity to speak through his mouth.
[115]  "But the Comforter...will...remind you of all the things which I have said to you" John 14:26 .
[116]  The believer does not realize that the meaning of this word is that the Holy Spirit will enlighten his mind to cause him to remember the Lord's words.
[117]  He assumes it means that he does not need to use his memory anymore and that God will make him remember everything.
[118]  The consequences are: 1 the believer does not exercise his will to use his memory; 2 God does not use it either, because there is no one to cooperate with Him; and 3 evil spirits come in and display everything that is expedient for themselves in front of him, so that he cannot refuse them.
[119]  The results are: 1 the believers themselves do not love; 2 God will not negate man or the natural function of his love; He will not give man a supernatural love; and 3 evil spirits will live on behalf of man and express their love and hatred according to their will.
[120]  Because the believer is totally consecrated, he thinks that he should take the way of the cross and suffer for the sake of Christ.
[121]  He also thinks that his natural life is of no use.
[122]  He wants to receive power from God, so he willingly becomes weak, hoping that by so doing, he will become strong.
[123]  Both suffering and weakness are pleasing to God, yet both can become the basis for evil spirits to work through the believer's misunderstanding.
[124]  He does not realize that he must explicitly exercise his will to choose what God wants him to choose and withstand everything that the evil spirits give to him.
[125]  He may not realize that his suffering is the result of his fulfillment of the condition for evil spirits to work and that his suffering does not come from God.
[126]  Now we should be thoroughly clear about the fundamental difference between the principle of God's work on us and that of Satan's work on us: 1 God wants the believer to exercise every faculty of his entire being through his own will, cooperating with God to the point of being filled with the Holy Spirit.
[127]  A consecrated believer can fall into passivity in a foolish and deceived way for several years and still be ignorant of the danger of his own position.
[128]  He can become more and more passive as time passes, until the sphere of passivity becomes so great that it inflicts unspeakable pain to his mind, emotion, body, and environment.
[129]  Therefore, if a believer wants freedom, he must eliminate his foolishness.
[130]  If a believer is not willing to be faithful to all the truth of God, it will be very hard for him to accept the truth that will cause him to suffer and be humbled.
[131]  While we can say with certainty that a believer can give ground to evil spirits, we need to ask what the ground is.
[132]  Before a believer asks what ground he has inside, he should first study what is a ground.
[133]  Otherwise, he will consider demon-possession to be something that it is not, or something that is not demon-possession to be demon-possession.
[134]  In addition to the matter of sins, a believer should realize that he allows his will to become passive whenever he accepts the counterfeit of evil spirits, and he gives ground to evil spirits whenever he believes in their injected thoughts.
[135]  There is one common principle that underlies all the ground given to the evil spirits.
[136]  Once a believer, who has suffered from evil spirits, becomes enlightened by the truth and stirred up by the Holy Spirit, he will no longer be able to bear the continuous attachment of evil spirits.
[137]  When the believer reclaims the ground with his will, his life will experience a new beginning.
[138]  He can reclaim all the things that he offered to evil spirits.
[139]  Now the believer has to choose whether he will remain passive, allowing evil spirits to continually move him.
[140]  If he is unwilling to let evil spirits use him in this way, even though he is temporarily unable to "determine" anything, he will not allow evil spirits to use his power of determination.
[141]  Hence, if the believer wants to be free, the will needs to rise up to: 1 oppose the rule of evil spirits, 2 recover the lost ground, and 3 work actively together with God and exercise his own entire being.
[142]  We should understand God's way of leading as well as the relationship between man's will and God's will.
[143]  We must realize that a believer's submission to God should be unconditional.
[144]  If a believer desires to obey God, he must go through the following steps: 1 he must resolve to obey God's will John 7:17 ; 2 he must receive the revelation concerning God's will through his intuition Eph 5:17 ; 3 he must be strengthened by God to resolve to carry it out Phil 2:13 ; and 4 he must be strengthened by God to execute it Phil 2:13 .
[145]  SECTION TEN THE BODY CHAPTER ONE THE BELIEVER AND HIS BODY
[146]  We need to know how God views the position of the body.
[147]  No one can deny that there is a relationship between the body and the spiritual life.
[148]  Although the intuition, fellowship, and conscience of our spirit may be very healthy, and although the mind, emotion, and will of our soul may be renewed, we have not become a spiritual man if our outward body is not healthy and renewed in accordance with our spirit and soul.
[149]  We have already seen how our bodies are dead.
[150]  Although the shell is not dead, it is heading toward the tomb.
[151]  Although humanly speaking, the body has life, God regards that life as death because it is full of sins.
[152]  The apostle's words "so then" connect this verse with the preceding text.
[153]  Verse 10 speaks of the body being dead, and verse 11 speaks of the Holy Spirit giving life to the body.
[154]  1 Since the body is dead because of sin, we must not live according to it; otherwise, we will sin.
[155]  2 Since the Holy Spirit has given life to our mortal bodies, we do not need to live according to the flesh, because our flesh has no authority to bind our spiritual life anymore.
[156]  First Corinthians 6:12 through 20 adds considerable light to the matter of the believers' body.
[157]  In other words, there are many things, humanly speaking, that a believer can do related to his body but may choose not to do because he belongs to the Lord and wants to glorify God.
[158]  It seems as if God has not provided anything for their body, that all of Christ's salvation is limited to the spirit and soul, and that the body has no share whatsoever in it.
[159]  They do not pay any attention to the fact that the Lord Jesus healed the sick when He was on the earth, and the apostles continued to experience the power of healing.
[160]  If a believer thinks that God and His Spirit communicate with him through his body, he may expect God and His Spirit to communicate with him through his body.
[161]  Every sin which a man may do is outside the body, but he who commits fornication sins against his own body."
[162]  The first "do you not know" v. 15 refers to "the body is...for the Lord." The second "do you not know" refers to "the Lord is also for the body." In 1 Corinthians 3:16 the apostle already told us that "you are the temple of God." But now he specifically says, "Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit." This means that the residence of the Holy Spirit expands from the spirit to the body.
[163]  Sickness is the most commonly encountered thing in the human life.
[164]  If we want to know the way to preserve our body in a condition that glorifies God, we must know the attitude that we should have toward sickness, how to utilize our sickness, and how to have our sickness healed.
[165]  Since sickness is so common, we will inevitably have a great lack in our lives if we do not know how to deal with it.
[166]  We have seen something concerning the matter of sickness in a general way.
[167]  All of our bad and hostile environments expose our true condition.
[168]  These environments will not bring out sins that we do not have.
[169]  Because believers love themselves so much and do not deal with God in a basic way, they seek after the healing of earthly medicine when they are sick.
[170]  We will not adamantly say that God never blesses the use of medicine.
[171]  On many occasions God has blessed the use of medicine because He is kind and forgiving.
[172]  Nevertheless, these kinds of believers do not stand on the position of redemption; they simply stand on the same position as the worldly people.
[173]  If a believer is not willing to bow down his head and accept his sickness, and if he cannot acknowledge that God has given him the best, seeking instead for healing outside of God and rebelling against the way He deals with him, He has no choice but to let him become sick again.
[174]  If the believer is not willing to give up his self-love, and if he continues fastidiously to care, nurture, pity, and consider himself, not abandoning himself in God, God will give him more things that will make him pity himself even more.
[175]  There are also some believers who have gone to another extreme.
[176]  We should not let others think that the only way God can subdue a believer is by sickness, and that without sickness, he is incapable of glorifying God in his daily life.
[177]  Paul's word in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 also shows us that prolonged sickness is not God's will.
[178]  The condition of the body should match the spirit and the soul.
[179]  If our spirit and soul become sanctified wholly and preserved complete without blame, but our body is still weak, sick, and full of affliction, God will definitely not be satisfied.
[180]  CHAPTER THREE GOD AS THE LIFE OF THE BODY
[181]  We have previously seen how our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.
[182]  Ordinarily we think that Christ's life is for our spirit and not for our body.
[183]  If God intended for the Holy Spirit to dwell only in our spirit so that only the spirit would benefit, why did the apostle not say, "Your spirit is a temple of the Holy Spirit," rather than saying, "Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit"?
[184]  God never intends for His children to be weak and ill; His will is for them to be healthy and strong.
[185]  He does not want His children to be afflicted with weakness until death.
[186]  Elihu told Job about the punishment of God and its results: "He is chastened also with pain upon his bed,/and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:/so that his life abhorreth bread,/and his soul dainty meat./His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen;/and his bones that were not seen stick out./Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave,/and his life to the destroyers./If there be a messenger with him,/an interpreter, one among a thousand,/to show unto man his uprightness;/then he is gracious unto him, and saith,/Deliver him from going down to the pit:/I have found a ransom./His flesh shall be fresher than a child's:/he shall return to the days of his youth" Job 33:19-25 .
[187]  If we accept the biblical teaching that our body is a member of Christ, we also have to take the teaching that Christ's life flows inside of our body.
[188]  If we fully consecrate ourselves to God, we can believe that He has indeed prepared a body for us.
[189]  We often think that it would have been great if we could have decided how our body was to be formed.
[190]  Our greatest hope is that our body would be free from so many natural defects and that it would have greater resistance so that we could enjoy a longer life without pain and illness.
[191]  When He prepared our body for us, He knew all of its limitations and dangers, intending that we would seek a new body through our painful experiences, one which does not live by our natural strength but by the life of God.
[192]  Some may think that receiving the Lord Jesus as the life of our body means that God conducts a miracle to transfuse a great amount of strength into our body, with the result being that we will no longer suffer or become sick throughout our entire life.
[193]  If we receive the life of the Lord Jesus as the life of our body, our body will be strengthened by the Lord, and our spiritual life will be prosperous because of Him as well.
[194]  According to knowledge, we realized long ago that our body is for the Lord; yet because of our self-will, the Lord has been hindered from saturating us.
[195]  The experience of overcoming death is not rare among the saints.
[196]  Since Christ has overcome death, believers need not feel that they must die, although they still may die.
[197]  Similarly, since Christ has condemned sin in the flesh, believers no longer must sin, although they still may sin.
[198]  Since it is a believer's goal to be free from sin, it should also be his goal to be free from death.
[199]  A believer should understand that as a consequence of the death and resurrection of Christ, his relationship with death is the same as his relationship with sin.
[200]  Unless a believer is clear that his work is finished and that the Lord does not need him to remain on the earth any longer, he should not die; that is, he should always resist death.
[201]  If the symptoms of death have gradually occurred in his body and he knows that his work has not been finished, a believer should completely deny these symptoms and refuse to die.
[202]  He also should believe that the Lord will carry through his resistance because He still has work for him to do.
[203]  To be raptured alive is the last way to overcome death.
[204]  When the Lord Jesus comes back, many believers will be raptured alive.
[205]  The Bible tells us that there is a kind of sin called "a sin unto death" 1 John 5:16 which believers may commit.
[206]  The "death" mentioned here is not spiritual death because God's eternal life will never die.
[207]  Proverbs is a book that deals with the believers' daily walk.
[208]  In the coming kingdom the Lord Jesus will be the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings Mal 4:2 .
