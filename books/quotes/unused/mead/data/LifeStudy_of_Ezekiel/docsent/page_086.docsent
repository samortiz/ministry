   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Number Thirty</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The number thirty, used in relation to the chambers, is composed either of five times six or of three times ten.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If thirty is composed of five times six, we then have man six multiplied by responsibility five .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If thirty is composed of three times ten, then we have the Triune God in resurrection three fulfilling all the requirements ten .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Christ whom we enjoy is the number thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is not merely five or six or three.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the number thirty, He includes six, five, three, and ten.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Him we have man, the Triune God, resurrection, responsibility, and the fulfillment of all the requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The number ten also signifies completion and perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that in Christ we have completeness and perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Praise the Lord that we have such a rich Christ for our enjoyment!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The number thirty here corresponds to the thirty sides of the posts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that our enjoyment of Christ depends on His being the supporting posts, or pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The extent to which He bears, supports, and sustains, is the extent to which we can enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Also, the thirty chambers correspond to the thirty windows.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the all-inclusive Spirit were not of the number thirty, we could not have the rich enjoyment of Christ as the number thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Width of the Pavement</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we consult the diagram of the plot plan, we will see that the width of the pavement equals the length of the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This signifies that the Christ whom we enjoy is the Christ whom we experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How much we can enjoy Christ depends on how much we experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If our experience of Christ measures fifty cubits, then our enjoyment of Christ will also measure fifty cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How much are we able to enjoy Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This depends on how much we experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we pass through Christ, the more we experience Christ, and the more we experience Christ, the more we enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We cannot enjoy Christ if we have Christ only in doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that we cannot enjoy a Christ whom we have not experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can only enjoy the Christ whom we have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The width of our enjoyment of Christ always equals the length of our experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Connected to the Gate</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The pavement is connected to the gate, for it is by the two sides of the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that the enjoyment of Christ is connected to the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do not have the experience of Christ, we cannot have the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Again we see that the enjoyment of Christ depends on the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Boiling Places</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the outer court, at the four corners, are the boiling places.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates that, by God s grace, the preparation of Christ for others enjoyment is spreading to every corner, becoming available everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At every corner there is a kitchen where Christ is being cooked for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Wherever we are, there is a kitchen for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We thank the Lord that the local churches are spreading to every corner of this country.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every corner of the country needs a kitchen to prepare Christ for peoples enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The measurement of the corner chambers is thirty by forty.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus far we have seen four thirties: thirty sides of the posts, thirty windows, thirty chambers, and thirty cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All these thirties are related and correspond to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to pass through Christ and then we have to enjoy a Christ who has been cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here we have a new number forty.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Forty is the number of testing and trials.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The people of Israel were in the wilderness forty years, and the Lord Jesus was in the wilderness forty days in order to be tested and tried.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This indicates that without suffering, testing, and trial, Christ could not have been cooked, prepared, to be our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For our enjoyment Christ was cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His suffering under the process of cooking was for our enjoyment of Him by eating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Apart from the Lord s suffering and trials, He could not have been prepared for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In a sense, when the sisters prepared food in the kitchen, the food suffers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While the Lord Jesus was on earth and especially while He was dying on the cross, He was under the suffering, the cooking, for the sake of our enjoying Him by eating Him.</S>
