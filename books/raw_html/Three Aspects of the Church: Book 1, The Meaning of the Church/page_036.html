<h1 class="title">THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</h1>
<p>The types in the Old Testament concerning the church can be divided into two main categories: women and dwelling places&mdash;the tabernacle, the temple, and a city. The children of Israel connect these two categories.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Children of Israel</h2>
<p>The children of Israel connect two categories because God considers the children of Israel as a corporate woman as well as His habitation. In the Old Testament, God regarded the children of Israel as His spouse, His wife. Such terms can be found in Nehemiah, Ezekiel, and Isaiah. Hence, the children of Israel stand before God in the position of a woman. Moreover, the children of Israel also typify God&rsquo;s habitation because they were corporately God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth. Before God, the children of Israel are not only a woman but also God&rsquo;s habitation. In like manner, the New Jerusalem is both a woman and a habitation (Rev. 21:2).</p>
<p>Ephesians clearly says that the church is Christ&rsquo;s counterpart (5:31-32) and that the church is also God&rsquo;s dwelling place (2:22). In addition, Revelation speaks of the New Jerusalem as the wife of the Lamb (21:2, 9), indicating that the church is God&rsquo;s dwelling place as well as His counterpart. In Old Testament typology, the children of Israel connect the two types concerning the church by being both a woman and a dwelling place. Thus, in the children of Israel we see both a woman and a dwelling place.</p>
<p>In the types of Eve, Rebekah, and the Shulammite, we cannot see the aspect of a dwelling place, and in the types of the tabernacle and the city we cannot see the aspect of a woman. We can see the aspects of a woman and a dwelling place only in the children of Israel. Hence, the type of the children of Israel is complete and whole. With them there is a beginning, a process, and a conclusion. Each of the seven women who are types of the church focus on a particular aspect of the church. In contrast, the children of Israel typify the church in its beginning, its process, and its culmination.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 5 speaks of the Feast of the Passover, indicating that the children of Israel&rsquo;s keeping of the passover typifies the church&rsquo;s corporate keeping of Christ as the reality of the passover. Verse 7 says, &ldquo;Purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened; for our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed.&rdquo; This means that our keeping of the feast is not an individual matter, in which one person keeps the feast today and another keeps it tomorrow; rather, everyone needs to keep the feast at the same time. In God&rsquo;s eyes we all, including the apostles Peter and Paul, keep the feast at the same time.</p>
<p>According to the type of the passover, it is not that one Israelite would repent, kill a lamb, and keep the passover on the first day of the first month, while another would repent, kill a lamb, and keep the passover on the fourteenth day of the same month. Instead, all God&rsquo;s people kept the passover at the same time on the same day. Hence, 1 Corinthians 5 speaks of the church corporately keeping the feast; it does not speak of individual salvation.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 10 also speaks of the processes through which the Israelites passed. Their exodus from Egypt and their journey in the wilderness typify the church coming out of the world and journeying in the wilderness. Hebrews 3 and 4 reveal that even though the children of Israel came out of Egypt and passed through the wilderness, only a few entered into Canaan to obtain the rest. These chapters do not refer to the believers individually but to the church as a whole.</p>
<p>These portions in the New Testament prove that the story of the children of Israel coming out of Egypt and entering into Canaan is a type of the church. This type does not focus on a single aspect of the church&rsquo;s experience; rather, it is a complete and systematic type with a beginning, a process, and a culmination.</p>
