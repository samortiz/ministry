When we have discharged the first burden, we will receive a second, and when the second is discharged, we will receive a third
If we are faithful to do this repeatedly before the Lord, God will continue to dispense burdens to us one after another
If you go along with it and act according to God's will, the more you preach, the more the burden will be released
If you work in accordance with the burden that is upon you, your whole being will be increasingly liberated as you advance
You may start off by having a heavy burden, but as you go on, the burden will be released, and you will be uplifted
If you work without a burden, you will sense that you are laboring in vain and may even be conscious of reproof as you labor
In relation to all spiritual work, you should wait on God for His burden and then set out to discharge it in a conscientious way
A barrier will develop between you and God because you have betrayed the burden and not acted according to God's direction
He may be sick or he may be in difficulty, but you know nothing about it; you have not received any news from him
Perhaps after a few weeks or a few months, you may receive a letter from him and find that he was indeed sick and in difficulty
If we remain silent before God, the burden will not leave; rather, it will become heavier and heavier upon you
If there is a heavy burden within, there should be a correspondence between the inner burden and the outward expression
Even if we cannot go to the wilderness or the mountain, we should pray audibly even if it means praying in a low voice
Very often our difficulty is that even when we are conscious of a burden to pray, we do not know how to pray when we kneel down
We need to realize that our burden is a matter of the spirit, whereas our comprehension of the burden is a matter of the mind
God gives them a burden to pray, and they may know what it is; their mind and their spirit may be connected, yet they do not pray
Oh, brothers and sisters, the work of God will be seriously hampered if we do not have a free spirit to serve as instruments for His use
If we asked someone to help us with a certain job but found that his hands were full, it would be useless to seek his aid
