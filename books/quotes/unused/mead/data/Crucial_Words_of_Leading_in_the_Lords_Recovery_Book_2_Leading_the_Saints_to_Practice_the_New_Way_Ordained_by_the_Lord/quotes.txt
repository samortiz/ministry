[1]  Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord s Recovery, Book 2: Leading the Saints to Practice the New Way Ordained by the Lord CONTENTS
[2]  The Importance of the Elders in God s New Testament Economy
[3]  IN GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Eph 3:9-11; Matt 16:18; 1 Tim 3:15-16; Acts 15:2, 6, 22-23, 28; 1 Tim 3:1-7; 5:17; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet 5:1-3
[4]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You that in this dark age You are bringing us into the light.
[5]  Lord, although our gathering is on earth, we sense that we are in the heavens, because the heavens are open to us and are even with us.
[6]  O Lord, may You cause each one of us to gain You, to gain Your good pleasure, and to gain the desire of Your heart so that we may be one spirit with You and even one heart and one entity with You.
[7]  Before we were saved and even after we were saved and entered into the church life, we may have never dreamed that in God s New Testament economy there is still a need for elders.
[8]  God s desire was not that kings would take care of the administration among His people.
[9]  The elders carried out the administration among the children of Israel not only according to the set law but also by means of God s instant revelation through the breastplate, the Urim, and the Thummim.
[10]  Just as the high priest in the Old Testament was able to read the condition of the twelve tribes of Israel through the breastplate, an elder must know not only the law of God but also have the breastplate and be able to receive God s instant revelation.
[11]  At the same time, he must have a heart that cares for God s people and be a person who draws near to God, fellowships with God, is in the light of His countenance, and is able to read every member in the church according to God s view.
[12]  If we are bearing and holding the brothers and sisters, we will be wonderful priests, and in God s light we will be able to read God s leading concerning the brothers and sisters whom we hold in our heart.
[13]  Moreover, this is not the building of a physical house but the building of the church, which is not an organization but an organic Body.
[14]  The elders must see that they are not building an organization in their respective localities; rather, they are building an organic Body, which is altogether a matter of life.
[15]  Wherever the elders of the churches are, whether in a church as big as Taipei or in a church as small as Tong-shi, they must see that the churches which they are building are not merely an organization but an organism, a part of the Body of Christ.
[16]  We may only know to preach the Lord Jesus to people and to baptize them after they believe into the Lord, receive Him, and pray to Him, but we may not know if they have touched the Spirit.
[17]  They must do so because they are elders in local churches, and every local church is a unit that upholds the truth of God.
[18]  THE ELDERS BEING THOSE WHO CARE FOR THE CHURCH Having a Good Testimony in Their Living
[19]  The elders should not only be apt to teach; they must also labor in word and teaching 1 Tim 5:17b .
[20]  A person who teaches at school, whether as a university professor or as an elementary school teacher, knows that when he was a student, his learning was limited because he did not need to teach others.
[21]  As elders, we should not lord it over others and give them the feeling that because we are elders, they must obey what we say as if we were kings.
[22]  If some, however, desire to serve as elders for the building up of the local churches and for the benefit of God s children and desire to truly have this kind of function and capacity, then their desire is not merely a matter of position but of function.
[23]  I hope that the Lord will speak to each one of us so that we may see that the most necessary and crucial persons in God s economy on the earth today are the elders.
[24]  CHAPTER TWO THE PROPER PURSUIT OF THE ELDERS Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 5:17; 3:2b; 1 Cor 14:1, 4-5, 12, 31, 39a; 3:10, 12; Psa 119:147-148; Lam 3:22-24; 1 John 1:9; Acts 13:52; Rom 8:4; Phil 1:20-21a; 1 Thes 5:17; 2 Tim 4:2; Heb 10:25; Phil 1:19; 4:13
[25]  Prayer: Father, be gracious to us that we may treasure Your holy ministry and touch Your throne of grace with our spirit.
[26]  Enable us not only to enter into the Holy of Holies but to remain and live in it in order to be able to pray for Your church and for the saints, to pray that we would take Your way, and to pray that we would be revived inwardly and gradually be enabled to live an overcoming life.
[27]  Lord, grant us Your visitation so that we may not waste our time or squander Your grace but may become priests and living stones.
[28]  O Lord, we want to enjoy You and to actively produce building materials for the building of Your church.
[29]  In any place, as long as two brothers know how to be elders, even if there is not a single saved one in that place, within two years a church of twenty-five will surely be raised up.
[30]  If the elders in the church want to teach the brothers and sisters, they must spend time and effort to labor in God s word.
[31]  If an elder thinks that he is a kind of master, puts on airs, and lets people know that he is an elder and that everyone must listen to him, his eldership is utterly annulled.
[32]  If some elders are willing to practice and learn in this way, even if there are only two such brothers, they will be able to raise up churches wherever they go.
[33]  If we are not occupied by our jobs and do not seek many possessions, desiring to lead a proper life, we will be able to use our evenings, weekends, and holidays to visit people by door-knocking.
[34]  When we contact people, we do not need to speak regarding any profound doctrine; we only need to speak the straight truth, that is, to speak the truth by cutting it straight.
[35]  ABOUND IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH First Having the Knowledge
[36]  In pursuing the knowledge of the truth, no one should say that there is no opportunity; in particular, the trainees should not feel that there are not enough teachers.
[37]  From now on, regardless of where we are and who we are, whether working saints or housewives, whether students or business people, whether full-time serving ones, elders, or co-workers, we must all pursue the truth.
[38]  If we feel that the new way is right, we should put our whole being into it; if we do not feel that it is right, the old way is still there and we can easily return to it.
[39]  If we desire earnestly to prophesy and speak for God, there will be an outward manifestation.
[40]  Every one of us, especially the young people, should have the attitude and spirit that although we do not know how to speak for the Lord today, we will learn to do so in a month, and that in two months we will be able to speak even better.
[41]  When we practice prophesying, we must bear in mind that to prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord.
[42]  Psalm 119:147-148 speaks of a seeker of the Lord rising up, seeking Him, and having fellowship with the Lord in His word before the night watches.
[43]  Lamentations 3 also says that God s grace, compassions, lovingkindness, and presence are new every morning and that we should enjoy Him as our portion vv.
[44]  CHAPTER THREE THE ELDERS NEEDING TO LEAD THE SAINTS TO PRACTICE THE WAY ORDAINED BY THE LORD 1 Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1; Acts 2:46; 4:31; 5:42; Matt 28:18-19
[45]  Prayer: Lord, our heart does not hope that we would be great or successful in this age; rather, our wish is to humbly serve You today so that we may gain Your praise in that day.
[46]  After several years of investigating, we have found that in order to practice the way ordained by the Lord, we need to pay attention to four main points: first, to visit people and preach the gospel to gain new ones; second, to lead the new ones to establish home meetings; third, to lead the new ones to join the small group meetings; and fourth, to participate in the district meetings.
[47]  In the past few years of experimenting, we have discovered several factors that are important and effective in regard to preaching the gospel.
[48]  After much study and discussion, we can say that we have come to the definite conclusion that preaching the gospel by visiting people and knocking on doors is the proper way.
[49]  The result of preaching the gospel in this way depends upon how we labor; this way definitely works and is by comparison the most effective way.
[50]  At the beginning they should explain to the brothers and sisters that their going out to visit people and preach the gospel is to consecrate themselves not only to the church but also to the Lord and that the responsible brothers in the church will assist them, help them, and perfect them.
[51]  TO PRACTICE THE WAY ORDAINED BY THE LORD 2 THE NEW TESTAMENT PAYING ATTENTION
[52]  If we read the New Testament carefully, we will see that what the New Testament reveals and pays attention to is summed up in three matters: truth, life, and the gospel.
[53]  Among the four Gospels the Gospel of John is the only book that does not conclude with the Lord Jesus saying that we need to preach the gospel to the nations or that we need to proclaim to the nations repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
[54]  Out of my desire for the truth and my study and pursuit of the truth, I came into contact with Brother Nee s books and eventually joined Brother Nee in Shanghai.
[55]  If we pay attention only to truth but neglect to preach the gospel, we will not have offspring; similarly, if we pay attention only to life but do not preach the gospel, we will not have a continuation.
[56]  TO PRACTICE THE WAY ORDAINED BY THE LORD 3 Scripture Reading: Heb 10:25 EXERCISING MODERATION
[57]  The Bible says that no one can serve two masters; it does not require us to drop our jobs, but if we have a job, we should budget our time.
[58]  If a car valued at thirty thousand dollars is more than sufficient for our use, why do we want to buy a car that is worth a hundred thousand dollars and for which we must work hard to come up with a way to earn the one hundred thousand dollars?
[59]  We will soon have a training for the working saints, and our principal burden is to speak this word to the young saints.
[60]  If we labor in this way, the church under our care will be rough and coarse, because we are not serving the church in a way that is proper, thorough, or self-forsaking.
[61]  If all the elders of the church in Taipei in all the different halls were able to serve full time, they would be able to take the brothers and sisters to visit these ones, and I believe that half of them would be brought back.
[62]  In the past, group meetings were established through arrangements made by elders, but it does not have to be this way.
[63]  If they do not learn this, they will not be able to lead the group meetings successfully, and it will be even more difficult if we later want to hand over the meetings to the local brothers and sisters.
[64]  The elders in all the churches should also learn this, and at the same time, they should take the lead to train the saints in their localities and let them know that it is not enough to simply spend time to visit people but that the saints need to lead the meetings properly.
[65]  The advantage of group meetings is that they do not have forms; only when there is no form can the new ones feel related to the saints and be drawn to the meeting.
[66]  TO PRACTICE THE WAY ORDAINED BY THE LORD 4 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:26, 4-5 THE NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN DISTRICT MEETINGS Exercising to Function in District Meetings
[67]  The most crucial point that we want to fellowship in regard to the district meetings is that we should exercise to function in the meetings.
[68]  I want everyone to pay attention to this matter: whether in the district meetings or in the bigger meetings of the whole church, when we come together, we need to try our best to function, either by praying, choosing hymns, giving testimonies, or reading the Scriptures; we need to practice according to 1 Corinthians 14:26.
[69]  We need to know that our speaking in the meetings is not something ordinary; we are neither chatting nor talking about the world situation, much less about the weather; rather, we are speaking things related to God and the Lord.
[70]  For this reason, prior to the meetings, we must first pray, confess our sins, have proper fellowship with God, and allow the Holy Spirit to have the ground within us; in this way, when we come to the meetings, we will be able to cooperate with God.
[71]  We must avoid giving tediously long prophecies; otherwise, we will occupy too much time and take away the opportunity for others to function.
[72]  The district meetings are generally fresh and living and are different from the past; more saints are speaking in the meetings, and the atmosphere is more open.
[73]  From now on we will spend more time focusing on the ninety-six districts in Taipei; we will study these districts one by one and present the condition of each district to the saints.
[74]  Some in Chefoo said that they did not need to pay attention to us because we were merely a group of youngsters leading other youngsters and that we would come to an end. However, this was not the case; the situation of the whole church changed completely within as little as one or two years.
[75]  Prayer: Lord, from the depths of our being we shout for joy that You are the victorious Lord.
[76]  Lord, we pray that You would be with Your church and remember that this is Your recovery; this is the way that You have led us to walk.
[77]  In Christianity there is a long-held concept of revival that exists not only within the Pentecostal movement but also among fundamentalists.
[78]  I hope we can see that if all of us, especially the elders, co-workers, and full-timers, are faithful to the truth, learn the truth, enter into the truth, release the truth, teach the truth, and preach the truth, the result will be that truth will produce life and that life will bring forth beautiful fruit.
[79]  Sadly, we have not seen a revival within the last sixty to seventy years, but we absolutely believe that if the truth in the Lord s recovery is given a way to thrive, it will bring in the richness of life, and the result will be clusters and clusters of fruit.
[80]  Although it is very effective to bring people to salvation by visiting them in their homes, it is not that easy to bring them into the church life.
[81]  After we have set up a home meeting, we may find out that it is not easy.
[82]  In the land of Judea, however, due to the lack of such a group of people who were joined and built together, not many were brought in. From this we should see that once we gain some new ones, it is not adequate to merely baptize them or even to show them the Lord Jesus resurrection.
[83]  In the past we appraised their work too highly, thinking that their work was marvelous and that every church they built up seemed to be a New Jerusalem.
[84]  However, while we were studying the new way and came back to the Bible to consider this matter, we discovered that the work which the apostles did was not extraordinary.
[85]  According to the Epistles, the church in Philippi was an excellent church, yet Paul still spoke of two co-working sisters who were not in one accord Phil 4:2 .
[86]  Even if all the churches in Taiwan take the new way and the Lord enables us to gain twenty thousand in the first year, sixty thousand in the second year, and one hundred eighty thousand in the third year, we need to be careful, because if we have this condition, it could be called a mushroom work.
[87]  Therefore, we should be assured that if what we do is real, it will come under Satan s devastation; nevertheless, the more he devastates, the more the reality will be manifested, and the more we will be able to see that our work is not a work of wood, grass, and stubble but of gold, silver, and precious stones 1 Cor 3:12 , which will last forever.
[88]  At present, the most important thing for the church is what Paul spoke of in 1 Corinthians 14:4: He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but he who prophesies builds up the church.
[89]  Hence, although all the brothers and sisters speak in the meetings, some speak on one topic, and others speak on another topic; at the end there is the need for a responsible brother to tie a knot, that is, to release a rich word to conclude the meeting.
[90]  First, in Matthew 28:20 the Lord personally charged His disciples saying, Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you.
[91]  This clearly says that we need to teach the believers all that the Lord commanded.
[92]  Hence, when we study the Lord s word, we need to exercise our mind, apprehension, memory, and understanding; if we are willing to exercise properly, we will become experienced.
[93]  In short, if we want to learn to prophesy in the church, we need to labor on the Lord s word and learn how to speak for God and speak forth God.
[94]  I hope that all the young people, including the sisters, will receive this word, be trained, pursue the Lord, love the Lord, give themselves to the Lord, and most importantly, enter into the Lord s word and be able to speak the Lord s word.
[95]  When we speak in the meetings, we need to raise our voice and speak loudly so that others can hear us.
[96]  CHAPTER NINE LEARNING THE TRUTH FOR PROPHESYING 2 PROPHETS SEEKING NOT THE LETTER
[97]  This hymn contains a crucial point that shows the kind of person we should be and the kind of attitude and desire we should have, if we desire to seek the word of the Lord.
[98]  Every time we come to a meeting, we must prepare beforehand, praying to the Lord to see which portion of the Word can be offered before God for the enjoyment of God s people; this is how we should prepare.
[99]  This means that although we may exert our effort in God s word, if there is a barrier between us and God, we should not expect a rich harvest; rather, we will receive nothing.
[100]  If we want to be prophets, we must have a foundation in God s word; without a foundation in God s word, it will be difficult for us to speak for God.
[101]  Moreover, our person must be right; if our person is not right, it will be futile even if we can prophesy well.
[102]  The prophets need the revelations in God s word, and the teachers who present a teaching also need the riches of God.
[103]  Thus, in order to speak for God, we need to see the revelations contained in the Bible; then when we teach people, we must take God s riches as the content and reality in our teaching.
[104]  IN ORDER TO HAVE A REVELATION, A PERSON NEEDING TO BE ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD
[105]  The requirement concerning revelation is even higher, because a revelation is God making known the intent of His heart.
[106]  Intimate counsel carries a sense of revelation, indicating that if we want to receive God s revelation, we must be those who draw near to Him.
[107]  If we are those who draw near to God, contact Him, and are joined to Him, we will be one spirit with the Lord.
[108]  Revelation is different from teaching and is deeper than teaching; it requires us to be those who draw near to God, fellowship with God, be one spirit with the Lord every day, and labor on the Bible continually; if we are such persons, God will reveal much to us through the words of the Bible.
[109]  From now on we need to strive and push toward the goal of taking the lead well, being apt to teach, and prophesying well.
[110]  Hence, whether we are co-workers, elders, or young full-timers, we need to realize that when we serve together, we need to learn to have no opinion.
[111]  CHAPTER TEN LEARNING THE TRUTH FOR PROPHESYING 3 THE CHURCH SERVICE TODAY
[112]  There are many opportunities for us to function, and we all need to function to preach the gospel and to participate in home meetings, group meetings, and district meetings.
[113]  If a person were to ask why we stay in Taipei and do not go elsewhere after having been in the church for so many years, we should answer by saying, I am waiting for the ninety-seventh district to be formed so that I may go and be a prophet there.
[114]  When we exercise to speak for the Lord, we should avoid conducting ourselves lightly or frivolously.
[115]  Once we are frivolous, we are worthless; thus, we must be solemn.
[116]  Hence, if a person speaks for God and speaks God s word with a frivolous attitude, his speaking lacks significance; even if a saint is merely giving a testimony, he still should not be flippant.
[117]  Today the truth is among us, and we need to endeavor to enter into it.
[118]  Although this kind of visitation was able to bring people into the Lord s recovery and gradually raise up churches in various places, I realized that the supply of the truth would be inadequate if I continued my work in this way.
[119]  Now when we come to the Lord s table, we sing concerning the Lord being the only grain that died and brought us forth as the many grains and blended us together in spirit to make us the one Body.
[120]  The saints should first have home meetings in their homes; then they should go out to lead others and establish home meetings in the homes of the ones they are leading.
[121]  If there are one hundred saints meeting in a certain church and twenty-five saints go door-knocking, at most they will gain four hundred people a year; do not expect too many.
[122]  Most brothers and sisters will not take care of the new ones simply because the elders have spoken about it and made a few announcements; rather, we need to find a way to lead the saints and make arrangements for them.
[123]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:7-9; 4:1; Eph 4:11-12; Acts 2:42
[124]  The New Testament ministry and the apostles teaching are two matters in the church that have not been accurately understood by most believers for the past two thousand years.
[125]  The ministry that the twelve apostles received was to bear the testimony of the Lord Jesus, testifying that He is the Triune God and that, as the Son of God, He was incarnated to be a man to pass through human living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, that He was nailed to the cross and died there according to the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God 2:23 , that He was raised up after three days, and that in resurrection He appeared to the apostles and disciples, charging them to preach Him as the gospel to the whole inhabited earth.
[126]  This ministry speaks of Christ being the mystery of God and of the church being the mystery of Christ.
[127]  Since the ministry of the New Testament is of the Spirit, it is a ministry of justification, not a ministry of condemnation.
[128]  In the past twenty-five years, especially since we began propagating overseas, some people have said that we have brought the Lord s recovery to the point that it receives only Brother Lee s ministry and no other ministry.
[129]  For us to take the Lord s new way, all the co-workers and elders need to see clearly that we have only one ministry in the Lord s recovery, the unique ministry.
[130]  FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST To Hold On to Some Special Creeds
[131]  After we are saved and begin to love the Lord, people may tell us that it is good to love the Lord but that it is possible that we have been deceived because even though we say that others are sects, are we not also a sect?
[132]  When we speak to people, they may not know us and thus think that we have a special title; nevertheless, on our part we know that we are all doing the work of the one ministry, which is to build up the Body of Christ Eph 4:12 .
[133]  We may encounter a situation in which some brothers love to expound the Bible; they are the Apolloses of this age.
[134]  In the beginning of Acts, Peter and a group of brothers carried out the ministry; later, the apostle Paul and some other brothers began to carry out the ministry.
[135]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES Scripture Reading: Matt 28:20; 1 Tim 6:3; Matt 16:16-18; Eph 3:5; Col 2:2; Eph 3:4; 5:32; Jude 3; 1 Tim 1:3-4; cf.
[136]  THE APOSTLES RECEIVING ALL REVELATIONS FROM THE LORD THROUGH THE HOLY SPIRIT
[137]  The apostles teaching teaches us concerning the faith, not concerning the law.
[138]  The center of God s economy in the New Testament is that Christ, the God-man, accomplished redemption, entered into resurrection, became the life-giving Spirit, enters into all who believe into Him to be their life, their everything, their life supply, and their person, and mingles Himself with them to be one spirit with them to make them members of His Body.
[139]  The center of God s New Testament economy is that the Triune God was incarnated to be the God-man Jesus, who brought our sins, our old man, the old creation, Satan, and the world to the cross and crucified them there.
[140]  In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit; thus, when we believe in Him, He enters into our spirit to be our life and our everything, making us members of His Body, who are joined to Him.
[141]  The kernel of the New Testament is that the Triune God became flesh, passed through human living, was crucified, resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit and that He now enters into us to be our life, our person, and our everything and to mingle Himself with us, making us a part of the Body of Christ to express the Triune God.
[142]  Although this is not altogether wrong, if we consider carefully the record in the Bible, we cannot find a definite verse that indicates that Paul was directing his co-workers.
[143]  From the context, these different things refer to the law, Old Testament genealogies v. 4 , and profane and old-womanish myths 4:7 . According to Paul s thought, we should speak only God s economy, which is in faith; that is, we should speak only the apostles teaching.
[144]  In 2 John 7-11 the apostle John charged the saints that if some did not bring them the teaching of Christ but preached that Jesus Christ did not come in the flesh, they should neither receive such ones into their house nor even greet them.
[145]  In 3 John 9-10 Diotrephes, who loved to be first, would not receive the Lord s workers, including John, but babbled against them with evil words.
[146]  Since 1949 I truly took the lead in the church and the work in Taiwan; nevertheless, from 1961 to 1984, a period of twenty-three years, I have never directed the church in Taipei to do anything nor have I interfered with the church.
[147]  Rather, everything needs to be carried out according to the principle of the elders administration of the church; that is, the elders discuss matters together, seek the Lord s leading together, and make every decision in the elders meeting.
[148]  THE WORK WITH THE STUDENTS 1 THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY BENEFITTING
[149]  To work for the Lord, we should not rely on organization; once there is an arrangement and organization, our work will be similar to a worldly enterprise that first establishes a small unit and then develops into a bigger organization.
[150]  The goal of our service is to bring the brothers and sisters into the church life.
[151]  When we began our work in Taipei in 1949, the land for hall one of the church in Taipei was bought with the money of the ministry.
[152]  I have been serving with the brothers for several decades, and none of you, whether in Taiwan or abroad, have ever heard me say anything loosely.
[153]  Actually, we need to realize that we can help people the most when we truly do not know anything; if we know everything, we will not be able to help others.
[154]  For instance, if we have the answer regardless of whether people ask us about the east or the west, or about our mother-in-law or our daughter-in-law, we will be useless in God s hand.
[155]  Even if we really know something, unless we are in our own place, that is, unless we are in our own car and we are the one driving, we should not say anything.
[156]  For over three years we have been studying the way for the church to gain the increase and have seen that door-knocking gains people, the home meetings keep people, the group meetings join people together, and the district meetings bring people into the church.
[157]  While the work of gaining people is done on the campuses, we still need to bring the new believers to attend the district meetings on the Lord s Day so that they can taste the church life and have some knowledge and feeling for the church.
[158]  THE WORK WITH THE STUDENTS 2 ANY WORK PRODUCED BY INCITEMENT
[159]  As we lead the church and the work, we should not rely too much upon organization.
[160]  In the church life the principle of discussing matters in the elders meeting is of great importance.
[161]  The church is an assembly of many persons; if we think that the discussion of matters in the elders meeting is the same as the discussion of official business in the world, this view is absolutely wrong.
[162]  The principle of the discussion of church affairs in the elders meeting is to let the Holy Spirit be the presiding One.
[163]  In the elders meeting, we should never elect a presiding officer; if we elect one, we annul the authority of the Holy Spirit.
[164]  Every time the elders draw near to God, they need to wear these two kinds of plates; that is, they need to bear the saints upon themselves as they come into the presence of God.
[165]  When the elders take care of God s children, they need to seek God s guidance; they need not only the Bible and the Holy Spirit but also the brothers and sisters as the alphabet.
[166]  Apart from the above points, we also need to use facts and experiences as references.
[167]  Acts 15 shows that the brothers had a discussion v. 7 ; this means that all the attendants had an equal right to speak.
[168]  Today when the eighty-some elders of the church in Taipei come together, every elder has an equal right to speak.
[169]  He said, Men, brothers, you know that from the early days God chose from among you that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe v. 7 . This is to read the facts, experiences, and present condition of the brothers and sisters; this was Peter s testimony.
[170]  THE CO-WORKERS AND THE ELDERS Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:5; 5:17; 3:2; 1 Pet 5:1-2; Acts 14:23a; Titus 1:5; Acts 13:1-3 THE ELDERS Taking Care of the Church and
[171]  The administration of the church is the elders responsibility, whereas the co-workers in the church simply work in coordination with the elders to build up the church in a locality.
[172]  We need to know that the elders are the administrators among God s people and that the co-workers should not interfere with the administrative matters of the church.
[173]  The elders should not only bear responsibility for the administration of the church, but they also need to teach and shepherd God s people 3:2; 5:17; 1 Pet 5:1-2 .
[174]  In the matter of teaching and shepherding, although the elders may not be weak, sometimes they are not able to meet all the needs related to shepherding and teaching; hence, there is a need for the co-workers to release the word and help with teaching and shepherding.
[175]  In serving the Lord in the church we must maintain the principle that although it is all right for the serving ones to host a meeting or gospel seminar at the meeting hall, they should not touch the administration of the church.
[176]  While laboring in various localities, the co-workers need to be like the five prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch.
[177]  As gifted ones, they labored in that locality, serving the church and the saints, yet they did not touch the administration of the church.
[178]  Hence, we cannot strictly say that the co-workers bear all spiritual responsibility and that the elders do not have any spiritual responsibility, nor can we say that the co-workers should labor on the spiritual matters and that the elders should labor only on business affairs.
[179]  For example, if we desire to use the meeting hall to host a gospel seminar, even if we are sure that the meeting hall will not be used at that time, we still need to fellowship with the elders.
[180]  However, during fellowship there will be points that not every elder agrees upon; at such times, we should learn not to think that only matters that we agree upon should be carried out, and that those that we do not agree upon should not be done.
[181]  Answer: According to the Bible, first, apostles should be able to preach the gospel, to preach the person and ministry of the Lord Jesus in its entirety, that is, thoroughly according to God s plan, God s economy.
[182]  In a locality there may be two or three brothers who are already elders, yet there may be two or three with more experience; however, due to the situation of the church and the particular environment, a change may lead to something negative and produce a poor result; in this situation it is better not to make any change.
[183]  We have invited close to eighty trainees, who are neither elders nor co-workers, to join the training for elders and co-workers.
[184]  At the same time we have also accepted some from various localities who are learning to be elders.
[185]  I hope that these ones will not think that their coming here means that they are elders; hence, they should not give people the impression that they are being trained and invited to the elders training because they will soon be appointed to be elders.
[186]  Our purpose in inviting these ones is that many more young brothers will know the importance of the elders, the need for elders, because as Paul said, If anyone aspires to the overseership, he desires a good work 1 Tim 3:1 .
[187]  Nevertheless, we deeply hope that after hearing such a word and seeing God s need, the younger generation will pray, O Lord, have mercy on me.
[188]  We believe that if two proper elders, who have some learning, know the truth, and hold God s people in their bosom and bear them upon their shoulders, are sent out, they will certainly raise up a church no matter where they go.
[189]  It is rather easy for the church to gain many new ones and reach a goal of increase, but it is more difficult to stabilize these new ones and bring them into the church life.
[190]  It is possible to gain someone with just a little effort, but we may not be able to keep him with even ten times that effort.
[191]  We may be able to gain one hundred people, but if we hope to bring them all into the church life, we need to spend at least ten times as much effort.
[192]  In the matter of door-knocking, we also need to be selective in regard to the districts we choose to labor in. We need to consider which districts we should labor in and how we should labor in them.
[193]  After we gain some people through door-knocking, we need to wait three or four months, that is, until we have brought them into the church and handed them over to the church, before we go out to knock on more doors.
[194]  Before the change of system, we were lacking in matters such as gospel activities, shepherding people, and group meetings.
[195]  This does not mean that since we currently have many activities, we can neglect the emphasis on life.
[196]  The whole church still needs to pay attention to the matter of life; the elders and co-workers especially need to take the lead to pursue life and grow in life.
[197]  We also need to pray for many small churches that need workers who have the heart, who are more gifted, and whose functions are more manifested to visit them and meet with them once a month or once every two months; this will be a great help to them.
[198]  There should be some adjustment in this practice; that is, the co-workers do not need to stay in a fixed place to take care of the church there.
[199]  Perhaps a certain church may have only ten or twenty people in the meeting, and thus a person does not need to speak loudly in order to be heard; nevertheless, if a person speaks in an ordinary way, the feeling of the spirit will be weakened.
[200]  To speak in the meeting, we not only need to lift up our voice but we also need to increase our volume; that is, our throat needs to be clear so that our voice will be loud and our volume will be weighty.
[201]  Therefore, not only do we need to speak in the meetings, but we also need to speak in a way that people can hear so that the moving power can come out, and the Spirit can work accordingly.
[202]  Some local churches have a large number of elderly saints, and the leading ones in these localities hope that they can all speak and function; this may not be easy for the elderly saints.
