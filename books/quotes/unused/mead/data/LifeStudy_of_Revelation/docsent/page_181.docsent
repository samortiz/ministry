   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HIS FALSEHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 13:11 says that the beast out of the earth had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The false prophet looks like a lamb, but speaks like a dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates his falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Bible the lamb signifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fact that the false prophet will have two horns like a lamb indicates that he will pretend to be the same as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, his speaking will be like the dragon, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although he will pretend to be like Christ, what he expresses will be like Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He will be an absolute falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 13 says, And he does great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth before men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The false prophet will employ satanic power to perform great signs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In calling down fire out of heaven, the false prophet will do the same thing Elijah did.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Elijah called down fire from heaven during the days of Ahab 1 Kings 18 , and during the coming three and a half years of the great tribulation he will do this again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Judas sees this, he may say, If Elijah can do it, I can too.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because the false prophet will perform great signs, it will be difficult for people to discern the real prophet from the false prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The false prophet will be able to do the same thing as the real one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As far as eloquence is concerned, Judas will likely be no less eloquent than Moses or Elijah because his speaking will be like that of the dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we have been enlightened, we would never pay attention to signs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the concept of the New Testament, the Lord does not intend for us to devote our attention to signs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, we must concentrate our whole being on the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not care for what a preacher or minister can do in the way of signs; we must examine the kind of life he has.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not a matter of the power we exercise, but of the life we live.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you care only for life, you will never be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As far as signs are concerned, there is no way to discern the true from the false, for both Elijah and the false prophet will bring down fire from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The only way to discern is by life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If both Elijah and Judas were standing before you, you could easily discern who is true and who is false by their very being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>People may cheat others by their words, but they expose themselves by what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not care for what people can do care for what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today most Christians do not care for what people are, but for what they can do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They care for power, signs, and miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But those who exercise miraculous power to do signs may have a living and behavior that are deplorable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am not saying that we should be concerned with our outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am saying that we must be what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What we are in our living must express what we are in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The life we live out from within expresses, not what we can do, but what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the end time, the signs, powers, and miracles will come.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Matthew 24:24 the Lord Jesus said, False Christs and false prophets shall arise and shall show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 2 Thessalonians 2:9 and 10 Paul said the Antichrist, the man of sin, would come according to the operation of Satan, with all power and signs and wonders of a lie, and with all deceit of unrighteousness among those who are perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must be warned not to look for signs and wonders.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you do, you may be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of seeking signs, we must care for Christ in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not expect miracles give your attention to life, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When Judas, the false prophet, appears, he will deceive people by the signs he performs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>WORKING FOR THE BEAST OUT OF THE SEA</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The false prophet will not work for himself, but for Antichrist, the beast out of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No one who speaks on his own behalf is respected or believed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is much easier to praise others than it is to praise yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If I were to speak highly of myself, no one would want to listen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everything Judas says and does will be on behalf of the first beast.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I simply cannot understand why he will sell himself to Antichrist to such an extent that he will even go to the lake of fire with him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There seems to be no reason for this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Neither Satan nor Antichrist will promise Judas anything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Why then will he be so foolish as to sell himself outright?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>From the beginning Judas was caught by Satan and became a person under Satan s evil instigation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As Satan controlled Judas in the past, so he will control him once again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This may be the reason Judas will completely sell himself to Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although none of us is like Judas, part of our natural being is in the principle of Judas at least to some degree.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We also may sell ourselves to Satan for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whether you realize it or not, you have done this many times.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Frequently we have betrayed the Lord Jesus or damaged the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have done certain things that have frustrated the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It seems that there was no reason for our doing these things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>During the past fourteen years in this country, I have seen some cases of those who damaged the Lord s recovery, but who received nothing for it in return.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Their acts were the result of the fact that Satan had occupied their natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When Satan gets into our natural being and possesses certain parts of it, we sell ourselves for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the principle of Judas as well as the principle of the false prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Not only will Satan give his power to the false prophet; the Antichrist will place his complete confidence in him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hence, the false prophet will be authorized to represent Antichrist, the embodiment of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Satan will be embodied in Antichrist, and Antichrist will be represented by the false prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Because of this, some Bible students call Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet a satanic trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But I do not like to see the word trinity used in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Nevertheless, Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet certainly will become one.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Due to this union, the false prophet will be authorized to do whatever he desires.</S>
