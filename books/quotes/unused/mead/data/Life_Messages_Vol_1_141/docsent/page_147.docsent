   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT WORSHIPPING IN SPIRIT GOD'S GOOD PLEASURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Testament reveals that when we were regenerated a great change took place in our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The main part of a natural man by birth is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The soul not only has the parts of mind, emotion, and will, but also is the person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At regeneration the person shifts from the soul to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Strictly speaking, we should no longer be a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should only use its parts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I would not say that we should be a spirit, but at least we can say that we must consider our spirit as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is not to say that our spirit is no longer an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE SPIRIT AS AN ORGAN</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 4:23 and 24 we are told that God is to be worshipped in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word in may be considered as an instrumental preposition and can therefore be translated with.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We worship with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that our spirit serves as an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We see with our eyes, hear with our ears, and worship with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we say we worship in spirit, we mean that we worship in the realm of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we say we worship with our spirit, we mean that the spirit is the part of our being by which we worship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The spirit then has become not only the new person, the inner man, but also the new organ with which we worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>SERVICE AND WORSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word worship in Greek implies also the thought of service.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Romans 1:9 reads, "For God is my witness, Whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word serve in this verse is translated worship in some other versions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether we say worship or serve, the meaning is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our worship is our service to God; our service to Him is also our worship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we worship Him, we serve Him; when we serve Him, we worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE HUMAN SPIRIT, NOT THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The human spirit, as the organ by which we worship or serve God, is largely unknown among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When they come across the word spirit, they understand it as the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Nee wrote a book called The Release of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christians who read this title may think that what is meant is the release of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you read the book, however, you will see how Brother Nee stresses that he is referring to the human spirit, not to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many Christians have a very light regard for the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Christian theology there is a school of dichotomy, which teaches that man has two parts, not three.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They consider that soul and spirit are synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This kind of belief affects the way the Bible has been translated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Chinese version, though it is a good translation, in many verses renders the word spirit as heart-spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such a rendering shows that the scholars lacked a clear vision concerning the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is heart-spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is an odd term!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Though the scholars knew the language, they did not know the spirit so well.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They realized that the word pneuma in John 4:24 does not refer to the Holy Spirit, but to some organ of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thinking that the Chinese mentality would misunderstand spirit, they added another word, making it heart-spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They thought that the heart and the human spirit are the same.</S>
