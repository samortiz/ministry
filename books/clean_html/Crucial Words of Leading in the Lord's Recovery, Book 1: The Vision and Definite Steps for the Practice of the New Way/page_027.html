<h2 class="head2">The Benefits of Changing the System</h2>
<p>As far as the outward fa&#231;ade is concerned, the big meetings are wonderful. A large meeting with fourteen thousand attendants surely draws much admiration, but the wonderful feeling does not last long. Once the excitement is over, what change has resulted in the saints when they return to their daily routine? What change has been brought about in the church? Is the Lord satisfied with us? In hall one of the church in Taipei, every Lord&rsquo;s Day there are at least three hundred fifty people meeting. The atmosphere is proper, a well-dressed person with a suit and tie conducts the meeting, the speaker is eloquent, the singing is accompanied by a grand and sonorous piano, and the meeting&rsquo;s atmosphere is uplifted. Many saints like to invite people to such a gathering. They like to tell their friends, &ldquo;This is our church.&rdquo; It seems as if they come to the meeting with the sole purpose of making such a display to people. When we speak of the small groups, however, who wants to bring their friends and relatives to such a meeting? The attendants are all unorganized, and everyone comes late.</p>
<p>We need to understand that the element of nonuniformity is the very characteristic of the small groups. This is a very distinctive feature of the small groups. It means that the small groups are able to take care of every saint in the group. This is the reason we say that the small groups are the life pulse of the church. Without such an element of nonuniformity, a small group is not able to be a proper small group. I have attended some very uniform small groups, and I like them and appreciate them, but I appreciate even more the disorganized small groups. They may meet from seven to eleven o&rsquo;clock at night. The saints may be constantly coming and going, and there may be much excitement. One brother testified that when his small group meeting began, no one showed up; as a result, he decided to go out and visit some people. By nine o&rsquo;clock at night, however, everyone arrived, and there were more than twenty people meeting. At the beginning the scene may be discouraging, but those who endure to the end will be saved and will prevail.</p>
<p>We have had too much experience with the big meetings. During the past twenty years, how many people have we brought in through the &ldquo;props&rdquo; of the big meetings? In the United States Billy Graham also organizes large gospel campaigns. His campaigns often are attended by hundreds of thousands of people. Countless numbers of people come forward to commit their names, but in the end, it is difficult to tell where they have gone. This can be compared to scooping up water from a pond with a woven basket; eventually, the water leaks back into the same pond. The small groups may not seem that great, but if we look at the statistics, the results are astounding. If each small group brings in one new one per month, from the four hundred small groups in Taipei there will be four thousand eight hundred new ones added to the church in a year. The individual numbers are not that impressive, but the total is staggering.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that one of the goals of the small groups is to recover the dormant saints. Until now, however, we still have not seen this carried out. If we practice this matter conscientiously, we can recover one dormant saint in a year, even if we cannot bring in any new people; in a year we will recover four thousand eight hundred dormant saints. If from the beginning we had set our mind to labor in this way, we would have recovered seven thousand five hundred dormant saints during the past one and a half years. This is the reason I say that our new practice is something that is on paper only; there is no reality to it yet. The reason there is no reality is that we have not practiced properly and conscientiously.</p>
<p>I am not rebuking anyone. If I were an elder, I also would be happy to see a large gathering. If the hall or church under my administration were made up of small unorganized groups, I also would be unhappy. Still, we need to realize that it is this &ldquo;unorganized&rdquo; element that brings in new ones. Romans 8:25 says, &ldquo;If we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly await it through endurance.&rdquo; If we are clear about our situation, we will exercise much endurance. We will not be afraid of the so-called &ldquo;unorganized&rdquo; element in the small groups. Once the small groups become uniform, the requirements increase, and it becomes difficult to bring in the new ones. The fact that the small groups are somewhat disorganized is proof that the new ones are being brought in. In order to care for everyone&rsquo;s condition, each one can come as early or as late as he pleases.</p>
<p>My hope is that the elders would pick up this burden to do their best to promote the small groups in all the meeting halls and all the churches. Tell the saints about the benefits of the small groups. The government of Taiwan has produced an overabundance of food, and the domestic consumption cannot catch up. The government is now on a promotional campaign to teach everyone how to best utilize the excess rice. In contrast, I am afraid that the elders have accepted the new practice merely as a doctrine or a theory; in practice they have not promoted it but have left the whole matter to run its own course. Of course, when they take this attitude, the saints do not pick up a taste for the small groups.</p>
<p>The primary task of the elders is to promote the small groups. If I were an elder, I would surely speak concerning the small groups every day. In every meeting I would take the opportunity to promote them. I would work on the saints until every one of them is in a small group and enjoys the small groups. After this I would dig out the records of all the saints and make a list of those who are dormant or who seldom come to the meetings. I would distribute the names to the small groups who meet in close proximity to them, and encourage the saints in the small groups to visit them and recover them. The elders may think that though this exercise is good, it will not increase the number in the big meetings. Perhaps at the beginning, the number in the big meetings will not increase, but in the end it will increase. We are here to pay attention not only to the number in the big church meetings but to the number attending the small group meetings. I hope that one day the church in Taipei will have two hundred thousand saints meeting in the small groups. The number will increase, but the meeting halls will remain the same. Of course, when that happens, the big meetings will not be that important anymore.</p>
