   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEEDED BY ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1 Timothy 3:3 Paul indicates that the elders in a local church need to be forbearing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the elders do not have adequate forbearance, the church in their locality will not be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We know from Ephesians 4 and Colossians 3 that the church is the new man, made up of believers with different nationalities and cultures.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A great deal of forbearance is needed to build up a church composed of saints with many different backgrounds.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The elders need a proper understanding of all the saints and their particular characters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They also need to exercise wisdom in caring for them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the elders lack understanding and wisdom, they will not be able to exercise forbearance and may cause a great deal of damage.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For the building up among the saints in a local church, the virtue most needed by every elder is forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>NEEDED BY ALL THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the church forbearance is needed not only by the elders, but also by all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We especially need to exercise forbearance when we come together in different groups for the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we serve together in the church, we need to show forbearance toward one another.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, we should not reject anyone; on the other hand, we should not be excessively tolerant with someone who serves in a way that is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How we need forbearance!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>GOD S FORBEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible reveals that in His economy God has exercised great forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Immediately after the fall of man, God began to show forbearance in His dealings with man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you read Genesis 3 from the viewpoint of forbearance, you will see how forbearing God was with fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God exercised His understanding, fully realizing man s situation and need.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He also exercised His wisdom to deal with fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For the accomplishment of His eternal purpose, for the carrying out of His economy, God has always exercised forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With His forbearance, He has understanding, wisdom, mercy, kindness, love, and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even the rich supply of life is included in God s forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God never commands us to do anything without considering our need and granting us His supply.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a parent charges his children to do a certain task but does not supply them with what they need, that parent is not forbearing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Forbearance always includes the adequate supply to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we read the Bible, we see that God dealt with different people in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, He dealt with Adam in one way, with Abel in another way, and with Cain in yet another way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some students of the Bible say that in the Scriptures there are different dispensations, different ways God deals with man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These dispensations are actually related to forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For God to deal with people in a particular way during a certain age is for Him to show forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because God is forbearing, He knows how to deal with everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He may come to you in a certain way because He knows that you are a certain kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, He may approach another person in a very different way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible reveals that God exercises forbearance in carrying out His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If God had dealt with fallen man in the way we deal with others, there would have been no way for Him to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But God has made His forbearance known to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, God Himself set up an example, a pattern, of forbearance, making known His forbearance to men throughout all generations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God makes known His forbearance by dealing with us in a way that is reasonable, suitable, and considerate.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God never disciplines anyone without proper consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He often waits a long period of time before chastising someone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God certainly is forbearing and full of understanding, wisdom, patience, consideration, sympathy, mercy, kindness, love, and the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Consider, for example, how forbearing He was in dealing with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you read of Israel s journey in the wilderness, you will see that God truly was forbearing toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God has also been forbearing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He has dealt with us like a wise and loving father, full of forbearance.</S>
