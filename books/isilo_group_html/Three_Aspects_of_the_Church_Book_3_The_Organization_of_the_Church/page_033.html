<p>Everyone who serves the Lord has to learn how to do things earnestly. We must pay serious attention to this matter. Nothing wastes a person more than being a preacher. A young man who is a teacher is compelled by his job to excel at teaching. Methods of teaching are continuously improving, and ways to handle the students are also constantly being adjusted. These changes compel teachers to improve themselves. For example, if I were asked to be an elementary school teacher, I would probably not be qualified, because I have not kept up with the times. Everyone in an occupation knows that today&rsquo;s age is an age of competition. This competition forces everyone to learn and improve himself.</p>
<p>Suppose another brother and I were fellow teachers in a certain school. If thirty-eight out of his fifty students passed the examination to enter into high school, yet none of my sixty students passed the examination, surely the school would dismiss me, and no other school on the whole island of Taiwan would give me a letter of employment. Everyone is competing, and this competition forces people to learn how to conduct themselves and to do their work properly. Those who do not compete will not have a job. This is exactly the same in regard to salesmen. If one salesman sells $2,000 to $3,000 worth of merchandise a day, and another salesman sells $30,000 to $50,000 worth of the same merchandise a day, the manager or the head of the sales department will fire the first salesman or ask him to resign. At minimum, such a person will be forced to make improvements.</p>
<p>This is the same in regard to government employees. If two people are both secretaries, when the task that one secretary cannot handle is carried out immediately by a second secretary, the boss will give the second secretary important assignments and even a promotion. This is the actual situation in society. Competition forces people to advance. However, when believers become preachers, they become at ease and have no need to compete. They consider that whoever competes is fleshly. Consequently, this gives them the best excuse to be lax and negligent.</p>
<p>I recently observed the situation among us and discovered that many brothers and sisters&rsquo; ability to handle matters is quite poor. This is because everyone is loose and wastes time. In the church there is no reward for doing things well, and there is no punishment for making mistakes. As a result, it seems that it is easier to become proud when things are done correctly and to make excuses when mistakes are made. This is not right. It is a huge mistake. Many reasons and excuses become shields for those who do not have a job and serve the Lord full time. Those serving the Lord do not want to be like Martha; rather, everyone wants to be like Mary. Instead of doing a lot of things, they would rather pray. What is this? This is the situation or condition of a monastery. Everyone likes to read the Bible and pray, but when matters come into their hands, they may create a big mess. This is truly improper. If those serving full time among us are loose in handling matters, in the future this will be a great loss to the church.</p>
<p>All those serving the Lord full time should learn how to handle matters in the church. Once we are short of aggressiveness or lack a sense of responsibility, we will not be efficient. Regardless of what profession a person is in, he cannot slack off. Once a person slacks off, efficiency is gone, and he will not obtain a good result. Most people do not slack off intentionally but are influenced by the trends around them. We have to admit that we are fallen and weak and cannot withstand the tests in the environment. We behave one way in one environment and another way in a different environment. If one is able to resist being influenced or subdued by the environment and instead subdues the environment, he is a most remarkable person. These people are far too few. Most people are controlled by their environment.</p>
<p>In the church the elderly brothers do not like to impose strict regulations on the full-time serving ones. The more the older saints have learned from the Lord, the more they dislike interacting with others as a superior ruling over a subordinate in the world, because such interactions are easily in the flesh. At the same time, the service in the church does not have an element of competition or of reward and punishment. Due to such an environment, the young full-time serving ones gradually enter into a state of ease and begin to slack off.</p>
<p>There are many things that I do not know, but there is one thing that I can boast of to the young people; that is, I know the proper way to do things. Since my childhood, I have daily had to deal with matters under the pressure of impoverished and difficult environments. Every day I struggled to handle different matters, and I learned to deal with every matter in a serious manner, not only in great matters but also in small matters. The pressure forced me to learn how to do things properly. For example, although others may have swept the floor thoroughly, when I sweep behind them, I am able to sweep up another pile of dirt. However, after I have swept the floor, others cannot find any more dust. This is competition.</p>
<p>Today many young people who serve the Lord in the churches are not like this. They do things in a rough and general way. Their heart is good and proper toward the Lord, but the environment they live in has caused their character to become loose. Looseness is a matter of habit and is developed unconsciously. The brothers who serve in the Taiwan Gospel Book Room are young, their minds are sharper than mine, and their education and literary talent may also be better than mine. Nevertheless, they can testify that in almost every matter, I have to go behind them and &ldquo;sweep up&rdquo; after them. Whatever they do leaves a trail for me to clear away. Our attitude should be to do things so thoroughly that if the angels came behind us, they would have nothing to do. In this regard, the full-time serving ones among us have not made much improvement or advancement.</p>
<p>The way we work depends on how we handle matters, and the way we handle matters depends on the way we conduct ourselves. If we do not know how to conduct ourselves, we will not know how to handle matters, and if we do not know how to handle matters, we will not know how to work. These three things are closely related and affect one another. Everyone who is useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hands knows how to work. He who knows how to work also knows how to handle matters. This is certain. Some people are loose, and although we cannot say that they are wild, they are lazy. When a matter falls into their hands, it is very hard to obtain a result. Almost every person who knows how to handle matters is a strict person, and he does not do things as he pleases. The work in the church has little effectiveness because the full-time serving ones do not do things properly; their work is full of flaws and is neither perfect nor solid. The lessons they have learned are not solid. This is due to the absence of pressure in their environment.</p>
<p>Before I began to serve full time, I worked as an accountant. Every month I had to submit a monthly statement that included a balance report, indicating the profit and loss and the assets and liabilities. This report had to be precise, not even a discrepancy of one cent could exist. If there was a slight mistake, even though it might be a small matter within the department, it would become a great matter, a huge problem, when it reached the bank. As a result, I do not know how many times I had to check the monthly statement to make sure that there was not even a slight mistake. In addition, I also had to submit the statement on time, because the manager had to take it to the bank. As my boss, he did not care whether I had enough time or not, because he had to face the bank. Moreover, he had his own pressure to bear. If I had not done my work well, I could have lost my job or received a reduction in my salary. However, if I did the work well, not only was my job secure, but my salary was increased, and I received a share in the bonus at the end of the year.</p>
<p>These lessons and abilities are completely missing among many of the full-time serving ones. They did not intend to be this way, but their environment caused them to turn out this way. Although they may promise to do something, they can sleep peacefully. They know that if they do a good job, they may not be commended and that if they do a poor job, they will surely be rebuked. If they are rebuked, they realize that they must learn the lesson of humility, saying that this is the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Then they know the matter will be over. If anyone tries to pressure them, they will say that such an action is of the flesh. Consequently, the leading brothers have not dared to pressure them, and they have not learned the proper lessons nor had a proper walk.</p>
<p>The environment of the full-time serving ones is not the same as that of the working saints. The working saints are pressured by the matters related to obtaining a livelihood, such as salary, benefits, position, reputation, and future. They must learn how to conduct themselves and how to do things well. However, those serving full time lack the pressure of such an environment. It seems that whatever they say or do is fine and that whatever they do not say or do is also fine. It does not matter whether they preach the word, visit the saints in a way that is profitable, or do things properly. Although they do not intend or have the slightest intention to be like this, the matter of serving full time has fallen into such a condition.</p>
<p>The brothers who are older and who have spiritual weight in the church do not want to and dare not pressure these full-time serving ones. They dare not pressure them for two reasons: they fear that they might end up in the flesh and overdo it, and they fear that they might hurt the feelings of others. Consequently, they have let the full-time serving ones grow and develop on their own in a loose manner. I am concerned for these serving ones that one day they will become useless materials not only in regard to the Lord&rsquo;s work but also in regard to a job in the world.</p>
<p>This is a hidden peril for every full-time serving one. If you serve the Lord full time, you must be faithful to yourself. Even without the pressure from the environment, you should learn to force yourself and create for yourself some demands and pressure. Please allow me to say an honest word. All those whom I have contacted in Taipei in the workers&rsquo; homes, the bookroom, or the business office have not committed great mistakes, but they are very loose. If this continues, in the long run the serving ones will surely not have much future and usefulness. I know what I am saying. If some of them were to go into business, they would not make any money, and if they were to serve in the military, they would not win a war.</p>
<p>I do not desire to give those of you who serve full time a difficult time. I treasure your consecration. Every time I consider before the Lord how you have given your precious futures into the Lord&rsquo;s hand, I am almost in tears. Nevertheless, I have to tell you that you are too loose. Your looseness not only ruins yourselves but also causes you to fall short in your consecration. If you continue to be loose, in the long run your desire to be useful to the Lord will never be accomplished. You desire to be for the Lord, but your looseness will make you useless in His hands. If you continue to be loose, you will definitely become useless to Him, not to mention in other matters as well.</p>
<p>If you work in secular society, no matter what profession you are in, the environment will never allow you to be loose. Whether you are scholars, farmers, laborers, or merchants, once you enter into a certain field, the environment will force you to accomplish something. If you are a chef, you will need to cook gourmet dishes. Competition is everywhere in every profession. Even chauffeurs must compete. What causes full-time serving ones to be so loose is that in the Lord&rsquo;s service there is no salary or position, and no one seems to care whether or not you do well. Outwardly speaking, to serve full time is most noble. It also helps preserve a person&rsquo;s morality. However, it is also a risky matter. It is easy for those who serve full time to become loose in character and inefficient in handling matters, because they face no competition, do not need to worry about the future, and undergo no examinations or evaluations. Every serving one is free to grow and develop on his own and according to his conscience.</p>
<p>If the full-time serving ones do not have a serious attitude, they will become very loose. All men are fallen. If a person is loose for two or three years, he is through. This is especially true of the young people. Once they become accustomed to being loose, it is a real problem. This is my greatest concern and worry in regard to the young full-time serving ones. Unless we deal with this looseness and gird ourselves up, those serving full time will not be of much use in their future service. This is an extremely serious matter. It is said that if a man has been a preacher for four years, he is good for nothing else. Whether or not this word is too much depends upon how we conduct ourselves.</p>
<p>Young co-workers, you should not wait for others to gird you up. You have to gird yourself up. When a matter is committed into your hand, you must learn to do it thoroughly and solidly. You need to learn to gird yourself up. You should not be loose in what you do, and you should not overstep what you have been given to do. For example, if you live in the workers&rsquo; home, you should not be loose in regard to how loud your voice is, because you are not the only person living there. Since there are many persons living in the workers&rsquo; home, you should be strict even in the matter of your voice. This is not to be strict with others but with yourself. In every matter there are lessons to learn. The more lessons you learn, the more you will become sensitive to different situations. As soon as you encounter a situation, you will have a sense as to how to conduct yourself. The reason we are loose and insensitive is that we are not strict with ourselves.</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has become warmer, yet those serving full time still gave heavy blankets to the guests in the workers&rsquo; home. The one in charge of the general affairs had no feeling about this. I do not believe that he did this to save money, because we are not short of money. Neither did he do this because he was not happy to receive guests, because we are all zealous to provide hospitality. Rather, he did this because of his looseness. His sensitivity to the needs of the service did not keep pace with the service. If we are providing hospitality, when we cover ourselves with a blanket at night, we should immediately consider what kind of blankets the guests are using.</p>
<p>In every matter someone should take responsibility, and he should be given clear instructions in regard to all the principles and details. Every matter should be done thoroughly, and everything should be well prepared. As soon as a person realizes that something is missing, he should replenish it immediately. Whenever something wears out, it should be fixed at once, and whatever is broken should be replaced immediately. In regard to the principles and details, we should provide clear instructions. For the past few days I have been very busy, yet it was I, not the one responsible, who first noticed and had a feeling regarding the heavy blankets. This may not be a big mistake, but neither is it the proper way to handle matters. If a person who does things in this way were to lead an army into battle, he would definitely lose the battle. If he were to invest in business, he would definitely lose money. Those serving full time must bear in mind that if their looseness remains unchanged, the work will have no future.</p>
<p>All those who know how to work are innovative. If there is nothing to do, they will find something to do. If there is something to do, they will do it in a thorough and solid way. However, among us the situation is exactly the opposite. Everyone is relaxed as if there were nothing to do. Even when there is something to do, it is not done thoroughly. If those serving full time do not change their character, we will have no hope for the future. May we all be girded up and learn to do things in a serious manner.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 3, The Organization of the Church &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
