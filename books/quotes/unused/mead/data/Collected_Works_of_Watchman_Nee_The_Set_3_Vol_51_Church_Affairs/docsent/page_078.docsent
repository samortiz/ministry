   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Charging Timothy to Keep the Commandment</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Finally, we should say more concerning what Paul said to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Timothy 6:13-14 says, "I charge you before God, who preserves all things in life, and Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate, to keep the commandment spotless.''</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You see how weighty a matter this is "I charge you before God, who preserves all things in life, and Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate, to keep the commandment spotless."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 20 says, "O Timothy, guard the deposit.''</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The commandment that I gave you, you need to guard.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please remember that the young brothers need to learn what has been entrusted to the older brothers and learn to obey them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then they will be able to walk the way ahead of them in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul Also Needing Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I hope that we can see how the work was carried out in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The work in the New Testament is one that has arrangements, authority, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe you still remember what I told you some days ago.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even though Timothy was a young brother, do you remember what was recorded in the book of Acts concerning what Paul did when Timothy came to him?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"When both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ" 18:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I feel that in the Bible this verse is the best.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul was one who knew the Lord and was used much by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet because Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, he was constrained by the word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With Paul, fellowship was also necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Timothy and Silas came, it was a great encouragement to him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is what you can see from Acts 18.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 17:14 says, "And immediately the brothers then sent Paul off, to go as far as the sea.''</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here Paul listened to the brothers' word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"And Silas and Timothy remained there.''</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"There'' refers to Berea, which is the name of a city in Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Macedonia is the name of a region, and Berea is the name of a city.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 15 says, "And those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible, they went off.''</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul commanded Silas and Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But after Paul went to Corinth, and after Silas and Timothy came to Corinth from Macedonia, Acts 18:5 says that Paul was constrained by the word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You see how good that situation was!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I hope that you brothers can see this principle in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we are like children learning to walk step by step, slowly walking before God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I hope that all the children of God would know how to have the mutual coordination in the work; then we will be able to do the work in a good way.</S>
