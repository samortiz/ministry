to Gain People with the Gospel</h2>
<p>The fifth aspect of our need concerns the campus work in every major city. The churches in Taipei, Tainan, and Kaohsiung should have a campus work. Taipei County has approximately two hundred junior high schools, high schools, junior colleges, and universities. If there were twenty brothers and sisters in every school, there would be four thousand saints who are students participating in the church life. This may seem difficult, but it is easy to attain if some working saints would receive a burden from the Lord and be led to go to a certain school for the campus work.</p>
<p>There are a few ways for the working saints to be involved in the campus work. First, they can teach in a school. Second, they can move close to a school into a spacious house where students can be contacted, come and sit for a while, and have a snack. Third, they can contact the staff and workers in the school. Fourth, they can use every available channel to gain an entrance into the school in order to contact the students. The student work requires patience; we should not be anxious for results. Some may work for a couple of months with no result, but at the end of the semester they will see the result. From our past practice in the United States, we know that the most effective way to gain people is to preach the gospel through the campus work. I believe this also applies to Taiwan.</p>
<p>We have presented five needs in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If the saints are willing to receive the burden and practice this fellowship, I believe that after a few years the Lord may bring us back to mainland China. Then He will be able to recover the situation in mainland China through the blessing received in the churches in Taiwan. How glorious this would be! However, the Lord may lead some of us to go to Southeast Asia, East Asia, Australia, or Europe. I believe that some brothers will go to Africa or South America. This is absolutely in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. I never dreamed that I would work for the Lord in the United States, but the Lord led me this way.</p>
<p>We have begun to take the first step, so we must be steady and go up step by step. We must receive a burden from the Lord before we take action. We need to bear the burden in the stronger churches, strengthen the testimony in the weaker churches, establish a church on the proper ground in satellite towns, pioneer the work and establish churches in rural communities, and contact students through preaching the gospel in schools. We all need to bring these five aspects of our need to the Lord in prayer in order to seek His leading.</p>
<p>We are not an organization, nor do we have someone who makes arrangements. However, we do not want to see someone act individualistically. Hence, we need to be led by the Lord, and we also need much mutual fellowship. We need to pray much before the Lord, and we also need to come together and pray. We may also need to fast and pray. In Acts 13 there were prophets and teachers in Antioch, in the local church, and &ldquo;as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them. Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away&rdquo; (vv. 2-3). This was not an arrangement according to human will. It was done in fellowship; it was not an individualistic action.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CALL FOR FULL-TIME SERVING ONES</h2>
<p>When we go and preach the gospel in different places for the Lord&rsquo;s need, we will encounter financial needs. According to the Bible, there is no such thing as professional preachers who are hired and given a salary. We must knock down such a concept. Every person who comes and goes should be an evangelist. Some may receive a particular commission. The function of their gift that is constituted with the grace of the Lord may become so great that they have no time or energy to care for other things; they care only for the things of the Lord. Hence, there is a need for them to serve full time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Scriptural Basis</h2>
<p>Even though the term <em>full time</em> is not used in the Bible, there is such a fact. First Corinthians 9:7-9 says, &ldquo;What soldier ever serves by his own wages? Who plants a vineyard and does not partake of its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not partake of the milk of the flock? Am I speaking these things according to man? Or does the law not also say these things? For in the law of Moses it is written: &lsquo;You shall not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain.&rsquo; Is it for oxen that God cares?&rdquo; Verses 13 and 14 say, &ldquo;Do you not know that those who labor on the sacred things eat the things of the sacred temple, that those who attend to the altar have their portion with the altar? So also the Lord directed those who announce the gospel to live from the gospel.&rdquo; These verses speak of evangelists needing the supply from others. This is proof that those who preach the gospel do not sustain their living with a job. They spend all their time on the gospel and live from the gospel. We should not misunderstand living from the gospel to mean that preachers are hired and given a salary.</p>
<p>Verse 9 says, &ldquo;You shall not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain.&rdquo; This means that an ox treading out the grain to feed others should be fed first. This verse does not refer to the giving of a salary. Verse 13 says, &ldquo;Those who labor on the sacred things eat the things of the sacred temple.&rdquo; This does not mean that they are given a salary; it means that their needs are supplied. These verses show that in the early church there were full-time serving ones who did not have an occupation but devoted their time and energy to the gospel. As a result, their needs had to be supplied by others.</p>
<p>First Timothy 5:17 says, &ldquo;Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.&rdquo; This shows that in the early churches some elders also served full time. The word <em>honor</em> implies material supply. Some elders were apt to lead and administrate the church, and they also labored to proclaim the Lord&rsquo;s word and teach the believers. They were full-timers without an occupation. Therefore, they needed the supply from others.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Age of the One New Man &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
