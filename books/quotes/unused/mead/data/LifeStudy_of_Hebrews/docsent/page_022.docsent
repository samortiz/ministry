   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. In the Coming Age of the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you know the Bible as a whole, you will realize that the coming inhabited earth will be this earth in the coming age with God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 2:8 says that God has given to Christ the nations to be His inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for His possession.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Revelation 11:15 says, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The day is coming perhaps it will be soon when the nations, the kingdoms, of the earth will become the kingdom of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to Daniel 2:35, at the time of the coming back of the Lord Jesus there will be on the earth nations represented by an image of iron, clay, brass, silver, and gold.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All of these elements represent the earthly kingdoms.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suddenly a stone cut out without hands Dan 2:34 will descend out of heaven and will break in pieces the iron, clay, brass, silver, and gold.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Daniel 2:35 reveals that the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This stone which becomes a mountain is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The stone cut out without hands that breaks in pieces the earthly kingdoms is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is not only the foundation stone Isa 28:16 , cornerstone Matt 21:42; Acts 4:11 , topstone Zech 4:7 , and living stone 1 Pet 2:4 for God s building; He is also the stumbling stone Matt 21:44; 1 Pet 2:8 to the unbelieving Jews and the smiting stone to the nations Matt 21:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Firstly, for the believers, He is a stone for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the stone for God s building, He is the foundation stone, cornerstone, topstone, and living stone to produce us as stones for God s building 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Secondly, in relation to the unbelieving Jews, He is a stumbling stone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The unbelieving Jews have stumbled over Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not think that the Lord Jesus is always kind to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To the unbelieving Jews, at least, He will be the stumbling stone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thirdly, to the Gentiles, the nations, the Lord will be the smiting stone that descends out of heaven to smite all the kingdoms of the earth into pieces Dan 2:34-35, 44 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This smiting stone will become a great mountain, meaning that the Lord Jesus will become the kingdom filling the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This kingdom, the great mountain that fills the whole earth, is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time, the earth will be the Lord s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is what Hebrews 2:5 refers to as the coming inhabited earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The coming inhabited earth denotes the earth having become the Lord s kingdom in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This may happen soon.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This coming inhabited earth in the coming age is not subjected to angels.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, God never ordained the angels to rule over that earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has ordained man to rule over the earth in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Based upon this fact, the writer of Hebrews shows us that man is superior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this aspect, that of ruling over the earth in the coming age, man is superior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In His economy, God intended from the very beginning that man should rule over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From eternity past, God determined to have man ruling over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the Bible, at the time of creation, God determined that man should exercise His authority over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is clearly mentioned in Genesis 1:26-28.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are three chapters in the Bible that belong together Genesis 1, Psalm 8, and Hebrews 2.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All of these chapters share one main point that God has ordained man to rule over His created earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why has God ordained man to rule over the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because God needs a realm, a sphere, a dominion, in which He can exercise His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without such a dominion in which He can exercise His authority, it would be difficult for God to express His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The expression of His glory needs a dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suppose God had no authority on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How could He come to express His glory?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do you remember the conclusion of the Lord s prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is, For thine is the kingdom, and the authority, and the glory Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>. Once there is the kingdom, there is the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then God is able to express His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The kingdom is for the authority, and the authority is for the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If God has no kingdom, then there can be no exercise of His authority and no expression of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord s prayer was for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In that kingdom there would be the exercise of authority and the expression of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God s purpose is constant and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God s purpose is from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God has never changed His purpose of having man exercise His authority on earth that He might have a dominion as a sphere in which He can express His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church life today is a dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every local church is a dominion where God s glory is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is why today s church life is the kingdom Rom 14:17 on a small scale.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although it is not the kingdom in full scale, it is at least the kingdom in small scale, signifying the same things in the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The proper church life is God s kingdom where He exercises His authority that He might express His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This was His purpose in creating man.</S>
