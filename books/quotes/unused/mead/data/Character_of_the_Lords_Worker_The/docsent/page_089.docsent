   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The same can be said about our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should not overeat, and we should not be too restricted in the variety of food we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should learn to eat all kinds of food.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some brothers and sisters cannot eat this and that and many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are not too many things that they can eat; this is not a healthy habit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to learn to eat a wide variety of food.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many things can provide nourishment to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we will only eat a few things, we are not doing our body any good.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may not feel that we are short in nutrition now, but when we become thirty or forty years old, our lack of certain nutrients will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our health will be damaged, and our life will be shortened.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our life is governed by the things we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why we have to learn to eat a wide variety of food.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another advantage for having a wide variety in our diet is that we are not inconvenienced in any way when we are sent out in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who cannot accommodate a wide variety of food will not be able to tolerate many things when they are in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They cannot eat things that are too cold or too hot.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They will encounter much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is a different story if we are sick; we have to take care of our health.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But under ordinary circumstances, we have to learn to eat as many different kinds of food as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus said, "Eat what is set before you" Luke 10:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a good guiding principle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once a believer asked another believer on a ship, "Why did the Lord Jesus give loaves and fishes to the multitude?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The other replied, "The riches of the sea plus the riches of the land."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a very good answer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's children should learn to take all the riches of the sea and all the riches of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The range of food we eat should be wide; the variety should be great.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brothers and sisters, do not think that this is a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not control and discipline ourselves in this matter, our body will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to make our body our slave.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the beginning we may find this difficult; we may find some food unpalatable to our taste.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But we have to discipline ourselves by forcing ourselves to eat those things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, we have to have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the other hand, we have to learn to take care of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to be able to suffer hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When hardship comes our way, we have to be ready to sacrifice our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some brothers are afraid of hardship; they cannot take this and that and many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such ones are useless in the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Similarly, we have no sympathy for those brothers who do not exercise care for their own body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brothers and sisters, it is harder to be health conscious than to not be health conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not think that it is easy to talk about health.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to take care of our body, we have to learn to control ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A person must exercise self-control before he can be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to learn to eat things that are beneficial to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our eating cannot be dictated by our taste; it should be dictated by what our body needs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to learn to take good care of our body and to use it properly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We cannot allow our body to break down easily.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord has spent many years working on us; we cannot deal with our body lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to take care of all precautions against disease.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If at all possible, and if the Lord so arranges, we should do our best to fulfill the requirements of good health and to eat things that are beneficial to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not expose our body to risks unnecessarily.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Timothy was advised to take some wine, because that was beneficial to his health.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not drink anything that is harmful to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Always take things that are beneficial to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a matter of principle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the one hand, we have to deny self-love and be faithful unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the other hand, when we do not have a specific charge from the Lord, we should take good care of our own body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we go to a place to work, we should try our best to take care of our hygiene.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But we should not burden the local brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the environment is not up to the proper standard of hygiene, we have to learn to trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But when circumstances allow, we should try our best to take care of hygiene.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This will spare our body of much unnecessary damage.</S>
