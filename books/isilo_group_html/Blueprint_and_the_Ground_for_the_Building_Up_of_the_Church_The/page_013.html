<p>We should apply the revelation concerning the building and location of the temple in the Old Testament to the building and ground of the church. The location for the building of the temple implies the ground of the church. According to church history, many truths in the Bible were recovered in the eighteenth century by brothers such as J. N. Darby, but they were still unclear concerning the ground of the church. These brothers saw that the churches in every locality are independent in administration, but they were unclear regarding the ground. The truth concerning the ground was not made clear until 1934. Brother Nee spent considerable time studying the Bible concerning the boundary of the church. He saw that the church can be established only according to a locality, such as the church in Jerusalem, the church in Antioch, and the church in Ephesus (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 2:1). The establishing of one church in a locality is the ground for establishing the church.</p>
<p>We cannot establish a local church in a factory or in a school. A local church can be established only in a city. However, there are many details related to taking the ground. If there is already a local church in a city, another church cannot be established there; just as when there was a temple on the threshing floor of Ornan, another temple could not be built. An Israelite could accept only that temple and be joined to that temple. Suppose a brother goes to Tainan, and there is no church there. He has the liberty to establish a church because Tainan is a ground on which a church can be established. If there is already a church in Tainan, then he does not have the qualification or the liberty to establish another church. Taipei is also a locality, a ground, where a church can be established. However, since there is already a church in Taipei, another church cannot be established. The ground for establishing the church in Taipei has already been taken; hence, there is no ground on which to establish any other church. Believers can accept only the church in a locality and be blended into that church. Only thus can the oneness be kept wherever the church is expressed.</p>
<p>The thought that the church can be established apart from the ground of locality will produce many grounds and result in division. Once a church already exists in a locality, it is wrong to establish other churches in the same locality out of convenience for the believers. Regrettably, some believers have established churches outside the ground of locality. If we do not hold fast to the unique ground, the oneness of the church will easily be damaged.</p>
<p>If the children of Israel did not have the threshing floor of Ornan as the unique ground for the temple, many temples might have been built. Some Israelites could have built a square temple of wood overlaid with gold, and others, a long temple with the same material. Thus, the children of Israel would have been separated, and their worship of God would have been divided. God&rsquo;s people must be united in their worship. Once the worship of God is divided, God&rsquo;s people are divided. This means that once the place where we meet and worship God is divided, we are divided. Therefore, God, according to His wisdom, determined that there would be only one ground for establishing the church. That one ground is the unique ground of locality. There is no other ground allowed besides this ground.</p>
<p>The ground is the locality of a city, where people dwell and gather. Upon this ground the church&mdash;and only one church&mdash;may be established. Once a church is established, no other church can be established. All of God&rsquo;s children in that locality should be joined to that local church to keep the one ground. Only thus can God&rsquo;s children be kept from division, even though their opinions may differ. A believer may have opinions, but he does not have the liberty to establish another church. A brother may advocate baptism by immersion, but he cannot take that view of baptism as a ground on which to set up a church. Believers may hold different views on baptism, but they cannot and should not establish a church based on their view. However, for many years God&rsquo;s children have violated the unique ground and caused many divisions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUOTING THE SCRIPTURES ERRONEOUSLY</h2>
<p>Once the ground of the church is violated, not only can many churches be established in a city, but it is possible to establish the church on the ground of doctrine or practice. Opposers erroneously quote Matthew 18:20, which says, &ldquo;Where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.&rdquo; Based on this verse, they say that as long as two or three believers are gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name, the Lord is in their midst, and they are the church. However, we insist on the ground of the church because, according to the revelation in the Bible, only one church can be established in a city. There is no basis and no authority to establish the church on any other ground.</p>
<p>In Matthew 18:20 the Lord said that His disciples can be gathered into His name no matter where they are and that He will be in their midst, but He did not say that such a gathering is the church. In verses 16 through 17 the Lord said that if there is a problem between two or three, they should &ldquo;tell it to the church.&rdquo; These verses indicate that the two or three are not the church. The Bible does not say that the gathering of two or three believers is the church. We must be scriptural and not establish other grounds. Only the ground of locality can close the doors to church division.</p>
<p>A brother may advocate baptism by immersion or favor head covering, but no matter what he advocates or favors, he does not have the liberty to establish churches apart from the unique ground. In the Old Testament God told the children of Israel that they could not worship Him in the place of their choice. They had to worship God in the place that He chose to put His name (Deut. 12:5, 8, 11). God would not allow the children of Israel to build another temple besides the one built on the threshing floor of Ornan. The Israelites had to strictly comply with and practice this command. Regrettably, in the New Testament age God&rsquo;s people neglect this. Some believers are bold and use many excuses to come together outside the ground of locality and even set up so-called &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; churches. The desire to seek spirituality and holiness is good. But this desire has become an excuse for divisions among God&rsquo;s people, producing justification churches, holiness churches, and spiritual churches. Division should be condemned. The desire to preach the gospel in a factory is not a reason to establish a church in the factory. The excuse of preaching the gospel must be removed. Division cannot be justified, but rather it must be condemned. We must see the importance of the ground.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Blueprint and the Ground for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
