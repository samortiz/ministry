   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 9 DAY 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Gal 2:20 I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me...</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>4:19 My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Phil 1:20 According to my earnest expectation and hope that...Christ will be magnified in my body...</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Experiencing and Enjoying Christ</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is not merely our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, He is God, man, the Spirit, our wisdom righteousness, sanctification, and redemption our life within, and the One who is all-inclusive and unsearchably rich.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No Longer We Living, but Christ Living in Us</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul said that Christ is the treasure that we contain as earthen vessels, vessels that are worthless and fragile 2 Cor 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are earthen vessels, yet within us, the earthen vessels, is Christ as the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, to experience and enjoy Christ, we first must not live by ourselves but let Christ live in us Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ Being Formed in Us</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Galatians 4:19 Paul says, My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that we need to pass through a period of travailing in order for Christ to be formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we were newly saved, the life in us was like an infant in the beginning stage of pregnancy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is our life, but at first we do not have much inner sense of life and do not know how to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It takes nine months of pregnancy for a baby to be fully formed in the mother s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Likewise, we need to continually practice living by Him and thus pass through a time of travailing that Christ may be formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What kind of life should we live today as Christians?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Is it merely a life of normal human relationships or a life of morality?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should live a life of having Christ formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not an easy thing because we are too natural and too accustomed to living by our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Unconsciously we still live a proper life, a righteous life, but not a life of having Christ formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not live by Christ, we still cannot have Christ formed in us even if we have no faults.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To have Christ formed in us and to be faultless are altogether two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Copper and gold may be very much alike in appearance, but their inner content is altogether different, and their degree of preciousness is also quite distinct.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may live by our natural life and even become perfect men, but we are still human beings; we are merely copper, not gold.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only a life that allows Christ to be formed in us is a life of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Magnifying Christ</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Philippians 1:20 Paul said, According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What Paul hoped for here was not that morality, kindness, normal human relationships, or patience may be magnified, but that Christ may be magnified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our problem today is that after we are saved, we keep trying to be a proper Christian living a pure and faultless life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whereas formerly we had an irritable temperament, now we hope to be gentle; whereas in the past we had a wrong attitude, now we hope to be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, even if we become faultless, that is still not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The question is, What do we express?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether we express temper or patience, both are wrong because neither is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The only One whom we should express is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>57</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the apostle s suffering in his body, Christ was magnified, that is, shown or declared to be great without limitation , exalted, and extolled.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The apostle s sufferings afforded him opportunity to express Christ in His unlimited greatness....To magnify Christ under any circumstances is to experience Him with the topmost enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>58</S>
