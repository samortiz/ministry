   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE WORKS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The next question is this: How does this law work?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a harder question.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You must realize it is altogether inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We cannot tell to the uttermost how this law works.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can only say that according to our experiences we realize how this law works.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It works through divinity, the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It works through humanity, the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It works through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Incarnation must be repeated again and again daily in your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And it works through crucifixion, through the wonderful all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It works through the defeat of Satan and the destruction of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It works through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It works through ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It works through all these ingredients of today s processed God who is the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the indwelling Spirit works in us, He works through all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When this law works in you, it spontaneously brings you the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It spontaneously functions to do the killing, the defeating, and the destroying.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the next message we have to find out the scientific knowledge of the way this law works in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is somewhat like modern medicine, like an antibiotic.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It works through many different ways to heal you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 8 gives us an all-inclusive scientific dose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It works within us in a scientific way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christians today are far off although they teach many things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Few have touched the very focus of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why Romans 8 remains nearly untouched.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But today I believe the Lord would unveil and uncover this chapter to show us the depths of His economy in very much detail.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to spend the time to consider how the law works through divinity and through humanity and through the crucifixion and through the defeating of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Due to the ignorance and blindness of the Christians throughout the centuries, this chapter has remained closed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason there has been very little Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all have to admit that through the centuries there has been very little Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even up to this day there is little Body life because the secret of how to have the Body life has not been unveiled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It has been under the cover here in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must see how this law is just the processed, all-inclusive God as the all-inclusive Spirit indwelling us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We also must see how this law works scientifically through all the ingredients which are incorporated in this wonderful Being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As long as this wonderful Being exists in us, He Himself as a law works through all that He has and all that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many of us can testify that our prayer to overcome sin was seldom answered.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our prayer not to lose our temper was seldom answered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why among Christians there is little victory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although the Christians who have received mercy of God try their best to love the Lord, actually not much really works within them in an effective way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because Romans 8 has been still shut up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It has not been opened up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I hope that we can all see there is a living Person who is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And this law as a living Person works through whatever He is and whatever He has.</S>
