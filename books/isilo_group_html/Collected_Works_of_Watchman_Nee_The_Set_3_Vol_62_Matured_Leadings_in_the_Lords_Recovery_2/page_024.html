Paul began with the word Paulos, his own name. Following this, he spoke of his three qualifications. These three qualifications qualify the noun-subject (Paulos). This is like a business card in which the name of a person appears first, followed by his titles.</p><p>Paul spoke in a defensive tone in his letter to the Roman Christians. This is because men at that time could not easily accept the gospel. Paul did not use his own name when he wrote the book of Hebrews. But in Romans 1:1 he put down his own name and showed his qualifications. This is the authority by which he was commissioned for the preaching of the gospel. In this declaration he said that he was not only called but also separated unto the gospel of God. The gospel of God is the gospel that Paul preached.</p><p>Verses 2 through 6 give an overall explanation of this gospel, because the predicate does not appear until verse 7. Verse 7 is a new beginning. The words in verses 2 through 6 are parenthetical words. In the New Testament, we find at least fifty to sixty such parenthetical passages.</p><p>William Kelly was a great Bible expositor of the last century. He was a doctor in theology but later gave up his theological degree. Over seventy years ago when he wrote about the word servant in Romans 1:1, he pointed out that a servant is a slave. In man's eyes such a person is lowly, but it was different for Paul. He was a slave of Christ Jesus. Paul seemed to be boasting about this. Outsiders probably cannot understand what he was saying. Only those who know the liberty and sanctification of grace can boast of such a title&mdash;"a slave of Christ Jesus." No one else is taught this way, and no one else can enjoy this privilege. We are called saints, but Paul was a called apostle. Apostleship is not hereditary or self-appointed, but commissioned and separated by God. Paul was an apostle for the gospel of God. Why did he not say the gospel of Christ? Although the gospel was accomplished by Christ, the source of this gospel is God. No doubt, the gospel can only be found in Christ and through Christ. But "the gospel of God" points us to God as the ultimate source of the gospel.</p><p>William R. Newell is an American Bible expositor. He told us that in the beginning of the book of Romans we only find the name of Paul, not Silas, Timothy, or other brothers. Only he was called by Christ to be an apostle to the Gentiles (Gal. 2:8-9) and a herald of the gospel in that age. The book of Ephesians also bears only the name of Paul. This is because he was the only one who saw the great revelation of Ephesians. At the beginning of Romans, he calls himself a slave, one bought with a price. This expression speaks of his most noble aspiration. The word called is used three times from verse 1 through verse 7. Calling is God's act of designation and separation. In verse 6 the saints are "the called ones of Jesus Christ." The believers are given to Christ by the Father (John 17). They were joined to Him before there was even the history of the world: "Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world" (Eph. 1:4). Romans 1:7 speaks of the called saints (not called to be saints). This does not mean that we are asked to become saints&mdash;a teaching of the Catholic Church. We are called under God's sovereignty as saints. We are the holy ones, those who are washed by Christ's blood and who are created in Christ. This is what we are. Even the angels did not become angels through a process of sanctification; they were created angels. This is what Paul means when he says that he was called.</p><p>Paul was called and summoned for the gospel of God. The gospel is God's glad tidings. It is God who loves the world. It is God who sent His Son to us. Hence, the gospel is the message that tells us about God's love. This was Paul's commission.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE "APOSTLE"</h2><p>Watchman Nee: Ephesians 4:8 says that the Lord gave apostles to His church after His ascension. However, we know that the twelve apostles were appointed before His ascension. Hence, the apostles appointed after His ascension were different from the twelve apostles. Even in the kingdom age, their position will be different. The twelve apostles will not only reign and rule with the Lord, but will sit on the twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel (Matt. 19:28).</p><p>In 1 Corinthians 15, Paul talked about his experience of being called to be an apostle. He said that the Lord appeared directly to him and called him. In verse 5 he said that Christ appeared to "the twelve." In verse 7 he said that the Lord appeared to James, the brother of the Lord. The same verse also says that the Lord appeared also "to all the apostles." These apostles certainly were not the twelve apostles. Perhaps they refer to an ordinary group of apostles who were appointed by the Holy Spirit to continue the work of the first apostles.</p><p>Acts 13 speaks of Paul and Barnabas being called by the Holy Spirit to be apostles to the Gentiles. Of the original twelve apostles, Judas died on account of his evil. Some people do not consider Matthias to be one of the twelve and artificially put Paul as one of the twelve apostles. But Acts 1 says that Matthias was "counted with the eleven apostles" (vv. 24-26). In chapter two it says, "Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth" (v. 14). This shows us that the Holy Spirit recognized Matthias as being one of the twelve apostles. Paul was an apostle; so was Barnabas. Even Silas and Timothy were called apostles. Romans 16:7 shows us clearly that Andronicus and Junia were apostles also.</p><p>Revelation 2:2 speaks of false apostles. This book was written between the end of A.D. 95 and the beginning of A.D. 96. At that time John was old, and most of the apostles of that age were dead. John was the only one left. It was difficult to know who were real apostles and who were false. Therefore, the Lord Jesus said that apostles must be tested.</p><p>Apostles are those who are sent out by God's grace. The death of the twelve apostles did not terminate the lineage of apostleship. In Roman Catholicism, the pope at the Vatican appoints himself as an apostle. The term apostle carries a special significance and status because of this. This is wrong. One item to be recovered in the Bible is the producing of apostles. Neither Paul nor I can be counted as one of the twelve. Yet we can still be apostles. The proof of apostleship is first in God's sending and then in the church's confirmation.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 62: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (2) &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
