 <h2 class="head1">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Our problem today is that although we may know how to love the Lord with our heart and how to read and meditate upon the Scriptures with our mind, we simply do not know how to exercise our spirit to take in the Lord. I have met many brothers and sisters who love the Lord very much, who read the Scriptures, and who can recite many verses. However, most of them do not know anything about taking the Lord in by using their spirit. We often use the wrong organ, trying to take the Lord in by using our heart or our mind. We must realize that the Lord is the Spirit and that the only way we can contact Him and take Him in is by using our spirit (2 Cor. 3:17; John 4:24). The part of our being that the Lord enters into is our spirit. Thus, we must know the difference between using the heart and using the spirit. In dealing with the Lord we must exercise to have a sincere, loving heart, but we also need to use our spirit. We must all ask ourselves whether we have had some experience of taking in the Lord by using our spirit.</p>
<p>Why is it that we may love the Word and be able to recite many verses, yet be unable to pray? This is because although our mind may be sharp and our heart may be proper, our spirit is weak and lacks exercise. Many Christians like to talk about the things of the Lord and to study the Scriptures, but when you ask them to pray, they become silent. They are happy and active in their mind and heart, but they are weak in their spirit. When we come together, our spirit should be active, living, and strong. Our spirit should be so strong, living, and active that we cannot waste time talking but must pray by using our spirit. Our situation today is abnormal; we use our mind and exercise our heart very much, but we neglect our spirit. We do not use it or exercise it, thinking that it is enough for us to understand the Lord and love the Lord. We must realize that even though we may love Him with our heart and understand Him with our mind, He may still be somewhat objective to us. If we want Him to be subjective to us, we must take Him in, receive Him, eat Him, and drink Him with our spirit.</p>
<p>In China I would often meet two kinds of Christians. One kind comprised the professors, medical doctors, and college students. They loved the Lord and studied the Word, and when you met with them, they would have many wonderful and interesting things to say about the Word. The professors would speak about the Bible from a scientific point of view, and the doctors would speak about the Bible from a medical point of view. However, if you asked them to close their books, close their eyes, and pray, they would become very quiet. On the other hand, sometimes I would go to a village to visit some saints who did not have much education. Some of the older women, even though they could not read, would pray all the time. You could not speak very much to them, because they would not understand, but if you asked them to pray, they would seize the opportunity. They were very active and living to pray aloud. The more I talked with those professors and doctors, the more deadened I became. However, the more I contacted those villagers, the more living I became, and the more my spirit was refreshed, satisfied, and strengthened. This proves that what we need is not only to love the Lord with our heart but also to exercise our spirit to contact and receive the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PROPER HEART</h2>
<p>The Scriptures tell us that our first need is a new heart (Ezek. 36:26a). If we do not have a heart that loves the Lord, nothing can be done. We also need a new spirit (v. 26b). We must exercise our heart to love the Lord and exercise our spirit to contact, take, receive, eat, and drink the Lord. While we are loving the Lord with our heart, we must exercise to contact the Lord with our spirit. However, if we are going to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord, our heart must first be adjusted; that is, we must have a proper heart.</p>
<p>We must be adjusted in the four parts of our heart in order to have a heart that is proper. First, we must have a pure conscience, a conscience without any kind of offense and without condemnation (Acts 24:16). We must be purified in our conscience (Heb. 9:14). This means that we must confess all our sins, trespasses, and faults (1 John 1:9). Our heart can never be right if there is a feeling of condemnation in our conscience. This will affect the ability of our spirit to contact the Lord in a proper way. Thus, we must deal with our conscience until it is pure and at peace.</p>
<p>Next, we must deal with our mind. Our mind must be simple. Second Corinthians 11:3 says, &ldquo;I fear lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your thoughts would be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity toward Christ.&rdquo; The word <em>simplicity</em> refers to the simplicity of our mind toward Christ. If we have lost the simplicity of our mind toward the Lord, this is an indication that the enemy has corrupted our mind. We must be simplified in our mind. As Christians we are often complicated regarding spiritual matters. When we are asked whether we love the Lord, we may say, &ldquo;Yes, I love the Lord, but...&rdquo; If you ask the saints whether they would like to pray, they may say, &ldquo;Oh, yes, but...&rdquo; The brothers may say, &ldquo;Yes, but I have to go to work.&rdquo; The sisters may say, &ldquo;Yes, but I have to take care of the children.&rdquo; Everyone has an excuse. This is the complexity of the enemy. Do not say &ldquo;but&rdquo; to the Lord; say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the enemy. Do not let your mind be corrupted by the enemy from the simplicity toward Christ.</p>
<p>Next, our will must be meek and soft toward the Lord. If our will is hard and unyielding toward the Lord, our heart will be wrong. If we have a stubborn will, our relationship with the Lord will be spoiled. We must have a will that is soft, submissive, and meek toward the Lord; then our heart and spirit will be proper.</p>
<p>Finally, our emotions must be full of love toward the Lord. The more we love the Lord the better. It would be best if we were beside ourselves with love for the Lord (2 Cor. 5:13-14). I am concerned that many of you have never been beside yourselves and are still more or less cold Christians. If you are a Christian, your heart must be so hot that you are beside yourself. Our conscience must be pure, our mind must be simple, our will must be soft, and our emotions must be full of love. This is a proper heart, the kind of heart that will be a help to our spirit in contacting the Lord.</p>
<p>After dealing with the four parts of our heart so that our heart is right and proper toward the Lord, we must exercise our spirit to contact the Lord. Then our spirit will be strengthened and satisfied, and our heart will be filled with the Lord and will become a home for the Lord. Ephesians 3:16-17 says, &ldquo;That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&rdquo; When our heart has been adjusted and our spirit is exercised, our heart can be an abode for the Lord. We will be filled with the Lord in our spirit and our heart. The Lord will occupy our entire being and be formed in us until we are transformed and conformed to His image (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29). This is real transformation&mdash;the mingling of God with us&mdash;and the issue of this mingling is the oneness of the Body. May we take care of these matters and practice them day by day.</p>
