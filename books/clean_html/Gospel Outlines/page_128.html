<h1 class="title">THE SALVATION OF ONE WHO OPPOSED THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Acts 9:1-19</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>One who served God zealously also opposed the Lord
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Saul, a young man serving God with zeal, was an orthodox religionist. He was not only an orthodox Jew, but also an orthodox Jewish religionist. He received the orthodox teaching of Judaism. Not only was he not a Gentile, he was even a Jew who feared God.</li>
	<li>Though he served God with zeal, he, in his zeal, became one who opposed God.</li>
	<li>He then obtained letters authorizing him to bind those who called on the name of Jesus. On the one hand he zealously served God, on the other hand he opposed Christ.</li>
	<li>The fact that he could oppose Christ at the same time he was serving God with zeal shows that there is a difference between believing in Christ and being zealous for religion. Do not think that serving God is believing in Christ. Many serve God and are zealous for religion, but they offend the Lord more than those that love the world and live in sin. You may be very zealous for religion, but your zealous activities are opposing Christ. <em>Elaborate fully on this point. It is important to let people see that believing in Christ is entirely different from being zealous for religion.</em></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ met him
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When Saul was zealously serving God, that is, opposing Christ with zeal, unexpectedly, Christ met him.</li>
	<li>He knew that there was such a man as Jesus, but he did not know that Jesus was the Christ. According to him all the preaching about Christ was false. Today there are also many who have some concept of Jesus but fail to realize that Jesus is God, Christ, and the Savior. Today these people consider as false the preaching that Jesus Christ is God.</li>
	<li>During the time he thought that the preaching about Christ was false and unbelievable, he met Christ. It was obvious that he had met Christ, yet he still asked, &ldquo;Who art Thou, Lord?&rdquo; The Lord answered, &ldquo;I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s salvation is not a doctrine, not mere hearsay, but a living Lord whose name is Jesus. He is God and He is Christ. Every man can turn from opposing and not believing in Christ to believing in Christ as soon as he meets Christ. Many have listened to preaching for years and yet have not met Christ. Today men can oppose many doctrines, but they cannot oppose the living Lord. One day the Lord will meet you.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The result of being met by the Lord
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>You will see the light. Before, this man served God with zeal, but he had no light. Once Christ meets you, then you have the light. Some have been pastors for twenty years, or have been elders for eighteen years, but they are still in darkness, without any light. Not only pastors and elders may be in this kind of condition, but also many other religionists.</li>
	<li>You will fall down. You cannot get up again. You cannot go on the same way you went before. The way you acted as a pastor or an elder cannot continue. You cannot go to the movies any more. All your activities have been terminated.</li>
	<li>You will become blind. The light is indeed bright, but you do not see. This is a paradox. Before, when you were a pastor or an elder, you had a way to handle everything. Now everything is unclear. Whenever your concept about things becomes unclear, you know that Christ has met you.</li>
	<li>You will go into the city to wait for someone to teach you.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>What should be done after meeting Christ
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Repent.</li>
	<li>Believe.</li>
	<li>Be baptized.</li>
	<li>Serve Christ.<br />
	<em>The above four points must be expounded according to the record of the Bible.</em></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The result of this change
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>You will preach Christ and testify Christ.</li>
	<li>For Christ&rsquo;s sake you will suffer persecution. Just as Saul persecuted others formerly, after he believed, he was then persecuted by others.</li>
	</ol></li>
