God is one, yet He has a distinction of three. The purpose of the Divine Trinity is to work Himself into His created man. Because He wants to enter into us, He has to be triune. He must be the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, at the same time being one entity.<p>In the Bible, the book that speaks most thoroughly and clearly concerning God being triune is the Gospel of John.<p>Forty or more years ago, when I first went to Taiwan, a friend of mine once sent me a big watermelon. When my children saw it, they were very happy. They asked what should be done to it. I took the melon to the kitchen, cut it into pieces, and pressed it into juice. Then I gave the drink to the children. In the end, the melon became part of the children&#8217;s constitution. Hence, in order that the whole melon could enter into the children through their little mouths, it had to pass through this process.<p>In the same way, our God is triune for the purpose of working Himself into us. He is the Father, the whole melon. He is also the Son, being cut into pieces. He is also the Spirit, being pressed into juice. In order for a big melon to enter into man, it must pass through all these processes. These steps are the stages of the dispensing. Not only does the melon need to be dispensed, but it must also be digested and assimilated into the constitution of man. In the same way, the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-has been processed to become the life-giving Spirit so that we can drink Him and so that He can become our element. This is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.<h2 class=head1>THE DIVINE TRINITY- THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT</h2><h2 class=head2>The Father Expressed in the Son- the Son Being the Embodiment of the Father</h2><p>The Gospel of John speaks of the truth concerning the Triune God in a most profound way. First, it shows us that the Father is expressed in the Son. In other words, the Son is the embodiment of the Father. In John 14, one of the Lord&#8217;s disciples, Philip, said to the Lord, &#8220;Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us.&#8221; Jesus said to him, &#8220;Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father...The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me&#8221; (vv. 8-11). Hence, the Son is the embodiment of the Father, and He expresses the Father among the disciples. The Son came in the name of the Father and worked in the name of the Father (John 5:43; 10:25). This means that He and the Father are one (John 10:30). He lives because of the Father (John 6:57), and the Father works in Him.<h2 class=head2>The Son Realized as the Spirit- the Spirit Being the Reality of the Son</h2><p>Following this, the Lord said again in John 14:16-20, &#8220;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality...He abides with you and shall be in you. I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you...because I live, you shall live also. In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&#8221; This shows us that the Son is the embodiment and the expression of the Father, and that the Spirit is the reality and the realization of the Son. The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son becoming the Spirit is realized in the believers. Hence, the Father is in the Son, and the Son becomes the Spirit. The Triune God has dispensed Himself into us to become our portion, so that we can enjoy Him as our everything in the Divine Trinity.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
