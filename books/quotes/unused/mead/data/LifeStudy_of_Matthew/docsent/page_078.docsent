   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE TWENTY THE DECREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE KINGDOM S CONSTITUTION 8</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For centuries, Christians have not had a clear understanding of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, in Romans and Galatians we are told that the law is over.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, Romans 10:4 says, Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one who believes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Based upon this, many Christians think that they can forget the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the other hand, in Matthew 5:17 the Lord Jesus said, Do not think that I came to abolish the law or the prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This word has troubled a great many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We praise the Lord that He has given us the clear light on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THREE ASPECTS OF THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to understand this matter of the law, we must know the three aspects of the law: the principle of the law, the commandments of the law, and the rituals of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you do not differentiate between these three things, you will never have a proper understanding of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we have seen, the principle of the law is over.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today, in the dispensation of grace, God does not deal with us according to the principle of the law; rather, He deals with us according to the principle of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether or not we shall be justified, saved, and accepted by God depends on the principle of faith, not the principle of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as we have faith in Christ, we are justified by God, accepted by Him, and saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is what it means for the principle of the law to be abolished in Christ under the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the principle of the law has been abolished, the commandments of the law have not been annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, the standard of these commandments has been uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, the commandments, related to the moral standards, have not been abolished; they will remain for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even for eternity we should not worship an idol, murder, steal, or lie.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In His heavenly kingdom the King has uplifted the standard of the law in two ways: by complementing the lower laws and by changing the lower laws into higher laws.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way the morality in the commandments of the law has been uplifted to a higher standard.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The kingly Savior Himself kept all the commandments of the law when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then He went to the cross to die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through His substitutionary death, He fulfilled the law on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, through His substitutionary death, He released His resurrection life into us, and we now have this resurrection life in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because we are able to live by this resurrection life, we have the strength, ability, and capacity to have the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we walk according to the spirit Rom 8:4 , we fulfill the righteous requirements of the law, fulfilling even more than the law requires.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we do not abolish the law; rather, we fulfill it in the highest way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The third aspect of the law is the rituals of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, offering sacrifices and keeping the Sabbath are outward rituals of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These rituals were also terminated because they were part of the old dispensation of shadows, figures, and types, all of which have been fulfilled by Christ as the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are no longer obligated to observe the rituals of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the principle of the law and the rituals of the law have been terminated, but the commandments of the law, which require a high moral standard, have not been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, these commandments have been uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By means of Christ as the resurrection life in our spirit, we can fulfill the standard of morality required by the higher law of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This word should make us clear concerning the law according to its three aspects: the principle of the law, the commandments of the law, and the rituals of the law.</S>
