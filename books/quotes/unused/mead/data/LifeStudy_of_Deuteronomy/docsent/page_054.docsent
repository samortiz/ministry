   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF DEUTERONOMY MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE REHEARSAL OF THE LAW 7 Scripture Reading: Deut 14:3-21, 28-29; 26:12-15; 15:1-11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing messages we covered the general advices and warnings 5:32 13:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we will begin to consider the rehearsal of the general statutes and judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE REHEARSAL</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>OF THE GENERAL STATUTES AND JUDGMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Deuteronomy 14:1 26:19 covers the general statutes and judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word judgments here actually means ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When a judgment is added to a statute, the statute becomes an ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. Concerning the Holy Diet</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whereas chapter thirteen is concerned with apostasy, chapter fourteen is concerned with eating.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verses 3 through 21 cover the matter of the holy diet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to be careful regarding our eating because germs can be transmitted by the food we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Signifying What Kind of People</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Are Not Clean and What Kind Are Clean</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The holy diet signifies what kind of people are not clean and what kind are clean, good for the people of God to contact, that they may be kept holy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In God's view, to contact people is to eat, that is, to receive something into us as a sustaining substance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As God's holy people, we need to take care concerning not only division and apostasy but also concerning the kind of people we contact.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We human beings need to be social; we cannot live alone, having no contact with others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we contact people, we need to be careful, for in our contact with others we may receive what they are, what they have, and what they know.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Contacting people is a kind of eating, and, as dieticians say, we are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that eventually we will be like those whom we contact.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, in contacting others we need to be discerning regarding who is unclean and who is clean.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the details on this matter, please see the Life-study message on Leviticus 11.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Boiling a Kid in Its Mother's Milk</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Being Prohibited</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk" 14:21b .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The mother's milk is for nourishing, but boiling a kid equals killing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that in the eyes of God, any living cattle that were not properly killed were not clean for eating, that is, for contacting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The milk in verse 21b typifies the milk of the word of God the life supply of Christ used to nourish new believers 1 Pet 2:2; Heb 5:12-13; 1 Cor 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not boiling a kid in its mother's milk typifies that the milk of the word of God should not be used to kill new believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should use the milk of the word, Christ as the life supply, to nourish newborn Christians, not to kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, many Christian teachers have used the word of God for "boiling" others instead of for feeding them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is what the divisive ones are doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The divisive ones use verses from the Bible to boil, to kill, the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are boiling the kids in their mothers' milk.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In practicing the new way, we should use Bible verses to nourish the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The word of Christ which produces milk should be used always to nourish the babes in Christ, never to kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the one hand, we should not eat without discernment; on the other hand, we should not allow a kid to be boiled in its mother's milk.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to help the young ones and to protect them from being boiled by the divisive ones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Deuteronomy 12 and 13 we see that we must hate and avoid both division and apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to do this, we need to be discerning in our contact with people, as indicated in chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Certain ones may be carrying the germs of division or heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we contact such ones without discernment, we will be infected, perhaps unconsciously, for these germs are very contagious.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once a saint has been infected in this way, he will become cold toward the recovery and toward the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, in order to avoid division and apostasy, we should be careful in contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Also, we need to protect our young ones from those who would use the milk of the word to boil them, to kill them.</S>
