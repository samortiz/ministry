<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Bride of the Lamb</H2><P>The bride of the Lamb signifies the totality of all the overcomers throughout the ages (Rev. 19:7-9). All the overcomers will be a corporate wife married to Christ, and they will become His army. They will return with Christ to defeat Antichrist and his army at Armageddon as a close to the wars of the ages before the millennium (vv. 11-21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The New Jerusalem</H2><P>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummated sign in the Scriptures (Rev. 21:1-3). It signifies the dwelling (the tabernacle and the temple) of God and the wife of the Lamb, as the ultimate consummation of all the matured elect of God to manifest and express the consummated Triune God and to show God's infinite grace and wisdom for eternity as an eternal testimony of Jesus for God.</P><P>The testimony of the seven above-mentioned signs is the testimony for Jesus by God's redeemed people. It is in addition to the testimony by Jesus for God. The two aspects of the testimony of Jesus are the total testimony for God by Jesus and by God's chosen and matured people. This total testimony is the spirit of the prophecy not only in the book of Revelation but also in the entire holy Scriptures.</P><P>W.L.</P>
