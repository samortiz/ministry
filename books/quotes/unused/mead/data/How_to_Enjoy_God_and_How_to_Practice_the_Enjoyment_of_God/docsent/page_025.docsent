   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God Desiring Man to Be Transformed and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Be Like Him by Eating and Drinking</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should consider the situation when Adam was placed in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Beside him was a river flowing, and where the river flowed, there were gold, bdellium, and precious stone vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This picture depicts the desire of God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Adam, who was made of earth, was placed beside Eve, who was made from Adam s earthy rib.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was an earthy husband with an earthy wife, an earthy male beside an earthy female; both were earthy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do we think that the God whose appearance is like the shining of gold and precious stones craves worship of earthy creatures?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is not a god of earth and dust.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has no intention for earthy men to worship and serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In effect, God was indicating that there was no need to serve and worship Him, but rather to be fed and satisfied with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is golden and like precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is different in nature from the earth, the clay, and the dust of our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to eat and drink Him and allow His nature to enter into us in order for us to experience transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This will make us the same as He is gold and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s word is even clearer in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second Corinthians 4:7 clearly says that we have this treasure in earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is a treasure, and we can be transformed when this treasure is hidden in us, the earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the end of Revelation there is a city with the tree of life and the river of water of life flowing in it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This city is not an earthen city but a golden city of precious stones and pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That is the ultimate manifestation of the glory of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the first picture that God shows in the Bible is that He wants to be food to man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He wants to be eaten so that man can be transformed in his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some may think that I am too excited, but I have a burden within me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has no intention for us to worship or serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He simply wants us to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although we would rather worship and serve Him, this thought is absolutely contrary to His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our thought and God s desire are incompatible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must eat Him; we do not need to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This picture needs to be seared into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have heard many brothers and sisters praising God, saying, I praise You that a man as vile and lowly as I am can worship You as the holy God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This type of praise comes from those who do not truly know God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we knew God and knew how to enjoy Him, we would say, I praise You that a man as lowly and vile as myself can eat and enjoy You even though You are great and holy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every Lord s Day we praise the Lord in the bread-breaking meeting, saying, Lord, we love You so much.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You died on the cross for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You have shed Your blood and borne our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You rose from the dead and ascended on high to be our interceding High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We thank and praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Almost every Christian says this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After this type of thanksgiving, we may make a resolution, saying, Lord, give me the strength not to shame your name but to walk and behave according to Your will so that I can preach the gospel with zeal, attend every meeting, and read the Bible and pray every day.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord s response to this is, Foolish one, I do not want any of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>My body was broken for you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Take and eat.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>My blood was shed for You.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Take and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Remember Me in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eating and drinking the Lord in remembrance of Him means to take the Lord by eating and drinking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we break the bread, we need to realize that we are not worshipping or serving Him; rather, we are eating and drinking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The loaf of bread before us symbolizes the Lord s body, which was sacrificed for us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The cup before us symbolizes His blood, which was shed for us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Both of these are for eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is altogether a matter of eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God s relationship with man is not based on things but on His being food.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Genesis 1 we see the matter of eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The tree of life is for us to eat, and the river of water of life is for us to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Through God becoming food, an earthen man can become golden.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A man without God can become a man full of God, and the human element can be transformed by participating in God s element.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God has absolutely no intention for man to do anything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He just wants man to eat and drink Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we break the bread, we are eating and drinking God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we contact Him in the morning, we are also eating and drinking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even our meetings are a kind of eating and drinking of Him.</S>
