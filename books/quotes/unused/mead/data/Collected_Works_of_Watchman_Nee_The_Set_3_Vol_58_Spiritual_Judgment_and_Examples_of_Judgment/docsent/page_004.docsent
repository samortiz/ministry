   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BASIC QUALIFICATIONS FOR JUDGING OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let me speak of another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In judging others, there is a basic qualification we first must be judged thoroughly by God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I cannot pass on a method of judging others to you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The only thing I can say is that our knowledge of others is based on our knowledge of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do not know ourselves, we cannot know others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are thoroughly judged by God, we will easily know the brothers and sisters when we see them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When a man's spirit is released, we immediately will know whether his spirit is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must learn the lesson ourselves, and we must pass through the judgment personally.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we have had the inward experience, we will be able to detect that sickness when others are in similar predicaments.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we circumvent a lesson, we will be insensitive to the same thing when others fall into its snare; we will easily excuse them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if we have been deeply touched by God in that matter, we will be alarmed as soon as it surfaces in others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, the basis of our knowledge of men is the kind of judgments we have experienced ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more we know ourselves, the more we will know the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we have never been judged ourselves, we will not be able to do anything even if we apply all the methods of judgment to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can never lead others through something we have never experienced ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we have passed through enough dealings ourselves, we will be able to identify the trouble spots in others as soon as they appear.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will know exactly where their problem lies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since we have gone down the same road, we will know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should seek to experience more dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more experience we have, the more we will know the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Otherwise, we will be in the dark even when our brothers and sisters are in error.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to be dealt with by the Holy Spirit in all things great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whatever we have passed through ourselves will be easily picked up by our discernment when others experience the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All men are alike.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are all similar in temperament, nature, and likes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is not much novelty in the way men commit errors and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everyone is a descendant of Adam and knows all the "tricks" that came with Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once we are enlightened to know ourselves, we will know almost everyone in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Please remember that every descendant of Adam has the full range of Adamic attributes within him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are experienced in discerning ourselves, it will be easy for us to diagnose others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not think that we can know men simply by acquiring certain skills.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must learn the lessons ourselves before the methods will become meaningful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How useful we are to others depends on how much dealing we have received from the Lord ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every area that we have circumvented will be an area that we cannot touch in others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not be so foolish as to think that we can run away from this "school."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we run away, we will forfeit our spiritual usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is ministry?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ministry is learning some lessons before the Lord and then ministering them to others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we have not learned anything, we will not have anything to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All of our environments, arrangements, and disciplines are for equipping us for the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The discipline of the Holy Spirit always increases the riches of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we experience little, we can render little help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we experience much suffering and discipline, we will be able to bear much burden, and we will lead others into rich experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The scope of our ministry is dictated by the amount of discipline we have received from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have not learned much, we will only be able to speak to the brothers and sisters in a frivolous way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our words will not hit home; they will not be sharp and pointed enough to produce any result.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have learned the lesson ourselves, we will know if others have passed the test.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They will not be able to cheat us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In preaching the gospel we will know whether others are saved; they will not be able to cheat us in the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the same can be said of deeper spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everything depends on the amount of lessons and experiences we have learned.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who learn more will know others more.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They will know what is wrong with a brother as soon as they contact him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order to fulfill our ministry of serving the Lord, I beg all of us to place ourselves in God's hand willingly and unreservedly and to receive the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are not inwardly built up, we cannot perform any outward work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God does everything within man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He does not work on man's mind alone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We cannot become preachers merely by studying the Bible for two or three years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It would be easy for the Lord to charge His disciples to recite His sermons, but He did not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Instead He gave them some practical training.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We want to know men for the purpose of ministering to them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are not here to satisfy our curiosity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our purpose is to build, not to destroy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have no time to mind others' business.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We seek to know men for the purpose of meeting their needs only.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In order to become a useful vessel, we have to commit ourselves unconditionally, unreservedly, and willingly to the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The more we accept, the more useful we will become.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Every discipline we receive will increase our capacity and usefulness a little.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must not only seek to teach doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Only then will we be able to lead others into spiritual riches.</S>
