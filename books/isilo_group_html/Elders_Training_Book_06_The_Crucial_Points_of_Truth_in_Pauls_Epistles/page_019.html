THAT WE MIGHT LIVE TO GOD</h2>
<p>The next crucial point is in verses 19 and 20 of chapter two where Paul says, &ldquo;For I through law have died to law that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.&rdquo; The crucial point here is that we have died to law so that we might live to God. This point includes the fact that we are in Christ, and therefore, not held responsible to keep the law. We have died to the law. That means we are freed from the law. A dead person is freed from the law and has no duty, responsibility, to keep the law. We have been freed from all regulations, all law and bondage, by our having been crucified with Christ. So, we are not responsible to keep the law; we are only responsible to God and we live to Him. Now it is not we who live, but Christ who lives in us through His resurrection. His living in us is entirely by His being the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b).</p>
<p>This point has been fully and adequately covered in the Life-study Messages, so you need to go there for your study. These messages especially point out that the Christian life is not an exchanged life, the exchange of a lower life for a higher one, but a life in union with Christ, a grafted life, the grafting of the human life into the life of Christ. This point is worthy of much study. Also, it may take two or three meetings to adequately cover such a crucial point.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE SPIRIT BY THE HEARING OF FAITH</h2>
<p>Chapter three of Galatians is a long and difficult chapter to understand. The crucial point that is so unique in this chapter is the matter of receiving the Spirit by the hearing of faith. In verse 2 Paul says, &ldquo;This only I wish to learn from you, Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith?&rdquo; Today among the Christians there are many arguments concerning the receiving of the Spirit. The Pentecostal saints would say that the receiving of the Spirit is by the baptism of the Holy Spirit. They even say that the unique sign of the baptism of the Holy Spirit is speaking in tongues. However, we have received the Spirit by the hearing of faith.</p>
<p>What is the faith for us to hear? Faith implies our believing in Christ, taking His person and His redemptive work as the object of our faith. This replacing the law, by which God dealt with people in the Old Testament, becomes the principle of God&rsquo;s dealing with people in the New Testament. This faith characterizes the believers in Christ and distinguishes them from the keepers of the law. This is the main emphasis of the book of Galatians.</p>
<p>Some other verses in Galatians 3 show us that faith is a wonderful thing. Verse 23 says, &ldquo;But before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed.&rdquo; Until faith came, the law was our child conductor, guardian, escort, custodian, used by God to watch over His chosen people (v. 24). In verse 25 Paul says, &ldquo;But faith having come.&rdquo; Since faith in Christ has come, we do not need to be under the guarding of the law any longer. It is by the hearing of this faith that Paul says we receive the Spirit. In verse 14 this Spirit becomes the very blessing of the gospel which was promised to Abraham.</p>
<p>Law was the basic term of the relationship between man and God in God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy (3:23); faith is the unique requirement for man to contact God in His New Testament economy (Heb. 11:6) that we may participate in God&rsquo;s promised blessing and live Christ. Faith here stands for the entire picture of the New Testament. The law in the Old Testament is always accompanied by works not by faith. The law is not a matter of faith but altogether a matter of works. When John the Baptist came, his preaching put the law aside. In other words, his preaching put the entire Old Testament aside. In his preaching he said, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2). John also preached that &ldquo;he who believes in the Son has eternal life&rdquo; (John 3:36). First, John preached repentance, and then the Lord Jesus followed John. After John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of God (Mark 1:14). In Mark 1:15 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Repent and believe in the gospel!&rdquo; From this verse onward the key word in the entire New Testament is faith which means to believe. John 3:14-16 says, &ldquo;Even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life. For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.&rdquo; In the Gospel of John alone a form of the word believe is used more than eighty times. Faith has two denotations: objective faith referring to the things we believe in and subjective faith referring to our believing act.</p>
<p>Faith can be illustrated in the following way. In photography there is always some scenery. Within the camera there is the film. Light is needed to expose the scenery to the film. There is also the need for the camera to &ldquo;click.&rdquo; When the camera clicks that means the camera was open to the light and the light is able to expose the scenery onto the film and produce a picture. This picture will be exactly the same as the scenery. The exposure causes a reaction, and that reaction fully illustrates our faith. Our faith is a reaction to the scenery of the entire New Testament. The New Testament tells us how Christ was God from the beginning, how as the Word He was incarnated to be a man, how He lived on this earth, how He died an all-inclusive death to solve all the problems and to release God&rsquo;s divine life, and how He resurrected to become a life-giving Spirit to enter into us. The New Testament also tells us how Christ ascended to the heavens, how He was glorified, enthroned, and made both Lord and Christ, and how he poured out Himself as the consummated Spirit upon all of us. It shows us that the Triune God&rsquo;s full salvation has been fully completed by seven major steps or processes which He has passed through: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, the breathing of the Spirit, ascension, and the outpouring of the Spirit. The New Testament also goes on to tell us that we are sinners and that we have to repent. Whosoever would repent and believe in Christ would be forgiven, reconciled, justified, and regenerated to have eternal life. This is the scenery of the New Testament.</p>
<p>When we preach the gospel, we are showing people this New Testament scenery. The more you show the audience this scenery in detail the better it is. When you are showing the scenery by the Word, the Holy Spirit works with the Word not only as the power but also as the light. As the audience listens to and hears the Word, the scenery is there and the Holy Spirit as the power and the light is also there. Suddenly there is an inward &ldquo;click&rdquo; in the ones we are speaking to. This click means repentance. This means they have opened themselves up a little bit and there is an exposure. That exposure issues in a reaction and this reaction is their faith. Now the scenery of the New Testament has been brought into their spirit, &ldquo;the film.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The faith in Galatians and in the other books of the New Testament equals the economy, the household administration, the dispensation of God. The truth is the contents, the reality, of the faith according to God&rsquo;s economy. Faith (subjective) is the response to the truth of the faith (objective), receiving and participating in the divine realities. Faith is produced by the showing of the New Testament scenery plus the power and the light of the Holy Spirit. Once faith is produced in you, it cannot be taken away. Even if you were to regret believing and were to decide not to believe anymore, this faith would still be in you. The proper way to receive the Spirit is by the hearing of faith.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:13 says, &ldquo;In whom you also, hearing the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.&rdquo; After hearing and believing, you are immediately sealed with the Holy Spirit. In other words, this verse also tells us the receiving of the Spirit is by believing. Faith is a reaction to the entire scenery of the New Testament. By this reaction we received the Spirit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 06: The Crucial Points of Truth in Paul's Epistles &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
