<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CONCERNING BREAKING THE BREAD<br />
IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 26:26-30; Luke 22:19-20; John 6:53-58</h1>
<p>The content of the church is Christ, and the intrinsic reality of every single matter in the church is Christ Himself. If we do not touch Christ and gain Christ, even our worship and service will be meaningless. Just as the reality of believing in the Lord is Christ&rsquo;s coming into us, and the reality of baptism is our union with Christ, so also all the services in the church should be related to Christ.</p>
<p>After a person is saved, he encounters several things. The first is baptism, and the second is the breaking of bread.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BREAD BREAKING</h2>
<p>What is the meaning of bread breaking? And what is the reality of bread breaking? Once we mention the breaking of bread, almost all Christians will say that breaking bread is for remembering the Lord. It is true that in the Bible the Lord Himself said that we should break bread in remembrance of Him (Luke 22:19). Thus, based on this word, many Christians conclude that the significance of bread breaking is the remembrance of the Lord. Although this word, this definition, is not wrong, the meaning of remembering the Lord is not simple.</p>
<p>The remembrance spoken of by the Lord is different from our thought concerning remembrance. When we talk about remembrance, we have our own concept. What is this concept? For example, after a father dies, his children remember him. We all understand this kind of remembrance, but is this remembrance the same as our remembrance of the Lord? I am afraid that many people would say that our remembrance of the Lord is simply our meditating on the Lord. This kind of concept, however, is very different from the thought of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REMEMBERING THE LORD<br />
NOT BEING MEDITATING ON THE LORD</h2>
<p>According to our natural concept, we think that when we break bread in remembrance of the Lord, we must calm down and meditate on the Lord in a detailed way. We feel that we need to contemplate how God came down to the earth from the heavens, was born in a manger, lived in Nazareth for thirty years, trod through Galilee and the land of Judea, suffered man&rsquo;s reproach and persecution, was betrayed, bound, and scourged for us, bore the cross to Golgotha, was crucified, endured unbearable pain, bore our sins, and was judged by God on our behalf. Moreover, we feel that we need to contemplate His burial, His resurrection, His ascension, and His sending of the Holy Spirit. We also feel that we need to contemplate the fact that He is now sitting in the heavens as our High Priest and that one day He will come again to take us to be with Him forever to enjoy His glory in eternity. We have all these scenes within us&#151;from the throne in the heavens to the manger in Bethlehem, from Galilee to Judea, from the virgin Mary to Golgotha, and from the tomb to resurrection, ascension, the second coming, the rapture to be with the Lord, and the enjoyment of glory forever. However, this kind of remembrance is based upon a kind of religious concept that is void of any revelation or spiritual value.</p>
<p>All the terms and all the utterances in the Bible are different from our natural comprehension of things. The faith referred to in the Bible is different from our understanding of faith. The repentance mentioned in the Bible is different from our comprehension of repentance. And the remembrance spoken of in the Bible is definitely not according to our realization of remembrance. When we remember the Lord in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting every Lord&rsquo;s Day, concentrating in our mind to meditate on the Lord Jesus silently, does this mean that we all love the Lord, are spiritual, and have the Lord&rsquo;s presence? This kind of remembrance by meditation is not the result of revelation but is a kind of religious worship. This is not service that is according to revelation but service that is according to our natural concept.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO REMEMBER THE LORD<br />
BEING TO EAT THE LORD&rsquo;S BODY<br />
AND DRINK THE LORD&rsquo;S BLOOD</h2>
<p>In the Bible the Lord does not tell us to meditate on Him in our remembrance of Him. What then did the Lord say? While eating the final Passover, He &ldquo;took a loaf and gave thanks, and He broke it and gave it to them, saying, This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me&rdquo; (Luke 22:19). The Lord did not tell the disciples that at the Lord&rsquo;s table they had to quiet their hearts to meditate on Him in remembrance of Him. Rather, the Lord said, &ldquo;This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.&rdquo; What the Lord indicated was that to remember Him is to eat Him. The remembrance in the Bible is not meditating. First and foremost, it is eating. What do we eat? We eat the Lord&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Verse 20 continues, &ldquo;And similarly the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant established in My blood, which is being poured out for you.&rdquo; The Lord meant that He wanted them to drink the cup in remembrance of Him. Hence, what is a remembrance of the Lord? We remember the Lord when we eat the Lord&rsquo;s body and drink the Lord&rsquo;s blood. The remembrance of the Lord in the Bible is to eat and drink the Lord. To remember the Lord is to eat the Lord&rsquo;s body and drink the Lord&rsquo;s blood.</p>
