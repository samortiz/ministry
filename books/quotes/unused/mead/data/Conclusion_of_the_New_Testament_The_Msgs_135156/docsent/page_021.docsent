   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>37 Making Them His Inheritance of Glory</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Through His dispensing God the Father is making the believers His inheritance of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul in Ephesians 1:18b speaks of "the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Greek word translated "in" may also be rendered "among."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's inheritance is in and among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We, the saints, are God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What we are by nature, however, cannot be God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God does not desire to inherit our nature, our flesh, our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He desires to inherit all that He has dispensed into us of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, whatever God has dispensed into us of Himself becomes His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's inheritance in and among the saints is an inheritance of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The riches of the glory in 1:18b are the many different items of God's attributes, such as light, life, righteousness, holiness, and love, expressed in different degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since glory is God's expression, the riches of His glory are the riches of God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, God has made us His inheritance Eph 1:11 as His acquired possession v. 14 and gave us to participate in all He is, all He has, and all He has accomplished as our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Consummately, all these become His inheritance in the saints for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This will be God's eternal expression, which is His glory with all its riches to express Him to the uttermost universally and eternally Rev 21:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ephesians 1:11 says, "In whom also we were made an inheritance."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Greek word rendered "were made an inheritance" means to choose or assign by lot.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, this clause literally means we were designated as a heritage.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We were made an inheritance to inherit God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the one hand, we were made God's inheritance for God's enjoyment; on the other hand, we were made to inherit God as our inheritance for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to our natural being, we are not worth anything, but in Christ we have been made God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is by having the Triune God dispensed into us and wrought into us that we are constituted into an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As God's element is wrought into our being, we become His inheritance in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we are still in the process of being made God's inheritance in full.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is God Himself within us who constitutes us His inheritance of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If God is not dispensed into us and wrought into us, we cannot become His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The believers become precious to Him by being saturated with the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only in this way can poor sinners become God's special treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this universe God is the only One who is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now this precious God of matchless worth is dispensing Himself into us to make us His inheritance of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our enjoyment of God as our inheritance consummates in our being made His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then our enjoyment of Him makes us His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is in the process of dispensing Himself into us little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whatever God dispenses of Himself into us becomes His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, God will inherit us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, He will inherit Himself in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The enjoyment of God as our inheritance is the dispensing of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The result of this dispensing is that He is making us His inheritance of glory for His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that in our natural being we cannot be God's inheritance, for in our natural being there is no glory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But from the time we were saved, God has been working to transform us, giving us Himself as our enjoyment, our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we enjoy Him and participate in Him, the more He dispenses His element into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then, more and more, we become His inheritance, and the more of His glory we have.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, we shall be fully saturated with Him and constituted of Him as our inheritance, and this enjoyment and constitution will make us His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, we are God's inheritance not in ourselves or by ourselves but by His being our inheritance through the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then our enjoyment of Him in the divine dispensing will consummate in our being God's inheritance for Him to enjoy eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Ultimately, the New Jerusalem, a mutual dwelling place for God and His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people, will be a mutual enjoyment, for in the New Jerusalem we shall enjoy the Triune God as our eternal inheritance, and He will enjoy us as His eternal inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This consummation will be the issue of God's dispensing Himself into us and constituting us of Himself.</S>
