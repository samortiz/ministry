   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God did not stay in the heavens and invite the sinners to come to Him.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God came to Adam and said, Where are you?</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They were instructed to enter into people s homes and stay with them to find out whether or not they were sons of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To preach the gospel we have to go to visit people in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to visit them in their homes, surely there is the need to knock on their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some may think that this is too much activity and that we must come back to life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have been emphasizing life again and again for years, but we bore very little fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Barrenness has been prevailing among us.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For the fruit to remain, we have to set up home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only home meetings can help the new ones to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The best way to bear fruit is to knock on people s doors, and the best way for the fruit to remain is to have home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is for the multiplication of Christ, which is the glorification of the Father, and this glorification of the Father is the very expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The scriptural way to meet and to serve is for this expression.</S>
