<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEGOTTEN OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:12-13</h1>
<p>John 1:12-13 says, &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&rdquo; This portion contains at least ten crucial points that are indicated by the following words and phrases: <em>received, Him, authority, children of God, believe into, His name, blood, the will of the flesh, the will of man,</em> and <em>begotten...of God.</em> We covered the point of receiving in the previous chapter, and now we need to consider the matter of being begotten of God. Receiving is the procedure by which we are begotten of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BEGOTTEN OF GOD BY RECEIVING THE LORD</h2>
<p>New believers often do not have an accurate understanding of the truth contained in the Bible. For example, in regard to receiving the Lord, many of us think of ourselves only as sinners who were in anguish and bondage, who were destined to perish, and who were in need of salvation and a Savior. Hence, we believed in the Lord Jesus as our Savior. This concept is quite common, and while it is not wrong, it falls short of the view contained in the Bible. The Bible shows that God wants us to receive His Son for a higher purpose.</p>
<p>Some of us also think that our believing in the Lord is for the purpose of improving our behavior. This sounds reasonable, but strictly speaking it is incompatible with the truth of the gospel. In the Lord&rsquo;s salvation the goal is not to improve our behavior. The Lord is focused on regenerating us, not improving us. Receiving the Lord is not a matter of improving our behavior but a matter of receiving another life. When we believe in the Lord, we receive another life, which spontaneously changes our living and behavior. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is focused on regeneration, not improvement.</p>
<p>Sages, philosophers, and religionists throughout the ages have focused on self-improvement. Nicodemus was a religionist who wanted to improve himself, and so he came to Jesus at night (3:1-2). But God does not want us to improve our behavior; He wants to give us His life. He does not want us to improve our life; He wants us to receive Him as life. The concept of improvement is not accurate. Although the word <em>repent</em> is in the Bible, this word in Greek refers to a change of mind, not to the improvement of behavior.</p>
<p>When we receive the Son of God as our Savior, God not only forgives our sins but also begets us. God&rsquo;s forgiveness of our sins and His deliverance of us from perdition are secondary matters. The Bible shows that God redeemed us so that we could be born again. God not only saves us but also begets us. God wants to beget Himself in us. He saves us so that we could be born of Him. Salvation is secondary; begetting is primary.</p>
<p>Although unbelievers do not have this concept, even many Christians do not have this concept. This is the reason that the apostle John clearly says, &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten...of God&rdquo; (1:12-13). The authority that John speaks of is the life of God. Those who have authority to become children of God are those who have been begotten of God. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God (v. 1); in Him was life, and the life was the light of men (v. 4); the light shines in the darkness (v. 5); and as many as received Him, that is, those who believe into His name, to them He gave authority, the life, to become children of God (v. 12). This is the apostle John&rsquo;s thought and concept. His emphasis in writing these words is not on the forgiveness of sins or blessings, but on the authority of life that makes believers children of God. Hence, he speaks of those &ldquo;who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God&rdquo; (v. 13).</p>
<p>We need to see how truly momentous it is to receive the Lord. Once we receive the Lord, God&rsquo;s life enters into us, and we immediately have a union with God in life. Our believing into the Lord is for our being begotten of God, that is, for God to come into us to be our life. This is not a natural concept. We would never think of God entering into us to be our life by regenerating us. In addition to our own life, we need to receive God as life. No religionist or philosopher sees that man&rsquo;s problem is related to life.</p>
<p>I hope that these words will deliver us from the concept of doing good and being moral. The Bible says, &ldquo;Who were begotten...of God.&rdquo; Once we receive the Lord, we are begotten of God. Some saints may ask, &ldquo;Although this is a good word, what about our behavior, our living, and the way we conduct ourselves?&rdquo; We should realize that our living comes out of life. Once we have God&rsquo;s life, every matter of our living is spontaneously addressed. The Gospel of John has a total of twenty-one chapters, and John carefully selected the content from thousands of events (21:24-25). In his entire Gospel there is no verse, sentence, or word that tells us how to behave. John did not address the matter of behavior; he only spoke of the matter of life because he knew that everything depended on life. Once our focus is on life, there is no problem with behavior.</p>
