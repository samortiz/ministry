Lord, we pray that You will support us and give us the Spirit from heaven and the words that are of the Spirit
The general subject of this series of messages is 'The Experience of God's Organic Salvation Equaling Reigning in Christ's Life'
God conforms us that we may have His divine element and glorifies us that we may have His divine image in full
We reign in God's life by His organic salvation to accomplish His eternal economy and achieve His divine purpose
In this message, the first message on God's organic salvation, we would like to see the matters of regeneration and renewing
It is not easy to speak such messages, but each message has an outline that can help us enter into the content of the message
As such, it can be understood only according to the revelation of the Holy Spirit, and it cannot be expressed with human words
We have said that regeneration is the center of God's entire salvation and the commencement of God's salvation in its organic aspect
One is the divine Spirit of God, the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ; the other is our created human spirit
John 1:12 says, 'But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name'
We need to be regenerated not because we have sins but because God's desire is that we have His life and be exactly like Him
We not only receive the divine life through regeneration but also grow in the divine life with regeneration as the base
After being regenerated, we must be nourished with the supply of the milk of the word of God unto our daily, gradual salvation
We need to grow by feeding on Christ as the nourishing milk in the word of God unto maturity for glorification, unto salvation in full
In order to experience this daily salvation, we need to live by the divine life through denying our natural life
We all must deny and reject the first life, our natural life, and live according to and by the second life, the divine life
Regeneration is not only the base for us to grow in the divine life but also the base for us to be built up in the divine life
After our regeneration, we are being built up in the divine life by the growth and increase of the divine life in us
Regeneration is for us not only to grow in the divine life but also to be built up as the universal Body of Christ
Out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God'
As members of the Body and as Christ's brothers, we are being constituted and built up into the universal Body of Christ
Although we have been regenerated with the divine life and nature, we still need to be transformed by the renewing of the mind
In God's organic salvation, regeneration is a washing, and renewing is the continuation of the washing of regeneration
Such a washing, such a renewing, in God's organic salvation is being carried out continually in us by means of the following matters
The renewing in God's organic salvation is also by our walking in the newness of the divine life in the resurrection of Christ
In order to walk in newness of life, we need, on the one hand, to put off the old man, and on the other hand, to put on the new man
We should have such a daily subjective experience of our outer man decaying and our inner man being renewed day by day
Through such a renewing we are built up in God's organic salvation to ultimately become as new as the New Jerusalem
If in our singing of these hymns, we would follow each word and line with our spirit, we will receive a divine transfusion
It is the totality of the mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man, expressed in the universe for eternity
Prayer: O Lord, You have spoken and You will still speak until You fulfill Your eternal purpose, the manifestation of the New Jerusalem
In this message, the second message on God's organic salvation, we would like to see the matters of sanctification and transformation
The first four points of God's organic salvation are regeneration, renewing, sanctification, and transformation
First we have His divine life second we become the divine new creation third we have the holy nature and fourth we have the divine image
To thus be made holy unto God is to become the New Jerusalem, the holy city, which is absolutely sanctified unto God
God not only regenerates and renews us but also sanctifies us that we may be established in His organic salvation
Such a dispositional sanctification is from our spirit through our soul and unto our body so that our entire being can be wholly sanctified
God's organic salvation is to produce something with a shape, something visible; hence, there is the shaping aspect in God's salvation
We not only have received God's divine life at our regeneration, but we also are being renewed to become His divine, new creation
It is not enough to become the new creation; we still need to be sanctified that we may have His divine nature
Not only do we have God's nature inwardly, but we also bear His image outwardly, which is something concrete and visible
As a result, after a period of time, when you see him again, you notice that his facial appearance has become healthy
Consequently, we have a change not only in our inward nature but also in our outward image so that we express the image of Christ
We are being transformed metabolically with the life element of God's firstborn Son and thereby will have His divine image
Being transformed indicates that we are in the process of transformation, which is a process in life, an organic process
On the one hand, He passed through the processes to become the firstborn Son of God with a view to become the prototype
God transforms us not only that we may be shaped in the divine image but also that we may be shaped in God's organic salvation
Romans 12:2a says, 'Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind'
In God's organic salvation transformation is also by the Lord Spirit in us, transforming us into the image of the glory of Christ
We are being transformed into the same image from one level of glory to another level of glory for His expression
In God's organic salvation the key to transformation is altogether in the mingled spirit-the Spirit with our spirit
The Triune God has been processed to become the Lord Spirit, and this Spirit in us is mingled with our regenerated spirit
Paul paid the highest price in order to gain this treasure, this jasper; moreover, he even became a part of this jasper
In the previous two messages we saw the first four items of Gods organic salvation regeneration renewing sanctification and transformation
In this message, the third message on God's organic salvation, we would go on to see the matters of conformation and glorification
As those who have been regenerated by God with the divine life, we are not just photographs of God; rather, we are His reproduction
As such, we not only have His image outwardly, but we also have His life and nature with His divine element inwardly
We must see that with the matter of conformation, the emphasis is not only on the divine image but also on the divine element
God's intention is for us to have His divine element in His divine life, nature, and image as His expression, but not in His Godhead
God regenerates us with His divine life that we may begin to participate in His divinity to have His divine element
Without conformation, the divine life may have entered into us, but it has not reached the extent of being solidified and matured
We can arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and be conformed to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God
God's desire is to glorify His people, but He cannot glorify a group of children; He can only glorify a group of grown-up people
We have been regenerated to become the sons of God, but we still need to be conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son
God's only begotten Son had divinity but not humanity; Christ as God's firstborn Son has both divinity and humanity
We are to be conformed to God's firstborn Son, Christ as the first God-man, that we may be a group of God-men who are exactly like Him
In Philippians 310 Paul said To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings being conformed to His death
God glorifies us that we may have His divine image in full; this is the consummating of God's organic salvation
Glorification, the final step in God's organic salvation, brings the conformed believers into the glory of God
Gods organic salvation has not only the base the building up the establishing the shaping and the solidifying but also the consummating
Whereas the inner saturation is a lifelong process, our being brought into God's glory outwardly will be instantaneous
The day is coming when our body will be redeemed and we will enter into the top and full enjoyment of the divine sonship
To know whether we are truly experiencing God's organic salvation, we must see if we are reigning in Christ's life
The abundance of the gift of righteousness refers to judicial redemption, and the abundance of grace is the processed Triune God
If we have the living and experience portrayed in the revelations in Romans 6-16, this is evidence that we are definitely reigning in life
Our natural life needs to be annihilated, completely destroyed, put out of existence, with Adam in our co-death with Christ
In our baptism we have been buried with Christ into His death, and thereby the natural life of our old man in Adam has been annihilated
The marvelous things which God does for us due to His love provoke God's enemy to attack us with all kinds of sufferings and calamities
According to the book of Ephesians we are joined with Christ in His resurrection and ascension so that we have transcended to the heavenlies
It is when we arrive at such a transcendent position that we have truly received grace and are genuinely saved
Do not live a befuddled life day by day, imagining that you have been saved and are just waiting to go to heaven
We who believe in Christ will enjoy the consummation of resurrection through the redemption and salvation in Christ
We reign in life not only to live the life of the new creation but also to reign in eternity in our being grafted with Christ
As human beings we are branches, pieces of wood; in like manner, Christ came as the branch of David, as a piece of wood
A grafter knows that in order to have a successful grafting, both of the grafting parts need to be cut and die
On Christs side one day as the branch of David He died on the cross however although He died in the flesh He was resurrected in the Spirit
Once we repent and receive Him, He as the life-giving Spirit enters into our spirit and puts the divine life in us
He brings the key to death and resurrection into us who have believed in Him and have died and resurrected with Him
We should no longer live by our flesh or our natural being; rather, we should live by our mingled spirit, a spirit grafted with Christ
My intention, my burden, is to show you that the entire Bible speaks of only one thing-grace, which is God, who is the New Jerusalem
Grace is the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
We are exceptionally strengthened in establishing not our own righteousness but God's righteousness in our reigning with Christ
We are exceptionally radiant in establishing not our own righteousness but God's righteousness in our reigning with Christ
We reign in life in establishing not our own righteousness but God's righteousness and also in taking Christ as God's righteousness
The objective righteousness is for grace to come to us that we may receive Christ as our subjective righteousness
God's righteousness is the subjective Christ, the Christ whom we enjoy and experience and who is constituted into us
Christ's becoming righteousness from God to the believers is of two aspects: the objective aspect and the subjective aspect
Being clothed with the best robe is the objective, outward covering; eating the fattened calf is the subjective, inward life supply
God's salvation not only has an objective aspect in which we are justified by God positionally; this is our solid foundation
Based upon the objective justification, God's salvation also has a subjective aspect in which we enjoy Christ as grace
Although our gifts are different, we all function according to our respective gifts as normal, proper, rich, organic, functioning members
We do not live a befuddled and confused life; rather, we have been raised from sleep to be those who are watching and waiting
To be general means that everyone is speaking and every home is doing the same thing; no one is particularly different
Remember these two statements: we must receive the believers according to God, and we must receive the believers according to Christ
If we do not receive him, our receiving is a special receiving; then we are sectarian and have become a denomination
When we are not general, there is no peace, smoothness, or order, and the result is something particular and sectarian
If we receive others according to God and Christ, the church life will be smooth and orderly, and the whole church will be in harmony
To experience reigning in life, first, we must imitate the apostle in bringing the local churches into the fellowship of the Body of Christ
It is only by practically entering into the fellowship of the Body of Christ that we can have the genuine experience of reigning in life
All other matters, such as eating and the keeping of days mentioned in Romans 14, are secondary truths, not the basic faith
Timothy 4:1 and 3 tell us that forbidding marriage and commanding to abstain from certain foods are teachings of demons
We should not argue with people concerning whether we should meet on Saturday or on the Lord's Day; that is a secondary truth
Because of our negligence in this matter in the past, we have offended the Body of Christ and many brothers and sisters in the Lord
Romans 14:3 tells us that we should receive people according to God; this is to receive all those whom God has received
On the one hand, He is a servant of the circumcision ; on the other hand, He is a servant of the God-chosen nations
If we do not participate in the New Jerusalem, whatever we do is not a glorifying of God but of ourselves, an expression of ourselves
Romans 16 gives us an excellent pattern of the apostle in bringing all the saints into the blending life of the entire Body of Christ
Such recommendations and greetings show both the mutual concern among the saints and the mutual fellowship among the churches
Otherwise regardless of how much we pursue and how simple and humble we are sooner or later there will be problems even divisions among us
