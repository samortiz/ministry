<p>If we truly see this vision, our understanding of the Bible will change, and our condition before the Lord will also change. We will set aside many items associated with the detour, which we have paid attention to in the past, and we will come to the tree of life to enjoy God. However, some may say that we need to deal with Satan, sin, the flesh, and the world because they entered into man and have become problems in man. It is true that man fell and has many problems, but God has already dealt with these problems. God entered into man through incarnation, and He dealt with Satan, sin, the flesh, and the world through crucifixion. The Lord then rose from the dead and was transfigured to become the life-giving Spirit. As a result, when a person obtains the Spirit, he immediately obtains everything that the Lord has passed through; such a person does not need to deal with Satan, sin, the flesh, or the world. As long as we enjoy the Lord and absorb Him, we will be in an organic union with Him. In this union the flesh is crucified, and sin and the world are dealt with. In this union we experience the glorious facts of death, resurrection, man entering into God, and man being joined to God. We do not need to deal with anything, because God has passed through the detour for us. Thus, we do not need to pass through the detour for ourselves; we simply accept everything that God has accomplished.</p>
<p>Many believers, including Mrs. Jesse Penn-Lewis, were not clear concerning what God has accomplished; therefore, they encouraged others to take a difficult detour of dying with the Lord. This is truly difficult because no matter how much man tries, he cannot die. In fact, the more he tries to die, the more alive and miserable he is (Rom. 7:19-20, 24). There is no need to endeavor or to struggle to experience our co-crucifixion with the Lord. For example, in demolishing a house, it would be laborious and exhausting to tear it down one brick at a time, but if we could drop a bomb on the house, it would be reduced to ashes. Similarly, in dealing with negative things, such as Satan, sin, the flesh, and the world, a clear vision of what the Lord has passed through is like a bomb. It solves all our problems, requiring nothing further from us.</p>
<p>We have experienced failure when we endeavor and struggle to live the Christian life. However, when we fellowship with the Lord, enjoy Him, and let Him fill us instead of making determinations to endeavor and struggle, there is a spontaneous outcome. For example, a sister who hears a message on humility realizes that humility is a Christian virtue and then desires to be humble. She, therefore, prays to the Lord for humility, determines to be humble, and pursues humility. Nevertheless, no matter how much effort she exerts, she cannot be humble. However, there may be another sister who has not heard a message on humility, has made no determination to be humble, and is not struggling to be humble. Rather, she lives in the Lord daily by eating, drinking, and enjoying Him. As a result, she is a very humble sister. She does not feel that she is humble, but all who contact her sense that she is very humble. She does not have a desire to be humble, but she has the reality of being humble, for her humility is God Himself who has filled her. This is also true concerning the experience of our co-crucifixion with the Lord. We must see that in the Spirit of resurrection there is the element of death, because the Lord has passed through death. As long as we enjoy the Lord, we will experience our co-crucifixion with Him. The Lord did not only become flesh; He died, resurrected, and was transfigured to become the life-giving Spirit. Hence, the elements of incarnation, death, and resurrection are in the Spirit. We need only to enjoy Him, and we will have all these elements.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly emphasized that the fact of our co-crucifixion in Romans 6 can be gained only in the Spirit of life in chapter 8. Reckoning ourselves as dead is ineffective, for such reckoning is but outward behavior that lacks the inward reality of life. However, if we live in the Spirit of life, eat, drink, and enjoy the Lord, and give the Spirit of life absolute freedom in us, the fact of our co-crucifixion with the Lord will be manifested spontaneously in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SHORTCUT BEING TO ENJOY GOD</h2>
<p>We need to see this revelation so that we no longer deal with sin and the flesh in ourselves. Such dealings are a part of the detour from Genesis 3 to Revelation 20. There is a shortcut in front of us, and this shortcut is the Lord Jesus. In John 14:6 He said, &ldquo;I am the way.&rdquo; Through incarnation the Lord entered into man and was joined to man, and through death the Lord dealt with everything that opposes Him. Then He resurrected from the dead, became the life-giving Spirit, and entered into glory in order to enter into man. Hence, we need only to absorb Him and enjoy Him in order to experience our co-crucifixion with the Lord and our living together with the Lord. This is a shortcut.</p>
<p>The problem lies in our not seeing that the Triune God has come to be everything to us. We see doing and working. We see dealing with the flesh and reckoning ourselves as having been crucified with the Lord, but we do not see that God wants to be our life, nor do we see that we need only to enjoy Him. We lack such a vision. Ever since man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the concept of doing and working has been deeply rooted in man. Those without a vision cannot rid themselves of this concept. Even &ldquo;enjoying&rdquo; God is hard work to them: they study how to enjoy God and how to eat and drink God. If we see that God wants to be our life, we will not ask how to eat, drink, or enjoy the Lord; rather, we will eat, drink, and enjoy Him.</p>
<p>The tree of life is sufficient for all our needs. It is the unique base. When this base gains ground in us, we will be God&rsquo;s expression with His image, we will be the means for God to exercise dominion, and we will be joined to God as His counterpart. These are spontaneous issues. The brothers who minister the word in the different localities must avoid the atmosphere of merely teaching and expounding doctrine and of interpreting the Scriptures. Instead, we must learn to bring people to enjoy God, who was incarnated, died, resurrected, became the life-giving Spirit, and entered into us to be our life. If we will enjoy the Lord in such a way, the churches will have a solid and full expression.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
