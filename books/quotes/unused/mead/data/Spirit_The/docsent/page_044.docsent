   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In previous messages we have seen the functions of the Spirit in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we want to see what the Spirit is to God and to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are going to experience God and Christ, we must know what the Spirit is to God and what the Spirit is to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>TO GOD The Spirit Being the Essence of God s Being</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit is the essence of God s being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John 4:24 says, God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Greek text there is no article before the word Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is like saying that a table is wood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates not only that the table is made of wood but also that the very essence of the table is wood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we say that a ring on a person s hand is gold, we are referring to its essence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The essence is the intrinsic content of the substance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit is God s very essence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The essence of God s being, of what God is, is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word for Spirit in Hebrew is ruach, and in Greek it is pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These words can be translated as spirit, breath, or wind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Ezekiel 37 ruach is translated as Spirit, breath, and wind vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>5, 9, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In John 3pneuma is translated as Spirit v. 6 and as wind v. 8 . How these words are translated depends upon the context.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the context of John 3:6, pneuma here surely refers to the Spirit that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verse 8, pneuma must be translated as wind because it blows and the sound of it can be heard.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The very essence of the God whom we worship is pneuma, Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The incarnation of God is just God s coming to man, God s reaching man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every morning we need to enjoy God s reaching, God s coming to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit is also God s abiding among man Hag 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was mostly in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To abide is to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the New Testament, God s remaining is not merely among us but mainly in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the New Testament uses the word in instead of the word among.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1 John 3:24 and 4:13, we are told that God s abiding in us is by the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>for Him to Dispense His Attributes to Man</S>
