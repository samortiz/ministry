   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TESTIMONIES OF SERVING ACCORDING TO THE GOD-ORDAINED NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are two hundred fifty trainees from overseas, one hundred eighteen of whom have requested to stay in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They cannot bear the thought of leaving so many whom they have gained through door-knocking and who need care.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In one time of fellowship with the elders, a leading brother from America testified that he had attended a few home meetings since coming here and felt that they were very good.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now he does not feel satisfied unless he goes to a home meeting every evening.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, I exhort all the elders and co-workers to taste this heavenly flavor first, to take the lead to go out door-knocking, and to attend the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, this new way is very effective.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not only are people gained quickly, but many of them also have a strong testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>An eighty-six year old sister who was newly saved through door-knocking is very thankful that some of the trainees brought the gospel to her.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to show her appreciation, she has given many snacks to the training center.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some other trainees knocked on a door last week and led the father of that household to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When they went back this week, the son also received the Lord, and the father baptized him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There have also been cases in which the husband is saved one week and baptizes his wife the next week.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, after this last conference meeting, one of the saints from America got lost and asked a policeman for help.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the way to the stadium he preached the gospel to that policeman.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After arriving there, the policeman went in with him and was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He also promised to have a meeting in his home.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such testimonies are very encouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There was another sister who went out door-knocking for four days without gaining anyone, but she still went out patiently on the fifth day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On this day she gained a person who was baptized through her door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In a short time she gradually brought the five members of that family to be saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Among these five was one young person who came to see her this afternoon, expressing a desire to attend the full-time training.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is not just one testimony like this; there are many.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The young people whom these trainees have brought to the Lord are also willing to be like the trainees and to do what they do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a very sweet matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>EVERYONE BEING A DOOR-KNOCKER</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I believe that we all love the Lord and have inwardly aspired to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now there is a way set before us through which we can realize our aspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps we will not all be full-timers, but we all can be door-knockers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This does not demand a great deal from us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We just need to be willing to go out for the Lord to knock on doors for two or three hours every week.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are one hundred sixty-eight hours in a week, and we need to consecrate only two or three hours, so this price is not too high.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not think that we are so busy that we do not have time to spare.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually we usually do things however we want and do not keep track of our time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, we read the newspapers as we like, chat with people as we please, and can be on the phone for a long time without feeling that our conversation is too long and without getting tired.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is only when we come to serve the Lord that we calculate the time carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the stratagem of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why we must change our concept and act contrary to our natural disposition to force ourselves to set aside two or three hours a week for door-knocking, despite wind or rain.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should go out door-knocking week after week without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not at all a matter of whether or not we have time; rather, it is a matter of whether or not we are willing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are willing and if we care for this matter, then we will certainly have time to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everyone likes to be free.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Anything that one must do week after week becomes a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even cleaning the house is like this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It takes ten minutes at the most to dust a table and no more than twenty or thirty minutes to vacuum the floor, but we may feel it is a burden to dust even weekly, much less daily.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If there is no regulation and we are free to do whatever we like making phone calls, reading newspapers, and going window-shopping as we please, not having to do a single thing that we dislike, then we will not feel anything is a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the condition of our natural man, so we truly need a strong turn.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we can all exercise to turn to our spirit and do things according to the feeling in our spirit, we will discover that going out door-knocking really is an opportunity given by the Lord for us to take a deep breath to fill up the empty hole within us.</S>
