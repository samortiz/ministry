   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SHOWING FAITH BY WORKS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 18 says, "But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If a vain and boastful person keeps on boasting, someone will eventually rise up and say, "You say that you have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But where is it?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You should be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You have faith, but I have works."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Notice that this one does not say that he has works only; he does not say that he is without faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not what a Christian would say.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He says, "You have faith, and I have works.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I have provided someone a meal today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have given someone clothing today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Please show me your faith without works.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What good is it if you only talk about these things?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Can you see the meaning in these words?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When you read them, you must pay attention to the tone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you read James, the most important thing is to take note of the tone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you pay attention to the tone here, you have to admit that this word is spoken to the vain and boastful person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>James is speaking here about practice; he is not dealing with justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must take note of the word "show" here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This person says, "Show me," and, "I will show you."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, James 2 is not talking about whether or not a man has faith before God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not dealing with our faith before God at all; rather, it is dealing with our faith before man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If someone boasts before man that he has faith, you should say to such a one, "Show me your faith without works."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>James 2 deals with the problem of faith before man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No one can see whether or not you have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Others see only if you have works, that is, if you feed others and give others clothes to wear.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do you realize that this requires faith also?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose that there is a brother or sister here tonight who lacks clothes or food.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I say to him or her that as long as we believe, we will be clothed and fed, that is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>James says that we have to feed him and clothe him, and at the same time we should have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you realize that it takes faith to give to others?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This faith comes from two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If I do not have much money, perhaps only a few coins in my pocket, and I see someone without food and clothing, I have to exercise faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I do not need to have faith for others; for them I need works only.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But for myself, I need faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If I do not have faith within me, I will probably not be able to give away these few coins until I have reconsidered and counted them a few more times.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I will wonder if I will be able to get back what I would give away.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if I can spontaneously give away the few coins, it must mean that I have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, when you see a poor man and give him food and clothing, you must have faith before you can have works.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without works, your faith cannot be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, even if you are rich and it does not take much faith for you to give away a little, how do you know that after you have given the money, it would not spoil the receiver and cause him to look to you again the next time to bear his burden?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you do good to others indiscriminately, would it not cause others to look to man continually for help?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many times we do not give something to beggars because we are afraid that doing so would cause them to be beggars forever.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, even if you are a rich person, you have to have faith that God can keep a person from developing a bad habit of depending and relying on others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You have to believe that God would not make you bear this person's burden continually.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a work, but it is a work of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is a work that comes out of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He who makes big promises and speaks empty words appears to have great faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But actually, he has no faith at all.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you have faith, you should take off your coat and let another put it on.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You should invite others to eat your food.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you only talk about faith, you do not have it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, James concluded that this kind of talk is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The point here is not that faith is wrong, but that speaking empty words is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Last night we talked about faith.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The night before last we also talked about faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But we have not paid attention to this kind of faith yet.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Inasmuch as James was opposed to it, we are opposed to it, too.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is useless to speak empty words.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verse 19 says, "You believe that God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You do well; the demons also believe and shudder."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a very strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You believe that God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You do well to believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The demons believe this too, but they shudder.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Please take note of the word "and."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The question today is not whether or not you believe.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you say that you believe, no one can say that you do not.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The problem is that even the demons believe.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But they do not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The apostles did not write to the demons, saying, "Peace be unto you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>May God bless you and the fallen angels with you."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Although the demons believe, they shudder.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>That kind of faith does them no good.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Their faith makes them shudder and lose their peace.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you say that you believe, is your believing the kind of believing that the demons have?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>James's words are very strong and sharp.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Undoubtedly, you do believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But the demons believe, too.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You say you believe, but at the same time you shudder, fear, and are nervous.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, you are standing on the same ground as the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When we read on, we understand what James is against.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>James is not against faith at all.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He is against a certain kind of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>James is not saying that faith will not justify.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He is merely saying that this certain kind of faith will not justify.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In verse 20 James calls these people by their names.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He calls them what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He does not call them brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He does not call them his beloved, as Paul did; nor does he call them fathers or little children, as John did.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Rather, he calls them vain men.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>"But are you willing to know, O vain man, that faith without its works is useless?"</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Notice the words "are you willing" here.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>That James says this proves how hard their attitude is.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When others speak God's Word to them and warn them, they still will not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Hence, James asks if they are willing to know that this kind of faith is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is not that they are unable to know or that they are unable to be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It is not that no one will teach them how to know.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It is simply a matter of their not being willing to know.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Suppose I try to speak to a brother, and he looks away.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>When I try again, he looks the other way.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When I try a third time, he begins to talk to another brother.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I would then say, "Brother, are you willing to listen or not?"</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This is what James is saying here.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Are you willing to know that this kind of faith without works is dead?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When we read the Bible, we have to ask God to show us the circumstances under which the portion was written.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>James calls this kind of people vain men.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>They put everything out in the open for others to see and talk about and thus exhibit themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>They want to have a share in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>They want to speak up wherever they are.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>James says that this kind of person must be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>O vain man, are you willing to know that this kind of faith is useless?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Because they will not listen after he has spoken so much to them, he has to taunt them and shout at them a little.</S>
