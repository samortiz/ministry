In this lesson we shall consider the establishment of the local churches. What is the difference between the formation and the establishment? [There is an important difference between the formation of the universal church and the establishment of the churches. The universal church is not established; rather, it is formed with two categories of elements: all the believers as the extrinsic element and the all-inclusive Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God consummated as the all-inclusive, compound Spirit as the intrinsic element. Instead of being established, the universal church is formed by these two categories of elements.]<p>The formation is related to the universal church and was accomplished by the Triune God exclusively. He did the choosing, the redeeming, and the regenerating through His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Only He is qualified to form the church. None of us can help Him in the formation of the universal church. The establishment of the churches, however, is different. It is a job that man can participate in by co-operating with the Triune God. Man not only can participate, man is needed to establish the churches.
