<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S WORK IN TIME<br />
BEING TO WORK HIMSELF INTO MAN</h2>
<p>Everything that does not belong to God Himself, even if it has been created by Him, will all pass away. The heavens, the earth, and all things, even we ourselves, will all pass away, because the heavens, the earth, and all things, including ourselves, are not God Himself. That is why they will all pass away. No matter how good you are, and how nice and how clean you look, all these things will pass away. Of course, humanly speaking, it is always better to do good than to do evil. But the good and evil that come from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are the same before God. Everything that is not of God will pass away. The Chinese have a saying: &ldquo;Humility brings profit, while arrogance brings loss.&rdquo; But both of these things will also pass away. Today we are not evaluating matters from a temporary point of view. Rather, we are evaluating matters from an eternal point of view. Many things may appear to be good in time, but they cannot endure for eternity. Good is something that exists in time; it cannot be brought into eternity. To do good is the goal of those in the world, but a Christian&rsquo;s goal belongs to eternity. In eternity, there are only things that belong to God. Only God&rsquo;s things are eternal. It is true that God&rsquo;s things pass through time, yet they proceed from eternity and extend through eternity. Everything that God accomplishes in time and in the world is for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose, which is to work Himself into man. Only when God is worked into man can God&rsquo;s eternal purpose be fulfilled. God passes through time in order that He can work Himself into man, that is, in order for Him to mingle Himself into man.

<h2 class="head1">GOD CARING FOR THE PERSON<br />
MORE THAN FOR THE THINGS</h2>
<p>In the church the most important thing is the person. The importance of the person far exceeds that of any work. In the world it is just the opposite; there, the work is more important than the person. But for us the person is more important. Time stands between the two eternities; both creation and redemption are within the span of time. During the span of time, God does many works. God&rsquo;s main goal, however, is not the works but to gain persons through the works. God does not work for the sake of working, but for the sake of gaining men through His works. God is not here merely to accomplish a work but to use His work to gain some people. Hence, our views have to be changed. (<em>Messages Given during the Resumption of Watchman Nee&rsquo;s Ministry,</em> vol. 1, p. 189)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PERSON BEING GOD&rsquo;S METHOD AND WAY</h2>
<p>The service of the elders has to do with the person of the elder. It does not depend on the method but on the person. In the New Testament it is very difficult to find out what is the method or way to serve. Some places seem to speak about the method or the way, but actually the emphasis is still the person himself. The person is the way, and the person is the Lord&rsquo;s work. If God does not gain a person, He will have no work, and He will have no way. A way is a course that a person takes. If God does not gain man, He will have no course to take. Man thinks that the most important thing to do is to find a good way. However, God&rsquo;s work does not involve giving us the ways but is a matter of gaining the persons. If God can gain two or three brothers here, He will have a way. Even if I present to you the best way to be an elder, it will be useless if the person is wrong. We, the person, should be gained by God. We have to learn to be the proper person more than to learn to do the proper things. It is meaningless for things to be done properly without the person being a proper one. What you are is what you do. You cannot serve God beyond what you are as a person. Hudson Taylor said in his book <em>Union and Communion</em> that what we are is more important than what we do. This word left a deep impression on me. We should know how to help the brothers and sisters properly.

<p>We have to remember all the time that the need today is for God to work Himself into us rather than for us to work for God. All those who will only work for God without allowing God to work in them will eventually be rejected. Only those who allow God to work in them through various circumstances, people, matters, and events will be blessed by Him. (<em>Messages Given during the Resumption of Watchman Nee&rsquo;s Ministry,</em> vol. 1, p. 111)</p>

<p>To love the Lord Jesus does not mean to work for Him. Working for Him means nothing to the Lord Jesus. If you do not believe this today, some day you will believe it. But that day will be too late. It is not that we work for Him but that He works on us. We must not be merely His workers but His work (Eph. 2:10). We must take in the Lord so that He may perfume us and transform us. Then we will progress from one figure to another and will arrive at the stage of the palanquin and the crown. But we still need to go on to the garden and the city. May the Lord be merciful to us and take us all the way! Life and building are the two main items of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This is why we must attain to the garden and the city. (<em>Life and Building as Portrayed in the Song of Songs,</em> pp. 85-86)</p>
