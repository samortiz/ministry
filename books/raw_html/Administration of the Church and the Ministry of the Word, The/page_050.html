 <h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD<br />
AND THE SERVICE IN THE CHURCH<br />
NEEDING TO HAVE A LIVING COORDINATION</h2>
<p>We must fellowship, through prayer and consideration, with those whom we serve concerning the content of our speaking. When I was serving in northern China, between 1940 and 1943, there was a brother whose situation was in my constant consideration. Sometimes I received a burden while I was speaking from the podium, and I would say that this brother needed to be visited. The brothers and sisters who heard this received a burden and visited him. Presently, however, because all the brothers endeavor to be unique in their speaking in order to become famous, they are not concerned about receiving a burden. This cannot be considered service.</p>
<p>It is regretful that the brothers in northern China did not leave the mainland. The messages they gave met the practical need and were not compiled hastily. When saints returned from visiting the brothers and sisters, they gave a report of their visit. On Monday mornings we would fellowship concerning the condition of the brothers and sisters from eight in the morning until three in the afternoon. Sometimes we would even fast and pray for them. As a result we learned many lessons. We studied how to help those who were having problems and how to deal with the problems. Often after a person was visited, he became living. Our speaking and our visitation worked together. But this working together was not by discussion; it was in spontaneity. This is true and practical coordination.</p>
<p>The speaking from the podium was living, and those who came to the meetings were also living. Many of the saints were amazed that what was released in the message met their exact need. Whenever they came to a meeting, their problem was solved. The speaking touched their problem and their inner being; hence, their problem was solved, and their need was met. What was spoken was the living word. This was the situation for almost two years, because the serving ones looked for a living word, rather than a routine speaking. They were not disorganized or loose, nor did they speak at will. Hence, wherever they went, their leading in the churches was living.</p>
<p>The best period of our coordination in the ministry of the word was between 1940 and 1943. Our present situation does not match the situation we had then. During that time the coordination between those serving and those ministering the word was living. Printing was not as convenient as it is today, and there were not that many arrangements, but everything was living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>In brief, we cannot be individualistic. We should learn to depend on others, relying on them for our life. We should learn to coordinate with others in service. We should not use dead ordinances or speak dead messages. Rather, we should study a living way and learn the lessons. Moreover, we should receive a burden and understand people&rsquo;s needs. We should know the different problems of the saints, the problems of the children, the young people, and the elderly ones. Based upon this knowledge, we can touch the elderly, the young people, and the parents when we speak. Everyone who hears the message will be touched. The church needs such a living word to bring in a living situation.</p>
<p>Today we encounter death in all our meetings. The children&rsquo;s meeting, the young people&rsquo;s meeting, and the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting are all conducted according to dead ordinances. These meetings are our responsibilities. We cannot continue like this. The Lord&rsquo;s work and the church are suffering a great loss, and the main responsibility is with those who minister the word. The supply in the ministry of the word is important to the children, the young people, the parents, the elderly, and the working saints.</p>
