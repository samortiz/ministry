   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DEFICIENCY OF THE REFORMATION A. The Recovery of Faith</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>without a Clear Understanding of Justification</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Luther, we see the recovery of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, Luther did not recover justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He only recovered faith, and he was not so clear concerning justification.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>History tells us that he once punished himself in order to be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Rome, he once climbed up to a cathedral step by step in order to be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later, he saw that a man is not justified by works, but by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. Bringing In National Churches</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Luther came out of Babylon, but he did not return to Jerusalem yet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He brought politics into the church and thought that by so doing, it would help the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Little did he realize that no political power can help the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the contrary, any political power will only damage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the end, the national churches were formed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The national churches are partnerships between politicians and believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The one contributed Germany whereas the other contributed the doctrines, and the result was the national churches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Germany, the Lutheran church became the national church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The reason the Lutherans embraced the power of politics was that Roman Catholicism was too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But by so doing, what we see was a change of nationality instead of a change of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church was changed from a Roman church to a German church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In England, it became the Anglican church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every Englishman automatically became a member of the Anglican church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As soon as a person was born, he was baptized in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No question was asked as to whether or not such a person was regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The only thing that mattered was whether or not such a person was an Englishman.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as a person was an Englishman and was born in England, he was a member of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Consequently, the tradition of infant baptism by sprinkling became very prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE RAISING UP OF INDEPENDENT CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With the rising up of the national churches, many pure seekers and lovers of the Lord became dissatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They did not want to remain in the national churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, some independent free churches were formed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Soon after the Reformation, there were over two thousand independent churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Switzerland alone, there were over two hundred such churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During this period of time, the Roman Catholic church persecuted the Protestant churches, and the Protestant churches in turn persecuted the smaller independent churches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To stop these small churches from being established, the English Parliament even passed a law to unify all the churches in England.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, this produced the so-called Nonconformists.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They were faithful lovers of the Lord raised up by Him, who would not cooperate with the national churches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The government persecuted them and ordered them to take jobs five miles away from their former places of occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They could not work for the government, and all of them who were government officers were removed from their posts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who opposed the law were condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE RECOVERY OF THE EQUALITY OF BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>AND THE TRUTH OF BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After this, there were the Mennonites, who were the first group of believers to realize the error of a hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Among them, they recovered the title of "brothers," and they addressed each other as brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some of them went to Russia to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In addition to them, the Baptists were also raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They saw the error of infant baptism, and they taught that a man must first be clear about the truth of baptism before he can be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They were called the Anabaptists, and they were much persecuted at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These are recoveries of the outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE RECOVERY OF THE INNER LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In addition, there was the recovery of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Madame Guyon, Father Fenelon, and others brought in a recovery of the spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These ones are now generally called the mystics.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They practiced denying their self, joining themselves with God to oppose their self, giving no excuse to the self, and not asking God to spare His hand on them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In every age, we can find followers of their practice.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In addition to these, there were also the Pietists and the Quietists.</S>
