<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WAY TO KNOW GODâ€”<br>DEALING WITH GOD<br>AND BEING DEALT WITH BY GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 27</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Luke 22:41-45; Col. 1:9-12; Matt. 2:4-6; 26:42, 44; 22:29; Psa. 103:7; 2 Cor. 12:7-9; John 11:49-51; Heb. 8:10-11</H1><P>This morning we have read the Scriptures about an event which took place several days before the Lord Jesus was crucified. The Sadducees came to Jesus asking Him concerning the matter of resurrection. They said there were seven brothers with them. The first one married a wife and died and left no children. His widow became the wife of the second brother. Likewise, the second brother also died, and the third became the husband. This continued until the seventh brother, who also eventually died. Last of all, the woman died. Whose wife would she be at the time of resurrection? The Lord gave them a very clear answer: "You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God" (Matt. 22:29). I am not going to expound on the marriage of the seven brothers, but point out from this verse two very deep principles which relate to our spiritual living. The first principle is to know the Bible, and the second is to know the power of God. Christians should have two kinds of knowledge: the first is the knowledge of the Bible, and the second is the knowledge of God.</P><P>Among God's seeking children, there are two kinds of people: the first kind know the Bible but lack the knowledge of God's power; the other kind know God's power but not the Bible. Very few Christians have both kinds of knowledge in a balanced way. Some believers have considerable Bible knowledge but know nothing about God's will, nature, and ways of working. My intention is not to talk about the equal importance of these two things, but to tell you that it is not enough to just know the Bible; we have to know God's power as well. I will assume that all of you know the Bible. What we want to see now is how to know God. It is not enough just to have the knowledge of the Bible; we must also know God. However, if we want to know God, we need to deal with God and be dealt with by God. Without dealing with God and being dealt with by God, we cannot know God. The knowledge of God comes from dealing with God and being dealt with by God. Apart from this there is no other way. This is what all of us should pay attention to.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MERE BIBLE KNOWLEDGE<br>DOES NOT NECESSARILY MAKE ONE KNOW GOD</H2><P>One day several magi came to Jerusalem asking, "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews?" (Matt. 2:2). They asked this question everywhere along their way. When Herod the king heard this, his heart was troubled, and assembling in haste all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked where Christ was to be born (v. 4). At that time did anyone among them say, "I do not know; let me go back to check the Scripture"? Did anyone say, "I have forgotten what the Scripture says; let me go back and look it up"? No, they could recite immediately, "In Bethlehem of Judea" (v. 5). This proves that the priests and the scribes knew the Scriptures very well. When they were asked, they answered immediately. Was their answer wrong? No, it was right. But strangely, not one scribe or priest went to Bethlehem. They knew the exact answer, but they only told the magi from the east to go to Bethlehem. They were like traffic policemen who only direct people from one place to another with a police stick in their hand, while remaining unmoved. The priests and scribes knew the Scriptures well, but they never took any action to look for the Messiah. The magi probably found out from the book left behind by Daniel about the One who was born to be the King of the Jews. Therefore, they came to seek the Lord despite the long journey. It is interesting to see that some people without Bible knowledge had the zeal to seek for Christ, while those with Bible knowledge did not seek for the Lord. It was the men from the east who came to seek the Lord from a long distance. Eventually, they found the Lord. Therefore, those who only have Bible knowledge do not necessarily know God.</P><P>This was true not only concerning Christ's birth; it was also true concerning Christ's death. It was Caiaphas who prophesied, "Nor do you take account of the fact that it is expedient for you that one man die for the people and that not the whole nation perish" (John 11:50). It was also Caiaphas and his father-in-law who sentenced Jesus to death. Therefore, we can see that it is useless to have only Bible knowledge without the knowledge of God. This is why God prophesied again and again through the prophet Jeremiah, "I will put My law within them and write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they will be My people. And they will no longer teach, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for all of them will know Me, from the little one among them even to the great one among them" (Jer. 31:33-34). The outward knowledge of the Bible is not sufficient; this knowledge also needs to be written within man. The result of this inward writing is knowing God. We hope all the brothers and sisters will realize that mere biblical knowledge is not enough; we need to pursue the knowledge of God as well.</P><P>Today an unfortunate phenomenon exists in many places: too few people know God. Brothers and sisters, it is possible for us to acquire much Bible knowledge without knowing God. If all that a man has is only some Bible knowledge, he is merely making weapons of reeds, which will collapse when the wind blows and which are completely powerless when it comes to fighting the warfare. Who can say today that he knows God's purpose, God's desire, God's will, and the way of God's work? I have often said that the knowledge of God is more precious than anything else. Nothing is more precious than this. A man can open up the Bible and can expound a passage very well. Yet at the same time, he can know nothing at all about God. Although he can say a great deal, he knows nothing concerning the knowledge of God. Originally, the knowledge of the Bible was to lead people to the knowledge of God. But this is not true today.</P>
