   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When young believers discover such an inward conflict, they are really baffled.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some become discouraged, thinking they are too bad, with no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some even doubt the genuineness of their regeneration because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They should have known that it was precisely because they were regenerated that they were having such a conflict.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Formerly, the flesh exercised its control without any interference.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, because their spirits were dead, they did not sense that they were sinful, even though they had sinned much.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now the new life comes, bringing with it the heavenly nature, desire, light, and thought.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once this new light enters into man, it exposes how man is so basically filthy and corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The new desire naturally is not willing to remain in corruption and filthiness but seeks to walk according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then the flesh spontaneously desires to war against the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such a war makes a believer feel that there are two persons within him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Each has his own opinion and power and is trying to overcome the other.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If he follows the spiritual life and overcomes, he will rejoice greatly, but if the flesh overcomes, he will not be able to avoid self-condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of experience is proof that such a one has been born anew.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's purpose is not to improve the flesh, but rather to destroy the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God gives His life to man at the time of regeneration for the purpose of destroying the self of the flesh through His life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the life that God gives to man is very powerful, a newly regenerated person is just like an infant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because he is newly born, he is still very feeble.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, because the flesh has ruled over him for such a long time, its power is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, he has not apprehended God's full salvation by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, at this juncture, although he has been born anew, it is still difficult for him not to be fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be fleshly means that he is still ruled by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The most pitiful thing is that although this man has been born again and the heavenly light has shined on him, and he knows that the flesh is hateful and he wishes with all his heart to overcome it, he is too weak in his own strength and is not able to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a time of much shedding of tears and much sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, every regenerated person must have a new desire to purge away sins in order to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, his will is not strong enough, and he is overcome by the flesh most of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Consequently, his victories are few, but his defeats are many.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How can he not hate himself at these times?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The experience Paul mentioned in Romans 7 is the story of such a conflict.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do...For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For I do not do the good which I will; but the evil which I do not will, this I practice...I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man, but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>15, 18-19, 21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The hearts of so many who have had the same experience will really respond in one accord with Paul's final sigh: "Wretched man that I am!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Who will deliver me from the body of this death?" v. 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What then is the meaning of this war?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This war is also a kind of discipline by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has already prepared a full salvation for man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man does not obtain it either because he does not know of it or because he does not want it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God can only give to man according to what he believes, accepts, and appropriates.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, when people ask for forgiveness and regeneration, God forgives and regenerates them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is through such a war that God makes the believers seek after and hold fast to the complete victory in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a believer has not obtained such a full salvation because he does not know it, through such a war he will seek to know it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Holy Spirit will then have a chance to reveal to him how Christ on the cross dealt with his old man so that this one may believe and may obtain it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a believer does not have it because he does not want it, the truth he has is merely in his head.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through such a war he will know that simply to have the knowledge is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since he fails repeatedly, this will create in him a desire to experience the truth he has known.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This kind of war increases as the days go by.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If these believers do not easily give up but continue to press on faithfully, then they will have much fiercer battles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Unless they obtain deliverance, this kind of war will never cease.</S>
