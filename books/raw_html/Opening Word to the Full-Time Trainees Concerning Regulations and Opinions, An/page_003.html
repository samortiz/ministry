<p>Our spiritual life, the divine life, zoe, should grow. It does not need to grow in God, but it does need to grow in us. Colossians 2:19 says that we need to grow with the growth of God. The divine life in God Himself is perfect, complete. It is at the highest peak and does not need any growth in itself. But when this life is mingled with our life, this mingled life needs to grow.<p>In the Scripture reading at the beginning of this message are some of the best verses concerning the growth in the divine life. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3:6 that he planted and Apollos watered but God caused the growth. We need to consider what Paul planted. Surely he did not plant the plant life or the animal life. Even he did not plant the human life. He planted the divine life into the human life. According to Matthew 13, the human life is the soil in which the Lord sows Himself as the seed of life. When any seed of the plant life is sown into the earth, there will be a mingling. The seed mingles with the soil to produce a plant. So when Paul said he planted, this means that he planted the divine life into the believers. Once the seed has been planted, there is the need of watering. Watering helps the growth of this life, which is divine, in humanity.<p>Ephesians 4:15 tells us that we all need to grow into the Head. The Head is Christ, the One who has the divine life mingled with His human life. The Head of the church is not merely the divine person. The divine person alone is not qualified to be the Head of the Body, which is the church. This Head needs to be the divine life mingled with the human life. We believers are humans who have received the divine life. We have the human life mingled with the divine life, so we are qualified to be the members of the Body of this Head. Now the divine life in us needs to grow. The human life in the Lord Jesus grew. Luke 2 tells us clearly that Jesus grew not in the divine life but in the human life (v. 52). Today we are growing spiritually, not in the human life but in the divine life. He was growing in the human life, and now we are growing in the divine life. In this divine life we grow into the Head.<p>Just by your human life, you are not qualified to have an organic union with the Head. The organic union with the Head depends upon the divine life mingled with your human life by faith and baptism (Eph. 4:5). By believing and being baptized, we all have been put into this organic union. In this organic union we, who have the human life, received the divine life. The mingling began here. In this mingling we need to grow with the divine life into the Head, and this divine life is God Himself. Colossians 2:19 says that we grow with the growth of God. This means that we grow with the growth of the divine life. Thus, we are growing with God as the divine life into the Head.<p>Among todayâ€™s Christians there is very little talk about such growth. Sometimes they might use the word growth, but not according to its biblical denotation. According to the biblical denotation, our growth in the divine life is to grow with God Himself increasing in us. God increasing in us means that He is added into our being. In this way we grow up into the Head in all things.<p>We need to see that even this growth needs regulation. In 1963 I was invited to speak in Dallas, and I strongly told the people there that we do not need any teaching. After the meeting, a group of people challenged me. They pointed out some verses from the Bible to show that we need teaching. They did not understand what I meant. The divine life does not need any teaching, but our human life, in which the divine life is, needs some teaching. Then you may wonder why I told people that we do not need any teaching. My point is this: Christianity always teaches people in the human life, while neglecting the divine life. But what we are short of today is the divine life. Teaching cannot help you without the divine life. So what you need today, in this sense, is not the teaching but the divine life. When I came to this country, I did not minister teaching to people for the human life. What I ministered all the time was Christ Himself. Christians today are short of the divine life, which is embodied in Christ. So in this sense, you do not need teaching. You need Christ, the very embodiment of the divine life.<p>But in another sense, after you have the divine life, you need teaching. In this message I substitute the word teaching with its synonym regulation. Regulation actually is the top teaching. Every teaching regulates you. Every teaching which a mother gives to her children is a kind of regulation. In this sense the Bible is full of teaching, full of regulation. The Old Testament, the testament of the law, is full of commandments, and the New Testament is also full of commandments. Even the Lord Jesus said in the Gospel of John that He gave the disciples a new commandment (13:34). John stresses the divine life and also stresses teaching. That means John stresses regulation.
