H. WEIGH</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 29, 1948<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><p>(Editor's Note: Brother K. H. Weigh arrived in Shanghai in early April to attend the co-workers' fellowship. On April 30 he left Shanghai to go to Foochow. This message is Brother Nee's word of farewell to Brother Weigh on the evening before Brother Weigh left.</p><p>There is only one Christ, but due to different viewpoints and different emphases of the workers, it seems that Christ has been divided into many Christs. If a worker cannot express to others the one Christ whom God desires to present, his work is a failure. Many today have very intimate contact with the Lord, whereas others are merely pressing upon Him (Mark 5:24). Perhaps some indeed touched His back, held His hand, or tore His garments, but they had no relationship whatsoever with Him in life. Among the many who thronged Jesus, the woman with an issue of blood was not the only one who was ill, but she was the only one healed in life (Matt. 9:20-22).</p><p>Some today indeed know the Christ of Bethsaida (Mark 8:22-26), the Christ of Gadara (5:1-20), or the Christ of Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35). In their experience they have really seen miracles and wonders. They may even be able to perform the miracles themselves. Yet if there is no true inward revelation, none of these works will amount to anything. Some may be able to tell others with moving power about a Christ of Emmaus. They may be able to expound the Scriptures and may cause others to become truly fervent in their hearts, but it is all to no avail. The real work is to impart a Christ of revelation to others. I speak these words not only to Brother Weigh, but to all the co-workers and to all the brothers and sisters alike. If you and I cannot impart a Christ of revelation to others, our work is a failure.</p><p>Here we see that there are basically two different stands that a worker of the Lord can take: one emphasizes work, the expounding of the Scriptures, miracles, works of wonders, answers to prayers, and so forth. The other presents a Christ of revelation before men.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_110.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_112.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 57: The Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry &nbsp; pg 111</div><br></body></html>
