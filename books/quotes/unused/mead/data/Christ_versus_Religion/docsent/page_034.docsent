   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FIRST QUESTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The high priest, the authority of the religion, and the elders, the authority of the community, combined together to raise the first question, a question concerning the source of Jesus' authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"By what authority doest thou these things?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And who gave thee this authority?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>21:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, they asked, "What is your source?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Is your authority authentic?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Where did a little man like you get this authority?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not consider such questions lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Christianity today people are always asking such questions: "What about his origin?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Is that fundamental?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is that sound?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What they really mean, and sometimes they say it in so many words, is this: "From what seminary has he graduated?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Where was he ordained, and by whom was he ordained?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus, of course, was so wise.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He said, "I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The baptism of John, whence was it?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From heaven or from men?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>21:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He really put them on the spot.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then those learned ones with the highest attainments reasoned among themselves saying, "If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why then did ye not believe him?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>21:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What they meant was that if they endorsed John, they would have to receive Jesus, because John testified of Him and was His forerunner.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they accepted John, they must also accept Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, they said in effect, "We cannot say that.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do, we will fall into a trap."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then they said, "But if we shall say, From men; we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet" 21:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually they decided that the best solution would be to tell a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So they turned back to Jesus and said, "We know not."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the Lord Jesus knew that they knew.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said in effect, "You know, but you won't tell Me. You say you don't know, but that is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The truth is that you won't tell Me. And since you won't tell Me, neither will I tell you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You lie, but I will not lie."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jesus is really Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is really worthy of our worship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Who could answer a question in this way but Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Following this answer of the Lord to the chief priests and elders of the people, He proceeded to speak to them in parables.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I will just refer briefly to the last two.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the second parable the Lord indicated that He was there for God's building 21:33-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They had spoken to Him in a foolish and sinful way, but in spite of that the Lord Jesus proceeded to unveil something of God's revelation, of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this parable He indicated first that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God sent His Son unto them, and this Son is the heir who will receive all God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What they were doing was rejecting this heavenly and divine heir, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Secondly, the Lord Jesus told them that in rejecting such a One, they were rejecting the very cornerstone for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He said in other words, "You do not know what you are talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You do not know what you are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You do not know whom you are rejecting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am here as the Son of God, rejected by you; but eventually what you reject will become the headstone of the corner."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For what purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even in the Lord's answer to such foolish ones, He indicated that He was for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Following this, He spoke the parable of the wedding feast 22:1-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Son of God is the cornerstone, and the Son of God is also the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, the Lord revealed two marvelous things the building and the wedding feast.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The building requires the feast, and the feast is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more we feast upon Jesus, the more we will be built into His building.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord's answer in these parables is so full of meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By referring to I Corinthians 3 and I Peter 2, we see that the feasting is for the growth, and the growth is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, we all must feast at the wedding feast of Jesus that we may grow, and as we grow we will become proper material for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is the chief cornerstone for the building, and we are the many stones.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We become the stones by feasting on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God's intention with the Lord Jesus is simply the building and the feast, the enjoyment and the building up.</S>
