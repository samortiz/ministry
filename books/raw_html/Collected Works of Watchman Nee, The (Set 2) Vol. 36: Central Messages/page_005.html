<p>Philippians 2:12-13 says, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure." Verse 1:21 tells us about Paul's personal experience. These two verses tell us what every Christian can experience.</p><p>When some people read, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling," they think that salvation is something to be worked out. Therefore, they make up their minds to rise up early to read the Bible and to be zealous to testify to others. But they fail because they have forgotten the words in verse 13 which say, "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure." Since the word "for" denotes a cause, "Work out your own salvation" in verse 12 is only a result.</p><p>In our daily lives we mainly do two things: (1) will (decide)&mdash;this is an inward resolution, and (2) act (work)&mdash;this is outward behavior. All our living is composed of these two things. Inwardly we plan, and outwardly we speak and act. We are able to will and work because God operates in us. This verse does not say that we should will and work; it says that God is operating in our hearts until we are able to will and work. God's operation is God's working. God works in our hearts until we are able to will and work. Since God has already worked in, we are able to work out. If nothing is worked in, nothing can be worked out.</p><p>We often tell God, "O God, I am willing to obey You absolutely. But this is extremely difficult. I do not want to love the world. But this is extremely difficult. I do not want to go along with my self. But this is extremely difficult." There is a way of deliverance; God can work in us to the point that we are able to obey Him absolutely. He is able to work to the point that we do not have to love the world and do not have to go along with our selves. Although we are not able in ourselves, God is able to work until we are able.</p><p>Full salvation for a Christian is not getting rid of one sin today and another evil tomorrow. Complete salvation means to receive the complete Christ. If you have Christ, you have full salvation. It is most difficult to help a Christian whose eyes are not set on Christ! He looks at what is good and bad about himself. He pays attention to his particular sins, to certain persons who entangle him, and to certain things that attract him. He blames himself and tries to overcome all these. But this is a big mistake. God has no intention that he overcome these things one by one or make things right one by one. God only wants him to receive a complete Christ.</p><p>Suppose that a child loves to eat fruit. He may want pears one day and go buy them from an orchard. The next day he may want oranges or bananas and go buy some more. Suppose that he later learns that his father is the owner of the orchard and is giving him the orchard. After he realizes this, his way of eating will be different because all the fruit is his. As Christians, we want to do one thing today and another thing tomorrow. Today we want patience, and tomorrow we want love. This is like the child who buys a pear one day and an orange the next. God wants us to receive the complete Christ. All the things in the "orchard" are ours. If we buy them piece by piece, we will have to buy again and again when we run out.</p><p>I am not saying that we do not need to be patient or to have love. We should be patient, and we should love. But if we try to practice these things item by item, we will not succeed. If we do this, day after day we will find ourselves loving the world more and being prouder than before. We should realize that the whole "orchard" is ours. God wants us to have one common goal&mdash;the complete Christ. God operates in us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.</p><p>In the past perhaps we may have heard the truth concerning Christ living His life out of us. But today I must ask, "Is this our case?" Although we know this, we only practice it on a trial basis. The result is that we inevitably fail.</p><p>First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption." We have to read this verse very slowly and carefully. At the time we were saved, God made Christ our personal righteousness and our personal sanctification. If someone asks, "What is sanctification?", we have to answer, "Christ." What is overcoming? It is Christ. What are patience and humility? They are Christ. If we can answer this way, all will be well and we will overcome. We are thoroughly corrupted and fleshly. But Christ is sanctification. He is my sanctification. No one is holy and no one can overcome. There is only one way to be holy and overcome. It is to say to God, "O God, I receive Your Son!"</p>
