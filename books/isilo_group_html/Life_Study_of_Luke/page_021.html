Verse 42 says, &ldquo;And when He became twelve years old, they went up according to the custom of the feast.&rdquo; At the age of twelve, a boy was called by the Jews &ldquo;son of the law,&rdquo; and first incurred legal obligation (Alford). The number twelve also signifies eternal perfection in God&rsquo;s administration. Hence, &ldquo;twelve years old&rdquo; indicates that what the Lord did here was perfectly related to God&rsquo;s administration.</p><p>This verse says that they went up &ldquo;according to the custom of the feast.&rdquo; This custom was ordained by God for one to be a legal male in Israel (Deut. 16:16).</p><p>According to verses 43 through 48, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and His parents did not know it. When they realized that He was not with them in the caravan, they returned to Jerusalem searching for Him. When they found Him, His mother said to Him, &ldquo;Child, why did You treat us like this? Behold, Your father and I are greatly distressed seeking You&rdquo; (v. 48). The Lord replied, &ldquo;Why is it that you were seeking Me? Did you not know that I must be in the things of My Father?&rdquo; (v. 49). This indicates that the boy Jesus was caring for the interests of God. The words &ldquo;My Father&rdquo; in verse 49 point to the deity of the boy Jesus (John 5:18). In His humanity He was the son of His parents; in His deity He was the Son of God the Father.</p><p>Verse 51 says that the Lord Jesus &ldquo;went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them.&rdquo; Here we see the subjection of His humanity to His human parents.</p><p>In 2:41-51 we again see the Lord&rsquo;s dual status, His status as the Son of God and the Son of Man. As the Son of God, He cared for God&rsquo;s interests. As the Son of Man, He was obedient in His humanity to His human parents.</p><h2 class="head3">Advancing in Wisdom and Stature<br />and in Favor with God and Men</h2><p>In 2:52 we have the conclusion of the section concerning the youth of the Man-Savior: &ldquo;And Jesus kept advancing in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and men.&rdquo; As in verse 40, this wisdom of the Savior&rsquo;s deity was revealed in proportion to the measure of His growth. The Greek word for &ldquo;stature&rdquo; denotes not only stature as in 19:3, but also age.</p><p>We are told in verse 52 that the Man-Savior advanced in favor with both God and men. He advanced in favor with God because He was growing in the expression of God according to God&rsquo;s desire. He advanced in favor with men because He was growing in human virtues, which are gracious to men. Hence, He was growing as a God-man before God and men. Both God and men were pleased with Jesus, happy with Him.</p><p>As we have pointed out, all the incidents narrated by Luke in chapter two of this Gospel are strong evidences that the Lord Jesus was a real, genuine, proper, and perfect Man. However, in chapter two of the Gospel of Matthew we have another category of events, and those events prove that the Lord Jesus was a King, a true descendant of David to inherit the throne and the kingdom. Therefore, both Matthew 2 and Luke 2 speak concerning the youth of Christ. But they reveal different aspects of His status&mdash;His status as the King and His status as a real Man. In order for Him to be the King, there was the need of certain events to prove that He was the genuine heir and successor of David&rsquo;s throne. In order for Him to be revealed as a real Man, there was the need of evidences to prove the genuineness of His humanity. Thus, in chapter two of Luke we have clear and strong proof that the Lord Jesus was a proper and genuine Man.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Luke &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
