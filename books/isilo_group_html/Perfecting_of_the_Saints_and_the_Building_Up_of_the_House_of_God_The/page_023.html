REPRESENTING GOD</h2>
<p>Those who minister the word represent God. This concerns our person. We must be persons who speak for God as His representatives. Since we are God&rsquo;s representatives, we cannot speak our own words. We should be persons who also contact God and fellowship with Him continually. We should not give a message if we cannot touch God and fellowship with Him. When we give a message, we should fellowship with God. When our condition does not match what we speak, we are not speaking for God. What we speak should minister God; otherwise, we are not speaking for God, and our words are vain and empty.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MESSAGES NOT DEPENDING<br />
ON THE SUBJECT BEING SIMPLE OR DEEP,<br />
NEW OR OLD, BUT ON BEING LIVING</h2>
<p>The messages that we give should not depend on whether the subject is simple or deep. A message that is deep may not necessarily be good. We may consider that we would speak on something that is deep, because others have spoken on regeneration already. This concept needs to be dropped. We can give a simple message on regeneration even if others speak about abiding in the Lord or about regeneration in a deep way. It does not matter whether a message is simple or deep; neither does it matter whether it is new or old. We should have a willingness to speak on the same subject. It may be that a brother spoke on regeneration last week, another brother may speak on regeneration this week, and still another brother may speak on regeneration next week. We may speak on regeneration for several weeks. The more we speak on regeneration, the more the saints will be supplied. We should not be afraid to repeat topics. We do not have to always be looking for new topics. If we are always looking for some new topics, we will be speaking on many strange topics.</p>
<p>Our only concern should be that a message is living, not whether it is simple, deep, new, or old. We can speak the same message in many different ways. If the brothers who minister the word in the church in Taipei give fifty living messages concerning regeneration, the church in Taipei will be enlivened. We should speak messages that are living, not messages that are deep, new, or strange. In order to speak a living message, we must not be at ease and rely on our mind too much. If we want to speak a living message, our spirit must be fresh and living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT STRESSING LOGIC</h2>
<p>Furthermore, instead of stressing logic, we should focus on whether the saints can touch God and life and whether the message is living. Not many people focus on the logic of a message in a meeting. Some saints are not even clear concerning the topic of a message, but they remember what touches them. Hence, we should not focus on presenting a message in a logical way. The Scriptures were written by men who were borne by the Holy Spirit. While the Bible is not illogical, it is not rigidly logical. Nevertheless, the Bible has its logic.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING BIBLE EXPOSITION AND<br />
THINGS OF KNOWLEDGE</h2>
<p>The brothers who minister the word should not quote from too many sources, because this does not help the saints. Quoting from many sources inevitably leads to messages that merely contain knowledge in a way of Bible exposition. We should try to avoid this. An exposition of the Bible should give life. If it does not give life, we should not use it. Whether we give a message in an edification meeting, in a Bible-study meeting, or for fellowship, we should try our best to avoid bringing in too many things. We should not think that it is useful to quote many sources. If we expound the Word, we should do so according to life to meet the need in the meeting. This can be likened to a fruit tree, which has branches, leaves, and fruit. The edible part of a tree is the fruit. The function of the other parts of the tree is to produce the fruit.</p>
<p>There are many words recorded in the Bible, but some of them are branches and leaves that support the things which supply us. They are not the fruit. We cannot eliminate these words, because without them the central words will not survive. This can be compared to cutting off the leaves and branches from a tree but still expecting the tree to grow fruit. The words that are the branches and leaves support the fruit which supplies life. We should not give the saints &ldquo;branches and leaves&rdquo; to eat. Some brothers quote too many sources when they give a message. We must check and be sure that what we quote gives life to the saints. We should not give messages that stir up the saints&rsquo; curiosity; rather, we should supply life. The food prepared in a kitchen is to supply people with nutrients. We do not give people branches to eat. It is not a matter of whether something is from the Bible but whether it supplies life. It is useless to give the saints something that is in the Bible if it does not supply life.</p>
<p>It may be difficult for us to receive this word. However, according to my observation, the brothers who minister the word quote too many sources when they give a message. This often causes the saints to only debate about the Bible. Over the years saints have come to me with many questions concerning Bible exposition, but I never answered their questions. I rarely answer questions after I give a message, because most questions lead to debates. The brothers should learn to eat only the fruit, not the branches and leaves.</p>
<p>We need to be delivered from debates. Thus, in order to avoid debates, we should not bring distracting things to the saints. The more distracting things that we bring in, the more debates there will be. We should give only one kind of message, which is a word of life. We should receive only the things that supply us with life from the Word of God. Expositions and word studies should be on our desk, not on the dining table. What we present from the podium must supply life.</p>
<p>Some of the brothers may be offended by this word. As your brother, I must admonish you. If we do not receive this fellowship, we will reap the fruit of our labor in the future. Whatever a person sows, this he will also reap (Gal. 6:7). If we give the brothers and sisters life, we will enjoy the fruit of our labor. It is a small thing for us to suffer, but it is a great matter for the church to suffer loss. May the Lord have mercy on us and cause us to take heed to this matter. May we know only that God in His Son through the Holy Spirit is our life, and may we speak only this word.</p>
<p>We do not want anything other than this word. Just as fish bones are to support the fish and are not for us to eat, some words in the Bible support the words that give life. These words were needed to write the Bible, but we do not eat these words, nor do we give them to the saints to eat. We give the saints only the words that give life. We are foolish to give the saints bones to eat. We should give them meat. We should give the saints only food to eat; otherwise, what we give them will harm them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>The ministry of the word is to minister words that are spirit and life and that cause the saints to touch God. These words focus on God as man&rsquo;s life. Therefore, we must learn to contact God and fellowship with Him so that our words are God&rsquo;s utterance, and we represent God. When we give a message, we should not look for deep, new, or strange material. A message should be living. It does not matter whether the content is deep, simple, old, or new. When we speak, we must follow the inspiration of the Spirit and not care about being logical. We should follow the impression in our spirit and not care about being thorough or complete. Logic does not give people life. The Spirit enlivens people and gives them life. The brothers who minister the word truly need to look to the Lord, because this is a great lack among us.</p>
<p>Many problems among us cannot be solved at this time, because we are short of the words of life. May the Lord have mercy on us, and may we know only to give messages concerning the Triune God as our life. May we continually learn, experience, and grow in this so that we supply the saints with words of wisdom. We may speak on many topics but give only one message. Then the church will be glorious.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Perfecting of the Saints and the Building Up of the House of God &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
