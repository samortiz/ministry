   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FUNCTION OF THE MEMBERS BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE AUTHORITY OF THE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Body, life and authority are one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a most harmonious union.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Where the oneness of the Body is, there the authority of the Body is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The function possessed by a member of the Body becomes his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are many things which we do not have to experience ourselves; we only need to submit to those who have experienced them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If I am a hand, I should realize that I am not made to see.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, I have to acknowledge the function of the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If I am a foot, I should realize that I am not made to hear; I have to accept the function of the ears.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The problem today is that some want to take the place of the eyes even though they are hands.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Others want to take over the function of the ears even though they are legs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Two years ago five brothers were studying a certain portion of the Scripture in my living room.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One was an ear, but he wanted to express something.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Another was a nose, yet he also wanted to say a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was like the five fingers of the hand conducting a conference among themselves to discuss the color of a pair of eyeglasses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the end there were five conclusions, and all of them were wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are the Body of Christ, and we can only see through the eyes that God has ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are not the eyes, we should not insist on seeing everything ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The so-called "seeing" of many people is actually the "touching" of their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Day after day God's children are touching colors with their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is no wonder that so many heresies have been produced during the past two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They all came about when men considered the touching of their hands to be the seeing of their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One portion of the Scripture might not have a definitive judgment if three or five brothers studied it for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But another brother may be able to give a judgment immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are a leg, it is wrong for us to do the things that belong to the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are willing to accept the other members, we will receive the riches of the entire Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is easy for the eyes to identify black and white.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The hand only needs to accept and submit, and it will receive what the eyes see.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a man is willing to submit to the authority of all the members, he will receive the riches of all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's children are poor because they have not submitted to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christians today want to see everything for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But one cannot do everything by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If all the members in the church together possess the riches of the entire Christ, the fullness of the Body of Christ as mentioned in Ephesians will be easily realized.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the eyes are single, the whole body is bright.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The eyes can take care of the scenery; there is no need for the ears to try to see.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They only need to accept the seeing of the eyes and enjoy this seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The ears listen to music, and neither the hands nor the eyes have to listen, yet both share the same enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A member cannot say, "I will only submit to the Head; I will not submit to the other members."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Just as a man should not rebel and oppose the Head presumptuously, he should not oppose the members.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No one dares challenge the Lord's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>So if all the members are obedient to the Lord's authority, they should be all the more obedient to the authority of the members with whom they are coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a member insists on seeing everything himself, he is in rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If one member refuses to receive supply from another member, he is rebelling against the latter because he does not yield to the Lord's coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our body is not like the central switchboard of a telephone system, where every terminal is directly related to just the switchboard.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord's authority is manifested in two areas in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the first the Lord speaks to a member directly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the second He uses one member to supply another member.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In both cases there is the exercise of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the eyes see, they see under the direct supervision of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For the eyes to see is for the whole Body to see.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the members of the Body should submit to the seeing of the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As far as the eyes are concerned, they are supplying.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As far as the other members are concerned, they are subjecting themselves to the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What the eyes see, the whole Body sees.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is indirect authority, or deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Remember, however, that deputy authority is the same as the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is rebellion for a person to rebel against the Head directly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is also rebellion for a person to reject the supply of the members or the deputized authority.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once we submit to visible authority, there will be no barrier between us and the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we submit to the other members, we remove all barriers that exist between us and the Head; we become one with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, the supply a member renders is the authority he possesses.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All other members have to submit to him and receive from him.</S>
