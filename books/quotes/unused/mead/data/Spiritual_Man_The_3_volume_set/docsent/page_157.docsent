   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now we can see what spiritual knowledge really is.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Only that which is apprehended in the spirit is spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Anything other than this is mere mental knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How does God know things?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By what means does He judge?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What knowledge does He use to manage the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Does He reason with His mind like men do?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Does He need to ponder things over before He can understand?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Does He know things by logic, arguments, or comparison?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Does He need to investigate and consider before He comes to a conclusion?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Does the omniscient One also need to use His brain?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God does not need to search in this way before He knows.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All of God's knowledge and judgment is intuitive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Intuition is the faculty of every spiritual man or being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Angels follow God's will by knowing it intuitively.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They do not ascertain it by the way of argument, reason, or thought.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The difference between understanding God's will by the way of the mind and the way of the intuition is immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Spiritual success or failure is surprisingly dependent upon this distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If believers' conduct and work were based on their rationale, reason, and common sense, no one would dare to attempt the great spiritual works that have been done in the past and even presently.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the spiritual works are beyond human reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Who would have dared to risk them if they had not known the will of God in their intuition?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Anyone who walks intimately with God, having secret fellowship with God and spiritual union with Him, receives His revelation in the intuition and clearly knows what moves he should take.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This behavior receives no sympathy from men, for others do not know what he personally knows.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the world's wisdom, his moves are totally meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Have not many spiritual believers been opposed because of this?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Have not the wise ones regarded them as crazy?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not only do the worldly people say this, but even their fleshly brothers criticize them in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is because the life of the old creation, whether in worldly people or in believers, is equally ignorant of the work of God's Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more intellectual believers often label the ones who act contrary to common sense as "foolishly zealous."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To them, their acts are soulishly enthusiastic.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But actually, many so-called foolish zealots are very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They behave "foolishly" because they have received revelation in their intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must be careful not to mix up intuition with emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The zeal of an emotional believer may appear to be something spiritual, but it may not actually be from the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The judgment of a rational believer likewise may appear to be something spiritual, but it also may not be a revelation from the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Just as the emotional believer is soulish, the rational believer is also soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The spirit does have zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In fact, its zeal far exceeds that of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All of the actions of spiritual believers are "justified in the Spirit" 1 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are not condoned by fleshly emotion or the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we fall from the position of the spirit and walk according to our fleshly feelings or rational thoughts, we will immediately be at a loss as to what to do and where to turn.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When this happens, we will be like Abraham, who went down to Egypt where help could be obtained from things which could be seen and touched.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The spirit and the soul work independently of each other.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the spirit has not ascended and is not totally in control, the soul will always war against it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When a believer's spirit is renewed, strengthened, and educated by the Holy Spirit, his soul loses its place and submits to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Gradually, the soul becomes a servant to the spirit, and the body is conquered to become the soul's servant for the execution of the spirit's will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The spirit then knows God's revelation through the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This progress is without an end. Some have more things to be cast aside than others because their spirits are not as pure as others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are filled with mental and emotional knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many people cannot have an open spirit to receive God's truth because they are already filled with prejudice.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before the intuition can receive anything from God, all these things must be removed.</S>
