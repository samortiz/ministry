<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. To Keep the Universal Oneness of the Body</H2><P>In order to build up the Body of Christ, we need to keep the universal oneness of the Body (Eph. 4:3-4). We should not only keep the oneness among the saints in our locality, our region, or even merely in the United States. We must keep the oneness universally with all the saints all over the earth. The Lord's recovery has even spread to Russia and is beginning to spread to Eastern Europe, including Albania. We can travel through the entire earth and meet with the churches. When we are traveling, we do not necessarily need to stay at hotels or motels. There are always some "churchtels" where we can stay. We enjoy the universal oneness of the Body in the Lord's recovery. The church life has people of all colors --white, black, yellow, brown, and red. This is because we are the universal one new man, where Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:10-11).</P><P>In the recent rebellion, some were teaching that a local church should be autonomous. In a sense, we may say that a local church is autonomous in business affairs, but no local church is absolutely autonomous. We can illustrate this by considering the United States. Each state of the United States is autonomous to an extent, but not absolutely autonomous. This is because there is a federal, central government. National defense, currency, the postal system, and the interstate highways are federal matters. If a legal case cannot be decided at the local or state levels, it goes to the Supreme Court at the federal level. If all the states were absolutely autonomous, the United States would no longer be united but divided. In like manner, all the churches around the globe are one Body, and we must keep the universal oneness of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By All the Members of the Body,<br>Perfected in the Local Churches</H2><P>The Body of Christ is built up by all the members of the Body, perfected in the local churches (Eph. 4:12). Now that we are regenerated, we need to be perfected in order to be renewed, sanctified, and transformed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Either as the Joints of the Rich Supply of Christ</H2><P>The Body is built up by all the members. Some of these members are the joints of the rich supply of Christ (Eph. 4:16). These are the gifted ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Or as Parts of the Body<br>Operating in Their Measure</H2><P>The Body is also built up by the parts of the Body operating in their measure (Eph. 4:16). The gifted ones are one kind of member, and the parts are another kind. If we are not the gifted ones, we are the parts who should operate according to our measure for the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. With the Unsearchable Riches of Christ</H2><P>The Body of Christ is built up with the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Through the Divine Dispensing</H2><P>The organic building up of the Body is with the unsearchable riches of Christ through the divine dispensing (Eph. 3:2). While we are speaking Christ, something is moving within us, and this moving is the dispensing. We can illustrate this with electricity. When electrical appliances are operating, electricity is moving within them. The moving of electricity, the current of electricity, is the dispensing of electricity. We also have a divine current within us. When we do not function, the divine current, the moving of the Spirit, stops within us. Then there is no dispensing of the divine electricity, no dispensing of the Spirit. Our not speaking Christ is the stopping of the moving of the Holy Spirit. When we rise up to speak for the Lord, we have the moving of the Spirit within us, and that moving is the dispensing.</P><P>This divine dispensing results in our growth in life. If we attend a meeting and do not function, we may feel dissatisfied and empty afterward. But if we exercise our spirit to function in the meeting, we will be filled with the Lord. We grow by the moving of the Spirit within us, and this moving is the dispensing of the divine supply.</P>
