without Legality</h2>
<p>We need to learn to do everything in the Lord&rsquo;s service without legality. This, however, does not mean that we do not have regulations. It is not right for a brother who lives in the brothers&rsquo; house to come home at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning. There is a need to set up rules for their daily living, such as what time the door is locked and what time the lights are turned off. It is appropriate to set up the kind of rules that help others. However, we should change our attitude concerning forcing others to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name or to pray-read the Word. It is not even appropriate to force the saints in a meeting to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Calling on the name of the Lord has indeed helped us, and pray-reading the Word has nourished us. Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name or pray-reading His Word is not a problem, and it is not necessarily true that those who pray-read the Word are more spiritual than those who do not. This is not to say that we should not pray-read. Taking vitamins is a good example. Those who take vitamins are not necessarily healthier than those who do not. But it is an erroneous attitude to say that if this is the case, we will not take any vitamins. Others may not need to take vitamins to remain healthy, but we may become sick and even die if we do not take vitamins. Some might continue to live without pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word, but we become dry and even wither if we do not pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word. Even though we are nourished by pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word, we should not require that others pray-read. Even though we are supplied by pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word, we cannot say that we are stronger than others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Requiring Uniformity</h2>
<p>It is very easy to require uniformity in the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses. Not only so, it is even easy for the elders to require uniformity in a church of only fifty to sixty saints. The elders may expect all the saints in their locality to be as orderly as a gymnastic class so that a visitor would see them pray-reading the Word and calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name in an orderly way. However, the worst possible thing we can do is to turn a church into a gymnastic team or a military platoon. Would you prefer the church to be a home or a military platoon? We all want the church to be a home that can care for the young and the sick and can feed and give people warmth. The feeding and support in a home are lovely. If, instead, there is drill practice every day, the young and the sick would not live longer than six months. Therefore, there is no need to require uniformity in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Flexible in Our Practice</h2>
<p>We should be flexible and not rigid in our practice. Not only should the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses be managed in this way, but the church should also be led in this way. The brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses render much help to the young brothers and sisters. There must be wisdom and love in leading the young saints. We need to lead them gradually and in wisdom through their weaknesses, and render them proper care. We need to give them the feeling that we are not regulating, restricting, or limiting them; rather, we are sympathetic and considerate, and we think of them for their sake. If we regulate others to do this or that, the result will not be good.</p>
<p>Furthermore, those who have lived in the brothers&rsquo; or sisters&rsquo; house for a longer time should be like older brothers and sisters. They should be supportive and warm toward the younger saints who may still have some bad habits. The younger saints should know that the more experienced ones are willing to help them. We are all the same, and our spirit has been enlivened. If we can cultivate the young ones in this way, in two to three weeks they will be delivered from their old habits. We should not be rigid when we help them, nor should we be loose. We should learn the best way to use the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING A STUDENT CENTER IN TAIPEI</h2>
<p>According to our observation, there is also the need of a student center in Taipei. Hall three will be renovated, and we feel that it should be made into a student center because it is situated near several universities. Our plan is to have a building with six stories above ground and seven stories underground. We would like to be able to house as many people as possible, at least three hundred students. The student center will be larger than a brothers&rsquo; or sisters&rsquo; house, and we believe that it will be twice as effective as corporate housing. The student center will need careful planning. There needs to be space designated for activities and lounges, and at least two or three floors should be used as bedrooms. In addition, there is a need to learn how to manage and take care of such a place so that it meets the needs of the students and can reap a harvest.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 5: Concerning Various Aspects of Church Service &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
