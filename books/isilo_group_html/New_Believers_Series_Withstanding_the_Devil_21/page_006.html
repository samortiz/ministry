How to Help Those Who Are<br>under Satan's Accusation</H2><P>We must never add to the burden of the conscience of those under Satan's accusation. First, we should help them to do only what is within their ability to handle. If we ask them to do what is beyond their ability, they will fall easily into condemnation. We must be sure that they have enough strength before the Lord to go on before we give them stronger advice or urge them to move ahead. Second, where there is the clear work of the Holy Spirit, we should raise the standard a little, for with the clear operation of the Spirit of the Lord and the spirit of revival, the Lord's word has the ability to uplift the capacity of a person. If we raise the standard very high when the Spirit of the Lord has not done anything, we are not helping these accused ones to go on; rather, we are giving Satan opportunities to accuse them even more.</P><P>We must not be careless in pointing out the failures of others. Suppose a brother has failed in certain areas, yet he can still pray, read the Bible, and attend the meetings. As long as you have the assurance within that you can help him, a little push may be all that is necessary to bring him through his trouble. But if you do not have the assurance within and you do not have the power to uplift him, your exposure of his failures will only quench his prayers, his reading of the Bible, and his meeting life. The smoking flax must be rekindled; it must not be smothered. The bruised reed must be supported; it must not be broken. We should not make ourselves the standard and put the conscience of others under condemnation. We must learn not to do things that would offend the conscience of others.</P><P>We must point out Hebrews 10:22 to those who are under Satan's accusation: "Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience." With such a sprinkling, our conscience should no longer feel guilty. The principle of the Christian life is a life free from any condemnation in the conscience. When a Christian is condemned in his conscience, he will be weak before God and will be debilitated in all spiritual matters. Satan's goal is to derail us from this principle. This is the reason he accuses us unceasingly. We need to lay hold of this principle by applying the blood. The more Satan tries to make us feel guilty, the more we should apply the blood to all of our sins. The brothers overcame him not by their own strength, but by the blood of the Lamb. We can declare, "Satan, I admit that I have sinned. But I have been redeemed by the Lord! I have never denied that I am a debtor. I am in debt, but the Lord has paid my debt!" We do not need to deal with Satan's accusation by denying that we are debtors. We can deal with him by declaring that our debt has been paid.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Satan's Work in the Environment</H2><P>All circumstances are arranged by God. However, there are many things in our environment which, though permitted by God, are the result of Satan's direct and active work.</P><P>Take Job's experience as an example. His oxen and donkeys were taken away, his house collapsed, and his children were killed. These were all things in the environment. Though they were permitted by God, Satan was the one directly instigating the attacks.</P><P>Peter's failure was another example. The cause of his fall was partly due to himself, but partly due to Satan's attack in the environment. The Lord said, "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to have you all to sift you as wheat" (Luke 22:31). Peter's fall was the direct result of Satan's work. Yet it was something permitted by God.</P><P>Paul's thorn was clearly the work of Satan. Paul said, "There was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, that he might buffet me" (2 Cor. 12:7). This is the work of Satan. It is Satan who attacks God's children in the environment.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>New Believers Series: Withstanding the Devil #21 &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
