   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ephesians 4:3-4 says, "Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace: one Body and one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The expression one Body and one Spirit is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should endeavor to keep the oneness of the Spirit because there is one Body and one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The one Body and the one Spirit are all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to understand them, we need to read and study the entire Bible, from its first page to its last chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These truths, along with nearly all the basic and intrinsic truths in the entire Bible, have been nearly lost among God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have been in the Lord's recovery for many years, and what we have done through all these years is mainly to study His holy Word for His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Based on the recent turmoil among us, I have the deep sensation that it would be worthwhile for us to study the holy Word in a complete way concerning the one Body and the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I. ONE GOD TRIUNE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The one Body is based on the one God, who is triune Gen 1:1; Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is triune, but He does not have three economies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is triune, but from the beginning He did not move, act, or do things in three ways.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He has always worked in one way for one economy, but He needs to be the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in order to carry out His one economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The one God, the Triune God, is the first unique base of our belief concerning the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>ONE INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>GOD MINGLING HIMSELF WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The one Body is also based on the one incarnation God mingling Himself with man John 1:1; 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before incarnation there was the one creation; but the creation was not God's goal, nor was it His aim.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This creation, the old creation, is just the temporary means to reach the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One day the old creation will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the new creation came out of, and is still coming out of, the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Its coming out of the old creation has not yet been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the Bible, God will use four ages, four dispensations, to work in the old creation in order to produce the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These four ages include the age before the law from Adam to Moses Rom 5:14 , the age after the law from Moses to Christ's first coming John 1:17 , the age of grace from Christ's first coming to the restoration of all things at Christ's second coming Acts 3:20-21 , and the kingdom age of one thousand years from Christ's second coming to the end of the millennium Rev 11:15; 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The last age will be the shortest age.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God will use these four ages to work out the new creation from His old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We were in the old creation, but one day God worked on us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a result, we became a new creation 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's work to produce the new creation out of the old creation is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before the incarnation God was there, but He was never in any part of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His life and nature were always kept absolutely in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He never came with His divinity to enter into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From Adam until the New Testament age, no one among the human race knew what God's purpose was.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to Paul's word in Ephesians 3, God's purpose was kept concealed; hence, it was a mystery vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>4-5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His purpose was not made known to any of the sons of men, great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not even Abraham, one who was close to God as God's intimate friend James 2:23 , knew the purpose of God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Genesis 18 shows that God had an intimate friendship with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He came to visit Abraham with the intention of rescuing Abraham's nephew Lot from His fiery judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But no one knew of this intention, so God said, "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?" v. 17 . God had to let Abraham know.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet in the Old Testament God did not reveal His economy, not even to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The purpose for God's creation of the heavens, the earth, and billions of items, and man in His image and after His likeness, is not a small thing, but God never told anyone what His purpose was.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God had a good friendship not only with Abraham but also with Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Exodus 33:11 says that God spoke with Moses as a man speaks with his friend.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God revealed a great deal to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The five books of the Pentateuch are God's unveiling to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But in all this revelation God did not tell Moses what the purpose of His creation was.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The purpose of God's creation was not touched until Matthew 1.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Gospel of Matthew opens with the genealogy of Christ, showing that Christ is the son of Abraham and the son of David v. 1 . Matthew 1 tells us that this Christ would be born of the virgin Mary v. 16 . He is the Christ, the anointed One, the centrality and universality of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although this is revealed in Matthew 1, today most Christians do not know the real significance of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Incarnation is God mingling Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The creation of the heavens and the earth was a great thing, but incarnation is much greater.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many scientists through the past centuries have studied the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although the creation is very great, it cannot compare with incarnation because in incarnation God mingled Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This was a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Triune God, the One who calls not being as being Rom 4:17 , one day entered into the womb of a young virgin and remained there for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We call this a conception, but Matthew 1:20 says that it was a birth "That which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God was born into that virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then when Christ came out of the womb, that was the second step of His birth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>First, God was born into Mary's womb, and then Jesus was born out from Mary's womb to be a God-man.</S>
