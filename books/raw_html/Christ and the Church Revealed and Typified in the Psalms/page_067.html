<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE RECOVERY OF GOD’S TITLE OVER THE EARTH</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 93 to 101</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 93:1, 5;  94:15;  95:1-5; 96:1-4, 6-13; 97:1, 6-9; 98:2-9; 99:1-4, 9; 100:1-4; 101:8</h1><p>These nine Psalms tell of the recovery of God’s title over the earth through Christ in the house and the city of God. Five times in these Psalms we read, “Make a joyful noise unto the Lord,” and once, “Make a loud noise.” It is marvelous! Why should we make a joyful noise? Because the Lord is coming to reign over the entire earth! Notice how many times in these Psalms the words “all the earth” are mentioned. Other words in a similar vein are used as well, such as “the nations,” “the heathen,” and “the people,” or, properly translated, “the peoples.” The peoples are the nations. The Psalmists are not referring merely to the Jewish nation, but to all the nations on the face of the earth.<p>It is clear in the first three books that God has accomplished everything through Christ to establish His house and His city for the purpose of possessing the whole earth. Thus, both Book II and Book III end with the reign of Christ over the earth in and through the house and the city. That is wonderful; yet it is still not so adequate. Therefore, we need Book IV.<p>We have already considered the first three Psalms of Book IV, Psalms 90-92. Notice the title of Psalm 90: “A prayer of Moses, the man of God.” There is no title for Psalm 91, but Psalm 92 is titled, “A Psalm or song for the sabbath day.” It is difficult to determine the authorship of Psalms 91 and 92, but I am certain that Psalm 92 was not written by Moses, and I doubt that Psalm 91 was written by him. My point is that these Psalms, written probably by different authors, were all put together as one group. The subject of this group of Psalms, as we have seen, is the enjoyment of God as our dwelling place, which makes us absolutely one with God. When we take God as our habitation and dwell in Him, we and God are one. We have this concept in John 15: “Abide in me, and I in you.” When we abide or dwell in the Lord and let Him abide or dwell in us, it means that we are absolutely and practically one with Him. Psalm 90 speaks of our taking God as our dwelling place, and Psalm 91 speaks of Christ taking God as His dwelling place, thus proving that we and Christ are one. As He is, so are we. In John 17 Christ prays, “That they may be one in us” (v. 21). The “us” here is composed of the Father and the Son. Thus we are identified with Christ: He and we, we and He, are one, as a great, universal, corporate man, taking God as his dwelling place. This man is now practically one with God: “I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one” (v. 23). We are absolutely and completely one with the triune God. Then Psalm 92 tells the issue, the result, of taking God as our habitation. We will praise Him, realize His works, have our horn exalted, and be mingled with fresh oil day by day; then we will be planted in the house of God and flourish in His courts; we will bring forth fruit even in our old age, full of sap and green. It is not a matter of keeping His laws, but of being one with Him, mingling with Him, dwelling in Him, and letting His beauty be upon us, that He might come to recover His title over the whole earth.
