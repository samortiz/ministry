Firstly, it rebukes us, and secondly, it tells us to return to the law of life. Perhaps all of us have misunderstood 1 John 2:27, which says that &ldquo;the same anointing teacheth you of all things.&rdquo; The anointing does not teach us to do everything; it teaches us to abide in Christ. Some brothers and sisters may wonder whether or not to go shopping and they pray to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, should I go shopping or stay home? Lord, grant me the anointing.&rdquo; But the Lord may say, &ldquo;My anointing doesn&rsquo;t care for your going shopping or staying home. My anointing only cares that you abide in Me. As long as you abide in Me, you may go anywhere. If you abide in Me, whatever you do will be all right.&rdquo; If we abide in Christ, we may go anywhere. But remember this crucial clause&mdash;&ldquo;if we abide in Christ.&rdquo; As long as we abide in Christ, God does not care where we go or what we do. Many who are concerned about marriage pray to the Lord regarding it, saying, &ldquo;Lord, should I marry this one?&rdquo; Some can testify that although they prayed in this way, the Lord never answered their prayers. Many young brothers have prayed, saying, &ldquo;Lord, let me know whether this sister is the dear one You have chosen for me.&rdquo; But the more the brothers pray like this, the more confused they will be. I know of some sisters who have prayed for ten years about getting married without receiving an answer. If the Lord were to answer them, He would probably say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about your marriage. I only care whether or not you abide in Me. If you abide in Me, you may get married. But if you do not abide in Me, you should not even marry the best brother.&rdquo; The only thing that counts is whether or not we abide in the Lord. In God&rsquo;s economy, it is not a matter of our doing; it is absolutely a matter of our being. It is a matter of what we are. And what we are depends upon the life according to which we live day by day.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING RECOVERED TO THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p>In ancient times, the people of Israel got off the center, which is God&rsquo;s law, and God sent the prophets to bring them back. Today most Christians are away from God&rsquo;s center, which is the law of life. Therefore, the epistle of 1 John was written to the degraded Christians, calling them back to the anointing. The law of life is a basic matter. Because it is basic, it is mentioned in the book of Romans, a book of basic teachings. The anointing, on the contrary, is not mentioned in any of the basic books. Rather, it is mentioned in a book dealing with degradation, because many Christians had been distracted by the teachings of the antichrists. In the First Epistle of John, John told them to care for the anointing. John seemed to be saying, &ldquo;The anointing tells you what to do and where to go. Don&rsquo;t listen to the teachings of the antichrists&mdash;obey the anointing. The anointing will bring you back to the law of life.&rdquo; First John 2 brings us back to Romans 8. But if we are truly living in Romans 8, we do not need 1 John 2. Likewise, if the Israelites had never gone astray from God&rsquo;s law, there would have been no need for the prophets. From now on, we should live according to the law of life and not just move according to the anointing.</p><p>God cares for His nature, but His presence is our safeguard. God&rsquo;s nature is within us, and we must live according to it. This means that we must live according to the law of life. However, we are often distracted. In times of distraction, God&rsquo;s presence will watch over us, observe us, and warn us. If we stray from the law of life, the anointing will say, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; After we say, &ldquo;Lord, I repent,&rdquo; then the anointing will tell us to return to the law of life. In a foregoing message, I said that we must live according to the law of life and move according to the anointing. The anointing represents God&rsquo;s presence directing us, correcting us, and bringing us back to His nature. We must live according to the law of life. This means that we must live and walk according to God&rsquo;s nature.</p><p>Why is it easy to grasp the matter of the anointing but difficult to get into the law of life? It is easy to know a brother by his presence. With even a short glimpse, we can easily recognize his presence. But it takes a great deal of time to get into his nature. Perhaps his wife, who has lived with him for many years, is the only one who has gotten into his nature. We may know this brother&rsquo;s face, but we do not know his nature. In like manner, it is easy to apprehend God&rsquo;s presence, but it is difficult to know His nature in our being. Merely to tell people to walk in the presence of God is rather natural and religious. It is not life. But to know God&rsquo;s nature within our being and to live according to it is exceedingly deep. This is what God desires.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_234.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_236.html">Next</a> </body></html>
