   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE RECOVERY OF CHRIST AS LIFE Scripture Reading: John 1:14, 29; 12:24; 14:16-17; 7:39; 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17; 2 Tim 4:22; 1 Cor 6:17; Eph 3:16-17, 19; 1 Cor 12:12-13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ, who is the focus of God s eternal purpose, said that He is the way, the reality, and the life John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before becoming our reality or our way, Christ must first be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter we will consider how Christ can be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>CHRIST BEING</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE LAMB OF GOD FOR REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>AND THE GRAIN OF WHEAT FOR REPRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, we need to see who Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 1:1 says that in the beginning Christ, as the Word, was God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 14 says that one day this Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that God Himself was incarnated to be the man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God in Christ became a man to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, verse 29 says, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order for Christ to be our life, He first needed to solve the problem of our sin, which separates us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, He became a man to be our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the Lamb of God, He shed His blood for the forgiveness of our sins; He accomplished redemption on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John 12:24 says, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ came as the Lamb of God for the shedding of His blood to accomplish redemption; He came as the grain of wheat for the imparting of His life to make us His reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a grain of wheat, Christ was reproduced to become many grains through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The one grain is now the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the many grains, we are the reproduction of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a crucial item of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although this item is emphatically revealed in the Scripture, it has been lost in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Most Christians know that Christ is the Lamb of God, but few see that He is a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a young person, I was convicted of my sins, and I repented and confessed to the Lord and was washed by His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, when I asked how I should go on, I was told only to behave properly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ being the grain of wheat for life-impartation to make us His reproduction is a crucial and precious truth that has been almost entirely lost in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because of this great lack among Christians, there is the need of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>CHRIST BECOMING THE SPIRIT The Spirit of Reality</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 14:16 and 17 Christ said, I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ was the first Comforter; the second Comforter is the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the Spirit of reality is not another person apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The title the Spirit of reality indicates that whatever Christ is, is fully realized in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In other words, the Spirit is the reality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without the Spirit of reality, Christ could not be real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Christ resurrected, He immediately became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to see that Christ took two steps, indicated by two occurrences of the word became in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John 1:14 says that Christ as the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then 1 Corinthians 15:45 says that Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ as God took a step to become a man in the flesh to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After accomplishing redemption, He took another step by resurrecting to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some oppose the truth that Christ became the life-giving Spirit, saying that it is a heresy to say that Christ, who is the Son of God, is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nevertheless, this is what the Bible clearly reveals in 1 Corinthians 15:45.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although the indefinite article a occurs before the title life-giving Spirit in this verse, there is surely only one Spirit in the universe who can give zoe, the eternal, divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whether or not we understand this, the Bible reveals that the last Adam, Christ in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, The Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Darby s New Translation places verses 7 through 16 within parentheses, indicating that verse 17 is a direct continuation of verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The end of verse 6 says, The Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the Lord is the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>John 7:39 says, This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As a young believer, I was troubled that this verse says, The Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I even thought that this might be a mistake, because I knew that the Spirit of God was mentioned as early as Genesis 1:2.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then one day I read the book The Spirit of Christ by Andrew Murray.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In chapter 5, entitled The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus, Murray says that before Jesus resurrection the Spirit of God had divinity but not humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The humanity of Jesus was added to the Spirit of God in the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, this Spirit who possesses both divinity and humanity was not yet before Jesus was glorified in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Spirit of God existed before Christ s resurrection, but the Spirit that includes Christ s humanity was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Christ s resurrection His humanity was added to the Spirit of God.</S>
