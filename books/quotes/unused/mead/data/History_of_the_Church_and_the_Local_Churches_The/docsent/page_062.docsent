   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The work comes not out of certain doctrines, gifts, or practices, but out of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The ministry is composed, produced, and formed through revelations mingled with sufferings.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The spreading of the practice of the church life comes from a work by the definite ministry, which is composed with sufferings and revelations.</S>
