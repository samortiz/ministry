   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO EXTREMES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many believers do not have an adequate understanding of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Certain fundamentalists emphasize doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In many cases they are even afraid of talking about the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They do not pay proper attention to the two spirits in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In particular they do not place the proper emphasis on the two spirits in the Epistles of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the fundamentalists represent one extreme with respect to the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Certain Christians in the Pentecostal movement or charismatic movement represent another extreme, for they overemphasize particular gifts of the Spirit, such as healing and speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The situation among many of these Christians is very similar to that of the believers in Corinth: they place too much emphasis on tongues and miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In many cases, the supposed occurrences of speaking in tongues and healing are not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to Acts 2, speaking in tongues must be the speaking of a language or dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Genuine tongues-speaking does not consist of the mere repetition of sounds.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the so-called speaking in tongues practiced in many charismatic groups today were recorded and studied by a linguist, the linguist would conclude that the sounds uttered are not that of any language or dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In some charismatic meetings neither the tongues-speaking nor the interpretation of the tongues is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, someone may utter certain sounds, which are given a particular interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On another occasion, the same person may utter the same sounds, but they are given an altogether different interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On one occasion, the interpretation may be an exhortation to be humble before the Lord, whereas on another occasion, the interpretation may be a word about an earthquake or the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Certain believers devote much attention to the exercise of so-called spiritual gifts without any attempt to discern what is genuine from what is false.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In some Christian groups there is great emphasis on miraculous healing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I once attended a healing campaign in Manila purposely to see if there were any cases of genuine healing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the meeting I attended there was not one instance of a real healing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some claimed to be healed, but eventually this supposed healing was proved to be merely a psychological phenomenon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There was no permanent cure.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After a period of time, everyone who was supposedly healed in that meeting was the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The claim has been made in some Pentecostal groups that in their meetings people s teeth have been filled with gold miraculously.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I absolutely do not believe such reports.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why would God not restore the teeth instead of filling them with gold?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That would be more in agreement with the principle in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, if such miracles had actually taken place, newsmen would learn of them and publicize them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1963 I attended some meetings of a particular Pentecostal group.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In one of these meetings, a woman gave a short word in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then a young man gave a long interpretation of that word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later the leader of the group admitted to me that the interpretation given by this young man was not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Much later I met this young man in another place and asked him about that interpretation he had given.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In particular I asked him if he thought this interpretation was genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He denied that what he had spoken was intended to be the interpretation of that woman s message in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then I reminded him that he had clearly indicated to all present that he was giving an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I went on to say, There is no need for us to do such things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I definitely believe that you love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why don t you simply preach the truth and minister the riches of Christ to others?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The situation of today s Christianity is very much like that of the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is the neglect of the human spirit and often the identification of the spirit with the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, there is either the neglect of the Spirit of God because of a preoccupation with doctrine, or an overemphasis on spiritual gifts, genuine or false.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE CRUCIFIED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In dealing with the division and confusion at Corinth, Paul did not depend on doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead he took as his basis the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 2:1 and 2 he says, And I, when I came to you, brothers, came not with excellence of speech or wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The crucified Christ was the unique subject, center, content, and substance of the apostle s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ crucified is the center of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul determined that, among the Corinthians, he would not know anything except this crucified Christ.</S>
