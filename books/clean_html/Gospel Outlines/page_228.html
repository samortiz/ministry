<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Where does the creation come from?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Does evolution explain the creation? Give evidence, such as the laws of nature, to show that the theory of evolution is unreliable.</li>
	<li>There has to be a Creator in the universe. Perhaps you regard Him as the Supreme Being, God, the Divine Force, or the Mighty One; nevertheless, He is the Creator. Use the Bible to prove this point. The Bible says that the universe is created by God.</li>

<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Sixty</h2>
<h1 class="title">GOD HAS WRITTEN TO MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Heb. 1:1-2; 2 Tim. 3:16</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God desires to have fellowship with man<br />
<span class="normal">Since there is a God in the universe, this God must have a relationship with His creatures. Since He is a Being with much intellect, emotion, and affection, naturally He would like to fellowship with His creatures. Among the creation, the best object of fellowship is man. Hence, God would have fellowship with man.</span></li>
<li>How does God fellowship with man?<br />
<span class="normal">Men fellowship among themselves mainly through speaking and writing. The fellowship between God and man is also in these two ways. When it is possible, He communicates with man face to face. When this is not possible, He conveys His thoughts to man through writing.</span></li>
<li>God fellowships with man through the Bible
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Among all the writings of the human race there is only one book given by God to man. In the entire history of mankind, no book except the Bible was written by God. <em>Strongly emphasize that the Bible is inspired by God.</em></li>
	<li>Is the Bible inspired by God? If the Bible is written by God, it must contain the following few points:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It must claim that it is a book written by God Himself to man.</li>
		<li>It must reveal the origin and the consummation of the universe.</li>
		<li>It must speak of the relationship between God and man.</li>
		<li>It must present the highest standard of morality.</li>
		<li>It must be powerful.</li>
		<li>Its prophecy has to be fulfilled.</li>
		</ol>
	No other classic satisfies the above six requirements. Only the Bible is qualified. Hence, the Bible is the unique book written by God to man. (See <em>The Normal Christian Faith,</em> by Watchman Nee, pp. 33-49.)</li>
