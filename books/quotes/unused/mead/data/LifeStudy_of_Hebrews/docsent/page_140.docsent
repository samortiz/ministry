   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FORTY-TWO THE TWO MANIFESTATIONS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We Christians today need to get into the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I thank God that, under His sovereignty, there was such a group of staggering Hebrew Christians in the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without them, the book of Hebrews probably never would have come into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not think that the book of Hebrews was only for them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need this book today much more than they needed it in their time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the past eleven messages we have been on chapters seven, eight, and nine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If I were to ask you to write a conclusion to these chapters, you may find it quite difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But at the end of chapter nine the book of Hebrews itself gives us a summary, a conclusion, of these three chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This conclusion is the very matter which we shall cover in this message Christ s two manifestations and the interval between them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These three things, Christ s two manifestations and the interval, compose God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It has been difficult for many Christians to understand the true significance of Christ s two manifestations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The two manifestations of Christ refer to His two comings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ has come once and He will come again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During the long period between the two manifestations of Christ to the world, He remains in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nearly two thousand years have passed since Christ s first manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although this is a long time as far as we are concerned, to Him it is less than two days 2 Pet 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to see the significance of the two manifestations of Christ and the interval between them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before Christ s first manifestation, there were God s plan, God s promise, and a type, a picture, of God s economy, but besides God s creation nothing had been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we build a meeting hall, we also may have a plan and a model of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, simply having these things does not mean that there is an actual building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before Christ s incarnation, men like Abraham, Moses, and David had come and gone, but nothing had been accomplished for God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although there was the model of the tabernacle with Moses and of the temple with Solomon, nothing real was accomplished until the first manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I. THE FIRST MANIFESTATION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ took thirty-three and a half years to complete His first manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During those thirty-three and a half years, everything necessary for the fulfillment of God s purpose was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He accomplished what God needed and what we needed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A. For the Putting Away of Sin by Offering Himself</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>to God as the Sacrifice for Sins</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ s first manifestation was for the putting away of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 26 says that once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin by His sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Greek words translated consummation of the ages may also be rendered the completion of the ages or end of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here it means the end of the old testament age, whereas the consummation of the age in Matthew 28:20 Gk. indicates the close of the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ was foreordained for us before the foundation of the world 1 Pet 1:20 , and He was slain from the foundation of the world Rev 13:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, His being slain transpired once for all at the consummation of the ages, when He offered Himself to God in His first manifestation for the putting away of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ put away sin about nineteen and a half centuries ago.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before He accomplished this, the priests offered the sin offering day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But that was not the actual putting away of sin; it was only a type, a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The real putting away of sin was accomplished once for all by Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps you were born just twenty or thirty years ago, and during your lifetime you have committed many sins, such as stealing and lying.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the putting away of sin was accomplished nineteen and a half centuries ago, long before you committed any sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, the putting away of sin is a bequest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Firstly, it was a promise; secondly, it was foreshadowed by the covering of sins; eventually, the promise and the shadow were completely fulfilled by Christ on the cross when He offered Himself as the sacrifice for sins once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was once offered to bear the sins of many 9:28, 14; 10:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, in the eyes of God, sin has gone and has become a history.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not believe Satan, your feelings, or your failures.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are lies.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You must tell them, Sin was put away by Christ in His first manifestation.</S>
