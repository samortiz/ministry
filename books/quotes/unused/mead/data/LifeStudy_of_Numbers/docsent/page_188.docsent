   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. To Fight Together with God and for God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As a priestly army, God's chosen and redeemed people fought together with God and for God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we would fight together with God and for God today, we must first move, walk, and live with Him and also pass through many things in the wilderness.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should be able to say, "Lord, the church life is actually Your life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You want to live this way, and we are living together with You.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we did not live and move with You, You would not have Your satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You do not want to be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have chosen, redeemed, and saved us to accompany You in Your move.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our church life, Lord, is really for You."</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Bashan with His People</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By defeating the Midianites the people overcame Canaan's gate army.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The kings defeated by God's chosen and redeemed people signify the spiritual powers, rulers, and authorities in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today we need to fight against these powers and defeat them.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we defeat the rulers, powers, and authorities in the air, the kingdom of God surely is spread and established.</S>
