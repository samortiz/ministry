   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Replace and Terminate,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>in a Sense, the Stale Aaronic Priesthood</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a priest Samuel replaced and terminated, in a sense, the stale Aaronic priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He did not rebel against the house of Aaron, and he did not usurp anything of the house of Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There was no revolution; there was only revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As Samuel was growing, God arranged the environment to perfect him and to build up his capacity to do everything that was needed for God to change the age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the recovery the Lord will never allow any kind of rebellion, but He will bring in many changes, adjustments, and improvements, not through rebellion but through revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Samuel had a clear view of God's economy and also of what the enemy had been doing to devastate God's economy on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Samuel was thus a person full of insight concerning God's economy and concerning the environmental situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, God did something to match him, and there was a change among the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The people returned to God, lamented before God, and were willing to remove all the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before this change took place, there was preparation on two sides: on the side of the people, who returned to God, and on the side of Samuel, who was perfected, equipped, and qualified for God's move on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this situation the Philistines, who knew certain things concerning Israel and God and who tried to bribe God with their kind of trespass offering, were defeated to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anointing Saul and David to Be Kings</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this replacing priesthood, Samuel anointed Saul and David to be kings 10:1; 16:1, 13 as God ordained that he should go before His anointed continually 2:35b to supervise the king, observing what the king was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that Samuel, the acting God on earth, was greater than the king.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Samuel could be qualified to such an extent because for many years God had been perfecting him for His economy, not for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When God's economy is carried out among His people, they are blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that our welfare, our well-being, is altogether linked to the carrying out of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not seek our well-being apart from God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because this has been neglected and even lost, it needs to be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I wish to say, especially to the young saints, that we should not expect to have prosperity for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, as saints in the Lord's recovery, we should expect that through us the Lord will do as much as possible to accomplish His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we will be blessed.</S>
