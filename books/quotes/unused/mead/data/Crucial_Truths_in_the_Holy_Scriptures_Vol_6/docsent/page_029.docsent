   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, he hides in persons, things, and matters to keep people from recognizing him, and on the other hand, he uses craftiness to deceive people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When he deceived Eve, he hid in the serpent and he used crafty words.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The devil s craftiness involves mixing falsehoods with the truth.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He can also devise stratagems to deceive us and distract us from our true status before God, our true obtainments from God, our true service to God, our true love for God, and our true enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All his stratagems involve some element of truth being mixed with false and evil things; therefore, it is difficult to discern and recognize his stratagems.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to be watchful and to pray, asking God to expose the devil s stratagems so that we would not be ignorant of his stratagems.</S>
