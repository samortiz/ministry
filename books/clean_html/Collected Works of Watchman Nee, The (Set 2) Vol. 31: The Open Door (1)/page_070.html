<h2 class="head2">Sheng County,<br />Chekiang Province</h2><p>Peace to my dear brother in the Lord, Mr. X:</p><p>I have not written for a long time. I found out that you were in Hong Kong yesterday from Brother Ma Di-sheng. Thank the Lord very much for this opportunity to communicate with you....The brothers and sisters in certain places in Sha-Di are suffering more in places like Tou-Peng, Hsin-Wan-Di, San-Cha-Dai, Twelve Dai, and San-Tai-Chiao. (San-Cha-Dai and Tou-Peng are across the river from Hai-Ning.) The meetings in Shao-Shing stopped more than a month ago because most of the brothers and sisters had moved into the countryside. In the wake of the present calamity, I only hope that God protects, gives grace, and saves His children. I moved my family from Dong-Jieh Road to Tou-Peng on August 10, and on November 24 we moved back to our old hometown in Sheng County. My ancestral home is five miles from the major city of Sheng County. I do not know how many days Sheng County can remain safe. We can only rely on the protection of God's great power. The churches in this region have really been graced by the Lord. The assembly in Wan-An-Chiao has really progressed. The number of new believers is increasing. The assembly in Ji-Shan-Chiao in Yi-Rung has increased in their zeal for the preaching of the gospel. The assembly in Tou-Peng has improved in material offerings. The assembly in Si-Shing has improved in the matter of following the leading of the Holy Spirit. There is a table now in Sin-Wan-Di. The work in Sha-Di has come to a conclusion. Where are you going? How is your health? Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Lou Chuan-en<br />January 12<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Condition of the Assemblies<br />in the Region of Shao-Shing</h2><p>The meetings in the city stopped a long time ago and all the brothers and sisters have fled into the mountainous countryside. Wherever they went, they did a good job testifying for the Lord. Praise the Lord! In south Sha-Di the outward situation is not very peaceful, but their spiritual life is higher than before. They have a very simple and unshakable faith, and they are very watchful to pray at all times. I am always encouraged by them. I really thank the Lord. They are all farmers by occupation, so their livelihood has not been affected much by the war. There are one or two who are in difficulty, but they do all they can to care for one another. They really live the Body life. There are already nine meetings in the Lord's name in this region. Six localities have the table to remember the Lord. The total number of saved ones is about one thousand. I hope that the brothers and sisters in the Lord do not forget to pray for them before the Lord. They passed through very hard times in the past because of the failure of the silk industry. Their past experience has taught them to rely on the Lord, to obey Him, and to love the brothers. I see how the Lord uses sufferings more than ease to edify us. The brothers in the assembly in Hsia-Fang-Chiao are mainly in the silk business, but they are different from those in Hwa-She. We are the ones who are most positively influenced by this war. The responsibility for the meeting here is completely borne by the local brothers, so we can get by smoothly. May the Lord uphold them daily. Because the locality of Jou-Shan is near the mountains and the water, most of the refugees from the cities have moved there (Mr. Hsie Tze-yuen is among them). Therefore, the number listening to the gospel is very great. There are more than one hundred in the Lord's Day meeting. There are also many new believers. The responsible brother there, Brother X, has made much progress recently. May the Lord continue to edify them. Jou-Shan and Hsia-Fang-Chiao still do not have table meetings. I hope that the brothers and sisters will pray much for them.</p><p>A slave of the Lord,<br />Shan Kai-fen<br />February 5<br />[Address omitted]</p>
