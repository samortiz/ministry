   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE THE MIGHTY HAND OF GOD AND ITS GOAL 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 5:5-9</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall begin to consider 5:5-11, a section concerned with the mighty hand of God and its goal.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We shall proceed verse by verse through 5:5-9.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>YOUNGER MEN SUBJECT TO ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 5 says, In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders, and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once again Peter uses the phrase in like manner.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this verse in like manner must refer to what Peter has already spoken concerning submission or subjection 2:18; 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Wives are to be subject to their husbands, and servants, to their masters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we have pointed out, to some extent at least, husbands should subject themselves to their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now in 5:5 Peter goes on to say that in the church life the younger men should be subject to elders.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the Greek word rendered elders in verse 5 is the same as that used in verse 1, here it should, in principle, refer to all older men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that the younger men should be subject not only to the elders of the church, but to all older brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I believe that the principle is the same concerning the younger sisters subjecting themselves to older sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>GIRDED WITH HUMILITY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 5:5 Peter says that all of us should gird ourselves with humility toward one another.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone in the church, including the elders, should gird himself with humility.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1:13 Peter charges us to gird up the loins of our mind, but here he indicates that our entire being needs to be girded.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Greek word for gird here is derived from a noun meaning a slave s apron, which girds up his loose garments in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is used here as a figure of speech, signifying the putting on of humility as a virtue in service.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This figure comes evidently from Peter s impression of how the Lord girded Himself with a towel when He humbled Himself to wash the disciples feet, especially Peter s John 13:4-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today carpenters and printers often wear aprons while they are working.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In ancient times the people wore clothing that was loose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, because this loose clothing made it difficult to work, the slaves wore an apron to bind up their loose clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peter uses this as a metaphor to indicate that in the church life we all must learn how to gird up ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not be loose in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are loose, we may automatically become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to gird ourselves with humility.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are girded with humility, we shall become humble, careful persons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We shall not be loose or careless.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the church life we all should put on the apron of humility.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE PROUD RESISTED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to Peter s word, we should be girded with humility because God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Greek word translated resist is a strong word for an army preparing to resist the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Peter uses this word to show how strong God is in resisting those who are proud.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Greek word rendered proud in verse 5 literally means showing above others .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be proud is to show ourselves above others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God resists the one who lifts himself above others and regards himself as better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead of being proud and showing ourselves above others, we should gird ourselves with the apron of humility.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Putting on such an apron will always bring us down and cause us to be lowly.</S>
