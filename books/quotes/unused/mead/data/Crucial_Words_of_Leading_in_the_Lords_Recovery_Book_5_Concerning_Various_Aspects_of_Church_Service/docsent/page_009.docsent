   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING COLLEGE CONFERENCES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE SUMMER AND WINTER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to take the college students to the mountains many times, at least twice a year.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The mountain trip can last longer than the trip for the younger students.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The conference for the junior high school students can be two to three days, but for the college students, it is best to have at least one more day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There should be a college conference during the winter holidays and during the summer vacation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The college conference should be by region.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The churches in northern Taiwan can have a joint college conference, the churches in central Taiwan can have a conference, and the churches in southern Taiwan can also have a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every region should have a college conference instead of one large conference for the whole island.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A large conference will use too many resources and will not be as fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The location for the college conference needs to be carefully considered.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must seek the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church in Taipei does not have an adequate facility.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hall one is not large enough for the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church in Taipei does not have a meeting place where the whole church can gather.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It has to rent a place when the whole church comes together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is inconvenient.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the conference site is not adequate and does not provide sufficient accommodation, some students may have to stay in either the meeting halls or in the saints homes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even if the messages are uplifting, the time that it takes to travel between the meeting place and their hospitality would be a distraction to the students and will reduce the effectiveness of the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The practice of the saints in Brazil is quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For their gatherings, they purchased a piece of property that is about one hundred acres.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to do a long-term work, we need property.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If it is not easy to find such a place in the city of Taipei, it is better to look in the suburbs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every six months there should be a weeklong college conference.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not more than two thousand college students can gather together for a week and be trained in life, truth, and the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not need to have only one speaker for the college conference.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Several co-workers can coordinate together for the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have much material that can be used.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we have a proper place, we can be certain that we will have results.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All those in the college conference will be fed spiritual meals for seven days and will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>TWO YEARS OF SERVICE AFTER GRADUATION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The gospel work should begin with the children.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The children in elementary school should be nurtured by the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When they enter junior high school, there will already be a gospel work with the junior high students.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then as they proceed to high school, they will be cultivated by the gospel work in the high schools.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>During the time they are at college, they will be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a person is gained in the first year of college, instead of through children s work, the serving ones should take him to the mountains once every semester for a week of training.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In four years he would have attended eight mountain trips.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By the Lord s mercy, after eight mountain trips, when he graduates from college, he will continue with two years in the full-time training.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Imagine how many thousands of serving ones there will be after a period of time!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the young people can be perfected from elementary school, through junior high school, high school, college, and two years in the full-time training, they will know whether or not they will serve full time after the training.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I believe that at least one out of ten students will give themselves to serve full time for the rest of their life, and the rest will probably get a job.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The ones who are trained will be different even if they get a job, because they have a solid foundation in the truth and have been gained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, when they enter into society to work, they will still be working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason, the full-timers who are laboring in the gospel work in the schools must be clear and have this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the goal of the work in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We begin our labor with the children and continue with those in junior high school, high school, and college so that they continue with two years of full-time service in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This plan is much superior to any plan set up by a seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>GRASPING THE OPPORTUNITY WITH NEW STUDENTS DURING ORIENTATION</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should also grasp the opportunity with the incoming new students during their orientation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Two brothers once testified that they contacted five hundred new medical students during orientation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a good way to contact the students.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The best time for a college student to receive the gospel is during his first semester as a freshman.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is easy for a person to receive the gospel when he is undergoing change.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we miss this window of opportunity, that is, the new student s transition from high school to college, we will miss the best time for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It will be much more difficult to gain the students later.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For this reason, we should try our best to preach the gospel to freshmen at the beginning of a semester.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The brothers have done a good job in this aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Eighty percent of their labor during orientation has been good, but our follow-up is still lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we can take care of the follow-up more thoroughly, more people will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to grasp the opportunity during the freshmen orientation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our labor can be compared to harvesting wheat in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In May, when the wheat is ripe, none of the farmers are concerned about eating or sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The old people have a saying: The wheat is falling; are you still sleeping?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once the wheat is ripe it must be harvested immediately; otherwise, it will fall to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the wheat is ripe, no one can sleep peacefully.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All the wheat must be harvested in half a day.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The new students coming into the schools can be likened to the wheat falling off the stalk.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must not be bothered with anything else, not the Lord s Day meeting or any other matters, other than the new students.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we cannot gain eighty percent of the new students, we should at least gain fifty percent.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must grasp this opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must also be thick-skinned when we preach the gospel, and we must be sure of what we preach, just as a salesman must be thick-skinned, not shy but confident of his product and confident that the customer will buy it from him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>A salesman who can guide a customer in a simple way to buy his product has made a sale.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We still need further study concerning how to put everything into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Please do not pay lip service to our fellowship, but outline a way and hit the target.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This requires much effort.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Our goal is to gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Whatever way by which we can gain people is the way we will take.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must take the time and make the effort to study this.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In principle, whether we serve full time or part time and are under thirty years old, our labor in the gospel should be in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The saints who are over thirty years old can participate in all areas with the gospel.</S>
