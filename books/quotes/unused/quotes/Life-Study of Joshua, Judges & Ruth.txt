2) Elimelech swerved from the rest of the good land due to the trial of a punishing famine in the God-given land
3 Ruth an alienated Moabitess turned to Bethlehem the place of the holy birth of Christ and entered into the realm of the divine economy
4 Boaz married Ruth and produced the royal house of David by Jehovah that Christ might be brought in for the accomplishment of Gods economy
For God to accomplish such an eternal economy of His, He needed to create the heavens for the earth, and the earth for man
We need to be today's Joshuas and Calebs to take possession of the God-promised land for Christ that we may become His possession
The writer of the book of Joshua was Joshua , whose name means 'Jehovah Savior,' or 'the salvation of Jehovah'
Israel's crossing of the river Jordan typifies the believers' experience of the death of Christ , not the believers' physical death
Israel's taking possession of the good land was in the line of bringing forth Christ by gaining two females-Rahab and Ruth
The Bible presents a full picture of God's economy from His creation of the universe to the consummation of the New Jerusalem
The first two chapters of the Bible are on God's creation with man, created in God's image and according to His likeness, as the center
Many things occur between these two ends, but all are linked to God's economy-mainly concerning Christ and His counterpart, the church
Because of the moving of the great wheel of the divine economy, within five years the number in the churches increased to fifty thousand
In every age and in every generation, this great wheel has been moving, and today we all are a part of the move of this great wheel on earth
Sometimes the move of this wheel is quite slow, but at other times it is so fast that we can hardly keep up with it
In particular, this is the principle of incarnation for the destruction of the satanic power in its usurpation of the earth
Today God wants to save people, but in order to do this, He needs us to be one with Him according to the principle of incarnation
Verses 10 through 15 are Joshua's charge to the people to prepare provisions for their entering into the good land within three days
Joshua's charge in verses 12 through 15 was to the two and a half tribes-to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh
Rather, all the elect of God were required to rise up, fight for the land, and gain and possess the land, fighting for one another
The people answered Joshua, saying, 'All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go
For the gaining of Christ, we need to be today's Joshua, fighting the battle, taking the land, and enjoying Christ as our inheritance
Israel had been prepared through God's dealing with them for several hundred years in Egypt and for forty years in the wilderness
Israel had become a corporate Joshua, chosen, called, redeemed, saved, trained, prepared, and qualified by God
They were ready to go on with God as one to take the land of Canaan, which typifies the rich, all-inclusive Christ
Ephesians 2 also tells us that we were once dead persons , but then God made us, the chosen Rahabs, the enjoyers of Christ
God can perform His dynamic salvation through the redemption of Christ to save such sinners, to make such Rahabs the enjoyers of Christ
How could Rahab, a Gentile harlot who had sold herself to sin to the uttermost, become a member of the chosen people of God?
People need to hear that everything has been finished and completed and that the all-inclusive Christ is in the heavens for them to receive
There was the need of a Gentile female for the spreading of Christ, and for this God provided Rahab the harlot
The scarlet thread tied in the window of Rahab's house was hung out in the open; it was there for everyone to see
Acts 16:30 and 31 reveal that whereas the Lord's salvation is for the individual believer, the unit of His salvation is the household
The children of Israel were buried in the death of Christ and then they were resurrected in the resurrection of Christ
We need to realize that our natural man, our old man, is altogether not qualified to fight the spiritual warfare for the gaining of Christ
The ark of God with the bearing priests took the lead to go into the waters of the Jordan and stood still in the waters
Joshua erected twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark had stood
These were another twelve stones, signifying the twelve tribes of Israel in their old life and in their old nature
As the priests stood in the middle of the Jordan, there was no need for them to be afraid, for the ark was with them
As Joshua was participating in this miracle, he was strengthened to take the lead to war against the demonic Canaanites
As we consider Israel's history recorded in Joshua 3 and 4, we need to realize that the same things have happened to us
Ephesians 2 tells us that the believers who were dead in sin have been made alive raised and seated together with Christ to be one new man
By cutting off their flesh to roll away the reproach of Egypt, they were buried and resurrected, both actually and practically
Christ in the stage typified by the produce of the good land is different from Christ in the stage typified by manna
In the Epistles Christ is no longer just manna; He is the produce of the good land, prepared through our laboring cooperation with God
The purpose of circumcision was to make God's chosen people a new people for the inheritance of God's promised land
The children of Israel were to keep the Passover to remember Jehovah's redemption of Israel from the death judgment on their firstborn sons
The keeping of the Passover was also to remember Jehovah's salvation of Israel from the power of Pharaoh and Egypt
The keeping of the Passover encouraged the children of Israel and gave them the assurance that Jehovah would displace the evil Canaanites
Israel's keeping of the Passover typifies the believers' keeping of the Lord's table to remember the Lord's redemption and salvation
The manna typifies Christ as the unconsummated heavenly food to God's chosen people, not requiring the eaters to labor on it
Our taking possession of the God-promised good land is for Christ, and Christ's making us His possession is for us
What does it mean to say that we possess the good land for Christ and that He, for our sake, makes us His possession?
Only after Israel had gained the good land and had taken possession of it did the land actually become theirs as a practical fact
The good land had been promised to Israel, and the situation was ready for the land to be given to Israel in actuality
If you know the heart of God, you will realize that whenever a sinner repents and receives Christ, that sinner is doing God a favor
At the beginning of the book of Joshua, Israel was ready to go forward, to take the good land, to possess it, and to enjoy it
The more we gain Christ, possess Christ, experience Christ, and enjoy Christ, the more He becomes among us what He should be
Although God has been working with the church for nearly two thousand years, God has not yet gained what He desires
As early as the first century, the Lord came in to call for overcomers , and today He is still sounding out the call for the overcomers
Even among devoted Christians it is hard to find some overcomers, some who are pursuing Christ in order to gain Him
Both the land and the Giver of the land needed certain ones to take the land, possess the land, and enjoy the land
If we take Christ, possess Christ, and enjoy Christ as our all-inclusive good land, the land will become our supply
When the Israelites were in Egypt, they ate Egyptian food, and this food caused them to have an Egyptian constitution
From that time onward, their constitution began to be different, for they began to be constituted with the produce of the good land
As we eat Christ as this food and enjoy Him, we will be constituted with Him, being made the same as Christ in life and nature
On the other hand, the enjoyment of this possession constitutes us with Christ, and we thereby become God's inheritance
We need to take the allinclusive Christ as our good land and labor on Him to gain some produce which will be our organic transforming food
In order for the children of Israel to gain the good land, they had to defeat the enemy and drive out the evil forces
When the king heard what Jehovah had done for His people, his heart melted and he lost his spirit, his boldness
In verse 2 Jehovah told Joshua that He had given Jericho, its king, and the mighty men of war into Joshua's hand
God instructed Joshua to have the men of war with the priests bearing the ark circle the city, going around it one time
For the first six days, the army of Israel just walked around the city with the ark, which typified Christ as the embodiment of God
The way that Israel conquered Jericho was a strong testimony that Israel's God, Jehovah, is a true and living God
As we take up the burden to visit sinners, we need to realize that every sinner is a 'fortified city' that has been cursed
In dealing with such a fortified city, we must exercise patience, considering when we should be silent and when we should speak
At the right time, the proper declaration will be very effective, and there will be a Sabbath day in which we can shout, 'Praise the Lord!
According to verse 2 Jehovah promised Joshua that He had given Jericho and its king and its mighty men of war into his hand
Jehovah further instructed Joshua that seven priests were to carry seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark
On the seventh day all the men of war were to circle the city seven times, and all the priests were to blow the trumpets
Jehovah went on to instruct Joshua that when the people shouted with a great shout, the wall of the city would fall down flat
The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard went after the ark, the trumpets continually blowing
To be silent means to be one with the Lord to carry out the matter in the Lords way without the expression of any thought opinion or feeling
The ark of Jehovah circled the city, going around it one time, and did the same on the second day, circling the city one time
The seventh time they circled the city on the seventh day, the priests blew the trumpets, and Joshua said to the people, 'Shout'!
At that time Joshua charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah who raises up and builds this city Jericho!
At the cost of his firstborn son shall he lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest son shall he set up its gates'
God can do everything without man, but according to the record of the book of Joshua He wants man to be one with Him
In keeping with the principle of incarnation, God wants to do everything through man, with man, and even in man
At Jericho Israel marched around the city with the ark a type of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God on the shoulders of the priests
However, God did the fighting, and Israel simply shouted, proclaimed, and testified and then occupied the city
After the destruction of Jericho, Israel sinned by taking something from Jericho that was devoted to destruction
When Israel was defeated by the people of Ai and thirty-six men were slaughtered, Joshua realized that something was wrong
Joshua called the people together, and through the Urim and Thummim he found the tribe , the family , and the person who had sinned
Do you realize that, as a believer in Christ, you are a God-man, that God is a part of your being and that you are a part of God's being?
For this reason, we must realize that whatever we do, wherever we go, and whatever we are should not be by ourselves
If Joshua had said this, he would have been a wise man, and the children of Israel would have followed his wise counsel
As we study the intrinsic significance of this part of Israel's history, we need to learn the secret of walking with the Lord
Why have You brought this people over the Jordan at all, to give us over into the hand of the Amorites and cause us to perish?
Verses 10 through 15 are a record of Jehovah's charge-to deal with the stealing of the thing devoted to destruction
That was the reason the children of Israel were not able to stand before their enemies but instead turned their backs before them
Jehovah charged that he who had stolen what was devoted to destruction was to be burned with fire, he and all that belonged to him
Israel dealt with Achan by taking him his sons and his daughters and all that he had and stoning them with stones and burning them with fire
Israel took the cattle and the spoil of the city of Ai for themselves as plunder according to what Jehovah had commanded Joshua
There at Mount Ebal, in the presence of the children of Israel, Joshua wrote upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses
The Bible shows us that we, as God's elect, are His wife and that between Him and us there must be a marriage union based upon mutual love
By the time God had brought Israel out of Egypt to Sinai, surely she had 'fallen in love' with this universal Man, this unique Hero
He had the wisdom, the capacity, the ability, the strength, the might, the power, and the authority to do everything
Wherever they went, they were a couple walking together-the husband and the wife, the Triune God and His elect, walking as one
Whereas the people of Ai fought against Israel strongly, the Gibeonites came to them begging to be their servants
At the end of three days after Israel had made a covenant with them they heard that they were their neighbors and that they dwelt among them
They let them live so that wrath would not come upon Israel because of the oath that they had sworn to the Gibeonites
In studying the Bible, we should not understand it merely according to letters nor according to the natural way by the natural mind
Genesis 6 reveals that the Nephilim were the issue of the evil union between the daughters of men and fallen angels
God made the earth in His economy, and He purposely created a strip of land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea
When Israel was ready to take possession of Canaan, it was filled with demon-possessed people, idol worshippers, and Nephilim
The significance of this is that without Joshua we cannot fully understand the spiritual warfare in Ephesians 6
Christ is our good land, and God wants us to gain Christ, but there is a layer of devilish, demonic forces between us and the good land
Since there was much fighting and rebellion after the time of Joshua, there was not the opportunity for God's people to build a temple
There is a struggle in the United States because it is a crucial country, affecting the entire world situation related to the Lord's move
We all need to know what the recovery is, where the recovery is, and what kind of persons can take the recovery on
The king of Jerusalem was threatened by Israel's destruction of Jericho and Ai and their peaceful agreement with Gibeon
Joshua came upon them suddenly, and Jehovah threw them into a panic before Israel, struck them with a great stroke, and pursued them
While the five nations fled from before Israel, 'Jehovah sent large stones upon them from heaven as far as Azekah, and they died
Joshua 10:42 says that Joshua took all these kings and their lands at one time, 'for Jehovah, the God of Israel, fought for Israel'
Joshua took all the cities of these kings with their kings, struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them
Joshua 12:1-6 speaks of the destruction of Heshbon under King Sihon and Bashan under King Og east of the Jordan
Jacob's blessing of Judah reveals that God considered Judah a threefold lion: a lion's whelp, a mature lion, and a lioness
Benjamin was a ravenous wolf , and Dan was a serpent on the way, biting the horses' heels to frustrate God's people from going on
All the tribes were possessors of the land, but the tribes possessed particular portions of the land according to what they were
In Leviticus 1 Christ is unveiled as burnt offerings in five types a bullock a sheep from the flock a goat a turtledove and a young pigeon
Whereas the Christ experienced by Paul was typified by a bullock, the Christ experienced by many believers today is typified by a pigeon
Christ is also unveiled by the three kinds of meal offerings in Leviticus 2: fine flour, a wafer, and grain that remains in the ears
Let us now consider the details concerning the allotment of the land described in chapters thirteen through seventeen
When Joshua was old, Jehovah said to him, 'You are old and advanced in age, and very much of the land remains to be possessed'
In verse 6b we have Jehovah's promise that He would drive out all the inhabitants of the remaining land before the children of Israel
No land was allotted to the tribe of Levi because the offerings of Jehovah, the God of Israel, were their inheritance
They gave no portion to the Levites in the land, but only cities to dwell in with their pasture lands for cattle and their substance
Caleb took possession of the land promised to him by Moses and Jehovah and then Calebs soninlaw gained the springs in the region of the land
The children of Judah were unable to dispossess the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem who dwelt with the children of Judah in Jerusalem
The land allotted to the children of Ephraim, the second son of Joseph, went from Jericho through the river Jordan to the sea
The land allotted to the rest of the children of Manasseh went south to Ephraim, west to the sea, north to Asher, and east to Issachar
The children of Manasseh were unable to dispossess the cities in their land, but the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in the land
When the children of Manasseh became strong, they made the Canaanites forced labor, but they did not utterly dispossess them
Joshua encouraged them to dispossess the hill country with its valley, though the Canaanites had chariots of iron and were strong
Many spiritual items concerning Christ and the church are revealed in the New Testament in principle but not in detail
He is not only all-inclusive but also all-extensive because His love is immeasurable in its breadth, length, height, and depth
Joshua 13-22 provides the detailed way to possess and enjoy the land, which is a type of the all-inclusive Christ
The good land was spacious, stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Euphrates, but the children of Israel did not possess all the land
Even with what they possessed, they still needed a detailed way to allot the land in order to gain and enjoy it
He was clear, for instance, that Jerusalem and the surrounding district were for Judah, out of whom Christ would come
In our experience and enjoyment Christ is of many sizes and types, as indicated by the different kinds of burnt offerings and meal offerings
Someone who is diligent in pursuing Christ will experience a larger Christ than someone who is lazy in this matter
The Protestants became shallow and dead so there was a reaction from the mystics including Madame Guyon Father Fenelon and Brother Lawrence
The twelfth tribe is the recovery, which has recovered the New Testament revelation back to the early apostles
Let us now consider from chapters eighteen through twenty-two more of the details concerning the allotment of the land
The land allotted to the tribe of Issachar went from Jezreel to the river Jordan and included sixteen cities with their villages
To the rest of the children of Kohath were given ten cities from the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh
To the children of Gershon were given thirteen cities from the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and the half-tribe of Manasseh
Regarding this, verse 45 says, 'Not a word failed of all the good things that Jehovah had spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass'
The children of Israel sent Phinehas the priest with ten leaders of the ten tribes of Israel to deal with them
Phinehas the priest and the ten leaders of Israel were satisfied with their explanation and returned to their land
The children of Reuben and the children of Gad named the altar, saying that it was a witness that Jehovah is God
To the fifth century, there were many teachings and debates concerning Christology, the study of the person of Christ
In the Old Testament there are many types of Christ, and each of these types is related to the study of Christ
My burden in this message is to consider ten aspects of the all-inclusive Christ, who is typified by the good land
For thirty years Christ in His humanity lived in a despised country, in the despised town of Nazareth, and in the home of a poor carpenter
The word ordinances here refers to rituals, the forms or ways of living and worship, which create enmity and division
Because every nation and culture has its particular ordinances, today there are thousands of different ways of living
After the Lord Jesus died, 'one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water'
The blood of Christ has redeemed us, and the divine life of Christ has flowed into us as a river to minister God into us
Now, as believers in Christ, we have been redeemed back to God, and we have God flowing into us as living water
In resurrection Christ also became the life-giving Spirit , compounded with divinity, humanity, death, and resurrection
The Christ whom we know, enjoy, possess, and experience is typified by the spacious good land of mountains, rivers, brooks, and plains
According to the book of Joshua, this is the Christ not only of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin but also of the tribe of Levi
It is our hope that the Recovery Version will carry on the heritage that it has received and will pave the way for future generations
Those who give up the church life with the fellowship of life spontaneously lose their right to inherit the enjoyment of Christ
We have been born of God and we are in the church life, having the standing to inherit Christ as our good land for our enjoyment
We need to take the way of fellowship, indicated by the contact the daughters of Zelophehad had with their kinsmen
The cities of refuge signify the all-inclusive Christ as the place to which we can escape when we realize that we are sinful
The all-inclusive Christ as the embodiment of the redeeming God is the city of refuge where we are safeguarded, covered, and concealed
After these tribes fought along with their brothers, they were qualified to return to their land to enjoy their inheritance
When Reuben Gad and the halftribe of Manasseh returned to enjoy their inheritance of the land they built a great altar at the river Jordan
In certain places the dissenting ones, not caring for the one accord in the Lord's recovery, have formed divisions by building another altar
To enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the good land, we must be one people, one Body, one universal church to testify for Christ
Joshua told them that if they forsook Jehovah their God, He would no longer dispossess the nations out of their sight
After Moses left, Joshua became the leader of the people of Israel, and he continued as the leader for about twenty-five years
Joshua reminded them that they had seen all that Jehovah their God had done to all the nations because of them
Next, Joshua encouraged the elders, heads, judges, and officers of Israel to love Jehovah their God and to cling to Him
Rather, the people of Israel were to cling to Jehovah their God, for He had dispossessed great and strong nations because of them
After speaking about this, Joshua said, 'Be very careful therefore for yourselves, that you love Jehovah your God'
Joshua continued by warning them not to turn back and cling to the remainder of the nations not to marry into them and not to go among them
Chapter twenty-four is Joshua's parting word to all the tribes of Israel with their elders, heads, judges, and officers
He charged them to put away the foreign gods that were among them and to incline their hearts to Jehovah, the God of Israel
Eleazar was buried in the hill of Phinehas his son, which had been given to him in the hill country of Ephraim
If we read the Old Testament according to this full scope, we will realize that at Mount Sinai God married Israel
In His concept and desire, He wanted to be to Israel as a husband to a wife, and He expected Israel to act as a wife toward Him
In writing the books of history, Samuel put Judges after Joshua to show us what kind of life Israel lived toward her Husband
In the book of Judges there is a terrible picture of a wife forsaking her Husband and not even acknowledging His existence
In the beginning Israel had a bridal love toward God, but after her marriage she lost her position as a chaste wife to her husband
Jeremiah 11:13 says that according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem the people had set up altars to burn incense to their idols
After the story of Judah and Caleb in 1:1-20, Israel's history as recorded in Judges was full of the rottenness and corruption of a harlot
Joshua is the book of Israel's history full of the marvelous victories over the inhabitants of Canaan in the presence of Jehovah
Judges, on the contrary, is the book of Israel's history full of miserable defeats under their enemies in the forsaking of Jehovah
The book of Judges has three sections: Israel's trusting in God ; Israel's forsaking of God ; and Israel's becoming corrupted
The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it, striking it with the edge of the sword and setting it on fire
Afterward they went down to fight against the Canaanites who inhabited the hill country and the southland and the lowland
Verse 20 tells us that Hebron was given to Caleb, as Moses had spoken, and that Caleb dispossessed the three sons of Anak from there
They took possession of the hill country, but they were not able to dispossess the inhabitants of the valley, for they had chariots of iron
He showed them the entrance, and they struck the people of the city with their sword, but they let the man and all his family go
The Amorites persisted in dwelling with them, but the house of Joseph prevailed so that they became forced labor
Israel rejected God as her Husband and as her King and 'went about as harlots after other gods and worshipped them'
In dealing with this situation, the King became a servant, as the Angel of Jehovah, to admonish the children of Israel
When Moses was being called by God to lead Israel out of Egypt, the calling Jehovah became the Angel of Jehovah
He did not come to her as a Husband, Head, or King but came to her as the Angel of Jehovah, who was sent by Jehovah
With respect to Christ as the Angel of Jehovah, let us review what is revealed concerning Christ in the four Gospels
In the Gospel of Matthew Christ is presented as the King, and in the Gospel of Mark the King is presented as a Slave
In the Gospel of Luke the Slave-Savior is presented as a Man-Savior in His human virtues with the divine attributes
The death of Joshua, of the elders, and of that entire generation was the reason for Israel's forsaking of God
Also, 'another generation,' the present generation, who did not know Jehovah or the work that He had done for Israel, rose up after them
By reading her song in chapter five, we can see that she was full of ability, capacity, insight, and foresight
In their miserable situation no one would take the lead to fight for Jehovah's interest, and no one would be willing to follow
From this we see that the entire country came into an excellent order, assuming the proper position before Jehovah
Judges 3:12-13 says that Jehovah strengthened Israel's enemies, but 4:6-16 reveals that Jehovah was fighting for Israel
Jehovah sold Israel into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, and Israel served him eight years
Eglon gathered the children of Ammon and Amalek to himself and went and struck Israel, taking possession of the city of palms
Verse 15a says, 'Jehovah threw Sisera and all his chariots and all his camp into confusion with the edge of the sword before Barak'
In verses 17 through 22 Sisera, the captain of King Jabin's army, was killed by Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, as Deborah had predicted
The mountains quaked at the presence of Jehovah, / Sinai there, at the presence of Jehovah, the God of Israel'
Verse 24 says, 'Blessed among women shall Jael be, / The wife of Heber the Kenite; / Blessed among the women in the tent shall she be'
Verses 28 through 30 continue by mocking ironically the imagination of the mother of Sisera concerning her son's good fortune
Gideon, a marvelous judge who was called by Jehovah in a very particular way, was successful because of four things
For Gideon to do such a thing for God required that he sacrifice his own interests, and his sacrifice was a strong factor of his success
The selection of the three hundred in 7:2-7 also stresses the sacrifice of our personal interests and enjoyment for God's purpose
When Gideon blew the trumpet to call the people to fight against the Midianites, thirty-two thousand responded
Only the three hundred who lapped the water into their mouths with their hands were chosen by God for the battle against Midian
With Gideon we have a picture of a man in union with God, a God-man, to fulfill God's word and to carry out God's economy
After his great success-the greatest success in all the cycles of Israel's history recorded in Judges-Gideon had a terrible failure
Although he did a good thing in refusing to rule over the people , he coveted the spoil of his people, and they surrendered it to him
Even King Solomon, who began as a God-fearing and God-loving person, eventually became an idol worshipper through his many foreign wives
Gideon made an ephod with the gold he had taken from the people, and this ephod became an idol to the children of Israel
Gideon began by tearing down the altar of Baal and its idol, but after his success he built something idolatrous
Let us now go on to consider the many details of the fourth cycle of Israel's miserable history recorded in 6:1-8:32
He also reminded them that He had driven out the Canaanites before them and had given to them the land of Canaan
Jehovah charged the children of Israel not to fear the gods of the Amorites, but they did not listen to His voice
The Angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in His hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes
Gideon did this by ten men at night and not by day because he was too afraid of his father's house and the men of the city
When they saw that the altar of Baal had been torn down and that the Asherah beside it had been cut down, they asked who had done this thing
All the Midianites, Amalekites, and the children of the east gathered together, and they crossed over and encamped in the valley of Jezreel
Jehovah told Gideon that the people who were with him were too many for Jehovah to deliver Midian into their hand
Out of the ten thousand, only three hundred who lapped the water into their mouth with their hand were chosen by Jehovah
Holding the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands, they cried out, 'A sword for Jehovah and for Gideon'!
The men of Ephraim contended sharply with Gideon, complaining that he did not call them when he went to battle against Midian
The men of Israel asked Gideon to rule over them, but he refused, saying, 'I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you
Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and the land of Israel had rest forty years in the days of Gideon
Due to man's forsaking of God and joining to Satan, the entire world, including every nation, society, and family, has become chaotic
The first manifestation of this chaos was the first murder, which took place in Adam's family when Cain slew Abel
It seems that in the recovery there are cycles of rebellion about every ten years, involving struggles for power to fulfill ambitions
In family life, whenever a husband and a wife love the Lord and reject everything other than Him, their married life will be wonderful
Once a husband or wife begins to love something else in place of the Lord, their married life and family life become chaotic
We must take Him, love Him, honor Him, respect Him, regard Him, exalt Him, and cling to Him, rejecting Satan to the uttermost
As soon as Gideon died, Israel turned again and went as harlots after the Baalim, making Baal-berith their god
He likened Abimelech not to a good olive tree or a good fig tree or a good vine but, derisively, to an evil bramble
The men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech, revolting against him and being strengthened by Gaal the son of Ebed
When he came up to the tower and fought against it, a certain woman threw a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and it cracked his skull
God repaid the evil of Abimelech and all the evil of the men of Shechem, and the curse of Jotham came upon them
Israel's degradation also issued in the wantonness of their hatred in slaying one another, ending themselves in full destruction
Ever since the time of Genesis 3, man has been forsaking God and joining to Satan, taking many things as replacements of God
In his fourteen Epistles Paul ministered the allinclusive and allextensive Christ but he also dealt with all kinds of replacements of Christ
Samson, the last judge mentioned in this book, was very powerful, yet the factor of his failure was his indulgence in sex
At the end of Judges, there is an account of wanton slaughter, describing how the entire tribe of Benjamin was nearly extinguished by Israel
If someone becomes an idol worshipper, he will become a person who is very indulgent in sex and full of hatred toward others
Such a sister may not have time in the morning to spend ten minutes with the Lord, but she has plenty of time to comb her hair
It seems that the leaders among them are doing nothing but traveling from place to place in order to create and strengthen such divisions
Their intention is to poison the saints in order to deaden them, cool them down, and cause them to have doubts about the Lord's recovery
The main factor with these ones is that they have left the church and joined themselves to the 'demon' of division
In our spiritual life, even to take a small thing, such as combing our hair or buying something, may be to take another husband
The children of Israel cried out to Jehovah, saying, 'We have sinned against You, for we have forsaken our God and have served the Baalim'
He asked them if He had not saved them from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the children of Ammon, and the Philistines
Verses 17 and 18 speak of the pressure of the Ammonites and the need of a head over Israel to take the lead to fight against the Ammonites
The princes of Gilead said each to his companion, 'Who is the man who will begin to fight against the children of Ammon?
Eventually, he was requested by the elders of Gilead to be their head and chief to fight the Ammonites for them
In reading through these cycles in Judges, it is difficult to understand how someone as positive as Gideon could become so negative
Between his success and his failure, it must have been that a demon entered him, because he forsook God and joined himself to Satan
Although he had been empowered by God, he was damaged and destroyed to the uttermost because of his indulgence in lust
The sisters in a local church should clothe themselves with these two virtues-shamefastness and self-restraint-as their demeanor
They should pray to see if there is the leading of the Lord in this matter, rather than trying to be too selective
Samson's conception was actually a miracle initiated by the appearing of the Angel of Jehovah to his mother and father
When Manoah asked the Angel of Jehovah what His name was, He said, 'Why do you ask about My name, since it is wonderful'?
We see his might in his tearing a young lion by the Spirit of Jehovah and in his killing thirty men by the Spirit rushing upon him
The Philistines grabbed him, gouged out his eyes, and bound him with fetters, and he ground at the mill in the prison house
He was forced to perform before the Philistines that they might celebrate their victory over him before their god Dagon
When we were saved, we were brought into a fellowship of the Divine Trinity with His redeemed and regenerated people
It is in this fellowship that we can gain what God has given us, that is, the Son of God given to us by God as our allotted portion
Once a branch ceases to abide in the vine, the branch is cut off, becomes barren and dry, and loses the enjoyment of the riches of the vine
If we are cut off from the fellowship just a little, God's economy will not be able to go forward for a period of time
We need to be careful every day and in every detail, keeping ourselves in the enjoyment of Christ all the time
Doing things without taking care of the inner feeling, the sense of life within, may delay the Lord for a longtime
The recent rebellion in the recovery has also delayed the Lord and, in certain respects, hindered the move of the wheel of God's economy
Micah then set up a house of gods, made an ephod and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons to be his priest
The state churches, the denominations, and many of the independent groups are also houses of Micah, full of idols as replacements of Christ
Let us now turn to Judges 17 and 18 and consider what these chapters have to say regarding the abominable chaos in Israel's worship
Judges 17:1-6 tells us that Micah, a man from the hill country of Ephraim, set up a house of gods in his house
Verse 6 says that in those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did that which was right in his own eyes
In chapter eighteen we see that the Danites robbed Micah of his sculptured idol the ephod the teraphim and the molten image with his priest
The priest ordained by Micah said to the five men, 'Go in peace; your way on which you are going is before Jehovah'
They went back to their brothers and asked them to go to take possession of the land, saying, 'God has indeed delivered it into your hand'
Six hundred men girded with weapons of war set out from the family of Dan and came to the house of Micah in the hill country of Ephraim
Jonathan the son of Gershom the son of Moses he and his sons became priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land
In the United States every state is autonomous in business affairs, but the fifty states are not fifty different nations
We have seen that, according to the record in Judges, in the degradation Israel became chaotic in government, in worship, and in morality
We thank the Lord that, in the midst of the chaotic situation, there was a person-Boaz-who had the highest standard of morality
As we will see when we come to the book of Ruth, according to typology Boaz was one who enjoyed Christ very much
The concubine went about as a harlot and departed from the Levite to her father's house, to Bethlehem in Judah, for four months
He brought her from her father's house, went through Jerusalem, and came to Gibeah, which belonged to Benjamin
While they were making their hearts merry, the worthless men of the city surrounded the house, beating on the door
They spoke to the master of the house, saying, 'Bring out the man who went into your house that we may know him'
In the early morning the concubine came and fell at the entrance of the old man's house, where her lord had been until it was light
According to verses 27 through 30 the story of this corruption was spread throughout all the territory of Israel
When he came to his house, he cut her up limb by limb into twelve pieces and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel
All the children of Israel from Dan as far as Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, gathered as one man unto Jehovah
The Levite, the husband of the woman who had been murdered, told them the story of the wickedness and folly of the men of Gibeah
All the people rose up as one man, saying that none of them would go to their tents nor any of them return to their houses
The children of Israel destroyed twenty-five thousand one hundred men of Benjamin, by Jehovah striking them down before Israel
The men of Israel returned to the children of Benjamin, striking them, both the entire city with the cattle and all that was found there
The children of Israel were grieved concerning Benjamin their brother that one tribe had been cut down from Israel
In verses 7 through 24 we see that the children of Israel planned to get wives and possessions for the remnant of Benjamin
The book of Judges concludes by saying that in those days there was no king in Israel; each man did what was right in his own eyes
Judges is a book of Israel's miserable history, dark and stinking; Ruth is the record of a couple's excellent story, bright and aromatic
The book of Ruth is also an important part of the genealogy of Christ , which is the record that concerns the incarnation of Christ
The short book of Ruth, containing only four chapters, is related in a particular way to the incarnation of Christ
According to the word 'Jesse begot David' , the time of writing must have been after the rule of the judges and in the time of the kings
According to Deuteronomy 23:3 the Moabites were forbidden to enter the congregation of the Lord, even to the tenth generation
Once she exercised the right that came to her through her choosing for her goal, Ruth, in wisdom, sought for her rest
In this message we will consider Ruth 1, a chapter that covers Elimelech's swerving, Naomi's returning, and Ruth's choosing
Staying in the good land is not just for us to earn a living but for us to participate in the carrying out of God's economy
Israel's rest, their prosperity for their enjoyment and their contentment, was related to their situation with God in His economy
Two thousand years later, this rest will be enjoyed in a fuller way in the millennial kingdom with Christ as the King
After the millennium, the enjoyment of this rest will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity
Elimelech's mistake was to swerve from the ground, the standing, which gave him the opportunity to enjoy the rest in the good land
In the eyes of God, Bethlehem was a very special place, for it was the place where He, through incarnation, would be born to be a man
It was the top part of the God-promised land , the top part of the good land , and the top part of the land of Immanuel
Moab was a country of people whose peace and prosperity God would not allow Israel to seek all their days forever
Elimelech left in the days of the rule of the judges, under Israel's forsaking of God and under their degradation, confusion, and corruption
Elimelech left due to a famine in the good land, a lacking of life supply for living and satisfaction as a punishment of God
We may wonder how there could be a famine in the good land since God had promised that it would be a land flowing with milk and honey
Because they had forsaken Him as their source and Husband and had gone to idols, He let them go to their idols for food as well
Naomi returned with Ruth, her daughter-in-law given to her by God for the accomplishment of His economy concerning Christ
She kissed them, and they lifted up their voice and wept, saying to her, 'No, we will return with you to your people'
Naomi said to Ruth, 'Your sister-in-law has now returned to her people and to her gods; return with your sister-in-law'
Ruth chose to go to the land of Israel because she probably had heard a great deal concerning God, God's promise, and the good land
In the ordinance of the law given by God through Moses regarding reaping, the size of the corners of the field was not specified
Now Naomi had a relative of her husband's, a man of great wealth, from Elimelech's family; and his name was Boaz'
Ruth asked Naomi to let her go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight Ruth had found favor
Naomi told Ruth to go and she went and gleaned in the field after the reapers happening to glean in a portion of the field belonging to Boaz
He came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, 'Jehovah be with you,' and they said to him, 'Jehovah bless you'
His word to Boaz regarding Ruth indicates that he was happy with her, considering her a woman of fidelity and virtue
He said to her, 'Do not go to glean in another field, and also do not pass from here but stay close to my young women
Boaz replied that all that she had done for her mother-in-law since the death of her husband Elimelech had been made known to him
He also had learned how she had left her father and mother and the land of her birth and had come to a people whom she had not known before
In response, Ruth asked that she would find favor in his sight, for he had comforted her and had spoken kindly to her
At mealtime Boaz told her to eat some food, extending some parched grain to her, and she ate and was satisfied
When she rose up to glean, Boaz charged his young men to let her glean among the standing grain and not to rebuke her
He went on to say to them, 'Also pull out some from the bundles for her, and leave it for her to glean; and do not rebuke her'
According to her threefold status as a sojourner, a poor one, and a widow, she exercised her right to glean the harvest
The book of Ruth portrays the way, the position, the qualification, and the right of sinners to participate in Christ and to enjoy Christ
Chapter one shows Ruth's choosing, chapter two shows Ruth's exercising of her right, and chapter three shows Ruth's seeking for her rest
Under the Lord's sovereign arrangement, we heard the gospel and made a resolution to become a believer of Christ
With this intimate, organic union, we must begin to pursue Christ in order to gain, possess, experience, and enjoy Him
It is a tragedy that Christianity, both Catholicism and Protestantism, has not seen this matter of enjoying Christ
In these messages on Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, the Lord has given us a clear view of how we should take Christ as our unique Husband
After the people of Israel entered the good land under Joshua, there was a history of miserable chaos because Israel was not faithful
In this modern age there are many idols, such as entertainment, sports, and shopping, which cause Christians to be unfaithful
It seems as if they have never been married to Christ, that they have never actually taken Him as their Husband
Christ as our Husband and the church as our home are a complete unit for us to have a proper and adequate rest
Since this was the situation, there was the need for Naomi, as the person in the middle, to push Ruth and Boaz to get married
We will become those who gain Christ and enjoy Christ, loving Him, staying at home with Him, and living with Him at home, in the church
When Ruth identified herself and asked Boaz to spread his cloak over her, he said, 'Blessed be you of Jehovah, my daughter
You have shown your latter kindness to be better than your first by not going after the choice young men, whether poor or rich'
Boaz went on to say that if that other kinsman was not willing to do the kinsman's duty for Ruth, then he would do it for her
Under the prodding of Naomi, Ruth sought for a resting place, and finally she received a reward, a gain, for God's economy
Ruth's gaining of such a husband was witnessed and blessed by the people and the elders in the gate , and it was also blessed by God
Through that marriage Ruth, a Moabite widow, gained the holy citizens' citizenship, becoming one among God's elect
The more we receive such an injection, the more we will be able to sing, 'Christ liveth in me, / Christ liveth in me; / Oh!
In order for this to happen, we all need to speak for Christ, to speak forth Christ, and even speak Christ to others
Samuel to Malachi is a long record of the generations for the prolonged line of humanity for Christ's incarnation
At the beginning and at the end of the portion of Israel's history from Joshua to Ruth are two prominent persons typifying Christ
Sadly, in their experience many of today's Christians do not have Christ in His riches, and they do not have Him as the Husband
In the last two chapters of the Bible we see that Christ the Lamb is our Husband and that we the believers in Christ are the Lambs wife
As human beings created by God we should have married our Creator taking Him as our Husband but instead we married a fellow creature Satan
We need to realize that the believers' old man consists of a natural part created by God and a fallen part corrupted by sin
From this we see that in the old man typified by Ruth, we have two natures and that one of these natures is good and the other is evil
The evil nature, acting with the good one, assumed to be the husband, and together they became the old man, our incestuous husband
Ruth being united to Boaz typifies the Gentile sinners being attached to Christ that they may partake of the inheritance of God's promise
The more we consider these aspects of Ruth as a type of the church, the more we can know our status as believers in Christ today
When Ruth married Boaz, she was redeemed from her indebtedness, and she became his new wife for the producing of the needed heirs
In resurrection He as the lifegiving Spirit regenerated us to make us as created fallen and redeemed persons a new creation married to Him
1) The believers' old man is composed of two parts: the natural part created by God and the fallen part corrupted by sin
4) Ruth's old husband typifies our fallen part of our old man, and his indebtedness typifies our sin caused by our fallen part
Ruth herself typifies our natural man created by God and redeemed and regenerated to be the new man as the counterpart of Christ
5) The first kinsman of Ruth's husband typifies our natural man who cannot and will not redeem us from the indebtedness of our old man
Christ redeemed this God-created part of the old man, destroying the fallen part and clearing away the sin caused by this fallen part
She became an old man to be, by forsaking God as her Husband, an old husband to herself who brought her into indebtedness
Ninth, she was the great-grandmother of David who brought forth the royal family of the God-ordained government on the earth
Tenth, she became a crucial ancestor of Christ who brought forth Christ, the embodiment of God, to men on earth
As a God-created person with her status of a natural person with its rights by birth, Ruth typifies the believers as a natural man
From the typology of Ruth's statuses, we can see that as a natural man, we became fallen and involved with sin
He was a Nazarite, keeping his hair long as a sign that he submitted to God as his Head, not drinking wine, and not eating unclean food
A number of Pentecostal preachers have been reckless, without any restraint, or control, of the lust of their flesh
Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, was punished by God because he did not live according to God's eternal economy
He did not commit fornication; on the contrary, it seems that he just made a little mistake in leaving the Holy Land
The purpose of the book of Ruth is not to tell us anything concerning power but to reveal the things of life to the uttermost
Feeling that the situation was hopeless, Naomi encouraged Ruth to return to her mother's house in order to have a future
