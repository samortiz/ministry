   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It takes no time to enter into the Holy of Holies because there is no distance between it and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Holy of Holies, we can touch the throne of grace, which is Christ as the propitiation place; this propitiation place covers the demands of the Ten Commandments and satisfies the requirements of God s righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the book of Hebrews, the real Christian life is one of coming forward to the throne of grace continually to receive mercy and find grace for timely help.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For the divine conformation, the believers enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation not only by entering the Holy of Holies but also by following Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John 21:19, after the Lord Jesus told Peter how he would die to glorify God, He said to him, Follow Me. The Lord Jesus wanted Peter to follow Him as the indwelling One.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The One we are to follow is inside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 18 also points out that we must not follow the Lord according to our own ideas but according to His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our following Him, even unto death, glorifies God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, we must follow Him without paying attention to others.</S>

To this, the Lord replied, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me v. 22 . The Lord was telling Peter that what would happen to John was none of his concern; he must follow the Lord and not pay attention to others.</S>
