Needing the Priesthood and the Kingship</h2>
<p>Zechariah 6:12-13 contains a prophecy concerning the Lord Jesus: &ldquo;Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, saying, Here is a man, whose name is the Shoot; and he will shoot forth from his place and will build the temple of Jehovah. Indeed, it is he who will build the temple of Jehovah; and he will bear majesty and will sit and rule on his throne; and he will be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace will be between the two of them.&rdquo; This portion contains two significant points. First, a man whose name is the Shoot will build the temple of Jehovah. This man refers to the Lord Jesus, who is the righteous Shoot of David (Jer. 23:5). Second, the builder of this temple is a priest yet a king, a king yet a priest. In the Old Testament the priests were one group, and the kings were another group. However, the Lord Jesus is the counsel of peace between the offices of the kingship and the priesthood. This means that these two offices have been combined as one in Him.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:4-5 says, &ldquo;Coming to Him, a living stone,...you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ,&rdquo; and verse 9 says, &ldquo;You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation.&rdquo; These verses show that the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place is related to the priesthood and the kingship. We are living stones, and we are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood. The church as God&rsquo;s dwelling place is built up with living stones, and this dwelling place is a priesthood. According to verse 5, the priesthood is holy, and according to verse 9, the priesthood is royal.</p>
<p>There is a common element in 1 Peter 2:4-5 and Zechariah 6:13. Both books speak of the building of God&rsquo;s temple, both speak of the relationship between the priests and the building of God&rsquo;s temple, and both speak of the priesthood as having a royal aspect. The Lord Jesus, as the Priest who is building up the temple of Jehovah, is on &ldquo;his throne&rdquo;; He is both Priest and King. The believers, as living stones who are being built up as God&rsquo;s dwelling place, are a &ldquo;royal priesthood&rdquo;; we are both priests and kings. The priesthood and the kingship are indispensable factors in the building up of God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>

Representing God&rsquo;s Image and Authority</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s thought and desire can be seen in these verses. When a person writes a poem, there is always a thought and desire that are expressed through words. A good reader will not only read the words of the poem but also touch the inner feeling, thought, and desire of the writer. This is the way that we should read the Bible. The Bible is God&rsquo;s revelation, and His desire, thought, and feeling are hidden within the words of the Bible. As we read the Bible, we must touch God&rsquo;s desire and feeling.</p>
<p>In order to understand the relationship between the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place and the royal priesthood, we need to consider God&rsquo;s intention when He created man. God created man in His image and according to His likeness so that man could express and represent Him (Gen. 1:26). Expression is a matter of life and image, and representation is a matter of authority. God created man because He had a desire to enter into man as life, to constitute Himself into man, and to be mingled as one with man. Consequently, when God created man in His image, He created man with a human spirit so that man could receive God (Zech. 12:1), who is Spirit (John 4:24), and be mingled with God in spirit until man&rsquo;s whole being is thoroughly saturated with God (Rom. 8:16). When God&rsquo;s life enters into us and saturates us, we spontaneously express God&rsquo;s image and glory in all things. This is God&rsquo;s desire and thought in creating man.</p>
<p>Romans 8:29 says, &ldquo;Those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers.&rdquo; This shows that God intends to conform us to the image of His Son; that is, He will work on us until we are the same as His Son. As the Son of His love, Colossians 1:15 speaks of Christ as being &ldquo;the image of the invisible God.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus is the image of God. Hence, when we are conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son, we have God&rsquo;s image and become God&rsquo;s expression. Inwardly we have His life, and outwardly we bear His image for His expression and glory. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s authority is entrusted to those who bear God&rsquo;s image. Of all God&rsquo;s creatures, only man has the capacity to bear God&rsquo;s image and be entrusted to represent God&rsquo;s authority. God&rsquo;s authority and life are connected because His life enables man to receive God and His authority enables man to represent God.</p>
<p>At the end of the Bible the New Jerusalem signifies a corporate man. This corporate man expresses God&rsquo;s image and reigns with God, fulfilling God&rsquo;s desire for man to express His image and represent His authority. If we see God&rsquo;s desire, we will understand His desire for us to be priests and kings, because priests fellowship with God, bring people to God, and bring God into people, whereas kings exercise God&rsquo;s authority to rule for God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 45</div><br></body></html>
