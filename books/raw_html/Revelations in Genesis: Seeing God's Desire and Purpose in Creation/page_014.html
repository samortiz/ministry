        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S PROCEDURE<br />
TO FULFILL HIS PURPOSE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:4-25</h1>
<p>Beginning with this chapter we will consider the procedure that God takes to fulfill His purpose. Although Genesis 2:4-25 is a short portion of the Bible, it is rich in spiritual implications. We need much time to point out the important implications one by one. All Bible readers encounter a problem when reading this portion. They do not understand why the Bible repeats the story of the creation of man beginning in verse 4. The common explanation is that the creation of man in Genesis 1:26-28 is a general outline but that 2:4-25 is a detailed and supplementary description of the creation of man. This understanding may seem logical, but if we look to the Lord, we will realize that these verses have a greater significance.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING THE PROCEDURE<br />
TO FULFILL GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:1 through 2:3 reveals that God&rsquo;s desire and purpose are related to image and authority. He wants man to express Him, and He wants man to deal with His enemy. When both aspects of God&rsquo;s desire are fulfilled, He will be satisfied and have rest. The procedure that God takes to fulfill His desire and purpose is life, because chapter 2 speaks of a tree with a very particular name&mdash;the tree of life. After God created man, He placed man in front of the tree of life (vv. 8-9). This means that God wanted man to receive His life, signified by the tree of life, to thereby fulfill His desire and purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Life Conforming Man to the Image of God<br />
So That Man May Express God</h2>
<p>God created Adam in chapter 1, but at that time Adam had only the image of God, not the life of God (v. 26). Hence, Adam had no way to express God. A picture may represent a person, but it conveys only his appearance; it does not contain his life. A statue may express an image, but it is merely an outward appearance; it does not convey his inward character, because it does not have his life. Similarly, Adam had the image of God outwardly, but he did not have God&rsquo;s life inwardly. Adam had only the created human life; he did not have the uncreated life of God. Hence, Adam could express God only in appearance and likeness; he could not express God in nature and character. In order for God to fulfill His purpose in man, He needs to work His life into man. When God&rsquo;s life enters into man, man can be like God in both appearance and in nature. He can have not only God&rsquo;s outward appearance but also God&rsquo;s inward content, which is God&rsquo;s life. Only the divine life can conform us to the image of God&rsquo;s Son so that we are like Him (Rom. 8:2, 6, 29). Only the divine life can bring us into the glory of God so that we express Him (v. 30; Col. 3:4).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Life Giving Man Authority<br />
So That He May Rule for God</h2>
<p>Without the life of God, man cannot rule for God. Ruling is based on the life of God. In Numbers 17 Aaron&rsquo;s rod budded, blossomed, and bore ripe almonds. This indicates that man must have the life of God in order to rule for God. A rod represents authority, and a budding rod is a matter of resurrection. The leader of each of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel put a rod in the Tent of Meeting, but only Aaron&rsquo;s rod budded (vv. 1-8). This means that only Aaron had the life that had passed through death and resurrection. This resurrection life made Aaron acceptable before God and gave Aaron authority among the children of Israel.</p>
<p>Revelation 20:6 says that the resurrected believers are able to reign with the Lord. These believers are full of the resurrection and overcoming life inwardly; hence, they can rule for God outwardly. Chapter 22 reveals that life is related to ruling. The throne of God and of the Lamb is in the New Jerusalem, and the river of water of life proceeds out from this throne. A throne signifies ruling; therefore, life and ruling are inseparable (v. 1).</p>
<p>Man needs the life of God inwardly in order to express God and to rule for God to deal with God&rsquo;s enemy. Therefore, in God&rsquo;s further creation in Genesis 1 and 2, life was His goal. He created all kinds of life forms, and He also created man with the highest created life. However, this was not enough: God still wanted man to receive His uncreated life, which is signified by the tree of life in the garden of Eden (vv. 8-9).</p>
<p>The garden of Eden is a very meaningful picture. In the garden there was a tree of life, and next to the tree stood a man made of dust. In the garden there was also a river that divided into four branches. The flowing of this river issued in gold, bdellium, and precious stones (vv. 8-12). Bible readers know that gold always signifies God&rsquo;s nature (Exo. 25:11) and that dust signifies the human nature (Gen. 2:7; 1 Cor. 15:47). Although created man is the same as God in his outward appearance, his inward content and nature are of dust instead of gold; hence, his being is different from God&rsquo;s. The picture in Genesis 2 shows that the divine life, as signified by the tree of life, must enter into man to become the flow of life within him in order for a man of dust to become gold. The result of the flowing of life is that the man of dust becomes gold.</p>
<p>The picture at the end of Revelation is similar to the picture in Genesis 2. However, the New Jerusalem is a city of gold, not a man of dust (Rev. 21:18). In the New Jerusalem man will have the appearance of God. God will be his content, and he will have the nature of God. Man will be the same as God in life and in nature, and man will be able to express the glory of God and to rule for God. Then God&rsquo;s purpose in man will be fully accomplished. Therefore, life is the procedure that God takes to fulfill His purpose. In order to fulfill His purpose, God must dispense His life into man. If His life does not enter into man, man cannot be like God in order to express Him, nor can man rule for God in order to deal with His enemy. God&rsquo;s purpose cannot be fulfilled by human effort. The fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose requires God&rsquo;s life to enter into man.</p>
<p>This is the truth of the Bible. This truth is different from the teachings of the Chinese sages. The sages taught man to improve his behavior, to activate his own goodness, and to develop his &ldquo;bright virtue,&rdquo; that is, to magnify his human virtues. However, according to the truth of the Bible, man does not have the ability to improve himself, to activate his own goodness, or to cultivate himself in order to be like God. The human nature is dust, whereas the nature of God is gold. It is impossible to change dust into gold apart from the divine life. We thank the Lord that His saving way is to dispense His life and nature of gold into man in order to transform man. This is the way that we can receive the nature of God to express His image and to rule for God to deal with His enemy, Satan.</p>
<p>We need to consider step by step the procedure that God takes to fulfill His purpose according to the account in Genesis 2. Verses 4 through 25 speak of this procedure. These verses can be divided into three sections. The first section is from verse 4 through verse 7, the second section is from verse 8 through verse 17, and the third section is from verse 18 through verse 25. These three sections speak of the three steps of the procedure that God takes to fulfill His purpose.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
