   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO MAXIMS Concerning Outward Formality</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message I would also like to impress you with two maxims uttered by the Lord Jesus, the first in Matthew 12:30 and the second in Mark 9:40.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 9:40 the Lord says, He who is not against us is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This maxim speaks of outward formality in practice regarding those who are not against the Lord v. 39 . According to verse 38, someone was casting out demons in the name of the Lord Jesus, although he was not following the disciples who were close to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we have a matter of outward formality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both this person and the Lord s disciples were casting out demons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, that one did not follow the Lord in the same way the disciples did.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here we see a difference in formality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The disciples formality was to follow the Lord Jesus, but the formality of this other party was not to follow Him with the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The disciples cast out demons by following the Lord; this other person cast out demons not by following the Lord but by being in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What we have here is a difference in formal practice, a difference in outward formality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning differences in outward formality, we need to be very open.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The person mentioned in verse 38 was casting out demons in the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was right for him to do this, for he was doing the same thing the disciples were doing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likewise, believers today may preach the gospel in a way that is different from our gospel preaching, but both they and we are still preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a matter of outward formality in practice, and we need to be general in our attitude regarding it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Concerning Inward Unity</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second maxim is in Matthew 12:30: He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who is not gathering with Me is scattering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This word concerns inward unity for purpose, and it was spoken regarding those who were against the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In particular, it was spoken concerning the Pharisees, who said, This man does not cast out the demons except by Beelzebub, ruler of the demons Matt 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Pharisees were not one with the Lord Jesus; rather, they were against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead of gathering with Him, they were scattering away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, they were absolutely separated from Him and joined to His enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to see that the maxim in Matthew 12:30 is related to inward unity for purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This maxim surely applies to us today in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because we are here for the recovery, we must be one with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not possible for any among us to say, Even though we are not one with you, we are still for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not believe that someone can be for the Lord s recovery and yet not be one with those who are in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There must be an inward unity for purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With respect to these two maxims, we need to see the difference between practice and purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regarding practice, we need to be general.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But regarding purpose, we need to be particular.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Concerning outward practice, the Lord says, He who is not against us is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But regarding inward unity for purpose, He says, He who is not with Me is against Me.</S>
