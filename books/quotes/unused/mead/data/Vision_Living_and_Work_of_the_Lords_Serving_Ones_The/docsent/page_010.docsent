   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Appropriate Verses concerning Being Saved</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we will consider the most suitable verses to use when speaking about being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first part of Mark 16:16 says, He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can match this verse with Romans 10:13: Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why should we use Mark 16:16 first?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verses 15 and 16 the Lord said, Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Acts 16:31 Paul and Silas said to the jailer in Philippi, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This verse is also very good.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both of these verses are good because they say that the condition for being saved is to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Salvation in these two verses refers to sanctification, forgiveness, cleansing, justification, release, reconciliation, and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 2 Timothy 2:15 Paul says that we should cut straight the word of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Releasing God s word can be compared to a surgeon performing an operation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A surgeon cannot be careless; he must be precise.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Recovery Version of the New Testament the footnote to this verse says that the phrase cutting straight is likened to cutting wood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, to cut straight the word of the truth means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not be confused when we use a verse.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, we need to spend time to learn the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Question: Will Mark 16:16 cause people to misunderstand baptism as a condition for being saved?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Answer: Strictly speaking, in order to be saved, one needs to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If our gospel preaching is powerful enough, a person s salvation will include baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Acts 2:37-38 after the Jews heard the gospel, they were pricked in their heart, and they asked the disciples what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peter said to them, Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, if our gospel preaching is powerful, people will be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Repentance includes baptism because baptism means burial, which is a genuine change of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Question: During one of our visits, we encountered a gospel friend who had a desire to be saved, but because of the confusion in Christianity and the undesirable behavior of some Christians, he was hesitant.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In his thought he could be saved only after he understood the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even though we read Romans 10:13 and Mark 16:16, because of the poor behavior of many Christians, he questioned this salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We attempted to differentiate between being saved and overcoming, but he could not accept our explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not know how to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Answer: The question posed by this gospel friend cannot be solved with just one appropriate verse.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, we can use the following illustration to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A baby needs to be in the womb for nine months before it is born.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before a baby is born, we do not whether he will grow up to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, if a few days after birth a baby dies because of an illness, we cannot say that his birth was false.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Death is a result of inadequate care after the baby was born.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, Christians who are genuinely saved but lack care might have inappropriate behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some people are indeed saved; however, after being saved, they remain like babies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When a baby is conceived, it does not know anything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even after it is born, it still does not know much.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, after it is born, its life has the capacity to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are regenerated through God s word and of God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Regeneration is not based on our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, one is regenerated because he receives God s life with its life element.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After being regenerated, a person has the capacity to know and learn all things related to the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This situation shows that when you preach the gospel, not only must you be clear concerning the truth; you also need to be equipped with examples based on the truth so that you can give an illustration to help people.</S>
