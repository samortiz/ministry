   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD, THE DEVIL, AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is life?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 1:4 says that in Him is life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First John says that he who has the Son has life 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we come into contact with God, we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Life is versus death, in the same way that God is versus the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the whole Bible, there are only these three things: God, the devil, and man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These three things stand as three separate entities.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When man contacts God, there is life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When man contacts the devil, there is death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything with God is real, and nothing is false.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everything with Satan is unreal; he pretends to be good, and he pretends to give knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A man may be touching something that he considers good, but within that something is death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What did man touch in the garden of Eden?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He touched the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The result was that he received Satan into his being, and he became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Satan is the evil one, the one who holds the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The meaning of the fall is that Satan entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The meaning of salvation is that Satan is driven out and God has entered in. Ephesians 2 says that within the unbelievers there is the operation of the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ said once that we were of our father, and our father was Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why some people say that those who gamble are "gambling-demons," and those who take opium are "opium-demons."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a man sins many times, eventually the devil is lived out of that man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you go into the casino, the people you see do not look like human beings; everyone looks like a devil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before a man is saved, it is the devil that is living in him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such ones may be honest on the outside, but they are deceitful on the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Who is inside of them?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the devil who is inside of them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many times, a person cannot control himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is because Satan is living within him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Man has been mingled with the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now man has become very complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Within us, it seems that there are three persons: God, Satan, and man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You are like a little garden of Eden, and you are standing before two trees.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are saying all these things to show you that today the garden of Eden is within you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These two trees are within you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THREE KINDS OF LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is your attitude toward the knowledge of good and evil today?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christianity today has degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All that the ones there know is that evil is death; they do not know that good is also death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They do not know these two trees.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, a brother may become angry with his wife in the evening, and he may beat his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you see this, you will say that he is an evil person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The next morning, he may become humble, and you will say that he is a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the afternoon, he may fellowship with the Lord and live in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When you see him, you will sense that he is neither an evil man nor a good man, but a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why do you have such a sense?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is because with him, there is the taste of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This man has allowed God to rule over him and to live out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I hate two kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first is the proud ones, and the second is the falsely humble ones.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Perhaps the second kind is worse than the first kind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Notwithstanding, whether a person is humble or proud, our question is this: Which tree is his source?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In God's eyes, knowledge, good, and evil are all death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Very few people can discern this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With some people, a person does not sense any good or evil in them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He only senses the taste of God in them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are persons living in God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They do not know what is good and what is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They do not know what it is to be proud and what it is to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They are people who live in life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Suppose you see a brother loving others, and you ask him why he loves.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If he says that the Bible tells us to do so, it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If he says that God tells him to do so, it is right.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The question today is whether we are living in God's tree of life, or in something else.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Prayer: May the Lord work into our being the words released tonight, so that we become enlightened within, and so that the eyes of our heart may be opened.</S>
