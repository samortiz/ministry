Christ&#8217;s keeping of the law qualified Him to fulfill the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross. Christ&#8217;s fulfilling of the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross brought in the resurrection life to complement the law, to fill the law to the full. The old law, the lower law, with the demand that it be kept and the requirement that man be punished, is over. The kingdom people, as the children of the Father, now need to fulfill only the new law, the higher law, by the resurrection life, which is the eternal life of the Father. The old law was given through Moses, whereas the new law was decreed by Christ personally.</p><p>Concerning the law there are two aspects: the commandments of the law and the principle of the law. The commandments of the law were fulfilled and complemented by the Lord&#8217;s coming, whereas the principle of the law was replaced by the principle of faith according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy.</p><p>18<sup>1</sup> After the millennial kingdom the old heaven and old earth will pass away when the new heaven and new earth come in (Rev. 21:1; Heb. 1:11-12; 2 Pet. 3:10-13). What is covered by the law extends only to the end of the millennial kingdom, whereas what is covered by the prophets extends to the new heaven and new earth (Isa. 65:17; 66:22). This is why both the law and the prophets are referred to in v. 17, but only the law, not the prophets, is mentioned in v. 18.</p><p>19<sup>1</sup> Commandments here refers to the law in v. 18. The kingdom people not only fulfill the law but also complement it....</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>We come [now] to the third section of the King&#8217;s word on the mountain, 5:17-48, which concerns the law of the people of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>Before Christ came, there was the law with the strengthening through the prophets. Why then was there still the need for the law of the kingdom of the heavens? The reason is that the demands of the old law were not high enough. The requirements of the old law were not complete. Take the example of murder. The old law commanded us not to murder (Exo. 20:13), but it did not say a word about anger.... Here we see the shortage, the incompleteness, of the old law....According to the law of the kingdom of the heavens, we are forbidden to be angry with our brothers [vv. 21-22]. Thus, the basic principle of the [new] law...is that it is higher than the old law. We do not annul the old law; we complement it to make it higher.</p><p>[Christ&#8217;s] resurrection life is much higher than the natural life, for it is actually the divine life, the eternal life, the life on the highest plane. This highest life within us can fulfill the requirements of the highest law.
