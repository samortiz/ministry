<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. Not Speaking against the Brothers<br>by Keeping the Law</H2><P>James told us not to speak against the brothers by keeping the law (4:11-12). But Paul said that he lived no longer to the law and that he was not in debt to the law (Rom. 7:6; Gal. 2:19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. Confiding Not in Self-will but in the Lord</H2><P>We should confide not in our self-will but in the Lord (James 4:13-17). This can only be carried out by the new man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. Awaiting the Lord's Coming<br>with Long-suffering</H2><P>James exhorted us to await the Lord's coming with long-suffering (5:7-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>O. Taking the Prophets and Job as Examples<br>in Suffering Evil with Endurance</H2><P>James also told us to take the prophets and Job as examples in suffering evil with endurance (5:10-11). But at Job's time there was no new man. Here we can see the mixture in James.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>P. Speaking Honestly without Swearing</H2><P>James 5:12 tells us to speak honestly without swearing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Q. Praying according to the Example of Elijah</H2><P>James 5:13-18 speaks of praying according to the example of Elijah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>R. Turning Back the Brother<br>Led Astray from the Truth</H2><P>Finally, James tells us to turn back the brother led astray from the truth (5:19-20). All of the above items are the virtues of Christian perfection stressed by James.</P>
