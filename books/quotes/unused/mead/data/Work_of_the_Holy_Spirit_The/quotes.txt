[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in a training in Altadena, California in the summer of 1963.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 7:37-39; Luke 24:49; Acts 1:5, 8; John 20:22; 14:16-17; Rom 8:2; Eph 1:13-14; 4:30; 1 John 2:20, 27, 1; John 14:26; 15:26; 16:7
[4]  THE APPLICATION OF THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT With the Lord Jesus
[5]  We may now apply the principle of the two aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit.
[6]  Before He came out to work for God at the age of thirty, He was already filled with the Holy Spirit.
[7]  However, it was at the time of His baptism in water that the heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit came upon Him as a dove Matt 3:16 .
[8]  This promise concerning the coming of the Holy Spirit in chapters fourteen and sixteen was not fulfilled on the day of Pentecost but in the evening of the day of resurrection, in chapter twenty, when the Lord came to them with the Spirit, breathed into them, and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit."
[9]  Now we must see what the Spirit is to us when He comes into us.
[10]  As we have seen, He is the Spirit of life to be life to us Rom 8:2 .
[11]  CHAPTER TWO THE INWARD AND OUTWARD FILLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:13; Acts 2:2, 4; 13:52; Eph 5:18; Luke 1:15, 41, 67; Acts 4:8, 31; 9:17; 13:9; Luke 4:1; Acts 6:3, 5; 7:55; 11:24; 8:15-17; 10:44-47; 19:2, 6; Eph 1:13-14; Acts 1:5; 11:15-17 TWO ASPECTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[12]  As we saw in the previous chapter, the work of the Holy Spirit is of two aspects: the inward aspect and the outward aspect.
[13]  The other aspect is that the Holy Spirit comes upon us as power to empower us, to endow us with power, that we may be powerful and prevailing in the Lord's service.
[14]  The two aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit can be seen in 1 Corinthians 12:13, which says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit."
[15]  To be baptized in one Spirit is one aspect, and to drink one Spirit is the other aspect.
[16]  We may have the inward aspect of the Spirit regeneration, indwelling, and infilling but we may not have the outward aspect of the Spirit.
[17]  By all these verses we can be clear about the two kinds of filling: the inward filling and the outward filling.
[18]  The Lord Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit, so we must believe that He was filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit.
[19]  However, at the age of thirty, before He came out to minister, He was baptized in the water, and the Holy Spirit came down upon Him as a dove.
[20]  Now we must see the way to be filled.
[21]  We have the Holy Spirit dwelling within us; now it is a matter of whether or not we give Him the room within us.
[22]  The more we love the Lord and the more we give Him the room in us, the more the Holy Spirit will fill us.
[23]  Today we may feel that we are filled with the Holy Spirit within, but tomorrow we may realize that we are not yet filled; there is still some part not filled.
[24]  We have seen clearly from the teachings of the Scriptures that the work of the Holy Spirit is of two different aspects.
[25]  Moreover, we must know that the Holy Spirit as life dwells within us to be the Spirit of life, the Spirit of reality, the seal which seals us as the inheritance of God, and the pledge to guarantee that all that God is and God has is our portion.
[26]  POWER, RELEASE, AND GIFTS AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT
[27]  Each of the nine gifts in 1 Corinthians 12:7-10 is a different manifestation of the Holy Spirit upon us.
[28]  This does not mean that if we do not have one of these nine gifts, we do not have the Holy Spirit upon us.
[29]  We may have the Holy Spirit coming down upon us as power, yet we may not have any of these nine gifts.
[30]  THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT IN THE FIVE CASES IN ACTS
[31]  We may now come back to the five cases of receiving the Spirit outwardly in the book of Acts.
[32]  THE NEED FOR A COMPLETE EXPERIENCE OF THE SPIRIT
[33]  As Christians we must experience the Holy Spirit in regeneration, infilling, power, and gifts.
[34]  The experience of the baptism of the Holy Spirit is the last item of the experience of the Spirit.
[35]  On the one hand, we must be regenerated with the Spirit and filled with the Spirit, and on the other hand, we must be baptized in the Spirit.
[36]  To be baptized in the Spirit means that we are not only filled with the Spirit, but we are absolutely in the Spirit.
[37]  CHAPTER FOUR MANY ASPECTS OF THE MANIFESTATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gal 5:22-25; Eph 4:2; Col 3:12; 2 Pet 1:5-6; Rom 14:17; Eph 5:9; 4:24; Matt 5:5-6, 8-9; 1 Cor 12:4-10, 28; Mark 16:17-18; Heb 2:4; Acts 2:16-18, 4-11; 10:44-46; 19:6
[38]  It is easy to realize how the Holy Spirit is life to us in our spirit, but it is more complicated to realize how the Spirit is upon us as power.
[39]  The eighth item in Galatians 5, for example, is meekness, which in the Greek text is prautes.
[40]  To be sure, this is an aspect of the manifestation of the Holy Spirit upon us as power; if someone casts out demons, he must be in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[41]  It is needless to say that if we do not have speaking in tongues, we can still have the manifestation of the Holy Spirit; even if we have none of those nine items, we still can have the manifestation of the Holy Spirit.
[42]  With regard to speaking in tongues, some may refer to the cases of the day of Pentecost, the house of Cornelius, and the twelve Ephesian believers.
[43]  This verse says, "And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues, even as the Spirit gave to them to speak forth."
[44]  In 1 Corinthians 12:30 Paul asks, "Do all speak in tongues?"
[45]  CARING ONLY FOR THE REAL AND GENUINE EXPERIENCE OF THE SPIRIT
[46]  Many Pentecostals, although they insist that everyone must speak in tongues and that they themselves speak in tongues, doubt in their own heart whether they actually speak in tongues.
[47]  NOT BEING INFLUENCED BY OUR BACKGROUND, TEACHINGS, OR MENTALITY
[48]  Some have said that they cannot prove that their speaking in tongues is genuine and real.
[49]  CHAPTER FIVE THE WAY TO EXPERIENCE THE INFILLING AND OUTPOURING OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Acts 2:37-38, 33; Gal 5:16-25; Acts 5:32
[50]  As Christians we all believe that we have the remission of sins, but are we sure that we also have the gift of the Holy Spirit, including the baptism, the outpouring, of the Spirit?
[51]  The Holy Spirit Being a Gift Already Given to Us
[52]  By His crucifixion Christ bore our sins and redeemed us from sins; by His resurrection He imparted the Spirit of life into us; and by His ascension He poured down the Spirit of power upon His Body, including all of us as His members.
[53]  The Spirit in this passage is the Spirit of life, who brings forth the fruit of life from within us.
[54]  This portion of the Word tells us that we have this Spirit already; what we need is to walk by the Spirit.
[55]  We have the Spirit, but we need to apply the Spirit, and the only way to apply the Spirit of life within us and let Him fill us is to apply the cross to our soulish life.
[56]  Apparently, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is hard to experience, but in actuality it is very easy.
[57]  A TESTIMONY OF THE EXPERIENCE OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[58]  I can personally testify of the experience of the outpouring of the Spirit.
[59]  CHAPTER SIX THE MINGLING OF THE OUTWARD AND INWARD WORK OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:28-30; 14:39
[60]  The experiences of the Holy Spirit as life within and as power without are different aspects of our experience, but they are the work of the same one Spirit, not two Spirits.
[61]  According to the New Testament, the one Spirit works upon us, with us, and in us in different steps.
[62]  In the first step, the Holy Spirit comes in to regenerate us, and as the last step, the Holy Spirit comes upon us to be power.
[63]  Let us pray that we all will be brought to the point that we have the infilling and the outpouring.
[64]  May we pray in this way that we may be enabled to realize how much we need the Holy Spirit within and without, for life and for power.
[65]  What I have spoken in these messages is the compilation of many good teachings of the past, including those of the Brethren, the mystics such as Madame Guyon and Father Fenelon, and the inner life teachers such as Mr. Stockmayer, F. B. Meyer, Andrew Murray, and Mrs. Penn-Lewis.
[66]  I have studied the subject of the work of the Holy Spirit for more than thirty years, and I have the full assurance that our attitude is the moderate and right one.
