   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE LIVE CHRIST ONLY Scripture Reading: Col 2:6, 8; Gal 5:4; John 5:39-40 THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's purpose is to work Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is God's very embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To have Christ within is to have God as life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the first two chapters of Genesis reveal, man was created to be God's vessel, containing God Himself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man, however, fell by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Had man partaken of the tree of life, he would have received life in its simplicity and purity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The tree of knowledge, in contrast, is complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Knowledge, good, and evil all pertain to this tree.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Knowledge and the good are commendable, even necessary, in the eyes of society.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of course, evil is to be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From childhood we have lived by knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have pursued it since kindergarten, right through elementary school, high school, and college.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even a university degree is not sufficient; we must go on for an advanced degree.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps even a doctor's degree will not satisfy us; we still continue our study and research.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Knowledge, we are assured, is our future.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without knowledge, we would be of a lower class of people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Human society lives by knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The good is also prized by society.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We appreciate high ethical standards.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Oriental peoples especially esteem humility.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We take pride in giving in to others and consider that this is the highest virtue of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are pleased to offer others our seat while we stand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We greet each other by bowing low.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Westerners seem to us less civilized.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They sit down without a thought as to where others will sit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They stand straight and look directly at each other when they meet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They keep whatever is theirs; it would not occur to them to offer it to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Oriental culture is surely superior to the Western!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Oriental peoples are more deeply into the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This can be seen by their more highly developed culture.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE BASIS OF SOCIETY</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Human society is formed of these three elements: knowledge, good, and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These three are in the same category, though society condemns only the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In essence, culture is the development of knowledge and of the good.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Its constituents are science, philosophy, religion, and law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The universities may offer a great number of courses, but all of them are promoting one of these four constituents of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Any country which is strong in science, philosophy, religion, and law is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Imagine a country where these are lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Science and philosophy lead to advances in knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Religion defines what is good and sets up a moral code.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Law restrains man from his evil, wild desires.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A country without these four would be full of robbers; its people would be like beasts.</S>
