<H1 CLASS=TITLE>QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(7)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue Nos. 13, 14</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GIFTS AND TITLES</H2><P>Question:Apostles and pastors are both gifts. But can I say that the word "apostle" can be used as a title also, because the apostles are "ordained"? (Lee, Kiangsu)</P><P>Answer:Yes. The fact that among all the gifts in the church, the apostles are the only ones who are "ordained" makes the apostleship a gift as well as an office. The pastors, however, are different.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BARNABAS</H2><P>Question:Why was Barnabas also called an apostle in Acts 14:14? (Lee, Kiangsu)</P><P>Answer:The word apostle in the original language means a sent one. Paul and Barnabas were both sent by the Holy Spirit to preach the word (13:2). As such, they were apostles (14:14), that is, they were sent ones. The place held by the twelve apostles was not something absolute; Judas could lose his place, and Matthias could take Judas's place. Paul was not one of the twelve. In spite of this, the apostles are the most important kind of people. There are no more apostles now. Only their teachings are left in the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EXTENT OF THE CHURCH'S AUTHORITY</H2><P>Question:According to Acts 15, it seems that churches in other places were keeping the decrees established by the church in Jerusalem. It seems that there is some kind of control here. (Lee)</P><P>Answer:The Bible does not have such a thing as a federated great church. At the time of the apostles, there was no such thing as the local churches in all the places being joined together to conform to the ordinances of one headquarters church. The Holy Spirit has guarded against this; He does not want any head church. As a result, in the apostles' work, the center was in Antioch, and not in Jerusalem. Paul and Timothy did not commit to the disciples the decree of "the church in Jerusalem." Rather, they committed to them the decree established by "the apostles and elders in Jerusalem." Actually, the decree was established by "the Holy Spirit and...us [the apostles and elders]" (15:28). This is why all the churches have the common responsibility to keep it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COMMANDMENT</H2><P>Question: Does the commandment in Matthew 5:19 refer to the words in Matthew 5:1-12? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: Yes. One thing is certain: The commandment here does not refer to the Ten Commandments. The law in verse 17 is related to the prophets. Hence, it does not refer to the Ten Commandments. The law and the prophets constitute the whole Old Testament. Those brothers who honor the law so much think that the law mentioned in verse 18 refers to the Ten Commandments. But when the Lord went on to expound what He was saying previously, we see that verses 21 and 27 are both in the Ten Commandments, whereas verses 31, 32, 38, and 43 do not come from the laws in the Ten Commandments, but from the books of the law. Hence, the law in verse 18, like the law in verse 17, refers to the books of the law. Since the law in verse 18 does not refer to the law of the Ten Commandments, the law following that in verse 19 should not be the laws of the Ten Commandments either. What the Lord Jesus is saying in verses 17 and 18 is that the prophecies in the Old Testament will not fail, that they will all be fulfilled. The significance of verse 20 is related to the law. To keep the law is to receive the righteousness that grants one an entrance into the kingdom of the heavens; it is to keep the words of verses 1 to 12 and the words of chapters five, six, and seven. Hence, the law here refers to the teachings on the Mount.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE END OF THE AGE</H2><P>Question: Will the work in Matthew 13:40-43 be performed at the time when the Lord descends to earth with His saints? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: Not completely. The sowing is the Lord's first coming. The harvest is the rapture of the saints. Verses 41 to 43 concern something that takes place when the Lord comes back to earth with His saints.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TORTURERS</H2><P>Question: Who are the torturers in Matthew 18:34? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: I believe it is Satan. This passage and 1 Corinthians 5:5 mean the same thing.</P>
