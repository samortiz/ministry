   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 3:4; Col 1:27; Eph 3:6; Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 12:12; Eph 1:23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we want to see the fourth great mystery in the Bible the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, before we fellowship about the mystery of Christ, I feel that I have the responsibility to fellowship in detail with you the truth concerning the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is only when we see this truth that we can enter into the subjective experience of Christ and live out the mystery of Christ, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This truth is neglected by Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The mystery of Christ is the church; the content and expression of Christ are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we have only the objective knowledge but not the subjective experience of Christ, this mystery will become an empty doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Dear brothers and sisters, we cannot be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to fellowship about this truth, I cannot avoid referring to certain things in our "family history" which can serve as a background and provide a contrast to this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"THOU, LORD, THE FATHER ONCE WAST CALLED, BUT NOW THE HOLY SPIRIT ART"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I started to correspond with Brother Nee in 1925.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1932, Brother Nee went to my hometown to hold a special conference, and we started to have face-to-face contact.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the following year, I left my work, and he wrote me a letter which confirmed my leaving my job to serve the Lord full time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, after I left my job, I went to Shanghai particularly to see him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the beginning of 1933, we began to work together until the political situation in mainland China changed in 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that time, he called an emergency co-workers' meeting to decide on how to cope with the changes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Two times in the co-workers' meetings he suggested that I leave mainland China and go overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, in April or May of 1949 I went to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The following year Brother Nee went to Hong Kong and brought in a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then he wanted me to go there to arrange all the church services of the co-workers, elders, and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After staying there for one and a half months, I returned to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just before I left for Taiwan, Brother Nee went back to mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 1952 he was put into prison, and after twenty years of imprisonment he was taken by the Lord in 1972.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I worked with Brother Nee for almost twenty years and had a very close relationship with him in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We had much time together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He and I never engaged in any idle talk; we always talked about the truth and the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I knew the burden within his heart for the Lord, his view concerning the church, and his way of carrying out the work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Nee absolutely believed that the Triune God is simply Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hymns, #490 was written by Brother Nee himself, and two lines of the hymn say, "Thou, Lord, the Father once wast called, / But now the Holy Spirit art."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This hymn was first printed in Shanghai and was included in the hymnal with 1,052 selections that Brother Nee had published before he went into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the end of 1933, a certain Mr. Hsueh, who was a Chinese traveling preacher from the China Inland Mission, was invited to speak in our meeting in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He said, "Never think that the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, and the Spirit is the Spirit, and that the three are separated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Never think that the Lord Jesus is not the Holy Spirit; the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit Himself."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brother Nee was sitting at the back listening.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Brother Hsueh mentioned this point, Brother Nee responded far from the back, "Amen!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even we who were seated in front heard it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After the meeting when he and I were strolling together, he said, "We all must see that the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Beginning with Brother Nee up until now, the belief among us concerning the Triune God is that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one and not separated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 1954 I was invited by the church in Hong Kong to hold a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For at least seven days, I spoke with much emphasis on this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every time after I spoke, the brother who accompanied me on the platform prayed to conclude the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His prayer completely confirmed what I spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The emphasis of my speaking was that the Triune God had become the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I also especially selected some hymns in this category for the congregation to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, after Brother Nee was imprisoned, that brother who had accompanied me changed and said that this was heresy, thereby stirring up contention, which eventually led to division.</S>
