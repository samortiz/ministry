   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the High Priest, Judging and Purifying the Churches and Holding the Messengers of the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the divine administration Christ is also the High Priest, judging and purifying the churches and holding the messengers of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Revelation 1:13 says, "In the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here Christ is depicted as the High Priest, as shown by His garment, a priestly robe reaching to the feet, signifying the fullness of His divine attributes and human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 14 says that His eyes are as a "flame of fire."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This fire is for divine judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the main significance of the Lord's eyes being as a flame of fire is for His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, verse 15 says, "His feet were like shining brass, as having been fired in a furnace."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here the feet signify the walk.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ's feet being like shining brass indicates that His perfect and bright walk qualifies Him to exercise divine judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, in the divine administration Christ is judging the churches and purifying them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Revelation 1:16, 20 and 2:1 indicate that, as the High Priest, Christ is holding the messengers of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These messengers are signified by the seven stars in His right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The messengers of the churches are the spiritual ones in the churches bearing the responsibility of the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They should be of the heavenly nature and in a heavenly position like stars.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Revelation 2:12 says that Christ "has the sharp two-edged sword," and 2:18, that He "has eyes as a flame of fire, and His feet like shining brass."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In dealing with the church in Pergamos, the worldly church, Christ refers to Himself as the One who has the sharp two-edged sword.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In dealing with the church in Thyatira, the apostate church, He refers to Himself as the One who has eyes as a flame of fire and whose feet are like shining brass.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The worldly church requires the dealing of His smiting and killing word, whereas the apostate church needs the judging of His searching eyes and treading feet.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today in the recovery Christ, the High Priest in the divine administration, is not only building up the churches in different localities but also judging and purifying them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is also holding the responsible ones, the faithful ones, who are bearing the burden of His testimony on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We trust in Him and look to Him for His continued purifying and holding so that we all may go on in a pure way.</S>
