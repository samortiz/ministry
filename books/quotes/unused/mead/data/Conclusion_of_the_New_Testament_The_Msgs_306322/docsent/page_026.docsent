   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 To Replace the First Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Bible there is a principle that the second always replaces the first Gen 17:18-19; 25:23; 48:18-19; 1 Sam 16:1; 2 Sam 12:14, 24-25; Rom 9:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This principle is indicated by 1 Corinthians 15:46: The spiritual is not first but the soulish, then the spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The spiritual here denotes Christ the second man; the soulish denotes Adam, the first man v. 47 . According to human understanding, tradition, and practice, we should follow the one who is first, not the one who is second.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this reason, Paul deliberately says in this verse that the soulish and not the spiritual is the first; the spiritual is the second.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we take the Bible, we should follow the second and not the first.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, we should not follow Cain, the first; we should follow Abel, the second.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, during the passover in Egypt, the firstborn were rejected, condemned, and killed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that God s judgment is upon the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The same principle applies to the first creation and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God does not want what is first; He wants what is second.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, God does not desire the first man; rather, He desires the second man to replace the first man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Last Adam</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Corinthians 15:45 reveals that Christ is the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul ; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>1 To Terminate the First Man</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ being the last Adam implies the termination of the first man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the universe there are only two Adams and two men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first Adam v. 45 is Adam our forefather, and the last Adam is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first man is Adam, and the second man is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The last Adam is the conclusion of Adam, the first man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The last of anything is the termination of that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, the last Adam is the end of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a man, He ended the Adamic race; Adam is terminated in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first Adam is the beginning of mankind; the last Adam is the ending.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The last Adam indicates an ending, and the second man indicates a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ being the last Adam means that He terminated Adam, whereas Christ being the second man indicates that He is a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We were all in Adam, and we were all terminated in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we are in the second man, and we are in the new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be terminated is to be crucified; to be in the new beginning is to be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are in Christ as the last Adam; we have been terminated in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are also in Christ as the second man; we have a new beginning in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the last Adam, He ended the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When He was crucified, our old man was crucified with Him Rom 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His death as the last Adam was for God s dealing with our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the end of the old man, He crucified the old man and terminated the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The old man is the representative, the center, of the old creation; hence, by destroying the old man Christ terminated the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>2 To Become a Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ, the last Adam, became in resurrection a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to 1 Corinthians 15:45, the first man, Adam, became a living soul, and the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This verse implies both the old creation with the soul as the center and the new creation with the Spirit as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Adam, the first man, was the head of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When God created him, Adam became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that he became a person, a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Hebrew Adam means man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ being the last Adam implies a termination and conclusion of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The old creation ends with a man, the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This man who terminated the old creation became in resurrection a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now the Spirit is the center and lifeline of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The old creation was created by God, whereas the new creation comes into being not by creation but by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, verse 45 implies two creations: the old creation with man, a living soul, as its center and the new creation in resurrection with the life-giving Spirit as its center.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Through incarnation Christ became the last Adam to die on the cross for the termination of the old creation, and through resurrection He as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit to germinate the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The life-giving Spirit is the reality and life pulse of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Resurrection was a process to bring forth the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through the process of resurrection, the last Adam, the man who ended the old creation, became the life-giving Spirit, the germinating element of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The life-giving Spirit is the essence to germinate a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This Spirit is nothing less than Christ, the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Actually, the life-giving Spirit is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Christ God has passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now in resurrection He is the life-essence to germinate the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have become the new creation germinated by the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The last Adam was Jesus Christ in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As a man in the flesh, He was the Lamb of God who took away our sins John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Furthermore, when He was crucified, He dealt with our natural life and our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This made it possible for us to receive the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After dying on the cross, the last Adam, our Redeemer, became in resurrection the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As the life-giving Spirit, He is the life-dispensing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now He is the Spirit who gives life, the Spirit who imparts life to us, the Spirit who dispenses Himself as life into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When Christ came through incarnation, He came with the Father and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After coming in incarnation, He took a further step to pass through death and enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the process that we call Christ s transfiguration from the flesh into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>By going through this process of transfiguration, the Lord Jesus, who came in incarnation with the Father and by the Spirit, became the life-giving Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This transfiguration included a number of elements: humanity, human living, Christ s all-inclusive death, and His life-imparting resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All these elements have been brought into the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Furthermore, the life-giving Spirit is the totality of all that Christ is as the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>First Corinthians unveils that the Christ who is the portion of all believers and into whose fellowship we have been called 1:2, 9 is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He is God s power and God s wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>24, 30 ; our glory for our glorification 2:7 , hence, the Lord of glory v. 8 ; the depths of God v. 10 ; the unique foundation of God s building 3:11 ; our Passover 5:7 ; the unleavened bread v. 8 ; the spiritual food and the spiritual drink flowing out the spiritual rock 10:3-4 ; the Head 11:3 and the Body 12:12 ; the firstfruits 15:20, 23 ; the second Man v. 47 ; and the last Adam v. 45 . As such an all-inclusive One, He is now the life-giving Spirit, the totality of all that He is for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
