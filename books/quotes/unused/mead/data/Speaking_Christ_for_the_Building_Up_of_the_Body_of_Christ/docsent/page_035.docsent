   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN HOW TO TAKE CARE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND SMALL GROUP MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Acts 2:46-47; 5:42</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter we want to see how to take care of the home meetings and small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AVOIDING THE PREACHING OR TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>OF THE PASTOR OR PREACHER TYPE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we attend a home meeting or a small group meeting, we should avoid the preaching or teaching of the pastor or preacher type.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that we should not behave ourselves as a preacher or a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do not make your preaching in the type of a preacher, and do not make your teaching in the type of a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we go to the home meetings, we should be only in the type of what we are, that is, a brother or a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not easy for a person who has been a preacher or a pastor for a number of years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When this person speaks, he may have the tone of a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Among the preachers in Christianity there are different types.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Baptists, Presbyterians, and Episcopalians have different types of preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever a Pentecostal preacher speaks, he does not need to tell others that he is a Pentecostal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His way of speaking and his tone make it clear that he is a Pentecostal preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Lord s recovery all of us have to be common Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are simply brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>AVOIDING ACTIVITY OF THE LEADER TYPE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The leader type is mainly among us in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Basically speaking, we do not have the pastor or preacher type, but we do have the leader type.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When certain brothers speak in the meetings, most of us realize that they are leaders in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a brother is in the leadership for a certain amount of time, he may build up a type.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is also possible for us to speak in the type of our national or cultural background.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A Chinese, Japanese, or Korean brother may speak in the type of China, Japan, or Korea.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We in the Lord s recovery must learn to come out of all kinds of types.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to speak only as a brother or a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not Doing Everything in the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>but Leading the New Ones</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>to Partake of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the home meetings and small group meetings, we must learn the skill not to do everything in the meeting but to lead the new ones to partake of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to be consulting persons when we go to the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The new ones need to be impressed that the meeting in their home is their meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should tell them that it is not our meeting and that we are not coming to hold our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are coming to help them have their meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we go into someone else s home and the family does not know how to cook, we must remember that the kitchen is not ours.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not cook for them, but we should teach them how to cook.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should help them to do all the cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we feel that we are the experts, we may not allow anyone to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, we may do everything for everybody.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The daughter of a mother who is an expert in cooking may not know how to cook well because she has been replaced by her mother.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since the mother is an expert in cooking, she may not let the daughter cook that much.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the leader type.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The leader type does everything for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the practical service of the church, the leader type may not allow anyone else to clean the restrooms or vacuum the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His attitude is You don t know how to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I know, so let me do it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These leaders do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In everything, they are the experts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To them, the others do not know how to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only they know how.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Others among us, instead of being leaders, are managers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They take the pretense that they are the overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They are the superintendents watching how others do things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have two concerns about your going to the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One concern is that you will go in the type of a leader, and the other concern is that you will go in the type of a manager.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Both are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If both of these types are wrong, how should we behave ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It seems that if we do anything, it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It also seems that if we do not do anything, that is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we speak, we speak wrongly.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do not speak, that is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since this is the case, we may feel that we do not need to go to the home meetings or small group gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But to do this is even more wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ has dealt with all the negative things on the cross, and through His death on the cross, He has released the divine life within Him into us so that we could become His many members which constitute His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we are experiencing the cross, nothing of us remains.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whatever we have, whatever we are, whatever we can do, and whatever we have accomplished should all go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Nothing of us should be left.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The cross takes away everything negative and releases the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we go to a home meeting or a small group meeting, we should hold an attitude that everything of us should be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Only one thing should be released through us and out of us the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I do not mean that we should not act or do anything in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But we should not do anything in our natural way, by our natural life, and with our natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should be in fear and trembling that we would offend the Lord by doing anything with our natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Anything that is natural, that is not holy or separated, and anything that we do by our natural strength should be crossed out.</S>
