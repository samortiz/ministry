<div class='line'>Open to Jesus-He is all you need.</div>
<div class='line'>He fed the thousands, now He'll feed you.</div>
<div class='line'>Just open your mouth and take Him in-</div>
<div class='line'>That's all you have to do.</div>

<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>We've found that calling on Jesus fills us within.</div>
<div class='line'>He came as food, so now we take Him in.</div>
<div class='line'>No doctrines or forms that you have to learn</div>

<div class='line'><b>2</b> If you are thirsty, He's heard your cry.</div>
<div class='line'>He is a fountain that will not run dry.</div>
<div class='line'>He's quenching our longings, we're satisfied,</div>
<div class='line'>Just eating and drinking the risen Lord!</div>
<div class='line'>Yes, that is why He died;</div>
</div>
<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>So He could become the Spirit, get into us,</div>
<div class='line'>Fill all our being-Oh, how glorious!</div>
<div class='line'>It's really so simple-just take and eat;</div>
<div class='line'>That's all you have to do.</div>
