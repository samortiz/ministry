THE LEPER WHO WAS TO BE CLEANSED NEEDING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF HIS SIN AND SINS BEFORE GOD</h2><p>In 14:10-32 we see that the leper who was to be cleansed needed to solve the problem of his sin and sins before God. This signifies that a sinner who is to be cleansed, even though he has been cleansed, still needs to solve the problem of his sin and sins before God. This means that the sinner needs propitiation.<h2 class=head2>A. Presenting the Offerings before God on the Eighth Day</h2><p>Presenting the offerings before God on the eighth day (vv. 10-11) signifies that man is freed in Christ in resurrection from the flesh of the old creation.<h2 class=head3>1. Offering One of the Male Lambs for a Trespass Offering, with the Log of Oil, Both of Which Were Waved for a Wave Offering before Jehovah</h2><p>&#8220;The priest shall take one of the male lambs and offer it for a trespass offering, with the log of oil, and he shall wave them as a wave offering before Jehovah&#8221; (v. 12). Here &#8220;log,&#8221; a Hebrew term, denotes a certain quantity (a pint) of oil, which signifies the Holy Spirit. &#8220;Wave&#8221; here signifies resurrection. A wave offering is an offering of resurrection and in resurrection. Therefore, offering one of the male lambs for a trespass offering, with the log of oil, both of which were waved before Jehovah, signifies that the death of the Lord Jesus as the trespass offering deals with our sins, and His resurrection in the Holy Spirit frees us from our trespasses, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness.<h2 class=head3>2. The Male Lamb as the Trespass Offering to Be Slaughtered in the Holy Place Where the Sin Offering and the Burnt Offering Were Slaughtered</h2><p>&#8220;He shall slaughter the male lamb in the place where the sin offering and the burnt offering are slaughtered, in the holy place&#8221; (v. 13a). The holy place here is not the holy place in the tabernacle, but the area at the entrance of the tent of meeting where the animals were slaughtered, which was considered holy. Slaughtering the trespass offering in this place signifies that the Lord Jesus&#8217; being able to deal with our sins is based on His bearing our sin as our sin offering and on His living absolutely for God as our burnt offering. Christ&#8217;s being the sin offering and the burnt offering is the base for Him to be the trespass offering.<h2 class=head3>3. The Trespass Offering Belonging to the Priest and Being Most Holy</h2><p>&#8220;The trespass offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; it is most holy&#8221; (v. 13b). This signifies that the serving one who leads others to deal with sins also enjoys Christ as his holy portion. For example, when we visit people in their homes and minister Christ to them so that they may be saved, we ourselves enjoy Christ. The Christ who becomes their Savior also becomes our portion for our enjoyment. This means that while we minister Christ to others, we eat Him, enjoying Him as our portion.<h2 class=head3>4. The Blood of the Trespass Offering to Be Put on the Tip of the Right Ear of Him Who Is to Be Cleansed, on the Thumb of His Right Hand, and on the Great Toe of His Right Foot</h2><p>&#8220;The priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot&#8221; (v. 14). This signifies that man has trespasses because, first, his ears are wrong in not listening to God, and second, his hands are wrong in not doing the things of God, and third, his feet are wrong in not taking the ways of God. Therefore, he needs to be cleansed with the blood of the Lord Jesus as his trespass offering.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_143.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_145.html">Next</a> </body></html>
