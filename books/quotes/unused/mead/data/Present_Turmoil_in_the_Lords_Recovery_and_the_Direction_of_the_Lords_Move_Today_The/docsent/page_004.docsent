   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Turmoil among the Lord s People</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the New Testament the Lord Jesus selected twelve of His disciples and appointed them to be apostles Luke 6:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One among the disciples selected by the Lord Jesus was Judas, who also became a betrayer v. 16 . During the apostle Paul s lifetime, the church life passed through turmoils that were full of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have been in the church life since 1932, and I was with Brother Nee for eighteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During those eighteen years with Brother Nee, turmoil came in every five or six years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1949 I went to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From 1949 until 1989 there have been three different times of turmoil, including the present one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The rate has decreased from once every five or six years to once every twelve years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Turmoil is the destiny of the progressing church, the pilgrim church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While the church is journeying on this earth as a corporate pilgrim, it is destined to suffer turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need such turmoil for our purification.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to our point of view, turmoil is not very good, but according to our real situation, turmoil is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we should not expect to remain free from turmoil in the church life all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Acts 20, after Paul had a long talk with the elders of the church in Ephesus, he warned them of fierce wolves who would come in among them, not sparing the flock v. 29 . In verse 30 he said that men would rise up from among them to speak perverted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the past three years, some have risen up among us to speak perverted things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>An article entitled Being Realistic was published in a periodical entitled The Word and the Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The author of this article is John So, and the editors of the periodical are John Ingalls and Bill Mallon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This article insinuates that I am like the Japanese army when it invaded and occupied the Philippines in the Second World War.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This implies that I invaded the church in Anaheim, taking it and possessing it in order to make it the church of Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The article goes on to indicate that the meeting on Ball Road in Anaheim is no longer a local church, because it has lost its ground.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to this article, the ground of the church in Anaheim has become a person Witness Lee and his work and ministry, and it is now occupied by us, just as the site of the temple in Jerusalem is occupied today by the Moslems.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Is this not a perverted word?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In another portion of this article, under the heading The Nicolaitans, I am categorized by innuendo as a Nicolaitan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the way of innuendo, I am also likened to Balaam, who peddled the word of God in order to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This article by John So also likens me to Jezebel, who called herself a prophetess and killed all the prophets of God, making herself the unique oracle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Is this not a perverted word that fulfills Acts 20:30?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE PRESENT TURMOIL IN THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The present turmoil among us can be considered a rebellion, a rebellion with a conspiracy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have been quiet for more than two years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You have probably never heard me speak concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On occasion I have expressed something related to this matter in the elders meetings, but not in a very clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since the ones who initiated this rebellion have made it so obvious, even through the printed page, I feel that after such a long period of silence I should let you know some of the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in this message I will say only a little bit in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For the details in full, see the book entitled The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is published by Living Stream Ministry and is free of charge.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instigated by the Evil One</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Having thoroughly considered during the past two years the things that have happened in the rebellion, I came to the conclusion that this rebellion is the work of the devil, the evil one Matt 13:19 , because nearly everything brought out by the rebellious ones was not logical or reasonable, and some of the ways by which they did things were inhuman.</S>
