   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In 1963 I introduced this hymn to some of the saints in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One day, after we had sung this hymn, a dear saint came to me and said, "I can't understand this hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Breathing, breathing, breathing breathing what?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was somewhat bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A few years later, after we had published our hymnal, this same saint said to me, "Brother, my favorite hymn in the hymnal is that hymn on breathing the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How do we breathe the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We breathe the Lord by opening ourselves to the Lord and calling upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to call out to Him and even cry to Him, for, as Jeremiah has told us, calling on the Lord is to cry out to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He did this out of the low dungeon.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever we are low, that is, down in a "dungeon," we have to call on the Lord by crying out to Him that we may be released from confinement and receive more of the Lord into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Isaiah also tells us that our calling on the Lord is our crying to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid: for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon his name...Sing unto the Lord...Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee" Isa 12:2-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In these verses Isaiah tells us to praise, sing, cry out, and shout.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All of these match the calling mentioned in verse 4.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 2 he says that God is our salvation and our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We simply need to draw water out of the wells of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How can we with joy draw water out of the wells of salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The way is to call on His name, to praise the Lord, to sing a hymn, and to cry out and shout.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 4 we find that praising and calling are put together, and in verse 6 we find that crying and shouting are put together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This proves that to call on the Lord is to cry and shout to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many Christians have never shouted.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you have never shouted before the Lord, I doubt that you could have enjoyed the Lord in a rich way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Try shouting before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you have never shouted about what the Lord is to you, I encourage you to try it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more you shout, "O Lord Jesus, You are so good to me," the more you will be released from your self and be filled with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You will be in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, Isaiah, even in Old Testament times, told people to praise the Lord, call upon His name, cry out and shout.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let me share with you something of my own testimony regarding calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I was raised in the Southern Baptist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After I was saved, due to my seeking after the Word, I stayed for several years with a very strict Brethren assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Their practice was always to be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is no exaggeration to say that even if a needle fell on the floor in their meetings, it would have been heard.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We were trained in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I sat under the feet of these Brethren teachers, listening to their teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I thank the Lord for that.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although I loved the Lord and the Word, I did not receive the proper help of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The only help I received was in understanding the black and white letters of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One day, in August, 1931, while I was walking on the street, the Spirit spoke within me, "Look at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You have so much knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You know the prophecies and the types, but look at how dead you are."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Immediately deep within I was conscious of a thirst and a hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Something within wanted to burst out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, because of my religious background, I would not do that on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I restrained myself, suffering for the remainder of that afternoon, evening, and night, waiting for morning to come, when I would be able to release myself before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>My home was at the foot of a small mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When morning came, I ran to the top of that mountain and released what was on my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I had no intention to shout, but something burst forth from within, saying, "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I spontaneously called on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one taught me to call on the Lord, and I had not seen anything in the Bible regarding it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I simply did it spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although I did not have the terms "enjoying the Lord" and "the release of the spirit," I had the reality of them both.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I did exercise and release my spirit and I certainly enjoyed the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nearly every morning thereafter I went to the top of the mountain, calling on the Lord each time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By calling on the Lord I was filled with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Each morning as I descended from the top of that mountain, I was filled with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I was in the heavens, and the whole earth with everything in it was under my feet.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, due to my background, I never brought this matter into the teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I did not teach others to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Twelve years later, in 1943, I was put into prison by the Japanese army which had invaded China.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One day they were persecuting me and beating me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I could do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Spontaneously I called, "O Lord Jesus," and they stopped beating me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Nevertheless, due to my religious background, I still did not bring it into the daily practice.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I did not realize that we could do it in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Twenty-four years later, in 1967, the matter of calling on the Lord came forth in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At that time I felt the need to verify this matter by studying the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As a result of spending much time in the Word regarding calling on the Lord, I discovered that it was a practice of the saints in ancient times.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It started thousands of years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Using a concordance, I found a great many references to calling on the Lord and I noted the various aspects of calling.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At that time I was confirmed and strengthened not only to practice calling on the Lord, but also to teach others and to help others to call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Since 1967, calling on the Lord has been one of the items in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It was discovered that it was the best way to touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In that same year I visited the Far East and brought this to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I can testify that thousands of saints were released and enriched through calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
