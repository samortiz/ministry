<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>INDIVIDUALLY AND CORPORATELY</H2><P>Not only does every proper local church need to have a wheel beside it, every proper individual believer must also have a wheel. The living creatures have several ways to move. First, they can move by flying because they have the wings of an eagle. They can also move by walking on the calf's hoofs. But these two ways of moving are simply to have an ordinary move. When they need extra power to move in a special way, they must move by a wheel. Suppose on your job you are moving daily by the eagle's wings and the calf's hoofs. Your co-workers can see that you have something powerful which is strengthening you. You are able to bear things that others cannot. You are able to endure things that others cannot because you have the eagle's wings. They also can see that in your character and your behavior, you are honest, straight, frank, and sincere, having no crookedness. In their conscience, they will be convicted and convinced by you. They will see your move in such a way. They will see the eagle's wings and the calf's hoofs upon you.</P><P>But in addition to this kind of move with you, there should be also another kind of move, an extraordinary kind of move, the move of a wheel. After a period of time, some of your co-workers should be caught by the Lord for the church life. The move of the Lord should be with you at your job. This is the move of a wheel. If you should work at a job for one year, two years, three years, or even ten years, and nothing happens, that indicates there is no move of the Lord with you. You are lacking a wheel. If you have the eagle's wings and the calf's hoofs, you should also have a wheel. If there is no wheel with you, probably you do not have the eagle's wings. You have only the human hands. Neither do you have the calf's hoofs; rather, you have the man's crooked feet. It may be that on your job you are not such a proper human being; you are somewhat worldly, and the move of the Lord is not with you.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, wherever you go, you must have a high and dreadful wheel by you. When you move into a city, eventually there should be a wheel in that city. When you move into a country, there should be a wheel in that country. The wheel will prove that you are proper, having the eagle's wings and the calf's hoofs. If you do not have the eagle's wings and the calf's hoofs, you are not qualified to have a wheel standing beside you. If you would have a wheel standing beside you, you must be a proper living creature. You must experience the blowing of the Spirit as a stormy wind from the north. You must experience the overshadowing and remaining of the Spirit as the cloud. You must experience the burning of the Spirit, and you must gain much electrum. Furthermore, you must have the four faces expressing Christ in an adequate way and the eagle's wings by which you can move. You need to have the calf's hoofs to walk in a very straight, sincere way. The result will be that a high and dreadful wheel is beside you. That wheel is the move of the Lord. Consider the Apostle Paul. By reading his writings and by reading the book of Acts, we can realize that the Apostle Paul considered himself less than the least. Even his name, Paul, means little. Paul was a little man, yet with him were the eagle's wings, the calf's hoofs, and also a high and dreadful wheel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WHEELS BEING UPON THE EARTH</H2><P>Let us now consider the wheels in detail. First, it says that the wheels are upon the earth (1:15). Never expect that the move of the Lord will be in the heavens. God needs a move on the earth. God needs a move in the United States, in New Zealand, in Australia, in Africa, and in Europe. He needs a move upon the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF BERYL</H2><P>Furthermore, all the wheels look like beryl (1:16). According to Daniel 10:6, beryl was the appearance of the Lord when He was moving. This reveals that within the move of the wheels is the appearance of the Lord. Wherever the wheel goes, it brings the appearance of the Lord to that place. If a wheel is with you at school or on your job, it will bring the Lord's appearance there. People will be able to see the beryl, the appearance of the Lord.</P>
