<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE OPENING OF GOD'S WORD<br />GIVES LIGHT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 4:12; Psa. 119:130</h1><p>Many Christians have an unusual number of problems. If these were merely outward problems, they would not be that important. But many of these problems point to inward darkness and to the lack of spiritual clarity; one should not treat this lightly. Some situations are necessary for a Christian in the course of spiritual progress. However, a Christian should not allow himself to remain indefinitely in darkness and unclearness. It is not God's will that we should constantly have problems; God does not wish to see us remain in darkness. How then can we become clear spiritually? Let us see what the Word of God tells us.</p><p>Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart." This tells us that when the word of God enters, we will be able to distinguish between what is from the spirit and what is from the soul. We cannot discern the difference by merely asking ourselves inwardly; this will only result in confusion. The more we look inwardly and the more we search ourselves, the more problems will arise and the greater the darkness will become. One question will give rise to ten questions, and ten questions to a hundred questions; the questions will go on. On the other hand, if the word of God enters into us, there will be no need to ask questions; the questions will be gone, and we will become clear. In fact, we will become very clear indeed. For instance, you may meet a man on the street and speak something to him. Although the words may be correct, you feel very uncomfortable afterward. The words were proper and your intention was good, but inwardly you feel otherwise. An hour later you come across a brother and speak to him at length, and the words are helpful to him. This time you feel inwardly satisfied; you feel that a burden has been released and you have rendered a service to God. There is little difference in the words spoken on these two occasions, but there is a great difference in your inward feeling. This difference is very clear to you; it tells you that one is wrong and the other is right. The outward distinction between the two is negligible. Superficially, it seems that the words spoken on both occasions were identical, but inwardly, you perceive a difference. When the word of God is in us, we shall know from within what is from the spirit and what is from the soul. Once we have this inward knowledge, there will be no more questions.</p><p>Psalm 119:130 says, "The opening of Your words gives light, /Imparting understanding to the simple." When the word of God enters into you it gives light; you will become inwardly clear, and you will have assurance. The word of God is not just the written Scripture which you read. It is also necessary for the Spirit of God to make this word living in you. Only the living word is useful, and this word will divide your spirit from your soul. This is not a question of reading a book and finding what way is spiritual and what way is soulish. Even if you follow the way given in the book, the result will still be soulish. But when the word of God enters into you and shines in you, it will separate the soul from the spirit; it will even expose the joints and marrow. You will know what is wrong and what is right. This is an inward knowledge. Such a person will no longer need to ask questions because there is light within him, and he sees from within.</p><p>Some people ask themselves all the time: "Am I living for God or for myself? Is this the will of God or my own?" Indeed, it is extremely difficult for us to distinguish which ideas and opinions are our own because we are very often deceived by our own thoughts and intentions. Nevertheless, as soon as the word of the Lord enters, it sifts through the thoughts and intentions of our hearts and immediately shows us which thoughts are perverse, which thoughts are impractical, which thoughts are selfish, which thoughts come from fear, and which thoughts protect ourselves. Inwardly we will see and become very clear. Self-analysis will not give us light; it will only lead us into self-deception. The more we analyze ourselves, the more we will be deceived and the more the word of God will be hindered from entering into us. When the word of God enters into us, our eyes will be opened, and we will no longer need to ask any questions because we will be able to discern the thoughts and intentions of our heart. Brothers and sisters, whenever we have a problem within, we ought to look to the enlightening of God's word. In this way, we will not be deceived.</p><p>Many of God's children discern right from wrong according to the conscience. However, we should know that the human conscience is still something very shallow. Life is something much deeper than the conscience. Some things often pass the test of the conscience but may not necessarily pass the test of life. Occasionally we do things by way of "trial and error." If our conscience is clear after we have done something, we thank God for it, and if our conscience is guilty, we ask God for forgiveness. We have to wait until the thing is done before we know whether we are right or wrong. But we should realize that we have a life within us. When the word of God enters into us that life will give light, and we will be inwardly clear even before we do anything. The word of God in us gives light and enables us to discern what is from the spirit and what is from the soul. It follows spontaneously that when we touch the spirit, we will realize it is the spirit; and when we touch the soul, we will realize it is the soul. We will know as soon as we touch it; it will become very clear to us.</p><p>The word of God will shine within us and make us clear. It is living and operative. It is not something outward but something inward. We do not discern the spirit from the soul according to outward things; this discernment is the result of inward clearness. Then and only then can we practically know God and recognize the way we should take.</p>
