[3]  It includes: 1 Bible studies given by him during the period when his ministry was not active The Orthodoxy of the Church ; 2 messages released during the resumption of his ministry in 1949 The Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry ; and 3 messages released after the resumption of his ministry, including all of his training messages given at Kuling Mountain Authority and Submission, Messages for Building Up New Believers, Church Affairs, The Character of the Lord's Worker, How to Study the Bible, The Ministry of God's Word, The Breaking of the Outer Man and the Release of the Spirit, Spiritual Judgment and Examples of Judgment, etc. , as well as conferences and service trainings given in Hong Kong Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery . In addition, some magazines published during this period are also included in this set The Ministers, The Open Door, and The Present Testimony . Watchman Nee's ministry during this period blossomed into full maturity, providing an invaluable contribution to the building up of the church.
[4]  May the One who gave Himself for the church anoint these pages through the all-pervading Spirit and bless the readers with the unsearchable spiritual riches revealed in them, and may their eyes be opened to see God's eternal will, His goal, and His way through the revelation entrusted to His faithful servant.
[5]  Volume 47 of The Collected Works is comprised of two books by Watchman Nee on the subject of the church and authority in the church.
[6]  I have never met a servant of the Lord so balanced as Brother Watchman Nee.
[7]  Books such as The Normal Christian Life; Sit, Walk, Stand; What Shall This Man Do?; The Spiritual Man; The Release of the Spirit; The Song of Songs; Love Not the World; The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; The Glorious Church; and many others which have not yet been translated into English contain messages given by him on the spiritual side.
[8]  He realizes that even if we are rich in the spiritual life but do not have the proper practice of the church life, we are still short of the purpose of God.
[9]  May we see the vision unveiled in the last seven epistles of the Lord to His church and hear what the Spirit speaks to the churches, that we may not join the Catholic Thyatira, nor stay in the Protestant Sardis, neither fall into the Brethren Laodicea, but absolutely remain in the brotherly-love Philadelphia, which is the church that has returned to the orthodoxy of the apostolic church.
[10]  The apostle John's writings, whether his Epistles or his Gospel, were always the last in each category.
[11]  The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke were written regarding the behavior of the Lord Jesus on this earth, while the Gospel of John speaks of "He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven'' 3:13 .
[12]  The Gospel of John shows us the Son of God who was in the flesh He was in the midst of us, but men mistook Him, thinking that He was only Jesus of Nazareth.
[13]  Revelation also shows us what pleases the Lord, what the Lord condemns, and what the Lord's way is for the church, when the outward appearance of the church is extremely confusing.
[14]  Indeed, the confusion on the earth does not affect the spiritual reality.
[15]  But the church in her outward appearance, at least, is confused.
[16]  In this kind of circumstance, the children of God must seek one thing; that is, how should we follow and serve the Lord?
[17]  These seven epistles start with the Lord and end with the call to the overcomers.
[18]  Here we see two more matters: First, the church is the golden lampstand, and the Lord walks in the midst of the lampstands; second, the Lord holds the seven stars in His right hand, which are the angels of the seven churches.
[19]  But the glory of God has never been known, because it is the one characteristic that belongs most uniquely to God.
[20]  It is not that the eyes of God can see better than ours, but that God sees the spiritual reality.
[21]  In the New Testament there is a fundamental principle: All of the children of God are priests of God.
[22]  In Exodus 19:5-6 God called unto the people of Israel, saying, "Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.''
[23]  God ordained in the beginning that the whole nation be priests, but the incident of worshipping the golden calf occurred not long after.
[24]  May God open our eyes that we may see more and neglect nothing.
[25]  "I know...the slander from those who call themselves Jews and are not'' v.
[26]  The Lord said that the church has tribulation and poverty in her sufferings; these are easy to deal with.
[27]  The Jews spoken of here do not refer to the Jews in the world but to the Jews in the church, just as the "people'' we saw before in connection with the Nicolaitans did not refer to the people in the world but to the laity in the church.
[28]  I would like to recount a story which expresses this meaning.
[29]  In Kuling there was a Mr. Yu, an electrician, who had very little schooling.
[30]  The church does not teach how much we shall gain before God, but how much we will be able to let go before God.
[31]  In Revelation 2:9 the Lord speaks a very strong word: "Those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.''
[32]  The word "synagogue'' is especially related to Judaism, just as "shrine'' is related to Buddhism, "monastery'' to Taoism, and "mosque'' to Mohammedanism.
[33]  A certain brother said that we should not call our meeting place a church assembly hall, but a Christian synagogue.
[34]  The church in Ephesus was the church at the end of the apostolic age, the church before the apostle John passed away, the church which John himself referred to as in the last time, and the church spoken of in 2 Peter and 2 Timothy.
[35]  Then we saw in the preceding chapter, the age wherein the church was persecuted, which is the prophecy of the church in Smyrna as shown to us by the Lord.
[36]  "But I have a few things against you, that you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices and to commit fornication'' v.
[37]  Balaam was a Gentile; we do not know why God also called him a prophet.
[38]  As in the case of Saul, the Spirit of God moved him but did not enter into him.
[39]  If we can trust in God, then we go to work; if we cannot trust in God, then we do not go to work.
[40]  When Constantine accepted Christianity, the teaching of Balaam occurred and the teaching of the Nicolaitans appeared.
[41]  Here I must especially emphasize that Ephesus came forth after the church in the apostolic age had passed away, and after Ephesus, Smyrna, and after Smyrna, Pergamos, and after Pergamos, Thyatira.
[42]  The Roman Catholic Church, according to our observation, has nothing good, but God says, "I know your works and love and faith and service and your endurance and that your last works are more than the first'' v. 19 . The Lord acknowledges that there is reality in the Roman Catholic Church.
[43]  No matter where you are, it is apparent that the Roman Catholic Church unites herself with political powers.
[44]  According to men it is a type of advancement for the church to be able to bargain, but according to God, it is sin for the church to gain what the world has gained.
[45]  "But I say to you the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they say I put no other burden upon you; nevertheless what you have hold fast until I come'' vv.
[46]  We have seen that during the time of the apostles there was the behavior of the Nicolaitans.
[47]  But there is a good point here: In Thyatira we see the judgment of Jezebel, the casting of her into a bed that she may not move; we also see that her followers will one day be killed.
[48]  Now we must see one thing: When the church, in her continuous fall from the Nicolaitans, comes to the stage of Jezebel, God can no longer tolerate it.
[49]  In Sardis the Lord says that His name is "He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead'' Rev 3:1 .
[50]  The Reformation did not bring the church back to the condition of the beginning; it only caused the world church to become state churches.
[51]  Thyatira is condemned for putting the church in the world; likewise, Sardis is condemned for putting the church in the states.
[52]  Although Ephesus was a church which had already slackened, it is on the same straight line, since the Lord acknowledged that the church in Ephesus continued the apostolic church.
[53]  To the church in Smyrna the Lord said, "That you may be tried'' Rev 2:10 , while to the church in Philadelphia the Lord said, "I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth'' 3:10 .
[54]  If we have to inquire concerning a certain matter, we cannot ask God ourselves; we must ask them to inquire of God for us.
[55]  I have already brought forth much Scripture as a basis for showing that we are all priests.
[56]  But now there is an argument between God and men.
[57]  Since God says that everyone in the church is qualified to be a priest, why do men say that spiritual authority is only in the hands of the mediatorial class such as the fathers?
[58]  They have the popes who exercise dominion over them, they have the high officials exercising authority over them, and they have the Vatican the church-palace high officials, etc. But the Lord says, "You all are brothers.'' Hold fast to Matthew 23:8 and 20:26.
[59]  Walking one day with a brother as we were passing down Lower Pembroke Street, he said to me: "This I doubt not is the mind of God concerning us we should come together in all simplicity as disciples, not waiting on any pulpit or ministry, but trusting that the Lord would edify us together by ministering as He pleased and saw good from the midst of ourselves."
[60]  This was how the brothers groped gradually onward, received revelation gradually, and saw the light gradually.
[61]  After one year in 1828, Darby published a little book called The Nature and Unity of the Church of Christ.
[62]  In the first place, it is not a formal union of the outward professing bodies that is desirable; indeed it is surprising that reflecting Protestants should desire it: far from doing good, I conceive it would be impossible that such a body could be at all recognized as the church of God.
[63]  It would be a counterpart to Romish unity; we should have the life of the church and the power of the word lost, and the unity of spiritual life utterly excluded...True unity is the unity of the Spirit, and it must be wrought by the operation of the Spirit...No meeting, which is not framed to embrace all the children of God in the full basis of the kingdom of the Son, can find the fulness of blessing, because it does not contemplate it because its faith does not embrace it...Where two or three are gathered together in His name, His name is recorded there for blessing...
[64]  Further, unity is the glory of the church; but unity to secure and promote our own interests is not the unity of the church, but confederacy and denial of the nature and hope of the church.
[65]  Because our table is the Lord's table, not our table, we receive all whom God receives, all poor sinners fleeing to the Lord for refuge, not resting in themselves, but only in Christ.
[66]  Now we will see what these brothers gave us: They showed us how the blood of the Lord satisfies the righteousness of God; the assurance of salvation; how the weakest believer may be accepted in Christ, just as Christ was accepted; and how to believe in the Word of God as the foundation of salvation.
[67]  Since church history began, there never was a period when the gospel was clearer than in their time.
[68]  It was they who also opened up the prophecies for the first time, causing us to see that the return of the Lord is the hope of the church.
[69]  It was also they who showed us what the law of sin is, what it is to be set free, what it is to be crucified with Christ, what it is to be raised with Christ, how to be identified with the Lord through faith, and how to be transformed daily by looking unto Him.
[70]  It was also they who showed us the sin of the mediatorial class, how all the children of God are priests, and how all can serve God.
[71]  It is no wonder that D. M. Panton said, "The movement of the brothers and its significance is far greater than the Reformation." W. H. Griffith Thomas said, "Among the children of God, it was they who were most able to rightly divide the word of truth.'' Henry Ironside said, "Whether among those who know the brothers or those who do not know the brothers, all those who know God have received help from the brothers directly or indirectly.''
[72]  From their time, men knew that the church is the Body of Christ, that the children of God are one church, and that they should not be divided.
[73]  In the church there is also neither bond nor free.
[74]  It is not that one receives more life because he is a master, or that one receives less life because he is a slave.
[75]  In the past a certain brother told me that the meeting places were usually in poor condition, and that it would be best for us to prepare a place especially for preaching to the government officials.
[76]  When our eyes are opened by the Lord, we will see that being above others is a glory in the world, but that there is no such distinction in the church.
[77]  I met a certain believer once on a train who asked me what kind of Christian I was.
[78]  Saying that you are a Christian means nothing; you have to say what kind of Christian you are in order for it to be meaningful.''
[79]  We must be very careful and humble or else we will become involved in the same failure.
[80]  I think any kind of division is due to the lack of love for one another; when love does not exist or is lacking, people pay attention to laws, stress procedures, and split hairs to find faults.
[81]  They clearly saw the sins of the church on the negative side, but on the positive side, they did not adequately see how the church should love one another and be of one accord on the ground and boundary of locality.
[82]  Since the Brethren did not pay enough attention to the fact that the church has the locality as her boundary, the "Exclusive Brethren'' demanded unified action throughout in every place, resulting in breaking the boundary of locality and falling into the error of the united church; while the "Open Brethren'' demanded independent administration of every meeting, the result of which is that there are many places that have many churches in one locality, thus falling into the error of the Congregational Church, which makes each congregation an independent unit.
[83]  "He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name'' Rev 3:12 .
[84]  "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches'' v. 13 . Please remember, God has not kept His heart's desire in secret; God has put the way very clearly before us.
[85]  We have seen the Roman Catholic Church, the Protestant churches, and the movement of the brothers.
[86]  Among these, God has chosen the movement of the brothers.
[87]  "Because you say, I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing'' 3:17 .
[88]  I have mentioned already that the movement of the brothers is far more significant than the Reformation.
[89]  The Reformation was but a reformation in quantity, while the movement of the brothers was a reformation in quality, recovering the original substance of the church.
[90]  The word "wretched'' here is the same as the word "wretched'' used by Paul in Romans 7:24.
[91]  The Lord is saying that they are just like Paul in Romans 7: On the spiritual side they are wretched, they are embarrassed, they are not like this and not like that, and in the Lord's eyes they are miserable.
[92]  Following this, the Lord points out three reasons why they are wretched and miserable: They are poor, they are blind, and they are naked.
[93]  In the Old Testament there are very clear prophecies concerning Judah.
[94]  Israel rebelled against God during the time of Jeroboam, and it was the nation which perished first.
[95]  Evidently, God was not pleased with Israel and rejected her.
[96]  So we should learn that regardless of the condition the church, whenever any church has a problem, if we are faithful before the Lord, we will discover what we must do.
[97]  We already know that the number seven is divided into three and four.
[98]  After Ephesus, there is Smyrna, and after Smyrna there is Pergamos.
[99]  We began to see that the church is entirely of God, only those who are saved can be in it, and only the words which God has ordained in the Bible are to be kept by the church.
[100]  Today if you have left the denominations and have seen the church, then only the Word of God can be the standard.
[101]  Can you say that he is not a brother?
[102]  He is a brother if he knows the truth clearly, and he is still a brother if he does not know the truth clearly.
[103]  But we should never have this kind of attitude: I love the brothers who are clear and the brothers who are lovable, but those who are not lovable I will not love.
[104]  Whenever we say "we'' and yet do not include all the children of God, we are the biggest sect, for we are not standing in the position of brotherly love but exalting ourselves.
[105]  I say that all the children of God must be baptized by immersion, but I cannot say that because one does not do it this way, he is not a brother.
[106]  Overcoming is spoken of in these epistles seven times.
[107]  In 1949 Watchman Nee released a series of messages on authority and submission in a co-workers' training held in Kuling, Foochow.
[108]  All who were present in the meetings fell prostrate in the light of God.
[109]  At the end of this age, how can the kingdom of God be brought in if the children of God do not bear a testimony for the Lord in submission?
[110]  AUTHORITY AND SUBMISSION CHAPTER ONE THE IMPORTANCE OF AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: Rom 13:1-7; Heb 1:3; Isa 14:12-14; Matt 6:13; 26:62-64 THE THRONE OF GOD
[111]  All things have been created by the authority of God, and all laws on earth are held together through authority.
[112]  Hence, the Bible says that God upholds all things by the word, which is of His authority Heb 1:3b .
[113]  It is easy to be forgiven of sin against God's power, but it is not that easy to be forgiven of sin against God's authority, because sinning against God's authority is sinning against God Himself.
[114]  The center of dispute in the whole universe relates to who has the authority.
[115]  We have to contend with Satan by asserting that authority is with God.
[116]  We have to set ourselves to submit to God's authority and to uphold God's authority.
[117]  But after he met the Lord on the way to Damascus, he realized that it was difficult to kick against the goads God's authority with his feet man's energy .
[118]  Some have considered the Lord's prayer in the garden of Gethsemane, where His sweat fell as blood, as a sign of His weakness in the flesh and His fear of the cup Luke 22:44 .
[119]  To be lawless is to disregard the authority of God, and to disregard the authority of God is sin.
[120]  IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 1 Scripture Reading: Gen 2:16-17; 3:1-6; Rom 5:19 THE FALL OF ADAM AND EVE The Fall of Man Due to Not Submitting
[121]  God entrusted all creation to Adam's authority so that Adam would manage and be the authority over all the creation.
[122]  At the same time, God put Adam under His own authority so that Adam would learn to submit to authority.
[123]  God destined that Adam would be the authority and that Eve would be under Adam's authority.
[124]  Man should not do anything out of a knowledge of right and wrong.
[125]  All authority is from God because everything is ordered by God.
[126]  When Adam fell, the order in the universe was destroyed.
[127]  IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 2 Scripture Reading: Gen 9:20-27; Lev 10:1-2; Num 12:1-15; 16 THE REBELLION OF HAM The Failure of the Deputy Authority
[128]  Serving God and offering strange fire are two similar matters, yet they are very different.
[129]  God called all three to come out to the entrance of the tent of meeting v. 4 . Aaron and Miriam came out boldly, presuming that they would be vindicated.
[130]  He did not try to exercise authority, because authority is of God.
[131]  He knew the consequence of such an act, and he sighed, saying, "You have gone too far, sons of Levi!...Is it too small a thing for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the assembly of Israel to bring you near to Himself?...Therefore you and all your company have gathered together against Jehovah" vv.
[132]  Moses and Aaron fell down before God and prayed, "Shall one man sin, and will You be angry with all the assembly?" v. 22 . God answered Moses and Aaron's prayer and judged only the company of Korah.
[133]  CHAPTER FOUR DAVID'S KNOWLEDGE OF AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 24:4-6; 26:9, 11; 2 Sam 1:14 DAVID GAINING THE THRONE
[134]  During the setting up of the kingdom of Israel, God officially established His authority on earth.
[135]  When the Israelites entered Canaan they asked God for a king, and God sent Samuel to anoint Saul as their first king 1 Sam 10:1 .
[136]  But when he became king, Saul did not submit to the authority of God.
[137]  CHAPTER FIVE THE SON'S SUBMISSION Scripture Reading: Phil 2:5-11; Heb 5:7-9 THE LORD CREATING SUBMISSION
[138]  The Word of God tells us that the Lord Jesus and the Father are one.
[139]  In the beginning was the Word, just as in the beginning there was God.
[140]  The Word was God, and this Word created the heavens and earth.
[141]  The Bible says that the Lord did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped Phil 2:6 .
[142]  Concerning His deity, the Lord was equal with God.
[143]  But His being the Lord was something given to Him by God.
[144]  When He laid aside His divine form to fully maintain the principle of submission and subsequently ascended to the heavens, God accorded to Him the position of Lord.
[145]  But if there was only authority without submission, authority could not be established, because authority is not something isolated.
[146]  CHAPTER SIX HOW GOD ESTABLISHES HIS KINGDOM Scripture Reading: Heb 5:8-9; Acts 5:32; Rom 10:16; 2 Thes 1:8; 1 Pet 1:22 THE LORD LEARNING OBEDIENCE
[147]  In this chapter we want to see how God establishes His kingdom through submission.
[148]  FOR MAN TO BELIEVE BUT ALSO FOR MAN TO SUBMIT
[149]  Second Thessalonians 1:8 says, "Rendering vengeance to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[150]  TO REPRESENTATIVE AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: Rom 13:1; 1 Pet 2:13-14; Eph 5:22-24; 6:1-3; Col 3:18, 20, 22; 1 Thes 5:12-13; 1 Tim 5:17; 1 Pet 5:5; 1 Cor 16:15-16 THE GOD-ESTABLISHED SYSTEMS OF AUTHORITY In the World
[151]  In the universe God is the source of all authorities.
[152]  God Himself has set up systems of authorities for His expression so that when man meets these authorities he will meet God Himself.
[153]  This, of course, does not include the fact that in the church, when man lives in the spirit, he can contact God all the time.
[154]  Not only do we have to submit to God's direct authority, we must also submit to His deputy authority because there is no authority that is not from God.
[155]  Although they do not believe in God, and although their entire kingdoms are under Satan, the principle of authority is still there, having been established by God.
[156]  Many children of God do not pay enough attention to the matter of the family.
[157]  God establishes the husband as the deputy authority of Christ, and the wife as the representation of the church.
[158]  Unless the wife sees the authority that the husband represents, the authority that God has set up, it is difficult for her to submit.
[159]  Not only has God set up His deputy authority in the universe, He has also set up His authority in the spiritual world.
[160]  It is much easier for us to be confident in submitting to representative authorities than for God to be confident in setting them up.
[161]  Since God is confident in handing over authority to man, should we not be confident in submitting to man?
[162]  The whole parable in Luke 20:9-16 is on deputy authority.
[163]  God leased the vineyard to the vinedresser, but He did not come to personally collect the rent.
[164]  But if the deputy authority is wrong, God will deal with him; he will have to bear the iniquity of his wife, and the submitting wife is guiltless v. 15 . This chapter tells us that man cannot overstep the deputy authority to submit to the direct authority.
[165]  CHAPTER EIGHT AUTHORITY IN THE BODY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:12-21; Matt 18:15-18 THE BODY BEING THE PLACE
[166]  The highest expression of God's authority is in the Body of Christ, the church.
[167]  Although God has established systems of authority in the world, none of the relationships with the government or between father and son, husband and wife, and master and servant can perfectly manifest authority.
[168]  Although God has set up many authorities on earth, they are but systems of authority set up by God.
[169]  The Spirit of life that God gave to us is the same as that which is in the Lord.
[170]  Today it is impossible for every member to be the whole Body.
[171]  This is why God first works thoroughly on the people who are used by Him so that when He gives them to us as our authority to help us learn submission, we can receive what we never could have otherwise received.
[172]  CHAPTER NINE THE MANIFESTATION OF MAN'S REBELLION 1 Scripture Reading: 2 Pet 2:10-12; Eph 5:6; Jude 8-10; Matt 12:34; Rom 9:11-24
[173]  In Numbers 12 Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses.
[174]  Has he not spoken through us also?" v. 2 . But God understood that as reviling v. 8 . Perhaps there were many words which they had not spoken.
[175]  Once we meet authority, there will be a sense of authority in us, in the same way that there will be a sense of sin once we meet the Lord.
[176]  In Romans 9 Paul tried to prove to the Jews that God has called the Gentiles also.
[177]  He said that not all of the seed of Abraham were chosen; only Isaac was chosen.
[178]  And not all of the seed of Isaac were chosen; God chose only Jacob.
[179]  God will have mercy on whomever He will have mercy, and will have compassion on whomever He will have compassion.
[180]  We have to realize that God sits on His throne of glory, and man is under His authority.
[181]  Paul went on to say, "So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy" v. 16 . God said of Pharaoh, "For this very thing I have raised you up, that I might show in you My power" v. 17 . Moreover, He said that "He hardens whom He wills" v. 18 . To harden does not mean to cause to sin.
[182]  CHAPTER TEN THE MANIFESTATION OF MAN'S REBELLION 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 10:4-6 THOUGHTS The Relationship
[183]  Not only is man's rebellion manifested in his words and reasons; it is manifested in his thoughts as well.
[184]  Paul was an intelligent, able, wise, and sensible person.
[185]  He was capable and confident in his work, and served God with his own zeal.
[186]  Saul was rejected by God, not for theft but for offering a sacrifice to God of sheep and oxen that he assumed were the best.
[187]  OF SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: Heb 11:23; Exo 1:17; Dan 3:17-18; 6:10; Matt 2:13; Acts 5:29 SUBMISSION BEING ABSOLUTE,
[188]  Acts 4:19 says, "But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you judge."
[189]  When the deputy authority the one representing God's authority clashes with the direct authority God , one must be submissive to the deputy authority but must not be obedient to it.
[190]  1 The midwives and the mother of Moses disobeyed the order of Pharaoh so that the life of Moses could be preserved.
[191]  If a man has not met authority and does not know the principle of submission to authority, he cannot bring others into the way of submission and authority.
[192]  Therefore, if a man is independent, individualistic, and free from any God-appointed deputy authority, he is an outsider as far as God's administration over the whole universe is concerned.
[193]  God has established deputy authorities in the church; the church is built up and maintained by the authority of God.
[194]  Today we will consider the kind of persons God uses to be His deputy authorities.
[195]  In order to be God's deputy authority, a person must fulfill three fundamental requirements in addition to knowing God's authority and submitting to His authority .
[196]  A deputy authority must remember that all authorities come from God.
[197]  In fact, the only authority that is authority at all is the authority that comes from God, and only such authority can claim submission from others.
[198]  We can only ask the brothers and sisters to submit to the authority in us which comes from God.
[199]  God appoints a person to be a deputy authority because such a person knows His will and His thoughts more than others, not because he has more suggestions, better ideas, or higher thoughts.
[200]  Every time that you have to deal with someone, you must have the assurance from God that you understand His will and that you know what God wants to do in that instance.
[201]  If God does not acknowledge what you have said to the brothers, you will be left representing only yourself, not God.
[202]  If we have sufficient experience before the Lord, and if we have sufficiently learned His ways, we will have the boldness to declare that this is what we know from God, that this is what we have learned of Him, and that this is what we have experienced in Him.
[203]  The second basic requirement of a deputy authority is to deny himself.
[204]  Before one is clear about God's will, he should not open his mouth and should not exercise any authority.
[205]  God's deputy authority must not only know His authority on the positive side, but must learn to deny himself on the negative side.
[206]  Please remember that neither God nor the brothers and sisters treasure your opinion.
[207]  If you think your opinion is the best, that God treasures your opinion, and that the brothers and sisters honor your idea, you are living in a dream.
[208]  In the same way, God does not ask a person who loves to express his opinion to be His deputy authority, because He does not want to suffer loss either.
[209]  God wants us to represent His authority, not replace His authority.
[210]  Those who are God's deputy authorities should possess a third qualification they must have a constant and intimate fellowship with the Lord.
[211]  There must not only be a communion, but a communication.
[212]  Every time one has an opinion, he has to bring it to the Lord and find out if such an opinion is of the flesh or of God.
[213]  If God has arranged for us to bear some authority and learn to be a deputy authority, we have to learn to live before Him and have constant fellowship with Him.
[214]  Since God is the One who establishes authority, there is no need for deputy authorities to try to build up their own authority.
[215]  I know of a few brothers and sisters who were so foolish in the past that they thought they could direct others with their authority.
[216]  Hebrews 5:4 says, "No one takes the honor upon himself, but only as he is called by God."
[217]  On the other hand, if I am an authority appointed by God, why do I have to worry that others will not submit to me?
[218]  REVELATION Scripture Reading: Exo 3:1-12; Num 12:1-15
[219]  In the Old Testament the greatest authority God appointed was Moses.
[220]  Before Moses was appointed by God to be the authority, he killed an Egyptian who had slain one of his kinsmen.
[221]  When Moses was reviled, he did not vindicate himself.
[222]  All vindication, justification, and reaction should come from God, not from man.
[223]  Those who seek to vindicate themselves do not know God.
[224]  God may have committed His authority to us, but if we vindicate ourselves before men, we have lost our authority because we are begging them to be our judge.
[225]  God does not appoint persons of great charisma to be His authority; He appoints those who are not only meek in a general way, but meek to the extent that their meekness exceeds that of all the men who are on the face of the earth.
[226]  Numbers 12:4 says, "And suddenly Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting."
[227]  All three came before the tent of meeting, and Jehovah said to Aaron and Miriam, "Hear My words" v. 6a . They first questioned if it was fair that God only spoke to Moses, and now God summoned them to hear His words too.
[228]  But God said that even if there were a prophet, God would at most speak to him in a vision or in a dream v. 6c . But with Moses, God spoke mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in obscure words v. 8 . This was God's vindication.
[229]  In Numbers 12:7, God said, "My servant Moses...is faithful in all My house."
[230]  Hebrews shows us that Moses, as a type of Christ the Son of God, was faithful in all God's house 3:2 .
[231]  God seemed to be hinting at Aaron and Miriam, saying, "Moses might not have been altogether faithful in your house when he married a Cushite woman.
[232]  If God is the One who appoints me to be the authority, I should not do anything to establish myself; I should only allow revelation to vindicate me.
[233]  If others oppose and rebel against you, and if they go to God and also receive revelation, it means that God has not vindicated you or backed you up.
[234]  If you understand what is God's authority and God's way, you will realize what I have been saying repeatedly, that is, when others argue with you, they are arguing with God, because you are God's possession.
[235]  Had Moses not received mercy and had he been ignorant of God's grace, he would have said to Aaron, "Since you have said that God should speak to you also, why don't you pray to God yourself?"
[236]  While God was about to execute His judgment, Moses said, "In this shall you know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these works, and that it has not been of my own mind" v. 28 . Moses was a meek person.
[237]  Moses was sent by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, just as Christ was sent by God to impart eternal life to men.
[238]  Authority is established by God, and when a man offends God's authority, he is despising God.
[239]  When God looks for deputy authority, He considers not only a person's individual submission to Him but his reaction to others' opposition in his service as a deputy authority.
[240]  When you set out for your work this time, you have to learn from Moses.
[241]  If we will truly bear the burden of the church and the children of God, and if we will learn to prostrate ourselves before the Lord, God will find His deputy authority on earth today.
[242]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE BASIS OF GOD'S DEPUTY AUTHORITY RESURRECTION Scripture Reading: Num 17
[243]  The purpose of Numbers 17 is to show us the way God dealt with Israel's rebellion.
[244]  In chapter sixteen there was an unprecedented rebellion, but chapter seventeen speaks of the termination of the rebellion; it shows the way to turn away from rebellion and death.
[245]  A rod signifies human position, while budding signifies the resurrection life.
[246]  Aaron could not serve God based on his position, because his position was the same as all the others.
[247]  Resurrection is everything that is not out of our natural life, not out of ourselves, and not based on our ability.
[248]  AND GOD'S GOVERNMENTAL JUDGMENT Scripture Reading: Num 20:2-3, 7-13, 22-28; Deut 32:48-52 A DEPUTY AUTHORITY SHOULD SANCTIFY THE LORD
[249]  After the Israelites wandered in the wilderness for over thirty years, we find in Numbers 20 that they forgot the lesson that they had learned through their rebellion.
[250]  God was not angry this time at the people's murmuring; He told Moses to take the rod, which was a symbol of God's authority, and to speak to the rock so that it might yield its water.
[251]  He said, "You did not believe in Me, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the sons of Israel" v. 12a . This means that Moses and Aaron had not sanctified God; they had not separated God from themselves.
[252]  We can never implicate God in our mistakes or our personal failures, or give others the impression that our attitude is the attitude that God is expressing through His deputy authority.
[253]  The result of this incident was the manifestation of God's judgment.
[254]  God said that Moses and Aaron could no longer enter the land of Canaan on account of their mistake v. 12b . When man speaks and acts loosely and does not sanctify God, He will vindicate Himself.
[255]  When this happens, man can no longer ask God for forgiveness.
[256]  Here is another thing that we should note: Every time we execute God's authority and take care of His business, we have to do it with fear and trembling.
[257]  When Moses was angry and threw down God's handwritten tablets of stone, God did not judge him because he was filled with God's jealousy, and it was right for him to do that.
[258]  But after following God for so many years, he misrepresented God by disobeying Him, striking the rock twice, and speaking rash words.
[259]  He had incriminated God in his mistakes, and he had dragged God into his error.
[260]  In Numbers 18 God told Aaron that he and his sons would bear the iniquity of the sanctuary v. 1 . The more a person represents God's authority, the more God scrutinizes him and will not let him go.
[261]  Even though he was a deputy authority of God who was obedient to God all his life, he was barred from entering Canaan because of his one failure in representing God.
[262]  Self-motivated service cannot find acceptance in the eyes of God.
[263]  The Lord does not want us to be misguided to assume that authority comes from someone other than God.
[264]  In the Old Testament David was the second king appointed by God.
[265]  Before David there was Saul, who was also appointed by God.
[266]  The less a man seeks for authority, the more God gives him authority.
[267]  A deputy authority should take a place before God that is as equally low and humble as all the people of God.
[268]  Second Samuel 15 is a record of Absalom's rebellion.
[269]  OF A DEPUTY AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: Mark 10:35-45 DRINKING THE LORD'S CUP
[270]  When the Lord was on the earth, He rarely taught others how to be an authority.
[271]  Clearly the baptism that the Lord referred to was not the baptism at the river Jordan, because that was over.
[272]  There is much contention between those who have the Lord and those who do not, those who know God and those who do not, those who pay the price and those who do not, those who are faithful and those who are not, and those who accept the trials and those who do not.
[273]  But even if they drank His cup and passed through His baptism, they still might not sit on His right or left, because the latter depends on God's preparation v. 40 . If a man does not drink the Lord's cup and is not baptized with His baptism, he will surely not be able to sit on His right or left side.
[274]  Today the Lord is establishing authority in the church.
[275]  Those who are great in the church, that is, those who are established by the Lord as great ones, are actually the servants and slaves of all.
[276]  We have seen that spiritual authority depends on spiritual attainment.
[277]  Please remember that authority is based on attainment on the one hand and on humility and obedience before God on the other hand.
[278]  Although our Lord was sent from God and had uninterrupted fellowship with God, He said, "For their sake I sanctify Myself" John 17:19 .
[279]  AN AUTHORITY HAS TO BE RESTRICTED IN HIS EMOTION
[280]  Leviticus 10:1-7 records God's judgment on Nadab and Abihu.
[281]  They were judged because they did not come under the authority of their father Aaron.
[282]  They were not supposed to serve independently; rather, they were to help their father in his service to God.
[283]  Moses said, "This is what Jehovah spoke, saying, I will be sanctified by those who come near to Me" v. 3 . God wanted to point out that those who draw near to Him cannot be loose.
[284]  According to Leviticus 10:9, God told Aaron, "Do not drink wine or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you come into the tent of meeting."
[285]  The more we are sanctified and the more we are restricted by God and bound under His authority, the more we can be an authority.
[286]  A DEPUTY AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: Eph 5:22, 25, 28, 33; 6:1, 4, 9; Psa 82:1-2; 1 Tim 4:12; 3:4-6; Titus 2:15; 1:6-8; 1 Pet 1:21
[287]  The elders are the authorities in the local church.
