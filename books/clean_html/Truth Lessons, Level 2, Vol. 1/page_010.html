<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>After God judged the corrupt generation by the flood and saved Noah out of that generation, He made the third covenant with man (Gen. 9:1-17).</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE ONE WHO MADE THE COVENANT&mdash;GOD</h2>
<p>The One who made this covenant was God. Here &ldquo;God&rdquo; in Hebrew is Elohim, which is composed of two words, the first word meaning &ldquo;the powerful One,&rdquo; and the second word meaning &ldquo;binding Himself with an oath.&rdquo; Oath-making shows God&rsquo;s faithfulness; power indicates God&rsquo;s might. This God who made the covenant is the mighty One who is faithful.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Faithful One</h2>
<p>God is faithful, and by His faithfulness He made a covenant with Noah. His faithfulness is established in heaven; it cannot be touched or altered by anything on earth. Therefore, God can never be faithless, nor suffer His faithfulness to fail, nor break His covenant which He made with man, nor alter the word that He spoke to man (Psa. 89:33-34). If man becomes faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself (2 Tim. 2:13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Mighty One</h2>
<p>God is also mighty, and by His might He made a covenant with Noah. His might guarantees that every word in His covenant will and can be fulfilled. He has the power to fulfill the covenant which He made with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE ONE WITH WHOM<br />
THE COVENANT WAS MADE&mdash;NOAH</h2>
<p>The one with whom this covenant was made was Noah, who was a righteous man, a perfect man who walked with God in that corrupt generation, and a herald of righteousness. He built the ark to save himself and his entire family, and he was saved through water, being delivered from that corrupt generation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. A Righteous Man</h2>
<p>Noah was a righteous man. This means that he was right with God, with others, and with himself. Because he believed in God, his believing was immediately reckoned to him by God as righteousness; that is, he became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith (Heb. 11:7). Moreover, because he found grace in the eyes of God, this grace strengthened him and helped him to live a righteous life. Therefore, he not only received objective righteousness but also lived out subjective righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. A Perfect Man Who Walked with God</h2>
<p>Noah&rsquo;s generation had become a corrupt generation. A number of the fallen angels in Satan&rsquo;s principality came down to the earth, took human bodies, and formed illegal marriages with the daughters of men, producing a mingling of the evil spirits and human beings. No longer was the human race merely the human race; it became a mixture of humanity and fallen spirits. Thus the entire generation became a corrupt generation. God saw the earth, that all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth (Gen. 6:12).</p>
<p>However, in that corrupt generation, Noah was a perfect man who walked with God (Gen. 6:9). His walking with God means that he did not override God, that he was not presumptuous, that he did not do things according to his own concept and desire, and that he did things according to God and with God. Hence, he became a perfect man. Without God, man is not perfect and is still lacking. The factor of perfection is not with man; it is God Himself. It was with such a perfect man who walked with Him that God made a covenant.</p>
