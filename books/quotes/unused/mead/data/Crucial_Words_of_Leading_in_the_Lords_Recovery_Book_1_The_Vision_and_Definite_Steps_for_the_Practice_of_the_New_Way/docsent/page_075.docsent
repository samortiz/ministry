   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A PERSONAL TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the present time in Taiwan, my goal, on the one hand, is to study how to advance in the new move with the co-workers and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the other hand, I have a great burden to work on the Recovery Version of the New Testament in Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It has been difficult to have a proper version of the Bible for our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The existing translations require much editing work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the publication of the Recovery Version in English, the Chinese saints, especially those overseas, have unanimously demanded a Recovery Version in Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The saints in Taiwan are also very eager to have such a version.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A few years ago I was hoping that some Chinese-speaking saints would pick up the burden to take care of this responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I was even ready to spend the money to hire someone to take care of this work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, after considering this for a few years and looking around, I realized that it was impossible to hire anyone to do this job.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such a one would need much spiritual education and should know theology as well as spiritual terminology and expressions, such as the Triune God, the person of Christ, God s dispensing, God s economy, the essential Spirit, the economical Spirit, and others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the same time, it was impossible to recruit some useful ones from the Lord s recovery and put them to use immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even if we selected a few young ones and started training them, they would still need to pass through a period of training and perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Consequently, I became clear that I had to sacrifice the work in the West and devote a year s time in Taiwan for this task.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Based on our experience in the last few decades, I know I must enter into this work thoroughly in order to establish a good foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For me to engage in this work is also a kind of warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It has been two months since I started this work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have used every ounce of my energy on this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I can say that I have exhausted the strength in my spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every day I work eight to ten hours.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although I am more than eighty years old, I still feel that I need to give myself in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May the Lord cover me with His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After two months we were finally able to lay a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The serving ones now have some realization of what it means to translate the Bible, how they should use the reference books, and how to consult other material or versions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the past they had the means, but they did not know how to use them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, at the present time I have personally taken the lead to work through everything with them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While I worked, I also asked questions and directed them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In two months we finished the Gospel of Matthew, and then we moved on to the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now the foundation is laid, but I am exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While I was working on the Recovery Version, I was also working on Truth Lessons and taking care of the English publications.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, the messages for the International Elders Conference have all been polished and are ready for me to read and review.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After working hard this way, I was suddenly overcome two weeks ago by a general feeling of fatigue.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since then, I have been resting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thank the Lord that He has given me a healthy body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If I did not have such a body, the result would have been unimaginable.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I rested for four days, and by the fifth day I was able to resume meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>My point is that the enemy is attacking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I was walking down to the basement of the meeting hall to join a truth class, I missed the last step of the stairs.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thankfully, the Lord protected me; my hand was still on the rail, but my body sustained a shock.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that time I did not feel anything, and I continued with the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since that time, however, I feel that my two feet have been weak and wobbly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I thought that it was caused by my fatigue and that with a little rest I would recover.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The doctors suspected something was wrong with my heart and suggested an examination.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The result of the examination was good, and the doctors declared that everything was normal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Still, I felt that my two feet could not bear my weight.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The doctors suggested that I exercise more; they thought that I was tired from the desk work and that I needed exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the more I exercised, the worse I felt.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I could not explain this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Last Friday I felt that I had to come and speak about the burden of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through this I realized that there is a spiritual battle here.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand, the prayer last Friday sustained me, and on the other hand, it triggered something.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The next day while I was in bed, I suddenly recalled a similar experience I had previously had with a backache.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was similar to this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I became clear that this was Satan s attack.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was doing a hidden work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I stopped all my work and lay quietly on my bed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I give this little illustration to show that we need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not think that Satan will work only a little.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He sends these frustrations to us one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After my backache was somewhat healed, two days later I caught a cold and had a fever as well as diarrhea.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The co-workers prayed for me on Monday morning for two hours, and then the full-timers prayed for me for one hour.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The prayers were very effectual.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the past when I had a cold, I would struggle with it for at least a week, but this time I recovered in a day.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not think that all these things are accidental.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to realize that we are in the midst of a spiritual battle.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yesterday I walked around my study for half an hour, and then I sat down to work on the manuscripts.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The more I worked, the more alert and energetic I became.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now as I am speaking, the more I speak, the more strength I have.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This shows that I am not sick.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is altogether Satan s attack in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Of course, he does have some ground to attack; two months of work has drained all my energy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This gave Satan an opening to attack me.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But thank the Lord for His protection!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I was not hurt in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A FIGHTING SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The brothers and sisters must realize that our work here is a fighting service.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The elders in particular must receive the burden to build up the church in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is our undisputed goal.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We need to make this successful.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I hope that one day there will no longer be any big meetings among us, but we would have only home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We can have more than three hundred thousand saints here in the church in Taipei without having a big meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Instead, everyone will meet in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Yearly we can have a few special corporate gatherings, but we must never forget that the basis of the church is built upon individual families.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This requires a long-term warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The co-workers in particular must see this and must endeavor in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must build up the home meetings, teach the truth well, and give up the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we do this, the clergy-laity system will be gone, and all the saints will know, speak, preach, and teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If we do this, we will no longer need a preacher among us; every saint will become a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>A society is not propagated through teaching but through the begetting of offspring.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Offspring are produced from the family, and they are also raised in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Through begetting, nourishing, and teaching, the offspring then produce their own families.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In this way society continues generation after generation.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Sixty years ago I was a single man.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Later I married and had a family with eight children.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Now these eight children have begotten more than twenty grandchildren in the third generation.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is the proper multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It is the proper way for a society to propagate as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The same is true with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It is through multiplication in the family that the church continues to prosper and spread generation after generation.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>However, it is not easy to do such a work.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Christianity is with us, and it affects us constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This custom of the nations is constantly frustrating us.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This is what happened to Nehemiah when he rebuilt the city; Sanballat constantly opposed him Neh 2:19; 4:1-8; 6:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This requires all of us to rise up to see this light and to struggle to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I do not mean to say that all of us must quit our jobs to serve as elders.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I am saying that we must have an attitude of fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Even if we hold a job, we need to be for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If we do this, the Lord will bless us and our career.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We are the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If the Lord does not bless us, whom will He bless?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If any man loves the Lord, this one is known by Him 1 Cor 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Those among us who have been loving the Lord and serving Him for decades have surely witnessed our families being blessed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Today if we fight for His building, will He not bless us even more?</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>It is a great blessing for our families to be gained by the Lord and for our offspring to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We do not need to quit our jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>God ordained that man labor to sustain his livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Because this is God s ordained rule for man to exist after the fall, we need to keep our jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The young people especially should do their best to study well.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>After they graduate from school, they should take up a proper job.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>However, we should not fall into the trap of mammon once we take up a career.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>We should not try to become rich or to raise our standard of living.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>When we take a job, we must pray that the Lord will guard our heart for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Our time must be consecrated to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>If we do this, the Lord will have a way in us.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>When Jacob was about to go down to Egypt, he first offered a sacrifice in Beer-sheba and consecrated himself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>God told him not to be afraid when he went down to Egypt, because He would make him a great nation Gen 46:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>We must have an aspiration and a burden from the Lord that even if we hold a job, we are still a full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>We are a money-making full-timer; we give all that we earn to the Lord for His use.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The purpose of doing this is not only to save a few more souls and edify some saints but to build up the Lord s church in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Today in Taiwan we have forty to fifty thousand brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>If we can build up the church in every saint s home, we will replace the work of many preachers, and we will effectively teach the truth to the saints.</S>
