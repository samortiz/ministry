LEARNING TO USE OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Regrettably, the work, service, and worship in Christianity are ritualistic, of the letter, and not in the Spirit, and sometimes our service and meetings have departed from the Spirit to become rituals. Romans 7:6 says, &ldquo;We serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.&rdquo; However, in some places the service has become an ordinance with rigid rituals of the letter.</p>
<p>Please allow me to ask, &ldquo;In elders&rsquo; meetings do the elders fellowship and pray in spirit, or are the meetings according to customs?&rdquo; When the elders come together, do they always begin the meeting with prayer? Is this prayer a routine for beginning the meeting, or are the elders truly burdened in spirit to pray with one another? If the elders are not burdened, the prayers are rituals. In some churches the elders pray for ten or more minutes when they gather together, but the content of their fellowship is unrelated to their prayers. This indicates that the prayers are ritualistic. The elders should come together with one heart, in one spirit, and with one burden. They should also have thorough prayer together for a matter or several matters before fellowshipping in spirit. If they are still not clear concerning a matter, they should have further prayer and fellowship. Such prayers are spiritual, not ritualistic. If the prayers in the elders&rsquo; meetings are ritualistic opening prayers, praying has become an ordinance.</p>
<p>We have given many messages on the spirit and on life, but in our living, meetings, and service we lack the spirit. As a result, for more than a decade we have wanted to tear down the rituals in our meetings. Ten years ago if a meeting began at 7:30 in the evening, the saints who arrived at 7:25 would sit down and wait for the elders to arrive in order for the meeting to begin. After four minutes the elders would arrive and also sit down. The elders would look to one another to know who would begin the meeting. Eventually, one elder would call a hymn, and the meeting would begin. Such a meeting lacked the spirit. This was our pitiful condition.</p>
<p>In 1961 we wanted to get through in the matter of being in spirit, but we could not get through. At the end of that year the Lord took me to the United States. In 1962 I began working in the United States, and I emphasized the spirit from the beginning of my ministry. Therefore, the testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States began in the spirit. Our meetings had no procedures. Whoever was the first to arrive for a meeting would sing or pray. This is how the Lord&rsquo;s recovery began in the United States. In many places in the United States there is no singing or speaking in the prayer meeting, nor do the brothers announce the prayer items. Suppose the prayer meeting begins at seven thirty. Those who arrive early begin praying. As other saints arrive, they join in and pray. The saints pray until nine thirty. There is no singing, nor is there the ministry of the word; there is only prayer. This is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to deliver the churches in the United States from the deadness of rituals.</p>
<p>It is easy for us to fall into the rituals of Christianity. In some local churches the service is organizational. How to be an elder, how to listen to the elders, who is a co-worker, and how the co-workers and elders handle affairs have all become rituals. No one knows how to meet or serve without the rituals, and no one knows how to function without the rules. The only ones who speak are those assigned to speak. This is a ritual. May the Lord have mercy on us and deliver us from rituals so that we would learn to live in our spirit. We must exercise our spirit in the meetings and in our daily living. We must also follow the spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord is my witness that while speaking with my wife, I must sometimes swallow a word that is on the tip of my tongue, because the Spirit forbids me from saying the word. There is a voice within me that says, &ldquo;Do not say it!&rdquo; This is a negative experience of following the Spirit. Sometimes the Spirit wants to move, and I move according to the Spirit, or the Spirit wants me to speak, and I speak according to the Spirit. This is a positive experience of following the Spirit. If we exercise our spirit regularly, it will be easy for us to be in spirit and to walk by the Spirit in the meetings. The genuine exercise of setting our mind on the spirit is in our daily living. In our daily living we should let the Spirit control our mind, emotion, and will and also let our whole being be controlled, restricted, and led by our spirit. Then we will be according to the Spirit.</p>
<p>When we are thus subdued by the Spirit and led by the Spirit, the Spirit will do a killing work in us. He will kill our flesh, our self, our temper, and our lusts, and the power of resurrection will also operate in us. Then our spirit will be released with authority and light when we speak, and our spirit will be released with the supply of life and the anointing when we pray. Because our spirit is released when we speak and pray, people will receive the supply of life and be watered. This should be our condition. Everyone who comes to our home and fellowships with us should touch the release of our spirit. If we would exercise our spirit in our daily living, our spirit will be released in our singing and our speaking whenever we gather together. Then our meetings will be filled with praise and thanksgiving, and they will not be disorderly.</p>
<p>It is easy to accept methods, but it is not easy to know or exercise our spirit. We must learn to exercise our spirit and not focus on methods. Although methods are helpful, it is more important for us to learn to use our spirit. For example, in the prayer meeting there is no need to ask who should pray or what to pray about; instead, we should endeavor to use our spirit to pray. Likewise, what we should say in a meeting is secondary; the primary matter is to exercise our spirit and speak according to our spirit.</p>
<p>Some people are naturally well behaved, but they cannot be moved by the Spirit; they are like walls of bronze and iron. Such persons need to be broken in order for their spirit to be released. Some have been practicing being broken, but their spirit is not released. These saints do not practice the release of the spirit; they practice the breaking of the outer man. As a result, their spirit is not released even though they may be broken. The messages that Brother Nee gave in <em>The Breaking of the Outer Man and the Release of the Spirit</em> are focused on the release of the spirit, not on the breaking of the outer man.</p>
<p>I hope that the focus of the elders&rsquo; meetings in the different localities would not be fellowshipping about different things but that the elders would learn to be open to one another in their meetings. We should not fear being open; we should only care for the release of our spirit through prayer. This is how everyone should pray. Do not ask how long we should pray. We should pray as the Spirit leads, even if we have to pray until the end of the world. When something is brought up, there is no need to ask how it would be done, when it would be done, or who would do it. Nor should we take any word of guidance as an ordinance. &ldquo;The letter kills&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:6). We must learn not to care for ordinances but rather to care only for our spirit. The co-workers who serve in a locality should not ask people to do things; instead, they should fellowship with the saints and supply them with life.</p>
<p>Our spirit is living, and our Lord is the Spirit. Paul says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom&rdquo; (v. 17). If we are not free, it is because we do not have the Spirit. The condition of the churches does not depend on whether our methods change but on whether we are in spirit. We need to have thorough fellowship and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading in spirit rather than conform to old ordinances. This is how the apostles worked for the Lord. The Lord had a different leading for Peter, Paul, and John; they did not conform to old ordinances. Even though they were different, they were the testimony of Jesus Christ because they lived in their spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
