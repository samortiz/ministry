   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>VICTORIOUS A. Overcoming the Archers' Attack</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis 49:23 and 24 say, "The archers have bitterly harassed him, and shot at him, and lay in wait for him: but his bow remained firm" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Joseph overcame the archers' attack.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The spiritual significance of this is that in all suffering we more than conquer Rom 8:36-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The sufferings cannot suppress us; rather, we subdue the sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>B. Being Made Strong by the Mighty One</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although Joseph was persecuted, harassed, and attacked, he remained strong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was not only strong, but also agile.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 24 says, "The arms of his hands were made strong and agile by the hands of the mighty One of Jacob" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more Joseph suffered and the more he was attacked, the more he became strong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His suffering also trained him to be agile.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order for our arms and legs to be agile, we need to be trained by suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Joseph was a trained person; he was trained through his sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the opposition and the rumors only help us to be agile.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Joseph, of course, was made strong and agile by the mighty One of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The source of his strength and agility was God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you read Joseph's history, you will see that God was always with him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When he was tempted by Potiphar's wife, he said, "How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>39:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that God was with him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His strength and his agility came from God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today in the Lord's recovery we are empowered in the grace of Christ to withstand all opposition for the Lord's testimony 2 Tim 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our strength is not of ourselves, but of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as we have Him as the source of our strength, no opposition can suppress us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>C. Tearing like a Wolf</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 49:27 Benjamin is likened to a tearing wolf: "Benjamin is a tearing wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and in the evening he shall divide the spoil" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The term "wolf" is not a pleasant term.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, whenever you tear anything, you cannot be nice; rather, you must be like a wolf.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we had to tear down some things in order to complete the building of the meeting hall in Anaheim, I observed the expressions of those who were doing this work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The expression on every face was fierce.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A gentleman cannot tear down anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whenever you are about to tear something down, you must be a wolf.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Benjamin was a wolf.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 2 Corinthians 10:5 Paul says, "Overthrowing reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and taking captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I was young, I thought that Paul was proud in saying this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Speaking about overthrowing reasonings and every high thing and about capturing thoughts is not nice, humble, gentle, mild, or kind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Paul wrote those words, he was a tearing wolf.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many times when I contact others I am humble and nice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But at certain times I am like a wolf tearing things into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In ordinary talk, I am a gentleman, but there are times when I show no mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes my co-workers and even my dear wife have asked me to be merciful toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But can you ask a tearing wolf to be merciful?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a wolf could speak, he would say, "In my language there is no such word as mercy."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A tearing wolf shows no mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are not tearing people into pieces; we are tearing Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are also tearing into pieces the dissenting thoughts and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All these high things must be torn to shreds.</S>
