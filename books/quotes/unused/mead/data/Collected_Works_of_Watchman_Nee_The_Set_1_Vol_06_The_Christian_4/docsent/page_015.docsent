   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We should remember that he said to God, "I am not like the rest of men."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many times when I preach the gospel, I ask, "Do you know that you are a sinner and that you need a Savior as a substitute to redeem you?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many have replied, "I have never killed anyone and burned down buildings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In what way have I sinned?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I do everything according to my conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am much better than my friends and neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am better than all."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>An unbeliever might add, "I am even better than many Christians!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am better than they without even believing in Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yes, maybe you can say this to me, but can you say to the Lord, "God, I thank You that I do not sin like the rest of men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am better than all others"?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am afraid you can only utter self-justifying words to me but not to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You dare to boast before men of your virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But you would not dare to say before God that you are better than all others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You may deceive men but not God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You may boast to me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may deceive parents, husband, wife, children, relatives, friends, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But you cannot deceive God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What you dare to say before men, you dare not say before God because God examines your inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Pharisee acted according to his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He not only boasted to men that he was a perfect and righteous man, unlike others who had committed sins, he dared to say even to God, "God, I thank You that I am not like the rest of men extortioners, unjust, adulterers."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His conscience did not even slightly condemn him; he could boldly declare his righteous acts before God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Truly, he was better than others, better than you and I. But the Lord said that this good man, who was rare among men, would go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If such a good man will go to hell, then what will happen to those who are not as good as he, who do not come up to his standard, and who have sinned as the rest of the world?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Should they go to hell and receive more punishment?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"If they do these things with the tree full of sap, what will happen with the one that is dry?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Luke 23:31 If an extremely good person goes to hell, what will happen to us sinners?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not be so self-confident.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although you are good, you cannot escape the fire of hell.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Oh, you who are self-righteous, please do not be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Your own righteousness cannot save you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was not an extortioner.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Extortion is taking what should not be taken by force or by power.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This Pharisee did not extort others, even though he had the power.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I wonder how many of you reading this message have extorted someone's riches by your own power.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You know it; God also knows it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What a common thing it is to dominate others by means of your power!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But this Pharisee did not do this; he did not extort.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet the Lord said that he could not be spared from going to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Good men go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a good man like this Pharisee was going to hell, then what about extortioners?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, he was not unjust.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whatever is not fair is unjust.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Being unjust is the most common sin today.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Not only is there much unjust conduct, but there are many unjust objects.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In your home, bedroom, classroom, living room, and office is there anything that is not yours, but has become yours?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Please search your bedroom, living room, closet, pocket to see if there are items that were obtained in an unjust way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Please check your own heart, and ask yourself if there is anything that you have gained in an unjust way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is still unjust, even if it is only one dress or one penny.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To put it politely, we acquired these things in an unjust way; putting it frankly, these things were stolen from others!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be unjust is to steal!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Did you ever steal any money from others?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Did you ever steal any article?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Did you borrow from others and never return the borrowed thing?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All this is unjust!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once I held a meeting at Changchow.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A young student who had stolen five dollars from her teacher was there.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After she attended the meeting, she realized that what she had done was a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Spirit urged her, and she confessed to her mother and returned the money to her teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Another young girl student who had stolen two loquats from her supervisor was also there.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Her supervisor was a very strict person; the students were afraid to talk to her.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After this young student received the Lord's grace, she realized that she should clear up this unjust matter; she went to her supervisor and boldly confessed her sin.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Two weeks later I went to the Kulangsu Bible Association.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The manager told me that he had received a letter and dictionary from Changchow.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the letter the writer stated, "I took this book from the Association without paying for it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I now know that this is unjust so I am returning it."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Brothers and sisters, I do not know if there is any injustice among you; I hope that there is none among you, but I am afraid that there are some unjust ones among us, and I am also afraid that there are some unjust things among you!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This Pharisee was not unjust.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He dared to say to the Lord that he was not unjust.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But the Lord said that even though he was a good man and not unjust, he was not justified and could not be saved!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A good man can go to hell!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If a just man can perish, how much more will unjust ones perish and go to hell?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Needless to say, you and I should go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He did not commit adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I do not know how many reading this message have committed adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You know and God knows.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The sin of adultery is filthy!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But many have defiled their beds through their flesh!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we agree that lusting in the heart is committing a sin, then there will be very few perfect people in the world!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Lord said, "That every one who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart" Matt 5:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Today few keep their bodies clean; even fewer keep their minds clean.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God surely will punish those who commit this kind of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He has to punish sin.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This Pharisee was a moral person; he did not do anything unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He never committed adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But the Lord said that the good Pharisee, who did not commit adultery, would perish and go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The destination of a good man is hell!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If such a good person is going to hell, then what about evil ones and adulterers?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Will not adulterers, all the more, go to hell?</S>
