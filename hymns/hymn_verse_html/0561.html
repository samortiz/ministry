This organism grows with His riches and expresses His divine life.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12436' href='#ref_12436'>John 15:8</a></span> In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit and so you will become My disciples.<br><b>fn 1 </b>In fruit-bearing the Father's divine life is expressed; hence, He is glorified.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12437' href='#ref_12437'>1 John 2:27</a></span> And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.<br><b>fn 8 </b>The Greek word means to stay (in a given place, state, relation, or expectancy); hence, to abide, remain, and dwell. To abide in Him is to abide in the Son and in the Father (v. 24). This is to remain and dwell in the Lord (John 15:4-5). It is also to abide in the fellowship of the divine life and to walk in the divine light (1:2-3, 6-7), i.e., abide in the divine light (v. 10). We should practice this abiding according to the teaching of the all-inclusive anointing, that our fellowship with God (1:3, 6) may be maintained.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12438' href='#ref_12438'>1 Cor 6:17</a></span> But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.<br><b>fn 1 </b>This refers to the believers' organic union with the Lord through believing into Him (John 3:15-16). This union is illustrated by that of the branches with the vine (John 15:4-5). It is a matter not only of life but in life (the divine life). Such a union with the resurrected Lord can only be in our spirit.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12442' href='#ref_12442'>Rom 6:5</a></span> For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection,<br><b>fn 1 </b>This denotes an organic union in which growth takes place, so that one partakes of the life and characteristics of the other. In the organic union with Christ, whatever Christ passed through has become our history. His death and resurrection are now ours because we are in Him and are organically joined to Him. This is grafting (11:24). Such a grafting (1) discharges all our negative elements, (2) resurrects our God-created faculties, (3) uplifts our faculties, (4) enriches our faculties, and (5) saturates our entire being to transform us.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

It is not the exchanging of a poor life for a better life. Rather, it is the uniting of two lives as one so that they may share one mingled life and one living. Such a mingling of life takes place when two similar yet different lives pass through death (cutting) and resurrection (growth). This depicts our union with Christ.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12440' href='#ref_12440'>Rom 11:17</a></span> But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them and became a fellow partaker of the root of fatness of the olive tree,<br><b>fn 2 </b>According to the word in Matt. 2:15, Out of Egypt I called My Son, a quotation from Hosea 11:1, Christ and the real Israel are one entity. When the Gentile believers are grafted into Christ, they are grafted into Israel, the cultivated olive tree, to become fellow partakers of the fatness (Christ) of the root (the patriarchs-v. 16), the unsearchable riches of God in Christ (Eph. 3:8). They and Israel have become the branches of Christ, the true vine (John 15:1, 5), and with Him the two have become the organism that expresses the Triune God.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

In the initial stage of Christ's shepherding, the lambs, the infants in Christ (John 21:15; 1 Pet. 2:2), feed on Christ as the green pasture and drink the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13), the resurrected pneumatic Christ, as the waters of rest.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12444' href='#ref_12444'>Gal 2:20</a></span> I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.<br><b>fn 3 </b>We have died in Christ through His death, but now He lives in us through His resurrection. His living in us is entirely by His being the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This point is fully developed in all the following chapters, where the Spirit is presented and emphasized as the very One whom we have received as life and in whom we should live.<br>The I, the natural person, inclines to keep the law that it might be perfect (Phil. 3:6), but God wants us to live Christ that God might be expressed in us through Him (Phil. 1:20-21). Hence, God's economy is that the I be crucified in Christ's death and that Christ live in us in His resurrection. To keep the law is to exalt it above all things in our life; to live Christ is to make Him the center and everything in our life. The law was used by God for a period of time to keep His chosen people in custody for Christ (3:23) and eventually to conduct them to Christ (3:24) that they might receive Him as life and live Him to be God's expression. Because Christ has come, the function of the law has been terminated, and Christ must replace the law in our lives for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
