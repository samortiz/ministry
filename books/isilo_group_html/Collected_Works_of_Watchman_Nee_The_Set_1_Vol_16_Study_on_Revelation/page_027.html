Revelation 7:15</H2><P>"Because of this they are before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits upon the throne will tabernacle over them." </P><P>"Because." According to the foregoing text, the reason that they can serve God is because they did not take the matter of sin lightly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Revelation 7:16-17</H2><P>"They will not hunger any more, neither will they thirst any more, neither will the sun beat upon them, nor any heat; for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and guide them to springs of waters of life; and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."</P><P>Compare this with Isaiah 49:10 (cf. Isa. 49:6; Acts 13:47; Isa 49:8; 2 Cor. 6:2).</P><P>"They will not hunger any more, neither will they thirst any more" is the fulfillment of hope. "Neither will the sun beat upon them, nor any heat." In the new city, there is no need of the light of the sun or moon (Rev. 21:23; 22:5). It is not that there is no sun or moon, but there is no need to use their light. Yet there is still night on the new earth (21:25); since there is "day," there must be night. "God will wipe away every tear" because there is no need to shed tears anymore.</P><P>One thing deserves our attention. The people in Revelation 7:9-17 and the man-child in Revelation 12:1-11 have many similarities:</P><P>(1) Revelation 7:10 says that they were redeemed by the Lamb. Revelation 12:11 says that the man-child overcame because of the blood of the Lamb.</P><P>(2) Revelation 7:9 says that they are standing before the throne. Revelation 12:5 says that the man-child is caught up to God and to His throne.</P><P>(3) Revelation 7:10 says, "Salvation to our God...and to the Lamb. Revelation 12:10 says, "Salvation...of our God and...Christ."</P><P>(4) Revelation 7:4 through 8 says that twelve tribes were sealed. Revelation 12:1 says that on the woman's head was a crown of twelve stars. The crown of twelve stars does not refer to the apostles. Joseph's dream of the twelve stars clearly indicates that they refer to the twelve tribes.</P><P>(5) Revelation 7:11 says that the angels are praising. Revelation 12:10 says that a loud voice in heaven speaks.</P><P>(6) The people in Revelation 7:9 must have resurrected bodies before the throne of God. The man-child in Revelation 12:5 also has a resurrected body. The words "caught up" must be interpreted according to the rule of interpreting visions and must not be interpreted literally. According to Acts 13:33-34, we see that it refers to resurrection. In addition, if Christ did not put on the resurrected body, He could not see God and would be reckoned as naked (2 Cor. 5:2-3; Exo. 20:26; 28:42). First Corinthians 15 speaks of the fact of resurrection, while 2 Corinthians 5 speaks of the condition of resurrection. At the present time, there is no Christian before the throne; this will happen only in the future. In Revelation 4:6 the glassy sea is empty. Not until Revelation 15:2 are there people on the glassy sea. Acts 2:34 clearly says that David did not ascend into the heavens. First Samuel 28:13 clearly says that Samuel came up out of the earth. This shows that they have not yet put on resurrected bodies. Their bodies are still in Paradise (in Paradise as in Luke 23:43 and in Hades as in Acts 2:27). Only the Lord descended out of heaven and still remained in heaven (John 3:13). Even the taking up of Enoch and Elijah was perhaps to a certain place that God has put them; they have not yet received a resurrected body.</P><P>(7) Revelation 7:15 says, "He who sits upon the throne will tabernacle over them," while Revelation 12:12 says, "O heavens and those who dwell in them." "Dwell in them" in the original Greek is "tabernacle in them."</P><P>(8) The ones in Revelation 7:9 are the overcomers because: (a) the "white robes" are promised to those in Sardis who have not contaminated their robes; (b) to be spared from the hour of trial is promised to the overcomers in Philadelphia who have kept the word of endurance; and (c) the palm branches signify victory. In the same way, the man-child in Revelation 12:5 is the overcomers, who rule over the nations with an iron rod.</P><P>This is the end of the inserted visions.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 16: Study on Revelation &nbsp; pg 27</div><br></body></html>
