<h2 class=head2>E. Israel in the Present Age and in the Coming Millennium</h2><p>In the present age the whole race of Israel has become poor and has lost the land of Canaan. At the Lord’s second coming, the coming millennium will be a jubilee to them, and they will return to their lost possession. They will have a long family reunion, a reunion that will last a thousand years.<p>Here I would like to point out that with the seven feasts in Leviticus 25 there are two consummations. The first group of feasts—Passover, unleavened bread, firstfruit, and Pentecost—consummates in the feast of Pentecost to have the Body of Christ. With the second group of feasts—the blowing of trumpets, propitiation, and tabernacles—the highlight is the millennium. These three feasts will consummate in the millennium. Therefore, the first consummation is Pentecost to produce, to bring in, the church life, and the second consummation is the millennium to bring in the full jubilee.<h2 class=head2>F. Neither Sowing, nor Reaping, nor Gathering  the Grapes of the Untrimmed Vines, but Eating the Produce Directly from the Field</h2><p>“The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you; you shall neither sow nor reap that which grows of itself, nor shall you gather the grapes of the untrimmed vines. For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat its produce directly from the field” (vv. 11-12). This signifies that in God’s jubilee no human work is needed. It is altogether a rest to man, and God bears all the responsibility-<h2 class=head2>G. In Buying or Selling the Land, the Price Was to Be Calculated according to the Number of Years after the Jubilee</h2><p>In buying or selling the land, the price was to be calculated according to the number of years after the jubilee (vv. 14-15). “According to the greater number of years you shall increase its price, and according to the fewness of years you shall reduce its price” (v. 16a). This signifies that our enjoyment of the divine possession in grace is within the limit of God’s grace. The measure of grace we receive is the measure of the jubilee we enjoy. Our enjoyment of the divine possession is measured by God’s grace.
