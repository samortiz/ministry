<h2 class="head1">WATER FLOWING OUT FROM THE THRESHOLD</h2><p>Ezekiel 47:1a says, &ldquo;Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward.&rdquo; In order for the water to flow forth, there must be a threshold, an opening, through which it can flow. This indicates that if we, through Christ, have more contact with God and draw closer to Him, there will be an opening which will allow the living water of God to flow out from the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RIVER FLOWING TOWARD THE EAST</h2><p>The river issues forth from the house and flows toward the east (v. 1b). The east is the direction of the glory of the Lord (Num. 2:3; Ezek. 43:2). The flowing toward the east indicates that the river of God will always flow in the direction of God&rsquo;s glory. The river cares for God&rsquo;s glory.</p><p>Everything in the church life should be for God&rsquo;s glory. For example, in our preaching of the gospel, we should seek the glory of God. If our gospel preaching is for God&rsquo;s glory, there will be an outflow of living water. However, if we do not care for the glory of God, the flow will be limited. Everyone in the church should seek and care for the glory of God. Then the living water will flow out from the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WATER FLOWING OUT<br />FROM THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HOUSE</h2><p>Ezekiel 47:1c also tells us that the water flows out from the right side of the house. According to the Bible the right side signifies the highest position. The flowing of the water from the right side indicates that the flow of the Lord should have the preeminence. We need to give the Lord the highest position, and we also need to give the flow of the Lord the highest position. Then the flow will be prevailing and become the controlling factor in our living and work.</p><h2 class="head1">FLOWING BY THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR</h2><p>The flowing is by the side of the altar (v. 1d). This indicates that the flow is always by the cross. If we do not have the dealing of the cross, the flow will be frustrated. If we would have the flow, we must have the dealing of the cross. We need to be willing to pass through the cross so that the flow may come forth.</p> <h2 class="head1">THE MAN WITH THE MEASURING REED</h2><p>The main point here is the man with the measuring reed in his hand (v. 3). This man, who is the Lord Jesus Himself, has the appearance of brass (40:3). As we have pointed out, in typology brass, or copper, signifies judgment and testing. The Lord Jesus was tested and judged as a man, and because He was tested and judged, He is now testing and judging. Because He was tested, He is qualified to test, and because He was judged, He is qualified to judge. He is the One with the measuring reed in His hand, fully qualified to measure us.</p><p>We have pointed out previously that to measure means to test, to judge, and to possess. When a sister is about to buy some cloth, she first examines the cloth and then measures it. Whatever amount she measures she also possesses. This indicates that to measure is to examine, test, judge, and eventually take over and possess.</p>
