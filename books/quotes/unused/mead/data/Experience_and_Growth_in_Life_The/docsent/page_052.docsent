   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: Sometimes as I enjoy the Lord, I receive His grace, and when situations arise, I am able to overcome them to remain in fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But at other times, when the Lord seems to be very distant, a situation comes in, I react, and it seems to take some length of time to restore my once peaceful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is this normal?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Answer: The Christian life is not a philosophical life of reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Christian life is a life of the three factors I have mentioned earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is a living Person with His history of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This Person with His history should be our experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should forget about all kinds of philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today most Christian teachers have turned biblical teachings into something philosophical.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Though I would agree that the Bible is the most philosophical book, the most thoughtful book, to make its teaching a philosophy is a big mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible does not reveal different kinds of philosophies.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It unveils a living Person, who is the Spirit today as the very consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This One is our need.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is a great deal of scientific knowledge concerning electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The need in our daily life is not this knowledge, but the power of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the same way, Christ with His death and resurrection should not be a philosophy to us, but something living and experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Philippians 3 Paul sought to know Christ as a living Person, to participate in His sufferings, and to be conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was not a philosophy to Paul, but a living Person with two living points.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must have the same desire, even the same vision, as Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we see such a vision, many of our improper prayers and foolish seeking will come to an end. Our need is to be unveiled to see a vision of Christ and His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am concerned that many of the young people will merely learn things in this training as they would in a school with a "textbook," without really seeing something.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My real burden is to help you see something.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As you read this message, I hope that you could see the living Person of Christ, His death, and His resurrection again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A hymn such as #642 in Hymns does not merely teach us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the contrary, it unveils spiritual reality to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our need is not just to learn doctrines, but to open ourselves to the Lord so that we can see something.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should pray, "Lord, I open myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I want to see more of You as an all-inclusive Person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Show me how Your all-inclusive death and resurrection includes me."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then as we listen to the speaking concerning Christ, we will begin to see something.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What we see becomes a reality within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we live by what we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The death and resurrection of Christ must become a vision to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the cross, not only was Christ crucified there, but also all the existing things in the universe were crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was on the cross representing the entire old creation, so when He died, we died with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His death was our death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, when He resurrected, we also resurrected with Him to be the people of His new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His resurrection was the birth, the germination, of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ is an all-inclusive Person, so His resurrection, based upon His all-inclusive death, is also all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>My burden is to help you see this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Vision comes from hearing and hearing comes from speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Christianity, the subtle enemy has cut off the proper speaking of Christ and His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But praise the Lord that He is still speaking today.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As long as He speaks and you hear, you also see a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once you see something, you also enjoy the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The reality is mainly composed of three factors: the all-inclusive Christ as a living Person, His all-inclusive death, and His all-inclusive resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we see these factors, we are brought into the realization and experience of them.</S>
