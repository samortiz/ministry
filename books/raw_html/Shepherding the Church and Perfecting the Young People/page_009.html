	 <h2 class="head2">Elders Needing to Labor in the Word and Teaching</h2>
<p>The Bible says that the elders should shepherd the flock of God. First Timothy 5:17 says, &ldquo;Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.&rdquo; This verse says that the elders who lead well are those who labor in word and teaching. Hence, to shepherd with feeding is to teach with the Lord&rsquo;s word. The elders in a local church should bear the responsibility of shepherding and feeding. This can be compared to parents bearing responsibility in a family. The elders should not excuse themselves and say that they do not have the gift of preaching the word. Such a thought is the influence of traditional Christianity. When we first began meeting as the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, we were greatly helped by the Brethren. They were the first group of believers to recover the church life, but they paid too much attention to the gift of preaching the word. In their consideration a person could not give a message unless he had the gift of preaching. However, we have clearly seen 1 Corinthians 14:31, which says, &ldquo;You can all prophesy one by one.&rdquo; Hence, we should uproot the concept of not having the gift of preaching the word. We need to learn how to use God&rsquo;s word to feed others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Depending on Full-time Serving Ones</h2>
<p>Whether you have the gift of prophesying does not matter, because 1 Corinthians 14:31 says, &ldquo;You can all prophesy one by one.&rdquo; This can be compared to a married sister who must cook even though she says that she does not know how to cook. In 1962 I went to the United States, and after being there for ten months, I was able to cook even though I had never cooked previously. I had to cook because I had to feed myself. Initially, I ate meals that others prepared, but as a result, I suffered from an ulcer. That was the result of my inability to cook. But when I began to eat my cooking, my ulcer was cured. I give this example to say that we have depended too long on others. The elders in the local churches depend on the co-workers and exalt them. The co-workers are like famous chefs whom we invite to our homes to cook for us. Actually, in terms of the skills in giving a message, some co-workers may be far inferior to the elders. I hope that we will be enlightened to see our mistakes. The concept that whoever serves full time is able to preach the word and whoever does not serve full time is not able to preach the word is erroneous.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking to Meet the Need</h2>
<p>It is correct to say that we can all prophesy one by one. However, the ability to give messages is not the result of a change in status; it does not come when a person begins to serve full time. A brother does not gain an ability to preach the word simply because he begins to serve full time. There are several elders who are very capable of giving good messages. As soon as they begin to speak, they hit the mark. If the elders are willing to endeavor, their speaking will be effective. We do not give messages in order to receive people&rsquo;s praise. The movements of a boxer are not to gain people&rsquo;s applause; rather, his sole aim is to deliver a blow to his opponent. We do not want to give lengthy and eloquent messages that are ineffective. We want to give messages that are effective because they touch people&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>Our speaking needs to be effective. We do not care whether the message is appealing or grammatical. We care about touching people&rsquo;s heart. Once after D. L. Moody, a prevailing American evangelist, preached the gospel, he was approached by a learned person who was in the congregation. This person told Moody that he had used mistaken grammar in his message. Moody was not an educated person; in his youth he was an apprentice in his uncle&rsquo;s shoe store. But after the Lord gained him, he was fervent to work for the Lord by preaching the gospel. Moody then suggested that this person preach the gospel with his correct grammar to see how many would be saved. Moody was very clear that he preached the word not to teach English grammar but to lead people to salvation. He cared only for people to be saved.</p>
<p>Some brothers speak with an accent. This is difficult to change. Nevertheless, as long as they are willing to practice, they will be able to give a message that is effective. Some brothers use beautiful words, but their speaking does not touch people. Some brothers articulate their words and are eloquent and logical, but their speaking produces no fruit. They may remain in a place for two years, but the place remains the same. There are others whose messages are ordinary but effective. Our goal is to give effective messages.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the elders should not expect the co-workers to bear the responsibility of ministering the word. They should not expect the co-workers to meet the need of the church. On the other hand, the co-workers must have a heart for the church and give messages that are effective. Otherwise, their speaking is not useful. The elders must learn to speak the word. I do not say this to depreciate the co-workers. I say this because the localities rely too much on the co-workers. We need to be delivered and to change our concept. We do not attend meetings in order to listen to beautiful messages, and the full-time workers are not the only ones who should give messages.</p>
