   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD'S INVISIBLE PRESENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Even today He is here, but He would not appear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to our weakness we all would like to see Him appear.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But you have to realize that His appearing is not so good as His not appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus came to train His disciples to realize His invisible presence because they were used to His visible appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They never had the experience of His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So the Lord Jesus came to train them by appearing to them and then by disappearing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Where did He go after He disappeared?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He remained in them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From that time He never left, but Peter and all the other disciples did not realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Soon they became disappointed again, and Peter said he was going fishing John 21:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When he went fishing all the others went fishing with him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They didn't realize that when they went fishing they took the Lord Jesus with them because He was in them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose you go to a movie.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do you realize that when you go to a movie you take the Lord Jesus there because He is within you?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While they were fishing, the Lord Jesus was suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It may be that the Lord Jesus did something to keep all the fish away, because they fished the entire night and caught nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>TWO STEPS OF BECOMING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through His death and resurrection He became a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The last Adam is not so simple as the first one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first Adam did not have God in him, but the last Adam was God becoming flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The last Adam was a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The good news is that after Him there is no more Adam, because He was the last Adam!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may ask then, Am I not an Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Adam you are an Adam, but in this last Adam you are no more an Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The last Adam was the ending of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The last Adam who was God becoming a man became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are two "becames" with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Word became flesh, and this flesh was the last Adam, and this last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without these two steps He could never get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He became flesh first to dwell among men, and then He became the Spirit to dwell in His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He reaches us by two steps of becoming.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First, He as God became a man to be the last Adam, and second, this last Adam became a Spirit to enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The last Adam in the flesh went to the cross to redeem us and to solve all the problems of sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After solving those problems He became the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, the Word became flesh and dwelt among men to be the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After taking away the sin of the world as the Lamb of God, He took another step to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today He is both the Lamb, the Redeemer and the Spirit, the life giver.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is both!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Most Christians today only know a gospel of Christ as the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They do not know a gospel of Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They only know that Christ is the Lamb of God taking away the sin of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They do not realize that the same Christ is also the Spirit to give life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is both the Lamb to take away sin and the Spirit to give life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If He were just the Lamb to take away sin, that would not be adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may illustrate with the altar in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Just to come to the altar to solve your sin problem is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you only come to the altar, you are still not in the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You must enter into the tabernacle to be in God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How can you enter into the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Redeemer who has become the life-giving Spirit has to enter into you, and then He becomes the very way of life for you to enter into God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today He is no more merely the Lamb, the Redeemer, to take away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is also the Spirit that gives us life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In John 10:10 He said that He came that we might have life and even have it abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But if He had never entered into resurrection how could He give us life?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He had to enter into resurrection that He might become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today He is not only the Redeemer, but also the life giver.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now in resurrection He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
