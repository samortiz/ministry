   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FIRST MARY BEING ONE WHO LOST HER OWN STATUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If a person wants to allow Christ to be born in him, and if he wants to experience Christ's death and resurrection, this person must be a Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is it to be a Mary?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we read their stories, we have to bow our heads and worship the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps they did not have much learning, talent, or knowledge, but they did have a love for Christ and the experience of letting Him pass through them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first Mary loved the Lord Jesus to the extent that she forsook her own status.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the angel told her that she would conceive in her womb and bear a son, she replied, "How will this be, since I have not known a man?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then the angel answered and said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you" Luke 1:28-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this pure virgin to receive this commission, she had to sacrifice her status.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even her fianc misunderstood her and wanted to send her away.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows that this Mary had experienced the Lord Jesus, allowed Him to pass through her, and entirely disregarded her own status.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everyone who experiences the Lord must be one who loses himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today some Christians do not give Christ the way to pass through them and to fill them because they are not willing to sacrifice their status.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are truly saved, but they do not let Christ pass through them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the reason that they do not allow this?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They do not allow this because they have their own status and are not willing to sacrifice or lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One who truly loves the Lord and wants to experience the Lord must be one who sacrifices his own status.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Mary was a virgin, but she was willing to sacrifice her status of being a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If she had maintained her status of being a virgin, the incarnation of Christ could not have happened in her.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although many among us have been saved, Christ still does not have a way to pass through us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is the reason that He does not have a way?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is because we stay in our status and are not willing to forsake it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all know about the great and famous revival of the Moravians in history.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The unique reason for that revival was that there was a person who allowed Christ to pass through him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A young count named Zinzendorf loved the Lord to the extent that he forsook the title of count and became even more common than the common people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because he sacrificed his own status, Christ had the way to pass through him, to fill him, and to gain ground in him so that he could be an outlet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This led to a big revival.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today our big problem is that even though we preach Christ, very few of us are willing to sacrifice our own status.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a boss is willing to not act like a boss due to his love for the Lord, this is to sacrifice his status as a boss.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a person is not willing to sacrifice his status, Christ will not have the way to pass through him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some Christians are very spiritual, but the problem we find in them is that they want to maintain their status.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Despite the fact that they love and pursue the Lord, they still have this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is this problem that prevents Christ from passing through them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A man should maintain his status as a man; however, as a lover of the Lord, he must be willing to cooperate with the Lord when the Lord requires him to sacrifice his status.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps someone will ask, "What does it mean to sacrifice one's status?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I will give you some examples.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Suppose a saint who is a manager says to his employee, "Tomorrow is the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Go and hear the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is an example of one who is not willing to sacrifice his status.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose a wife says to her maidservant, "Amah Wang, if you do not believe in Jesus, you will not be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although her word is right, Christ will not be able to come out of her because she remains in her status.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some people bring their status with them when they come into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A saint who is in a suit may not shake hands with another saint who pulls a cart for a living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He will shake hands only with a boss.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is status.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not to say that those who love the Lord and are touched by the Lord's love will be unethical people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In fact, they will be very ethical and will love their colleagues and servants even more.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a manager is touched by the Lord, he will be able to exhort his employee, saying, "In the flesh I am your manager, and you are my employee.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But in fact, we both are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What a sad thing it will be if you do not receive the Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I look to the Lord that you would sincerely listen to the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Please remember that this is not a doctrine but is Christ's coming out of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes people are willing to give up everything except their status.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The rich fellowship with the rich, the learned fellowship with the learned, the students fellowship with the students, and those who have a position fellowship with others who have a position.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some people may say, "Birds of a feather flock together."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In principle, however, as Christians we are all of the same species.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The problem is that outwardly we all have a status that we are not willing to sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As a result, the Christ within us cannot come out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why is it that we still have status, and why are we not willing to lose our status?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is because we do not love the Lord enough.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As human beings, we should keep our status; however, as lovers of the Lord, we should overflow life and release Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Please remember that the first requirement for the overflow of life is to lose one's status.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The reason that your servants and employees are not saved is that you are not willing to lose your status.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As men, we have our own status; however, as lovers of the Lord, we have no status.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If for the Lord's sake, the richer saints in the church fellowship with the poorer saints, what a beautiful scene this will be!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If as a rich person with a high status and a good family, you invite some poor saints to your home to have fellowship, how beautiful this will be!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is not to say that you must do this in order to be a Christian; rather, this is to say that even though you are saved, Christ will not be able to have a way in you or to pass through you if you do not lose your status.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>May the Lord have mercy on us to show us that the church is Christ Himself and the outflow of Christ's life.</S>
