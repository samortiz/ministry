   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is all that God cares for.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>On the one hand, we are happy because our flesh has been crushed.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>On the other hand, we are unhappy because the flesh will remain with us until the day of our maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When we are fully matured, we can say good-bye to the flesh and thank it for its help.</S>
