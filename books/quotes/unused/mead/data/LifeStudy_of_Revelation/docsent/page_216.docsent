   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WARRIOR A. Riding on a White Horse</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 11 says, And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here Christ, the Bridegroom as the Commander-in-chief, appears riding on a white horse.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The horse of the first seal is also white and signifies the preaching of the gospel 6:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, both Christ and the gospel ride on a white horse.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the book of Revelation, white indicates being pure, bright, justified, and approved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is vastly different from what is indicated by the colors of the other three horses in chapter six red, black, and pale green.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even today we are riding on this white horse.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our preaching of the gospel is pure, bright, justified, and absolutely approved by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ will ride on this horse as He fights against His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. Called Faithful and True</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 11 Christ is called Faithful and True.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is faithful both to God and to those who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His faithfulness He defeats and destroys those who oppose God and persecute the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is true in carrying out God s economy and in caring for those who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is trustworthy, and with Him there is no falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>C. Judging and Fighting in Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 11 also says, In righteousness He judges and makes war.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ will judge and fight in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He judges by fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is true even today that no wrongdoers would accept the judgments of our courts if the government had no police force to back up these judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Judgment can only be executed by police power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Christ comes to judge Antichrist, Antichrist will be utterly rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, there will be the need for Christ to fight to subdue this rebellion and to judge these rebels in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His judging by fighting is not only according to righteousness; it is also to maintain righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>D. With Eyes like a Flame of Fire</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 12 says, And His eyes are a flame of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This signifies Christ s judging eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He will judge according to what He sees.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His flaming eyes will carry out His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>E. Crowned with Many Diadems</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As the Warrior, Christ has many diadems on His head v. 12 . Every diadem is a kind of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is crowned and glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because He has been crowned with many kinds of glories Heb 2:9 , He wears many diadems.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>F. Having a Name Written,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Known Only to Himself</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the One on the white horse, the Lord has a name written which no one knows but Himself v. 12 . The experience of Christ can never be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we experience Him, we come to know a particular aspect of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, there are certain aspects of Christ that will not be experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only He Himself knows what these aspects are.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This indicates that the Christ whom we experience is inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because we have experienced His redemption, we know Him as the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because we have experienced Him as light, life, manna, power, strength, holiness, and comfort, we know Him in all these aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have experienced so many items of Christ s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But because there are some items which we have not experienced, He still has a name known only to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, we do not know this name.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No matter how much we have experienced Christ, there is still something about Him unknown to us because we have not experienced it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>G. With a Garment Dipped in Blood</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verse 13 says, And He is clothed with a garment dipped in blood.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The garment of Christ is dipped in blood and becomes red by His treading the winepress of the wine of the fury of the wrath of God v. 15; Isa 63:1-3 at Armageddon 16:14, 16 , where the blood will rise up to the bridles of the horses 14:20 .</S>
