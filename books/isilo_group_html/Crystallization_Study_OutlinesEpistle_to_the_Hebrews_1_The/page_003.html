<h1 class="title">The Son&mdash;His Divinity</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 1:1-13</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Son is God Himself speaking&mdash;Heb. 1:1-2a, 8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To say that God has spoken to us in the Son means that God speaks in Himself.</li>
	<li>God has spoken in the Son (v. 2a), and the Son is God; this indicates that God speaks in Himself.</li>
	<li>The Son speaks God, declares God, and defines God&mdash;John 1:1, 14, 18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Son is the center, the focus, of the book of Hebrews&mdash;1:2a, 5, 8; 3:6; 4:14; 5:5, 8; 6:6; 7:3, 28; 10:29:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s being the Son of God implies the expression of God, the issue, or the coming out, of God&mdash;John 1:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>There is an important difference between Christ as the embodiment of God and as the issue of God:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ as the embodiment of God is related to God&rsquo;s existence; Christ is the complete God as His embodiment&mdash;Col. 2:9.</li>
			<li>Christ as the issue of God is related to God&rsquo;s expression; Christ is the coming out, the emergence, of God as His expression.</li>
			<li>The Father as the fountain emerges in the Son as the spring&mdash;John 4:14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In Judaism God is true but hidden, whereas in God&rsquo;s salvation God is expressed; this expressed God is God the Son.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Regarding the Son of God there are two aspects: the aspect of the only begotten Son of God and the aspect of the firstborn Son of God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>From eternity until the time of His resurrection, Christ was the Son of God only in the aspect of the only begotten Son of God&mdash;John 1:18; 3:16.</li>
		<li>Through resurrection Christ became the Son of God in the aspect of the firstborn Son of God&mdash;Heb. 1:5-6; Rom. 1:3-4; Acts 13:33:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>As the only begotten Son of God, Christ is the embodiment of the divine life&mdash;John 1:4; 1 John 5:11-12.</li>
			<li>Through resurrection Christ became the firstborn Son of God as the life-dispenser for the propagation of the life embodied in Him&mdash;Rom. 1:3-4; 8:10, 6, 11, 29.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In His first coming Christ was the only begotten Son; in His second coming He will be the firstborn Son&mdash;Heb. 1:6-8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the Godhead the Son is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of His substance&mdash; Heb. 1:3a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The glory is the outward expression, and the substance is the inward essence.</li>
	<li>With respect to glory as the outward expression of God, the Son is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory is like the shining of the light of the sun.</li>
		<li>The Son is the shining, the brightness, of the Father&rsquo;s glory.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>With respect to substance as the inward essence of God, the Son is the impress of God&rsquo;s substance:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The impress of God&rsquo;s substance is like the impress of a seal.</li>
		<li>The Son is the expression of the Father&rsquo;s substance, the expression of what the Father is.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>For the Son to be the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of God&rsquo;s substance means that the Son is God coming to us:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Son is God reaching us, God coming to be one with us.</li>
		<li>In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, we have a God who reaches us, a God who comes to us to save us and to dispense Himself into us.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In God&rsquo;s creation the Son is the Creator, the Upholder, and the Heir:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the past all things came into existence in Him, through Him, and unto Him&mdash;Heb. 1:2; John 1:3; 1 Cor. 8:6; Col. 1:16.</li>
	<li>In the present the Son upholds all things by the word of His power, and all things cohere in Him&mdash;Heb. 1:3; Col. 1:17.</li>
	<li>In the future the Son will be the Heir to inherit all things&mdash;Heb. 1:2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In redemption the Son has accomplished the purification of sins and is now sitting on the right hand of the Majesty on high, waiting for the subduing of His enemies&mdash;Heb. 1:3, 13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Son has taken away sin and has made purification of sins by offering Himself as a sacrifice for our sins&mdash;John 1:29; Heb. 10:12; 9:26.</li>
	<li>The Son&rsquo;s sitting at the right hand of God in the heavens signifies that His work has been accomplished and that He is resting there&mdash;Heb. 1:13; 8:1; 10:12; 12:2.</li>
	<li>The Son is waiting for the subduing of His enemies, that is, waiting for God to set His enemies as a footstool for His feet&mdash;Heb. 1:13; 10:13.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Hebrews 1 presents a marvelous revelation of the Son in His divinity from eternity past to eternity future:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Son was the Creator of the earth and the heavens&mdash;vv. 10, 2.</li>
	<li>The Son is the Upholder of all things&mdash;v. 3.</li>
	<li>The Son is the Heir of all things&mdash;v. 2.</li>
	<li>The Son, having been incarnated for redemption by crucifixion, made purification of sins&mdash;v. 3.</li>
	<li>The Son was begotten in resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God&mdash;v. 5.</li>
	<li>The Son, in His ascension, sat down on the right hand of God in the heavens&mdash;v. 3.</li>
	<li>The Son will come again as the Firstborn&mdash; vv. 6-8.</li>
	<li>The Son will be the King on the throne with the scepter in the kingdom&mdash;vv. 8-9.</li>
	<li>The Son will remain forever and ever in eternity future&mdash;v. 12.</li>
	</ol></li>
