 <h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S GIFT AND<br />
COMMISSION TO HIS RECOVERY<br />
IN THE DIVINE TRUTHS</h2>
<p>Now we want to see the Lord&rsquo;s gift and commission to His recovery in the divine truths.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Having Opened to Us<br />
His Divine Revelation from the Making<br />
of His Eternal Economy to the Consummation<br />
of His Eternal Goal&mdash;the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>The Lord has opened to us His divine revelation from the making of His eternal economy to the consummation of His eternal goal&mdash;the New Jerusalem. All the messages we have published unveil the items and details included from God&rsquo;s making of His eternal economy to the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Having Commissioned Us<br />
with the Ministry of His Word</h2>
<p>The Lord has also commissioned us with the ministry of His word. After I was sent to Taiwan from mainland China, we began to publish a paper entitled <em>The Ministry of the Word.</em> Today our ministry has reached the point of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and God&rsquo;s dispensing. In 1984 I shared concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy in Stuttgart, Germany and a number of localities in the United States. These are included in a book we have published entitled <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy.</em> I still have more to speak concerning God&rsquo;s economy and God&rsquo;s dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Having Provided Us<br />
with the Marvelous Environment<br />
for the Release of His Divine Revelation</h2>
<p>The Lord has provided us with the marvelous environment for the release of the divine revelation. When I began to minister the word in Los Angeles in 1962, we had only conferences and informal trainings. When we moved to Anaheim in 1974, I made the decision to have two ten-day trainings every year. Because these trainings are in the principle of a school, those who come need to be properly enrolled. This helped not only in training the saints but also in having a proper, clear, uplifted atmosphere for the release of the divine truths.</p>
<p>I also decided to have the trainings to help us in the publishing of the ministry. Much of what Brother Nee shared was never put into print. I feel very sorry about this. Because I saw this situation, I decided that after I leave, I do not want the truths the Lord has shown me to be left in my grave. I want to put out whatever the Lord has shown me.</p>
<p>Brother Nee first put out a monthly periodical called <em>The Christian.</em> The subscribers had to pay one dollar a year for this periodical. The orders for this periodical eventually went up to ten thousand copies a month. Later, he changed to publish a periodical called <em>The Present Testimony</em> without subscription. When the situation was ready, he put out an issue. Sometimes he did not publish an issue for a long time.</p>
<p>For the expounding of the New Testament and the publishing of this exposition for the benefit of the churches and the Lord&rsquo;s children, I made the decision to have two trainings yearly with the help from the trainees and the work of the polishers and the serving ones in the ministry office so that the word of the Lord&rsquo;s truths may be released regularly. This practice helped a lot for the publishing of the interpreted, expounded, and understood Word for seventeen years without any interruption. I consider this as a marvelous environment for the release of God&rsquo;s divine revelation.</p>
<p>I am full of thanks to the Lord for His supply to meet every need. I am also thankful to the Lord that we have been able to have two annual trainings for the last seventeen years without interruption. This has been the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. He has provided us with the marvelous environment for the release of His divine revelation. I am sorry that my senior co-worker, Brother Nee, did not have such an environment.</p>
<p>We have over forty faithful, full-time workers in our three offices in Anaheim, Irving, and Taipei. In addition to these workers, a number of other saints volunteer their time to help us spread the truths. We are serving the churches all over the earth with the publishing and the tape ministries, and we have been doing this for over seventeen years. I thank the Lord that we have such a marvelous environment for the release of His divine revelation. I am thankful to the Lord that much of what I have spoken has been put into print. Even if I die, my word in the Lord still speaks. He has provided us with the marvelous environment for the release of His divine revelation.</p>
