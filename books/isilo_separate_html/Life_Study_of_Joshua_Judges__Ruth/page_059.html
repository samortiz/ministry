<p>Elimelech left in the days of the rule of the judges, under Israel&rsquo;s forsaking of God and under their degradation, confusion, and corruption.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Due to a Famine in the Good Land</h2>
<p>Elimelech left due to a famine in the good land, a lacking of life supply for living and satisfaction as a punishment of God (Lev. 26:26; Ezek. 14:13). We may wonder how there could be a famine in the good land since God had promised that it would be a land flowing with milk and honey. God sent a famine to His people as a serious punishment. He punished them by stopping their food supply. Because they had forsaken Him as their source and Husband and had gone to idols, He let them go to their idols for food as well. There was no food from God and no food from the illegal husband of their harlotry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. With His Wife and Two Sons</h2>
<p>Elimelech left the good land with his wife and two sons, who were good for the increase of the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. God&rsquo;s Chastisement<br />
in Moab over the House of Elimelech</h2>
<p>Ruth 1:3 and 5 speak of God&rsquo;s chastisement over the house of Elimelech. Elimelech was punished by God with death upon himself and his two sons. This left his wife, Naomi, as a widow with two daughters-in-law in a foreign country. That was the pitiful result of Elimelech&rsquo;s swerving from the rest in God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. NAOMI&rsquo;S RETURNING TO THE REST<br />
IN GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>In verses 4 through 7 and 19 through 22 we see Naomi&rsquo;s returning to the rest in God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. From Moab</h2>
<p>Naomi returned from Moab, the country of idolatry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. To Judah</h2>
<p>Naomi returned to Judah, the land of Immanuel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Having Been Stripped by God<br />
of Her Husband and of Her Two Sons</h2>
<p>Naomi returned because she had been stripped by God first of her husband and then of her two sons, leaving her and her two daughters-in-law as widows without children (vv. 5, 20-21). Naomi returned also because she had heard that Jehovah had visited His people by giving them food (v. 6). In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we also have experienced the Lord&rsquo;s merciful visitation. During the last several years He has blessed us and supplied us with rich food.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. With Ruth, Her Daughter-in-law</h2>
<p>Naomi returned with Ruth, her daughter-in-law given to her by God for the accomplishment of His economy concerning Christ (v. 22a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Arriving at Bethlehem</h2>
<p>Naomi arrived at Bethlehem, the birthplace of the coming Christ (vv. 19a, 22b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. All the City Being Stirred</h2>
<p>All the city was stirred because of Naomi and Ruth, and the women said, &ldquo;Is this Naomi?&rdquo; (v. 19b). Naomi said to them, &ldquo;Do not call me Naomi [meaning &lsquo;my pleasantness&rsquo;]; call me Mara [meaning &lsquo;bitterness&rsquo;]; for the All-sufficient One has dealt very bitterly with me. I went out full, but Jehovah has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, when Jehovah has afflicted me and the All-sufficient One has dealt harshly with me?&rdquo; (vv. 20-21).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. RUTH&rsquo;S CHOOSING FOR HER GOAL</h2>
<p>In verses 8 through 18 we have an account of Ruth&rsquo;s choosing for her goal.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Naomi&rsquo;s Proposal<br />
to Her Two Daughters-in-law for Their Future</h2>
<p>Naomi made a proposal to her two daughters-in-law for their future. She said to them, &ldquo;Go and return, each of you, to your mother&rsquo;s house. May Jehovah deal kindly with you, just as you have dealt with the dead and with me. May Jehovah grant you to find rest, each of you in the house of your husband&rdquo; (vv. 8-9a). Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice and wept, saying to her, &ldquo;No, we will return with you to your people&rdquo; (vv. 9b-10). Naomi told them to return and then asked them, &ldquo;Why should you go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? Return, my daughters, go; for I am too old to have a husband. If I said, I have hope; even if I had a husband tonight and even bore sons; would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from having a husband? No, my daughters; it has been far more bitter for me than it should be for you, for the hand of Jehovah has gone forth against me&rdquo; (vv. 11-13). When the daughters-in-law heard this, they lifted up their voice and wept again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her. Naomi said to Ruth, &ldquo;Your sister-in-law has now returned to her people and to her gods; return with your sister-in-law&rdquo; (vv. 14-15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Ruth&rsquo;s Choosing to Go with Naomi</h2>
<p>Ruth said to Naomi, &ldquo;Do not entreat me to leave you and turn away from following after you. For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you dwell, I will dwell; and your people will be my people, and your God will be my God. Where you die, I will die; and there will I be buried. Jehovah do so to me, and more as well, if anything but death parts me from you&rdquo; (vv. 16-17). When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she ceased speaking to her about it (v. 18).</p>
<p>Ruth chose the goal of participating with God&rsquo;s elect in the enjoyment of Christ, and she even became a top ancestor of Christ who helped bring forth Christ into mankind. This was more than just a resolution on the part of the Moabite widow; it was a goal, a choosing. Ruth chose God and His kingdom for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy concerning Christ. Hallelujah for such a goal and for such a person choosing this goal!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> </body></html>
