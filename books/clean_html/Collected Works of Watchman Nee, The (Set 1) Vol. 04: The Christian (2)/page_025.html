<P>What a comforting word! Although Christ is the judge expressing His majesty, and although the saints bear a serious responsibility before Him, John heard someone say, "Do not fear." Why? It is because the Lord Jesus, who is alive and who is the First and the Last, has become a man and has died and resurrected. "Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification" (Rom. 4:25). "In this...we have boldness in the day of the judgment because even as He is, so also are we in this world" (1 John 4:17). He has overcome Satan, and He has annulled the sting of death and the power of Hades. He is now holding "the keys of death and of Hades." Because He has died and resurrected, we should not fear.</P><P>Only the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus can give us boldness to stand before the judgment seat. Through His substitutional death and resurrection, we are delivered from the condemnation of the eternal lake of fire. Through His death and resurrection we are saved from the shame before the judgment seat. We should ask whether or not our boast is the Lord's death and resurrection. Everything else will fail. Those who are spiritually strong and well prepared are such, not because they are more advanced than others, but because they depend and draw more upon the Lord's death and resurrection. Here we can see the absolute need for a union with the Lord in His death and resurrection. The Lord reached the place of His authority through His death and resurrection. We cannot take any other way. "For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection" (Rom. 6:5). We reckon ourselves to be dead to sin and living to God in Christ Jesus (Rom. 6:11). When with faith we plant ourselves together in the likeness of the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, we will make it. Our death is a death to sin, to self, and to everything that is Adamic and satanic. Our living is a living unto God and all His virtues. The Lord Jesus has already completed all of His salvationâ€”both to sinners and to the saints. We need only to receive it by faith.</P><P>He is "the First," the source of all things; He is "the Last," the consummation of all things. God says in Isaiah 41:4: "I, Jehovah, am the first, / And with the last, I am He"; also, in 44:6, "I am the First and I am the Last"; and in 48:12, "I am He; I am the First, / I am also the Last." "The First" and "the Last" are names of God. This indicates the divinity of the Lord Jesus. He is before eternity past. He is also after eternity future.</P><P>He is "the living One." The Lord Jesus is life (John 1:4). He is doubtless the living One. This is what the Lord Jesus meant when He said in John, "I am...the life" (John 11:25). His life is not a created life; He exists forever. He is the source of life.</P><P>"I became dead." This is not for His own sins. It is a sin even to think that He has sins. This is for the sins of the world. The death of the Lord Jesus is "the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous" (1 Pet. 3:18). Through His death, He has given life to us. Oh saints, let us meditate more upon this wonderful death.</P><P>"And behold, I am living forever and ever." He is resurrected from death. Many people have met death and have died. They did not come back; there was no resurrection. God allowed Him to die and gave Him an opportunity to overcome death. Without battle there is no victory; without death there is no victory over death. He died and fought with death. He overcame it, and thus He resurrected. Death cannot cause Him to die forever. This proves that He is fully the living One. We can say that He has been "bench tested" in His experience to be the living One. Because He is "the resurrection," He is also "the life" (John 11:25). He is the resurrection; hence, He is the life. He resurrected for man. Hence, because of His resurrection, man can be resurrected.</P><P>"I am living forever and ever." There is only one death of the Lord and also only one resurrection of the Lord. He is living forever and ever. He will die no more, and He will resurrect from death no more. The Lord Jesus is God. For a while He humbled Himself to become a man that He could die and resurrect. Now He is living forever and ever. He has received back the glory of God which He had in eternity past, but now the glory of man has also been added. This kind of living is not only for Himself. We, the saints, are being "saved in His life" (Rom. 5:10). "He lives always to intercede" for us (Heb. 7:25). He Himself has promised, "Because I live, you also shall live" (John 14:19).</P><P>"And I have the keys of death and of Hades." Everything after this life is in the hands of the Lord. Death and Hades are put together in many places in this book. Chapter six, verse 8 seems to consider death and Hades as one following the other. Chapter twenty, verse 14 talks about the end of both. In both verses death and Hades are treated as if they are personified. We can see this in the New Testament. The devil holds the power of death (Heb. 2:14). Matthew 16:18 speaks of the gates of Hades. The one who is behind death and Hades is the devil. Therefore, when the Bible speaks of death and Hades, a personification is implied in the words.</P><P>It is of great significance that here the word death is linked to the word Hades. Death is related to the body, and Hades is related to the soul. Chapter six, verse 8 indicates that Hades receives the soul after the death of the physical body. According to chapter twenty, verse 13, death delivers up the body, and Hades delivers up the soul.</P><P>While the meaning of death is obvious to us, there are many things about Hades that many do not understand. In the original language Hades means the underworld. It is located in the heart of the earth (Matt. 12:40; Num. 16:30-33). It is separated into two parts: a part for the fallen ones and a part for the saved ones (Luke 16:19-31). The part for the fallen ones has burning fire. This is Hades proper. The part in which the saved ones stay is a place of comfort. The Bible calls it Paradise or Abraham's bosom. Hades is not the grave because man's grave is not in the heart of the earth (Matt. 12:40; Amos 9:2). Nor is Hades equivalent to hell or the lake of fire because inside the lake of fire (or hell) there is not only fire but there are also worms (Mark 9:48) and brimstone (Rev. 20:10), whereas Hades has only fire. What is called the bottomless pit, or tartarus, in the Bible is either Hades with a different name or part of a place that is sectioned into regions, one of which is called Hades while the other is called the bottomless pit.</P><P>Since the Lord Jesus holds the key of death and of Hades, He can resurrect those in them to receive judgment before Him. Thanks be to the Lord, for "then the word which is written will come to pass, `Death has been swallowed up unto victory.'" We have to rejoice and shout, "Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?" (1 Cor. 15:54-55).</P><P>What we are looking forward to is not death because death is our enemy (1 Cor. 15:26). We are looking forward to the time when the Lord will come again. In the present age, the Lord is not recovering the original creation from the grip of death and Hades. Rather, He is opening a door in death and Hades and leading us to a place of greater blessing. "Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness" (Judg. 14:14). Our Lord is the One who brings forth riches out of poverty. How wonderful is His way of salvation!</P>
