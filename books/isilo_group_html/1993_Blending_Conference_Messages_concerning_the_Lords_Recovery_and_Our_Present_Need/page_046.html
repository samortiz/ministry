Psalm 133 shows us that God's peoples dwelling in unity is the base of God's anointing and of God's refreshing grace that they may participate in the God-commanded blessing of life forevermore.</P><P>Psalm 133 reads, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is/For brothers to dwell in unity!/It is like the fine oil upon the head/That ran down upon the beard,/Upon Aaron's beard,/That ran down to the hem of his garments;/Like the dew of Hermon/That came down upon the mountains of Zion. /For there Jehovah commanded the blessing:/Life forever." The unity spoken of in verse 1 is a picture of the New Testament oneness. This unity is like the fine oil as the anointing ointment that was put upon the head of the high priest (Exo. 30:23-25, 30). In the Old Testament Aaron is a type of Christ, our High Priest today, and the oil poured on his head is a type of the anointing Spirit in the New Testament (Luke 4:18). In the Old Testament type the anointing oil ran down upon Aaron's beard and eventually reached the hem of his priestly garments. This anointing oil ran down not quickly but slowly, saturating and permeating as it went, all the way to the extremity of his being. This shows that not only the head but also the entire body of the high priest was anointed. This is a marvelous picture of the anointing Spirit upon Christ, the High Priest as the Head, and the church as the Body (2 Cor. 1:21; Heb. 1:9). The base of such an anointing is the oneness of God's people.</P><P>The oneness of God's people is also like the dew of Hermon that came down upon the mountains of Zion. The dew here signifies God's refreshing grace. This refreshing grace is actually the Triune God dispensed into us for our enjoyment. The base for such an enjoyment is the oneness of the church.</P><P>God's anointing and God's refreshing grace bring in the God-commanded blessing of life forevermore. This is the blessing of the Triune God as our eternal life in the church life today, in the kingdom in the coming age, and in the New Jerusalem in eternity.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>1993 Blending Conference Messages concerning the Lord's Recovery and Our Present Need &nbsp; pg 46</div><br></body></html>
