        <h2 class="head1">DEPENDING ON GOD&rsquo;S WORD<br />
AND ENVIRONMENTAL AFFLICTIONS<br />
FOR THE SAVING OF OUR SOUL</h2>
<p>Although man has a spirit, he does not live in his spirit; rather, he lives in his soul. Before man fell, his spirit was an organ, a vessel, not his person. His soul was his person. When man is regenerated, God puts His Spirit with His life into man&rsquo;s spirit. Thus, man&rsquo;s spirit is not only enlivened but also regenerated. If man&rsquo;s spirit were merely made alive, it would not possess the divine life and element. Through regeneration, however, the divine life and element have been added to our spirit. God&rsquo;s life and nature are in our regenerated spirit. Now our regenerated spirit is our person. From the time of our regeneration, God works on our soul so that it will also be filled with His element.</p>
<p>When God works on our soul, He is working on our being. The Bible says that we need &ldquo;to be conformed to the image of His Son&rdquo; and to &ldquo;arrive...at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ&rdquo; (Rom. 8:29; Eph. 4:13). Being conformed to the image of the Son and arriving at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ refer to our soul being full of God&rsquo;s element. After we are regenerated, our spirit is not a problem, but our soul is still a problem, because it lacks the element of God. Hence, God must continue to work in us so that His life can be wrought into and mingled with our soul. By the dispensing of God&rsquo;s life into us and the mingling of His life with us, we are conformed to the image of His Son. This is also the way for our soul to arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. This is the way that Christ grows in us and is formed in us. These matters involve our soul.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, when we were regenerated, only our spirit, not our soul, was saved. After our regeneration our spirit contains God&rsquo;s life and element, but our soul is void of His life and element. Hence, the salvation of the soul comes later. James 1:21 says, &ldquo;Putting away all filthiness and the abundance of malice, receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.&rdquo; James admonishes the believers to receive the word of God in meekness, because God&rsquo;s word can save their souls. The messages given in the churches should be for the saving of our souls.</p>
<p>First Peter 1:23 says, &ldquo;Having been regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God.&rdquo; Regeneration here is a matter in the spirit. Chapter 2 says, &ldquo;Therefore putting away all malice...long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation&rdquo; (vv. 1-2). Salvation here is a matter of the soul. The milk of the word refers to God&rsquo;s word. Our regeneration is through the living and abiding word of God. After we are regenerated, we should long for the guileless milk of the word, that is, the word of God, so that we may grow unto the salvation of our soul. Milk is nourishment. We are regenerated when God&rsquo;s word is planted in us. After we are regenerated, God&rsquo;s word nourishes us in order for our soul to be saved. Hence, to grow unto salvation means that we need to grow in the divine life so that we may be saved. In other words, if we grow, we will be saved, but if we do not grow, we will not be saved in our soul. Salvation through growth is different from salvation through regeneration. The salvation that comes from growth is for the salvation of our soul.</p>
<p>First Peter 1:8-9 says, &ldquo;Whom having not seen, you love; into whom though not seeing Him at present, yet believing, you exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory, receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.&rdquo; Verse 8 speaks of our situation when we were first saved, that is, the salvation of our spirit. Verse 9 speaks of the end of our faith, that is, the salvation of our soul. Hebrews 10:39 speaks of the &ldquo;gaining of the soul.&rdquo; This refers to the salvation of our soul after our regeneration. In verses 32 through 39 the apostle Paul charged the Hebrew believers to endure sufferings for the salvation of their souls. All the sufferings that we encounter after our salvation are for God&rsquo;s work in us. If we shrink back, we will nullify God&rsquo;s work in us and miss the reward from God (v. 35). For this reason, we have to endure sufferings in order for our soul to be saved. Furthermore, Luke 21:19 says, &ldquo;In your endurance you will possess your souls.&rdquo; Here the possessing of the soul is the salvation of the soul. This corresponds to Matthew 10:22, which says, &ldquo;He who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the one hand, our soul is saved through the nurturing and nourishing of the word, on the other hand, our soul is saved through sufferings. In order for our soul to be saved, God must work in these two ways. The Lord&rsquo;s word instructs us and gives us revelation, thus causing us to see that our soul and everything related to our soul have been forsaken by God. Therefore, we must deny our soul, reject the self. This is the focus of the New Testament teachings. The Lord also raises up outward sufferings in our environment in coordination with the words that we hear. This means that the discipline of the Holy Spirit is in coordination with the nurturing of the word so that our soul may be put to death. In this way we practically experience the losing of our soul-life. When our soul dies, the resurrection life of God in our spirit has the opportunity to operate in our soul. Thus, God&rsquo;s element is dispensed into us. As a result, we will not have our own mind, emotion, or will. Through this process of death, the life in our spirit has the opportunity to spread into our soul, delivering our soul in resurrection from naturalness. This is also the way that we are transformed. Then our opinions contain God&rsquo;s element, and our proposals have His flavor. This is the salvation of our soul and our transformation. This is our death and resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SALVATION OF THE SOUL BEING<br />
A LIFE-LONG MATTER</h2>
<p>The saving of our soul is the unique work that God is doing in us after our regeneration. God&rsquo;s salvation involves three stages: the enlivening of our spirit at the time of our regeneration, the transformation of our soul, and the transfiguration of our body at the time of our rapture. In between the regeneration of our spirit and the rapture of our body is the process of the transformation of our soul. Likewise, our salvation has three stages. In the past we experienced the salvation of our spirit; in the future, at the Lord&rsquo;s return, we will experience the salvation of our body; and in the present we are experiencing the salvation of our soul. From the time that we were regenerated until the time that our body is redeemed and raptured, God&rsquo;s work in us is related to the salvation of our soul.</p>
<p>Every person who has been regenerated is saved in his spirit, and his body will be transfigured in the future. However, his problem is with the present. Although many believers dare not behave as they did prior to their salvation, there is little transformation in their soul. In other words, their soul has not experienced salvation. One day when they are enlightened and see that their soul has been put to death with the Lord on the cross, they will rise up to deny the self. Then they will begin to suffer the world&rsquo;s persecution because they will be different from the people in the world. Such an environment will be raised up by God for their soul to be saved through being put to death and entering into resurrection. A Christian who is merely saved in his spirit has not received complete salvation. It is still necessary for his soul to be saved and for his body to be raptured at the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Only when his spirit, soul, and body are saved has he experienced God&rsquo;s complete salvation.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
