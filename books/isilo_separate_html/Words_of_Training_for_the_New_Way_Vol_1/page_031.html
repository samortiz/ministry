BETWEEN GOD AND MAN BEING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The ultimate consummation of this Triune God is the Spirit. His very nature is also the Spirit because God is Spirit (John 4:24). Not only so, the last Person of this Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is the Spirit. The Father is in the Son, and the Son is the Spirit. Therefore, the Triune God ultimately is the Spirit. This God, who is the Spirit and whose last Person of the Divine Trinity is also the Spirit, has passed through various processes. Moreover, He has entered into resurrection in His divinity with His humanity to become the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, the Lord in resurrection has breathed Himself as the all-inclusive Spirit into the believers. This very God in whom we believe is altogether a matter of the Spirit.</p>
<p>For the purpose of dispensing this Spirit into us, God in His creation of man particularly created a spirit for him that he might receive this God who is the Spirit by the spirit and with the spirit. Then, when He came back in His resurrection, the first thing He did was to enter into man&rsquo;s spirit to regenerate his spirit. This is spoken of as &ldquo;that which is born of the Spirit is spirit&rdquo; (John 3:6). This is a matter of the Spirit begetting the spirit.</p>
<p>If we want to worship God, we must worship Him in our regenerated spirit. This is a matter of the spirit worshipping the Spirit. Today all the relationships between man and God are in the spirit. One of the Chinese hymns contains this word: &ldquo;All the normal relationships between God and man are altogether in the Spirit.&rdquo; The chorus says, &ldquo;The Spirit begets the spirit, the spirit worships the Spirit, and eventually the Spirit will fill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.&rdquo; The Spirit witnesses with the spirit. Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; It does not say here that the Lord should be with our mind, or that the Lord should be with our heart. Rather, it says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; This clearly shows us that our spirit is the unique place where the Lord is.</p>
<p>Also, Matthew 10:32 says, &ldquo;Every one therefore who in Me shall confess Me before men, I also in him will confess him before My Father who is in the heavens.&rdquo; Here it says that our confessing of the Lord is a matter of us in Him confessing the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s confessing of us is the Lord in us confessing us. This means that whenever we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, we are in the Lord. As soon as we confess the Lord Jesus, we are in the spirit, and we are in Him. Our union with the Lord can reach such a degree!</p>
<p>Therefore, in John 15:4, the Lord said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you.&rdquo; At the end of John 17, the Lord prayed, saying, &ldquo;You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they [the disciples] also may be in Us [the Triune God]&rdquo; (v. 21). Today we believers are in the Triune God. This is altogether a matter of the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO BE FILLED WITH THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
BEING A NORMAL MATTER</h2>
<p>In Christianity, most of the teachers consider the matter of being filled with the Spirit as a very miraculous and extraordinary thing. Fundamental Christianity does not touch this matter much. On the other hand, the Pentecostals touch this matter in an improper way; they are too wild. However, according to the Bible, God, having passed through the different processes, became the life-giving Spirit and breathed Himself into His believers, that is, into His Body. Therefore, our being filled with the Triune God is a very normal matter, as normal as our regeneration.</p>
<p>In the New Testament Christ came; hence, the New Testament is the age of Christ. Then Christ went through death and resurrection to become the Spirit; hence, the New Testament is also the age of the Spirit. Furthermore, the Spirit has become the word; hence, the New Testament is also the age of the word. Romans 10:8 says, &ldquo;The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart.&rdquo; As long as you receive any gospel word in the Bible, this word within you is Spirit, and this Spirit is simply Christ. Therefore, today it is not too difficult to be filled with the Triune God; rather, it is a miraculous normality. Romans 10:13 says, &ldquo;For, &lsquo;whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rsquo;&rdquo; Once you call on the name of the Lord, the Lord who is the Spirit within you will carry out His deliverance so that you may obtain salvation. Nothing can be more normal than this. When a sinner hears the gospel, he is moved to repent and call on the Lord from within, saying, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! Forgive my sins! I receive You.&rdquo; It is in this simple way that the Lord the Spirit comes into him. To be filled in the Spirit is just as normal as this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT<br />
BY CALLING ON THE LORD AND<br />
SPEAKING THE LORD ALL THE DAY LONG</h2>
<p>After we have received the Lord in this way, we need to always say, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t need to analyze whether this calling is in the spirit or not. You simply call. We all have had experiences like these. When we weep, repent, and call on the name of the Lord, we always have a very good feeling and the sense of the Lord&rsquo;s presence. That is the Triune God filling us. At such a time, the sense within us is that the Lord Jesus seems to be right before us; it seems that we have entered into an atmosphere that causes us to feel very sweet, satisfied, and comfortable.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we get up in the morning, the best thing for us to do is not to think about other things, but only to think about the Lord Jesus. It is easy to talk about this, but it is not simple to practice. This is because we all have many things filling our hearts. In spite of this, we still need to practice. There is a difference between calling on the Lord the first thing before getting out of bed, and getting out of bed without calling. You need to call on the Lord in this way in the morning. Then during the whole day, you need to practice speaking the Lord. When there is no one with you, you should call on the Lord Jesus; when there are others with you, you should speak the Lord Jesus to them. Eventually, what you breathe is the Lord Jesus, and what you speak is also the Lord Jesus. Then you will definitely be filled with the Triune God who is the Spirit.</p>
<p>I hope that you will start practicing in this way from today on. You should begin with calling on the Lord before getting out of bed, and then during the day, either call on the Lord or speak the Lord. As soon as you call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, the Spirit is with you; as soon as you speak the Lord&rsquo;s word, the Spirit will be with you even more. Romans 12:11 says that we have to be burning and hot in the spirit. When you call on the Lord as soon as you get up in the morning, you will be hot in your spirit. When you call a few more times, you will become burning in your spirit. If you will also speak the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit will fill you within. This is a very normal matter. This should be our normal daily living.</p>
