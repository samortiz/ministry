<h2 class="head2">Chou-shan Village, Shao-Shing, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear and respected Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>I have testified for the Lord in Nan-Sha and have spread the Lord's accomplished work on the cross to the men in the X hospital. Some of the soldiers have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior. The meeting in Chou-Shan Village is going on as usual; there is no change in any way. God has been guiding His children on with miracles. He is worthy to be praised. We should shout Hallelujah! Please give my greetings to the brothers and sisters from various places when you see them. May the Lord strengthen you, and may His glorious light be manifested through you. May glory, kingdom, and power be unto Him forever and ever, amen!</p><p>A weak brother in the Lord,<br />Ma Ting-chi<br />November 12</p><h2 class="head2">Nan-Sha, Shao-Shing, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear X:</p><p>It has been a month since we parted in Shanghai. I trust that God has been preserving you in peace on your journey to Hankow. I returned home from Shanghai on the third of this month. My intention was to take care of my family business a little and then go back to Shanghai. But during those few days the war broke out and no train or steamer set off for Shanghai. Now my hometown Nan-Sha is also threatened by the war. I have not decided where to go yet. I want to go to Hankow or Ch'ang-sha but do not have enough money. Some brothers and sisters in Nan-Sha are faced with the same situation. There is no place for them to escape. If the situation becomes more tense, I intend to flee to the mountains. Please pray for this. I am afraid that mail and telegrams will also be cut off after a few days. If you write to me, please send it to Kao Yun-seng of Dang-Shan, Shao-Shing. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Chou Jin-tang<br />November 26<br />(This letter arrived on December 23, and it is too late to reply. However, we have received a letter from Shanghai that says that Brother Chou has perhaps returned to Shanghai via Ning-Po&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Ping-Yang, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Brothers Watchman Nee and Chang Kwang-rong<br />in the Lord:</p><p>Since the war broke out, we have been thinking of you all the time. We can only pray for you before the Lord and ask that He be with you and sustain you, amen. Presently, Wen-Chow, Ping-Yang, and Tai-Shun are all safe. Spiritually, however, we are dry and short of edifying. We earnestly desire that you would be able to come and dispense to us what God has commissioned to you. This has been our eager expectation for many years. We wonder whether you have considered us in your schedule (2 Cor. 1:15-16)? We have forwarded a little sum to Brother Lan Tsi-yi. It is for the brothers and sisters in Shanghai who are suffering from the war.</p><p>Your brothers and sisters,<br />Bao Chung-shian, Tze-jing, Tso-shien,<br />Dao-huang, Hsu-ching, Lin-shiang<br />November 22<br />[Address omitted]</p>
