   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN COMING TO US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the New Testament way to serve?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The New Testament service is something entirely outside of religion and contrary to human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John did not teach much; he told people to repent because the kingdom of heaven was at hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He did not preach concerning going to heaven; he told the people that the kingdom of heaven was coming.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not a matter of our going to heaven, but a matter of the kingdom of heaven coming to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some today tell people to be prepared to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John, however, did not say such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John said, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near Matt 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John indicated that the kingdom of the heavens was coming to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is not so interested in man going to heaven; He is more interested in His kingdom coming on earth!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many today are occupied with the concept of going to heaven, but God is interested in coming to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>John did not say, Repent and be forgiven of your sins that you might go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He indicated that we should repent, change our mind, change our concept, because the kingdom of the heavens is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not a matter of our going to heaven, but a matter of something from heaven coming to us on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That something from heaven is the heavenly rule, the heavenly reign, the heavenly regulation and restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all need to listen to John s words again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to repent, we need to change our mind, we need to turn from religion to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to turn from the mere Bible knowledge, from the teaching, the doctrines of letters, to the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The people in John s day needed to turn to the Lord from the law, the temple, the altar, the offerings, and all the religious things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If at John s time the people needed to turn, how much more we need to turn today!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John told them to turn to the Lord for the kingdom of the heavens, which is the heavenly ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If at that time there was the need of heavenly ruling, how much more is such a ruling needed today!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We cannot teach people to turn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The only way we can help them is to be different from religion and worldly culture.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we can encourage others to repent, to change, and to turn from so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to turn from everything else to the Lord s heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not a matter of morality or behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is entirely a matter of the heavenly ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John did very little teaching; he simply told people to change, to turn, to get themselves ready for the kingdom of the heavens and for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We cannot separate Christ from the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In a sense, Christ is the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When John says, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near, he is saying that we need to repent because Christ is here.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to be ready for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we have Christ, we are in the heavenly sphere and under the heavenly ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE WAY TO TESTIFY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>John the Baptist was the first one who testified of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through him we see that the New Testament way for our service is to testify of Christ outside of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to be outside of religion and culture; then we will be able to help others to turn and be changed that they may be prepared for the coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In John s testimony for Christ he even touched upon the matter of the Body of Christ John 3:28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was outside of religion, and he was in the hand of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There was nothing traditional, nothing according to the old way, with him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everything was new and even strange.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In a certain sense, everything seemed wild.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you think that it was proper or nice to baptize people?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To put people into water is not so nice or so proper; rather, it is an uncultured act.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even the way John baptized people might be considered wild.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To put well-dressed ladies into water and bury them there is quite awkward.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In a sense, to baptize people messes them up.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For this reason some have tried to make the matter of baptism more cultured by using a little bowl with some water in it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whatever John did, however, was completely against the cultured mind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to realize that whatever he did was of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was filled with the Spirit from his mother s womb, and as he grew he became strong in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He did not do things according to his forefathers religion, but according to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the way to testify of Christ.</S>
