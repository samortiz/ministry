        <h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE BEING TO ENJOY GOD,<br />
NOT TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE</h2>
<p>The same principle applies to our reading the Bible. We read the Bible to contact God and enjoy Him. Reading the Bible is not for us to receive teachings. Many people zealously pursue the Lord, but they cannot escape studying doctrines and teachings when they come to the Word of God. It is easy for people to fall into this snare when they read the Bible.</p>
<p>If we do not use the Bible properly, it will become a snare in our spiritual pursuit. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, the scribes and Pharisees did not know Him simply because they were well versed in the Old Testament, which was a snare to them. They understood and highly regarded the Scriptures, but they were not willing to come to the Lord so that they might have life (John 5:39-40). Likewise, many people read the Bible, but they are not willing to come to the Lord and receive Him. They may have a thorough understanding of the Bible, but they do not touch God. Hence, it is one thing to read the Bible and another thing to contact God. It is one thing to receive teachings from the Bible, but it is another thing to absorb God. There is a distinction between receiving teachings and absorbing God.</p>
<p>Let me use my testimony as an example. After I left my job to serve the Lord, I would take only a few clothes whenever I traveled for the work, but I took many books. My luggage was almost filled with books. Some brothers teased me and said that I had a mobile library. When I studied the Bible, there were books in front of my bed, on the desk, and on the chairs. I used at least seven versions of the Bible, various Bible commentaries, and an encyclopedia of the Bible. However, after 1943 I did not take any reference books when I traveled; I took only one book&mdash;the Bible. Some might think that I no longer needed the reference books because I had already read them. The fact is that those reference books could impart only knowledge to me. They did not bring me to God that I might enjoy Him.</p>
<p>I have observed some brothers reading reference books with the intention of bringing traditional Christian theology into our midst. However, to bring in the things of Christianity is to take the old way. There are more books on Bible exposition in Christianity than there are books on other fields of knowledge. When I was young, I read and treasured a book that explained the seventy weeks in the book of Daniel. I spent much time to read the book, memorize it, and speak it to others. Later, I learned that there were many different expositions of the seventy weeks and that there are at least a hundred interpretations of Revelation. A person who reads only one interpretation will be deceived. A senior co-worker once told me that if we do not want to be deceived by books on Bible exposition, we must read them thoroughly. This word was spoken from his experience.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that most of those who have studied the Bible have fallen into the trap of reference books. As a result, they merely studied the letter of the Bible. When George M&#252;ller was raised up, he read the Bible to touch God&rsquo;s presence. However, he was not able to tell people that to read the Bible is to absorb and enjoy God. But in recent years the Lord has given us this revelation: to pray is to breathe God and to read the Bible is to absorb God. Both our prayer and our reading the Bible should be our enjoyment of God.</p>
<p>When Christians hear a word concerning fellowshipping with the Lord, they immediately think that this means to go before the Lord in prayer in order to tell Him everything and to converse with Him. They compare this to conversing with a friend&mdash;two separate persons coming together to talk. This, however, is not what the Bible refers to as fellowship. According to the Bible, the Lord&rsquo;s fellowship with us is not an outward matter. Rather, it is a matter of His being in us and our being in Him; He and we are mingled together. We absorb Him into us and allow the Spirit to bring us into Him. This is fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S INTENTION FOR MAN</h2>
<p>We will now consider what God desires to gain in man, as revealed in the Bible. We will consider two points in a way that is simple and easy to understand.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Giving Himself to Man for Man to Enjoy</h2>
<p>The Word of God clearly reveals that God&rsquo;s intention is to give Himself to man for man to enjoy and thereby for Him to be everything to man. According to the Bible, God put Himself before the man whom He had created in order for man to eat Him (Gen. 2:9). God did not present Himself as the great and awe-inspiring God who is sitting on the throne in heaven and asking the man whom He created to worship and serve Him. Instead, He presented Himself as the tree of life. Through such a picture God seemed to be saying to Adam, &ldquo;I do not want you to adore Me, nor do I want you to serve Me. I want you to eat Me, to receive Me, so that I may be your enjoyment and become your content and your everything.&rdquo; This is the significance of God presenting Himself as the tree of life to man. We must keep in mind that this is God&rsquo;s desire for man. The human concepts of worshipping and serving God are natural concepts that were brought in after man&rsquo;s fall. These concepts are not what God desires.</p>
<p>To this day people still have the concepts of worshipping God, serving Him, and doing something for Him. They do not have the concept that God wants to be man&rsquo;s enjoyment. God does not want man to serve Him or to worship Him outwardly. He only wants man to give Him a way to enter into him as food. God wants to be what man eats, drinks, breathes, enjoys, and lives by. God wants to be man&rsquo;s life, nature, and everything.</p>
<p>We need our concept to be changed. God has no desire for us to worship Him or to serve Him outwardly. His intention is to enter into us to be our content and our enjoyment. However, most believers have the concept that to remember the Lord is to meditate on the numerous sufferings that He experienced on their behalf, that is, on His life from the throne to the manger, from the manger to the cross, and from the cross back to the throne. The Lord does not want this kind of remembrance. Such remembrance is a human concept and is like the remembrance of one&rsquo;s ancestors. The remembrance that the Lord spoke of is this: &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body...Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant&rdquo; (Matt. 26:26-28). Our eating and drinking the Lord are our remembrance of the Lord. How much we remember the Lord depends on how much we eat and drink Him. The Lord&rsquo;s intention is that we would receive more of His element every time we remember Him. When we remember the Lord according to our natural concept, our gratitude toward Him is what increases. There is a great difference between these two kinds of remembrance.</p>
<p>In the same principle, God has no intention for us to worship or serve Him outwardly. God&rsquo;s intention is to enter into us, men of clay, to cause us to have a change in nature and become men of gold. He has no other intention. For this reason, the tree of life is spoken of at the end of the Bible. In the New Jerusalem God&rsquo;s created and redeemed people have tasted and enjoyed Him, and their nature has been fully changed. Initially, they were men of clay, but now they have been transformed into a city of pure gold that shines forth the light of the glory of God (Rev. 21:10-11, 18). This is God&rsquo;s intention. If we see this, our concept related to God&rsquo;s work will change. In the New Jerusalem there is no worship and service according to the human concept. In the New Jerusalem there will only be God as the tree of life to be the enjoyment of His redeemed people. The God whom we enjoy will flow into us to become our constituent so that He may be expressed through us. Then God&rsquo;s intention will be fulfilled.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
