<h1 class="title">TRAINING FOR THE MEMBERS<br />
IN THE SMALL GROUPS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>It is very profitable to use the Life-study messages in the small groups. I am full of confidence that the <em>Life-study of Galatians</em> is not only useful but also timely medicine. Some of the saints know how to meet in a small group and some do not. We are not able to do things with our natural man. Take playing the piano as an example. Everyone can make sounds on the piano, but it is not easy to play music. Those who can play the piano know that it requires much practice. Therefore, I hope that we all will have an attitude to learn how to use the Life-study messages in the small groups. Otherwise, even though it is not difficult, we will not learn how to use them. As long as we are willing to learn, we will succeed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE LEAD OUT OF BURDEN<br />
AND NOT OUT OF ARRANGEMENT</h2>
<p>There are over one thousand brothers and sisters in this training. The church in Taipei now has around three hundred sixty small groups, and each small group can have at least three to four saints in this training. These three or four saints are members who care for the group and are burdened and experienced. According to man, there is no leader in this arrangement. In the Bible the Lord Jesus appointed twelve apostles, but He did not appoint a chief apostle among them. In Acts 6 the church appointed seven brothers to serve food, but there was no chief serving brother among them (v. 3). Deacons and elders were appointed in the New Testament, but there is no record of a chief deacon or chief elder (14:23). Similarly, in every small group, there are members, but no one is appointed by anyone to lead. This can be compared to a family with eight children. There is no need to designate who is the eldest or who is the youngest, because everyone knows. There is no need to appoint anyone. In a family with many children, the cleverest child is often not the oldest but the second oldest. Therefore, the leader among the children is not necessarily the oldest but perhaps the second oldest.</p>
<p>Recently I went to a small group meeting that did not have a leader. When the meeting began, not many people were present. After a few minutes, a brother asked about a brother who was not present. After a few minutes he asked again. I realized that he was a real responsible one. I also saw an eighty-year-old brother who was ushering with a respectful attitude. I felt that he was the best usher. If the meeting were held in the meeting hall, no one would arrange for such an old brother to be an usher, but when the small group meeting was in his home, he was a ready usher.</p>
<p>There were five family members in the home where we met: the older parents, the son and daughter-in-law, and the grandson. In the past the son did not meet regularly, but now that he had a small group meeting, he was stirred up to invite and bring people. After a while a sister arrived. She testified that she had not been to a meeting for many years but was now recovered by the small group. By sharing in this way, she became the best leader of the meeting, and she was appropriate. It is good that we did not arrange for any leader in the small groups. If a leader was appointed, the father, mother, son, and daughter-in-law, thinking that the church would send a person to lead the meeting, would at best clean their house, get it ready for the meeting, and then retreat to their rooms.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING THE LIFE-STUDIES<br />
TO ENRICH THE CONTENT OF THE MEETING</h2>
<p>There were more than ten persons in that small group, including the gospel friends and those who had not met for a while. Spontaneously, the gospel was preached, and it was full of taste. At the end of the meeting another brother arrived and apologized for being late. Right away the other brothers invited him to come and fellowship. The small group was truly full of flavor. Every member complemented another&rsquo;s shortage, and they all functioned. This kind of functioning is impossible to work out in a large meeting. Hence, we do not need to feel disappointed; rather, we must drop our prejudice and give up our opinion. The Lord is leading us this way, and I hope that we can all follow.</p>
<p>The small group meeting may be simple and spontaneous, but the content is very important. How do we enrich the content of a small group meeting? The way to enrich it is to use the Life-study messages. We can divide the messages into two portions. The first half can be used in the small groups and the second half after the table meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>For example, Message 2 of the <em>Life-study of Galatians</em> is entitled &ldquo;The Apostle&rsquo;s Gospel.&rdquo; This message says that Matthew&rsquo;s gospel is the gospel of the kingdom, John&rsquo;s gospel is the gospel of life, Luke&rsquo;s gospel is the gospel of the forgiveness of sins, Mark&rsquo;s gospel is the gospel of service, and Paul&rsquo;s gospel is the gospel of completion. The message goes on to show that Paul&rsquo;s gospel speaks of Christ being five matters to us. Christ is in us as the hope of glory (Col. 1:27), Christ lives in us (Gal. 2:20), Christ is being formed in us (4:19), Christ is making His home in us (Eph. 3:17), and we are being filled with Christ to be the fullness of God (v. 19). All these points are excellent for the content of a meeting. We need to practice speaking these points in the small group.</p>
<p>We should never think that those who come for the first time will not understand what we are talking about. We must believe that they can understand. Little children learn to speak by listening, and gradually they understand everything. In our meetings we are using the heavenly language and speaking heavenly words. You speak to me, and I speak to you. Eventually everyone will learn to say, &ldquo;Christ is in us as the hope of glory.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 5: Concerning Various Aspects of Church Service &nbsp; pg 57</div><br></body></html>
