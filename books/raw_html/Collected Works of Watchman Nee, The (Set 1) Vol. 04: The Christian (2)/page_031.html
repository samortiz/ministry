<P>Furthermore, at the end of each of these seven letters was written, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." There is no other place in the Bible where the importance of these words is emphasized like it is here. This word clearly indicates that the message was not written only for the people at that time. This word was spoken for those in the past as well as in the present, for anyone who has an ear to hear the Lord's word.</P><P>Also chapter one verse 3 of this book clearly indicates that this is a book of prophecy. If chapter four to the end are prophecies, then are not chapters two and three also prophecies? It does seem that we have the Lord's support in assuming that these seven letters are indirect prophecies, predicting the situations of the churches at different times. Just as John was a representative of all servants in that day, so were the seven churches.</P><P>When we look into these two chapters, we are surprised to see how the Bible matches church history. Firstly, the church in Ephesus was reprimanded by the Lord for leaving her first love. Is this not the case with the churches since the apostolic time? Not only was it so before the death of the last apostle, it was even the same afterwards. Smyrna's persecutions were also another picture in church history. Later, the church joined herself to the world, the persecutors were turned into friends, and a "Balaam" was hired to promote this kind of harmony. History and the third letter really match. Later, is not Jezebel's power, her fornication, and her filth a real picture of the Roman church era? The Reformed churches which were seemingly alive but were dead, the brothers who faithfully kept the word, and the lukewarmness of the middle-of-the-road groups—do these not show the experience of the churches one after another? Although we have only glanced over chapters two and three quickly, what we have seen already indicates that these seven letters match closely with the church history on the earth.</P><P>Now from our point of view, do we not see in a clearer way than those a hundred years earlier? The Lord was gracious to have had us born at this time, so that when we look back, we may know what has happened in the past. In this way our hope can be strengthened. Although the Lord has been delayed for a long time, one thing is sure: we are at the end of this age. We cannot tell how much more still lies ahead of us. We dare not say, but I am afraid we are already at the end of the way.</P><P>Nevertheless, our Lord did not explicitly state that these seven churches represented the churches in consecutive generations, nor did He state that these seven epistles are the history of the church in chronological sequence. If He were to do so, it would have caused His church to lose hope in waiting for His coming from heaven. The Lord Jesus never once told us that His church would be on this earth for another two thousand years before He would come back. Indeed, our Lord knew the future, yet He did not tell us the time and day of His return. Otherwise, we would not have the blessed hope. Even in the Gospels, the Lord Jesus indicated the same. In His words there were hints for His delay, but there was also hope for His soon return. This is the greatest help for those who are discouraged. It prevents us from living comfortably on this earth while forgetting the heavenly matters. Although He has not come, we are not disappointed because He has told us clearly, "Watch therefore, for you do not know when the Master of the house comes" (Mark 13:35). If the Lord said explicitly that these seven epistles were the history of the church, then we would lose our sojourner's nature and our lamp's oil. We would have no more heaven in our life on earth.</P><P>Although the conditions of these seven churches aptly represent the history of the church on earth, it does not mean that Smyrna came only after Ephesus had passed away, that Pergamos followed after Smyrna was gone, and so forth. After reading chapters two and three as well as history, we see that although the first age in church history corresponds generally with the condition of Ephesus, and the second age corresponds generally with the condition of Smyrna, actually in the age of Ephesus there were already the conditions of Smyrna and of the other five churches, yet the condition of Ephesus was more prevailing. In the age of Smyrna there were also the conditions of Ephesus and of all the other churches, but the condition of Smyrna was the most predominant one in that age. The church in every age also bears the characteristics of all the other churches in the same way that all seven churches existed simultaneously at that time. This will become more obvious in the last days. The Lord Jesus spoke to the church in Thyatira, "Nevertheless what you have hold fast until I come" (2:25). He spoke to Sardis, "I will come as a thief" (3:3), and He spoke to Philadelphia, "I come quickly" (3:11). Laodicea is the last church. We have seen that the Lord Jesus spoke to these three churches regarding His coming again. Thus, they are the churches which will remain until His coming. These three churches plus Laodicea will certainly co-exist until the end of the ages. History has completely confirmed this, and we will soon be studying this matter. Let me again point out clearly that the Lord said to Thyatira, "Until I come." From our point of view this was not very imminent. He said to Sardis, "I will come." This was more definite. He said to Philadelphia, "I come quickly." This was even more urgent. Now, we are already at the end of this age. We need to prepare ourselves watchfully.</P><P>Hence, the last four of these seven churches will exist until the Lord comes. This does not mean that they were raised up together at the same time and then co-exist until the Lord's return. It means that Thyatira as a beginning is raised up first, followed by Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. They were raised up one after another. The former did not come to an end because the latter was raised up. The four will continue together until the Lord comes. In other words, they have different beginnings, but their consummations will be together. The first three of the seven churches did not have the word of the Lord's return. Thus, they were raised up to replace one another, and they came one right after another.</P><P>Moreover, we see that in the first four churches, the Lord separated the messengers from the churches. Other than Smyrna, which bore no rebuke, all of the Lord's judgments and admonishments did not concern the messengers themselves. In Ephesus it was the lampstand that was to be removed, and in Pergamos and Thyatira it was the unfaithful members that were to be judged. The last three were just the opposite—the messengers and the churches were completely united. Other than Philadelphia, which was without blame, all of the Lord's judgments and admonishments were for the messengers themselves. In Sardis the few who wore white robes were not the messengers but were ones who were different from the messengers. The messenger of Laodicea was blended together with the church. The explanation of such a difference may be that the first four churches still had the position of the church, and God considered it sufficient for the messengers to represent their churches. Thus, He judged and punished only the immoral members among them. The last three churches have lost their position and have become wholly corrupted. Thus all of them were judged together with the world. Because of this, if there were any faithful members in the last three churches, they should have separated themselves from the churches so that they could become Philadelphia before the Lord. Smyrna and Philadelphia were perfect. Thus, there was no separation between the messengers and the churches—the two were united. Sardis (in position) and Laodicea failed completely. Thus, there was also no separation between the messengers and the churches—the two were one. They have no hope other than of being forsaken by the Lord. What a lesson the saints who love the Lord should learn from this passage!</P>
