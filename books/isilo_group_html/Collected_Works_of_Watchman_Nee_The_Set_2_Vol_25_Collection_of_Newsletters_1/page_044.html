Thank the Lord because He has added another member to be His people. A few months ago Brother Shih K'o Jen planned to take a trip to Southeast Asia. Since he has not yet received an answer from the Lord about this matter, he is afraid to go according to his own will.</P><P>The meeting in our locality used to be in Brother K'o Jen's house. Because it was an inconvenient location, the brothers prayed specifically to the Lord to prepare a place where His children could meet together to worship the Father and to break the bread and drink the cup in remembrance of the Lord Jesus who loves us. Thank the Lord, He had already prepared the T'ien Mei Chapel for us. We prayed according to His will, and He gave us what we asked for. Therefore, we moved our meeting into the T'ien Mei Chapel on December 17 of last year. Unfortunately, many milk-taking believers and worldly members of the Chapel do not understand that our meeting is in the Lord's name. They have risen up as a group to taunt us that we are the Baptist denomination and are established by man's will. Our meeting is not a denomination according to man's will, nor is it established by man according to man's methods. It has been more than a year since I received the Holy Spirit's leading to leave the denominations and to meet in the Lord's name. It really is the Lord's grace to be called out to be separated from the denominations and to meet in the Lord's name (Matt. 18:20). Man does not appoint us; our Head, the Lord Jesus, appoints us. We follow the Father's will and meet in accordance with the command of the Lord Jesus. We listen to the Lord's commandment and not man's commandment. At any rate, we only rely on the Lord. We only follow the Lord's commandment. We only meet in the Lord's name, so we do what God's unique universal church should do. Any Christian who can take solid food must take this way. The Lord's Day is the day to worship God, break the bread, and drink the cup in remembrance of the Lord (1 Cor. 11:23-31; Heb. 5:12-13). Please pray for us often in the Lord's love. May the grace and peace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all until eternity.</P><P>Your little brother in the Lord,<br>Yun Feng Chan<br>1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM CHEN CHIA YUEH TZE,<br>NORTHERN KIANGSU</H2><P>To the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</P><P>We thank and praise the Lord because day by day He leads us on in our pilgrimage in this world. Although we meet with many problems, He always opens a way for us. Although Satan attacks in many ways, we are able to stand firm by relying on our overcoming Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Beginning of the Table Meeting in His Name</H2><P>The meeting here began in 1929. At that time, there were seven or eight brothers and sisters in the table meeting. Later, the Lord Himself added saved ones to the meeting. Day by day we added quite a few new brothers and sisters. By 1933 there were more than ninety brothers and sisters in the table meeting. Among them were the brothers and sisters from Pan Hu. It was inconvenient for them to come for the meetings because the distance was so great, so this year they began having the table meeting in Pan Hu. (It is about fifteen or sixteen miles to the northeast of Chen Chia Yueh Tze.) According to outward circumstances, it was right for them to have a meeting there. Thank the Lord, the condition of the meeting there is very good now. This year (1934) the number of brothers and sisters is still increasing steadily. There are more than sixty brothers and sisters who come every Lord's Day to meet for the breaking of the bread. We see the Lord Himself working, and we cannot but testify for Him.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 25: Collection of Newsletters (1) &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
