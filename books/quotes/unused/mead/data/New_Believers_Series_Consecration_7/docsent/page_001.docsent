   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONSECRATION Scripture Reading: Exo 28:1-2, 40-41; 29:1-25; Lev 8:14-28; Rom 6:13, 16, 19; 12:1; 1 Cor 6:19-20; 2 Cor 5:14-15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now turn to the matter of Christian consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whether or not a person consecrates himself depends on whether he has a healthy salvation experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If he views his faith in the Lord Jesus as being a favor to the Lord and his faith in God as a courtesy to Him, it will be impossible to talk to him about consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is equally futile to talk about consecration to a person who feels that he is promoting the cause of Christianity and that his conversion is a great honor to it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a one does not have a good start in his Christian faith; he does not have a good beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is impossible to expect him to consecrate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must realize that it is the Lord who has graced us and granted mercy to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is the Lord who loves us and has saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why we consecrate our all to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Teaching concerning consecration can be found in both the Old Testament and New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many passages in the New Testament, such as Romans 6 and 12, speak of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Old Testament consecration is spoken of with special reference to Aaron and his household.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Exodus 28 and 29 and Leviticus 8 speak of the consecration of Aaron and his household.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although consecration is the first basic experience of our service to God, we do not find many direct teachings from God's Word concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to understand the meaning of consecration, we need to study the above referenced verses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I. THE BASIS OF CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second Corinthians 5:14-15 clearly shows us that the constraining power of the Lord's love is the basis for God's children to live unto Him who died for them and has been raised.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A man lives unto the Lord because he is constrained by the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the original language, the word constrained can be translated "pressed on from all sides," that is, tightly confined on all sides.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It means to be tightly bound and wrapped up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Love has bound us up, and we cannot run away.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a person is in love, he will have a sense of bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are bound by Him; we have no way out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He has died for us, and we should live unto Him today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, love is the basis of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A man consecrates himself to the Lord because of the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No one can consecrate himself unless he first touches the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A man must touch the Lord's love before he can consecrate himself to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When one touches the Lord's love, consecration spontaneously follows.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Consecration is based on the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But it is also based on the Lord's right.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the truth revealed in 1 Corinthians 6:19-20: "You are not your own...For you have been bought with a price."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our Lord gave His own life for us; He even became the ransom to purchase us back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are those who are purchased by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because the Lord has redeemed us, we willingly lose our own freedom for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are no longer our own; we are the Lord's. We must glorify God in our bodies because we are not our own; we have been bought by the Lord with a price.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The blood which the Lord shed on the cross is the price He paid.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, as far as the Lord's right is concerned, we belong to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must be clear that we are those purchased by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has purchased us with the highest price.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He bought us, not with silver or gold, but with His own blood.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here we see the Lord's love as well as His right.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We serve the Lord because He loves us, and we follow Him because He has a right over us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The right secured through redemption constrains us to give ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The love that results from redemption also constrains us to give ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The basis of consecration is His right as well as His love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is a legal right, and it is beyond all human sentimental love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These are the two reasons that we have to give ourselves to the Lord.</S>
