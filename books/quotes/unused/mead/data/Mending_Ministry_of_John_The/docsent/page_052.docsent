   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HIGH PRIESTLY MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How is it possible for every local church to be an embodiment of the Triune God as the lampstand?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ's heavenly priesthood is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His walking in the midst of the churches is His functioning as the heavenly High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By ministering His priesthood to us, He purifies and transforms us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Originally we are not golden but muddy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may still have a layer of mud on us!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to be purified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Read again the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There Christ as High Priest is ministering to cleanse away the mud and add the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you read these two chapters with this thought in mind, you will have new insights.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These epistles seem full of rebukes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why did He rebuke so much?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He wanted to purify.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While He was rebuking, His word was also supplying.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To the church in Ephesus He said: "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God" 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To the church in Pergamos He promised, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it" 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To eat of the tree of life and of the hidden manna is to take in Christ as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The result of eating this supply is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We become a white stone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To the overcomer in the church in Philadelphia the Lord promises, "I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore " 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Purified and transformed, those who overcome eventually are built into the temple as pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>OVERCOMERS BROUGHT FORTH</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The outcome of our High Priest's ministering in the churches is that a number of overcomers are brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not to say that everyone in the local churches is an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Outside the churches, however, does the Lord have a way to produce any overcomers?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not see any possibility for Him to gain any overcomers in the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I doubt that He can do so in the denominations or free groups either.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the local churches, however, the Lord has the full ground and a full entrance to come in and purify His seeking ones, supply His lovers, and transform them into stones for His building and pillars for His temple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus Christ's heavenly priesthood ministered to the churches produces a number of overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are now under this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is busy walking through the churches and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As He walks through the churches, He speaks to every one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His speaking is according to what He is and also according to the condition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In every epistle He begins by saying who and what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then He also speaks in every case according to what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His speaking is both practical and equipping.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In His walking He is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In His speaking He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the beginning of each of the seven epistles it is the Lord who speaks 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At the end it is the Spirit speaking to the churches 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Your experience will confirm this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When Christ came and walked through the church in your locality, you were enlightened and rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The walking Christ became the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By His speaking you are supplied with the tree of life and the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then you are transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Little by little the muddy things are washed away and you become a white stone, justified, accepted, and approved by God for the building up of His dwelling place, which consummates in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ today is busy ministering His heavenly priesthood.</S>
