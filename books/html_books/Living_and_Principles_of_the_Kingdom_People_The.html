<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Baguio City, Philippines, in April 1955. In the conference Brother Lee spoke concerning chapters 5 through 7, 13, and 24 through 25 of the Gospel of Matthew. However, detailed records of only the speaking concerning chapters 5 through 7 exist. These messages were originally published in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> in 1959.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NATURE OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 5:1-12</h1>
<p>Bible readers acknowledge that the kingdom of the heavens is a major item in the Bible. God&rsquo;s greatest desire in the universe is to bring the kingdom of the heavens to the earth. While the Lord was on the earth, He worked to manifest His kingship and to establish His kingdom on the earth. Those who care for God&rsquo;s will must pay attention to the Lord&rsquo;s intention regarding the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>In order to know the kingdom of the heavens, we must pay attention to the Gospel of Matthew, because Matthew specifically concerns the kingdom of the heavens. In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord gave three important teachings regarding three lines related to the kingdom of the heavens. The first line, in chapters 5 through 7, concerns the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. The second line, in chapter 13, concerns the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. The third line, in chapters 24 and 25, concerns the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. In this book we will concentrate on the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>Before considering the main subject, we must pay attention to some relevant points. Matthew 5 through 7 concerns the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. Among Christians these chapters are commonly known as the Sermon on the Mount, because it was given on a mountain. Chapter 13 is on the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, and this chapter is commonly known as the Seaside Parables, because it was given by the seaside. Chapters 24 and 25 are concerning the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, and these chapters are commonly known as the Olivet Prophecy, because this speaking was given on the Mount of Olives. The location from which the Lord gave these three teachings is significant. The teachings concerning the reality and the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens were given on a mountain. This means that we must go up the mountain and come forward to the Lord in order to hear and partake of them. Going up a mountain requires effort, and coming forward to the Lord is to draw near to the Lord. This indicates that those who pay the price and fellowship with the Lord can know the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the future. The word concerning the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens was given beside the sea. The sea signifies the world corrupted and occupied by Satan. This means that although those in the world can hear the teaching concerning the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, they cannot know the reality of the kingdom of the heavens or its manifestation.</p>
<p>If we read the Gospel of Matthew carefully, we will find other general teachings. Before the Lord spoke of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, He taught in the synagogues (4:23). His teaching in the synagogues was more general and was spoken to more people. In contrast, the words related to the reality of the kingdom of the heavens were spoken on a mountain to only a few people. Before the Lord spoke concerning the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, He taught in the temple (21:23), and in this teaching He spoke of woes (23:13-29). However, those who followed the Lord to the Mount of Olives heard the Lord say, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave...Enter into the joy of your master&rdquo; (25:21).</p>
<p>When the Lord spoke by the seaside concerning the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, He did not give an interpretation (13:10-12). The speaking concerning the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens was given by the seaside, but the interpretation of the mystery of the kingdom of the heavens was given inside the house (vv. 36-43). The mystery of the kingdom of the heavens is hidden. The people by the seaside can know only the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. In order to know the mystery of the kingdom of the heavens, a person has to leave the seaside and enter into the house in order to be with the Lord in a hidden way. These three contrasting teachings involve lower and higher elements.</p>
<p>The sequence of these three teachings is also significant. First, there is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, then the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, and lastly the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. The sequence reveals that unless a person lives in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, he cannot know the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens or the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. Those who do not live in Matthew 5 through 7 cannot know chapter 13 or chapters 24 and 25. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is very important. We must first live in this reality before we can know the parables by the seaside and the prophecy given on the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s teaching in Matthew 5 through 7 is on the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, that is, the living and principles of the people of the kingdom of the heavens. In seven sections the Lord explained the kingdom of the heavens. In particular, He explained the kind of living that the people of the kingdom of the heavens should have and the principles that they should keep. Therefore, the general subject of Matthew 5 through 7 is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. This is the living and the principles of the kingdom people.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NATURE OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</h2>
<p>The first section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching in Matthew 5 through 7 concerns nine blessings that the people of the kingdom of the heavens possess. Most Christians speak of the eight Beatitudes when they come to this section, but there are in fact nine blessings.</p>
<p>Although the Lord began this teaching with nine blessings, He was not merely emphasizing blessings. Rather, He was emphasizing the kind of people who are in the kingdom of the heavens. These nine blessings describe the people in the kingdom of the heavens and their nature. Whoever has these nine blessings is blessed, because these blessings prove that he is living in the kingdom of the heavens. We need to ask ourselves whether we have these blessings.</p>
<p>In this section the Lord presented two aspects of the nature of the people of the kingdom of the heavens. The first six blessings speak of the inward aspect of the kingdom people, and the last three blessings speak of their outward aspect. The inward aspect refers to the condition of their heart, and the outward aspect refers to the condition of their living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Poor in Spirit</h2>
<p>The first aspect of the nature of the kingdom people is in Matthew 5:3: &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; Being poor in spirit refers to having a deep, inward feeling of dissatisfaction. When a believer feels dissatisfied deep within his being, he is poor in spirit.</p>
<p>Being poor in spirit is affected by our outward environment, but it is not related to our environment. For example, a brother may be very rich and have all the enjoyments of human life, but he still feels inwardly dissatisfied. Such a person is poor in spirit. Another brother may not be wealthy, but he does not feel inwardly dissatisfied. Such a person is not poor in spirit.</p>
<p>The first condition of the heart is to be poor in spirit. A person living in the kingdom of the heavens and partaking of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens must be poor in spirit. Someone who is poor in spirit, who is inwardly dissatisfied, is not seeking the material possessions of the present age; rather, he is seeking God, who is Spirit. A person seeks what he lacks. Many people want to be rich, because they think that they lack money, that they are not wealthy. People also seek knowledge, promotions, and entertainment. People seek what they lack, that is, the things in which they are poor.</p>
<p>A person who is poor in spirit is not satisfied with the material possessions of this age. He needs God to be his satisfaction, and he sees that only God can meet the need in his spirit and satisfy him deep within. Hence, he desires God and seeks God.</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo; (v. 3). People who are poor in spirit and seek God are blessed, because the kingdom of the heavens is theirs. The material enjoyment, the material world, causes man to indulge his flesh and not be restricted by God. When man is not satisfied with the material possessions of this age and is willing to forsake the seen things in order to seek God, he will come under God&rsquo;s dominion and will be ruled by the kingdom of the heavens. Such persons possess the kingdom of the heavens. Being poor in spirit is the first condition of the heart of those who live in the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Mourning</h2>
<p>The second condition of the nature of the kingdom people is mourning. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.&rdquo; Someone who is poor in spirit and who desires and seeks God will be enlightened to see his evil, corrupt, and rebellious nature. He will also be enlightened to see that he resists God. As a result, he will mourn.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when he gains God, he will sense that many Christians do not want God, are not ruled by God, and do not give God the ground within them. This will also cause him to mourn. On a larger scope, a person who is poor in spirit and seeks God will mourn because his surroundings, the present generation, and the people in the world do not want God, resist God, and rebel against God.</p>
<p>From the context of Matthew 5 through 7, mourning is not related to disasters or illness but to the fact that people do not want God and do not submit to God. Such mourning may seem unpleasant, but it is sweet. The people of the world mourn often because they are in sin and have sicknesses and tribulations. However, this kind of mourning is ugly, low, and worthless. Only mourning on behalf of God is beautiful, precious, glorious, and of eternal value. The Lord promised that those who mourn on behalf of God will be comforted.</p>
<p>Comforting includes the satisfaction of having the Lord in us today and the comfort that we will have in the coming kingdom and in the new heaven and new earth. When the overcomers enter into the coming kingdom, their enjoyment and condition will free them from the grief of this age; hence, they will be satisfied and comforted. In the New Jerusalem in eternity future the portion that they receive will comfort them further. In the New Jerusalem God will be everything to man, and man will be fully under God&rsquo;s rule. Our grieving heart is comforted by gaining God and by coming under His authority; our heart is also comforted when we see our fellow seekers desiring God and being under His rule. However, our comfort will be greater and richer in the coming kingdom and in eternity future.</p>
<p>A person who lives in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens often mourns. He does not mourn over the tribulations that he suffers but over not gaining God. The object of such mourning is God and His dominion, and the reason for such mourning is the loss of God and the loss of His dominion. Such mourning is noble and holy. Those who mourn will be comforted by God.</p>
<p>Revelation 21 says that when the New Jerusalem descends from heaven, God will tabernacle with men (v. 3), and &ldquo;He will wipe away every tear from their eyes&rdquo; (v. 4). This refers to the nations, but verse 17 of chapter 7 also speaks of the Lamb wiping away every tear from those who stand before the throne of God. Surely, the kingdom people who mourn will be comforted in the New Jerusalem; they will have no reason to mourn.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Meek</h2>
<p>A person who is poor in spirit, who hungers and thirsts for God, and who mourns is also meek. Someone who is complacent in spirit and does not mourn is not meek. A hot temper and resistance are the opposite of meekness. In Matthew 5:5 the Lord said, &ldquo;Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.&rdquo; Meekness means not being resistant and not being hot-tempered. It is easy to be hot-tempered and resistant when someone strikes us. A person can be both hot-tempered and resistant, but resistance does not necessarily include a hot temper. In contrast, a person who is not resistant will not be hot-tempered. In Matthew 5 through 7 the Lord does not want us to be resistant. If someone slaps us on our right cheek, we should turn to him the other cheek; if someone wishes to take our tunic, we should yield our cloak to him also; and if someone compels us to go one mile, we should go two miles with him (5:39-41).</p>
<p>The Lord promised that the meek will inherit the earth. After the fall of man, people must contend with one another in order to inherit the physical earth. Those who are stronger and better at contending gain more of the earth. A person who lives under the rule of the heavens and who does not contend or resist will not inherit the earth today. Others will take even what he has. However, the Lord said that those who live under the rule of the heavens neither contend nor resist but will inherit the earth. This inheriting must refer to the reward in the coming kingdom.</p>
<p>According to Hebrews 2, God in His ordination did not subject the coming world to angels but to man (vv. 5-7). Those who inherit the earth in the coming kingdom will not be the ones who are contending for earthly things today, nor will they be resistant; instead, they will be meek. They will not gain by contending but by inheriting.</p>
<p>The words <em>the earth</em> in Matthew 5:5 do not refer to the world with its material enjoyment. People do not seek the kingdom of the heavens today, because they are occupied by the world. Someone who is poor in spirit and seeks God mourns because he has not gained enough God and because he is not under God&rsquo;s rule. As a result, he regards the earth in this age as dung. He does not contend with or resist the people of the world, because he does not want the world. The Lord&rsquo;s promise in this verse shows that in order to inherit the coming earth, we must forsake the present world. In other words, those who want to receive the kingdom must forsake the world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Hungry and Thirsty for Righteousness</h2>
<p>Being poor in spirit, mourning, and being meek are three general conditions of the heart of the kingdom people. These general conditions belong to one group. The following three conditions are specific and speak of the attitude that the kingdom people should have toward themselves, toward others, and toward God.</p>
<p>The first specific condition of the heart is to hunger and thirst for righteousness. Matthew 5:6 says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.&rdquo; This verse speaks of the attitude that one who lives in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens should have toward himself. He should be righteous and desire righteousness. He should hunger and thirst for righteousness. He should not do anything that would let others down, nor should he be indebted to others in anything.</p>
<p>People in the world are unrighteous and indebted to others because they do not seek the rule of the heavens by hungering and thirsting for righteousness. For example, in buying and selling, a buyer wants the price of something to be as low as possible, and the seller wants it to be as high as possible. Both want to take advantage of the other. They are prepared to use any means necessary, including lying and cheating, in order to take advantage of the other and make a profit. This is to take advantage of others, not to seek righteousness. When people hunger and thirst for profit, they set aside righteousness.</p>
<p>Regrettably, many Christians also take advantage of others. Brothers in the church in Corinth went to court with one another because they both sought to take advantage of the other (1 Cor. 6:6); they did not seek righteousness. Two brothers might be neighbors or colleagues, but both may try to get the upper hand. It is grievous for Christians to seek to take advantage of others.</p>
<p>A person who lets the heavens rule does not seek to take advantage of others. He would rather that others would be indebted to him than that he would be indebted to others. He earnestly hungers and thirsts for righteousness. Others may be satisfied with a gain, but he is not satisfied when he is unrighteous, because he hungers and thirsts for righteousness. Such hunger and thirst force him to desire and seek righteousness, just as being poor in spirit forces someone to seek God.</p>
<p>Someone who is poor in spirit takes God as the object, but one who is hungry and thirsty in his heart takes God&rsquo;s righteousness as the goal. We are poor in spirit because we seek God, but we hunger and thirst in our heart because we desire righteousness. God is our inward satisfaction, and righteousness is our outward living. When we are poor in spirit, we gain God. When our heart hungers and thirsts, we gain righteousness.</p>
<p>We should not think that it is sufficient to be poor in spirit and seek God. If we are genuinely poor in spirit and seek God, we will eventually hunger and thirst in our heart for righteousness. Although God is man&rsquo;s satisfaction, we will not be satisfied if we seek God but do not seek righteousness. We must have God within and righteousness without. Then we will have true satisfaction. Therefore, the Lord said, &ldquo;Those who hunger and thirst for righteousness...shall be satisfied&rdquo; (Matt. 5:6).</p>
<p>Many saints seek the Lord and serve God zealously. However, they are unrighteous in their living. Furthermore, they have no feeling about their unrighteousness and do not deal with it. This is to deviate, and it is wrong. The Lord wants us to seek God and to be strict with ourselves. Righteousness is an important aspect of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. No unrighteous person can partake of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. Only those who seek God and also seek righteousness can partake of the kingdom of the heavens and be satisfied.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Merciful</h2>
<p>The second specific condition of the heart is to be merciful. Verse 7 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy.&rdquo; To hunger and thirst for righteousness is toward one&rsquo;s self. Being merciful is our attitude toward others. When most people learn to restrict themselves righteously, they inevitably make the same, if not more stringent, demands on others. However, the Lord said that a person living in the kingdom of the heavens is full of mercy toward others while being righteous toward himself.</p>
<p>Mercy accommodates people more than grace. A person&rsquo;s situation may be so low that he is not worthy of grace. He needs mercy to accommodate him. For example, to give money to a friend is grace, but to give money to a beggar is mercy because a beggar is totally unworthy of the grace that we would give him.</p>
<p>Someone who lets the heavens rule is gracious to those who are proper and worthy of grace and also shows mercy to those who are improper and unworthy of grace. He is lenient toward others and makes no demands or requirements of them. To be righteous is to make demands and to be strict, but to be merciful is the opposite.</p>
<p>The result of being merciful toward others is that God shows mercy to us. This corresponds to verse 12 in chapter 7: &ldquo;All that you wish men would do to you, so also you do to them.&rdquo; God treats us according to how we treat others. If we have mercy on others, God will have mercy on us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Pure in Heart</h2>
<p>The third specific condition of the heart is to be pure in heart. Verse 8 of chapter 5 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.&rdquo; This condition of the heart is toward God, because it results in seeing God. Believers under the rule of the heavens are righteous toward themselves, merciful toward others, and pure toward God. Thus, these three specific conditions of the heart form one group.</p>
<p>To be pure in heart is to have a pure and single heart that loves, seeks, and hopes in nothing other than God. Such a heart is focused on God; it is not half-hearted. Such a heart is focused on only one person and has only one goal. When a heart has only God as its goal and is pure, single, and focused, it is a pure heart. Someone who has a pure heart is single toward God and wants only God; hence, his blessing is to see God. In the Bible to see is to enter in, which is to gain. Regarding any spiritual matter or experience, to see it is to enter into it and gain it. Therefore, in this verse to see God is to enter into God and to gain God.</p>
<p>To desire God is the first condition of the heart that a person living in the kingdom of the heavens should have, and seeing and gaining God are the issue of the sixth condition of his heart. Being pure in heart is the last condition in this section, because it brings a believer to the ultimate goal of his desire and pursuit.</p>
<p>However, the Lord mentioned three more blessings after being pure in heart, because the kingdom people have the inward aspect of their heart and the outward aspect of their living. The inward aspect relates to seeking and gaining God, and the outward aspect relates to walking under God&rsquo;s rule. Therefore, the Lord gave three outward conditions after the aforementioned six inward conditions of the heart.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Peacemakers</h2>
<p>The seventh condition of blessing for the kingdom people is being peacemakers. Verse 9 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God.&rdquo; The kingdom people are poor in spirit, mourn, are meek, hunger and thirst for righteousness, and are merciful. Since this is the condition of their heart, they do not cause problems with others. The kingdom people do not sow seeds of discord. Instead, the kingdom people are peacemakers; they make peace among men.</p>
<p>There is no peace in the present age. People everywhere are scheming and struggling against one another; they are backbiting and devouring one another. There is discord in every group and family. There is discord among people, and there is discord within people. There is much self-blame, self-hatred, indignation, discontentment, restlessness, and uneasiness within man&rsquo;s heart. Within man there is also the battle between reason and lust, and his conscience is full of condemnation. Man wants to do good, but he cannot stop indulging in sin. As a result, man has no peace in himself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is no peace between man and God. Man has gone astray from God and even opposes God. Colossians 1:21 speaks of those who are alienated and enemies in their mind because of their evil works. John 3:36 says that &ldquo;the wrath of God abides upon him.&rdquo; Therefore, there is no peace between man and God.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus came to the earth as the Son of God and brought peace to man. He made peace among men and peace between man and God. He is the Peacemaker. Therefore, someone living in the kingdom of the heavens must also be one who makes peace among men. He can live in peace with all men, and he can give peace to all who contact him. The blessing for the peacemakers is to be called sons of God, because they make peace like the Son of God.</p>
<p>There are strife and discord in the church because the church lacks peacemakers. Many saints sow seeds of discord when they speak. This proves that they do not let the heavens rule. If we do not have peace with others, we cannot have peace with God. We can have peace with God only when we have peace with men. Because the Lord made peace among men and peace between man and God, we must do the same in order to be called sons of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Persecuted<br />
for the Sake of Righteousness</h2>
<p>Being peacemakers is what we do for others. Being persecuted for the sake of righteousness is what we suffer from others. It is amazing that someone living in the kingdom of the heavens is often persecuted for the sake of righteousness. Normally, a person is punished for doing evil. It does not seem possible that someone would be persecuted for the sake of righteousness. However, this is indeed the case. If we hold fast to righteousness and refuse to partake of evil or corrupt things, we will be persecuted by the world for the sake of righteousness, because the world cannot stand our righteous testimony. This is a common Christian experience.</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo; (Matt. 5:10). Those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness are blessed. If we are willing to endure loss and pain for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens, we will inherit the blessings of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Persecuted<br />
because of the Lord</h2>
<p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me.&rdquo; To be persecuted because of the Lord is higher than to be persecuted for the sake of righteousness. Confessing the Lord&rsquo;s name on every occasion, testifying that Jesus is the King of the kingdom of the heavens, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens for people to repent and come under the rule of the heavens require a believer to endure reproach, evil speaking, and persecution. However, the Lord&rsquo;s promise to such ones is, &ldquo;Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens&rdquo; (v. 12).</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIVING OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE<br />
DEPENDING ON GAINING GOD TO LIVE GOD OUT</h2>
<p>The Lord spoke concerning nine conditions of the nature of the people of the kingdom of the heavens from the inside to the outside. The walk of every genuine and truthful believer is not merely an outward activity; it involves his inward nature and character. The kind of person he is determines the kind of living he has.</p>
<p>The human spirit is man&rsquo;s deepest part, followed by his heart. The deepest and most important two parts of man are the spirit and the heart. These parts represent him. Therefore, in Matthew 5 through 7 the Lord began by speaking of the spirit. The first condition is related to the spirit, and the sixth condition is related to the heart. Thus, a person in the kingdom of the heavens needs to deal with his spirit and his heart.</p>
<p>Within man the spirit has the highest ability, because man can contact God with his spirit. This is the highest ability. Seeing with the eyes, hearing with the ears, smelling with the nose, eating and drinking with the mouth, and touching with the hands are all human abilities, but they are low. Only the ability of the spirit is high, because we can contact, touch, and gain God, who is Spirit, with our spirit.</p>
<p>The human heart is an organ with emotions. Man&rsquo;s likes and inclinations are related to his heart. Man can touch and gain God with his spirit, but if his heart does not love God or is not inclined toward God, his spirit cannot contact God. Conversely, man&rsquo;s heart may love God and be inclined toward God, but if he is not poor in spirit, he will not be able to contact or gain God. Therefore, living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens depends on our spirit and our heart. We contact God with our spirit, but our heart enables our spirit to contact God. Our spirit and our heart are indispensable. Hence, when the Lord spoke on the inner condition of the kingdom people, He began with the spirit and then spoke of the heart.</p>
<p>There are six inner conditions of the kingdom people. The first is being poor in spirit (5:3); the sixth is being pure in heart (v. 8). Those who have a normal spirit and heart have a normal relationship with God, because they desire God when they are poor in spirit, and they see God when they are pure in heart. To see is to gain; thus, in the sixth condition man gains God. When someone gains God within, he can live out the kingdom of the heavens; his living becomes noble, extraordinary, and excelling, and because he has gained God, he is filled with God, and he lives like a son of God.</p>
<p>A living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is not based on human effort. Such a living is to live God out first by being poor in spirit and pure in heart and then by gaining God and being filled with Him. The last three conditions concern the living of the kingdom people. The first condition in this group says that those who live out the kingdom life are sons of God (v. 9). Only those who live out the life of God the Father can be called sons of God, for only sons can live out the life of their father.</p>
<p>A living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens does not speak of man&rsquo;s ability but of God&rsquo;s ability. Such a life is impossible with man but possible with God (cf. 19:26; Mark 10:27). Such a living is Emmanuel being lived out of man (Matt. 1:21-23). Only by living out the Father&rsquo;s life can we be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect (5:48). In other words, the living of the kingdom of the heavens is a matter of God being mingled with man. If we accept God&rsquo;s rule, are under His authority, and live in the reality of the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens, God&rsquo;s life will mingle freely with us and live out an extraordinary life through us. This is the living of the kingdom people.</p>
<p>What is commonly called the eight Beatitudes by Christians does not touch the spiritual reality of the Lord&rsquo;s word. This section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching begins with the spirit and continues to the heart. The Lord teaches that man&rsquo;s spirit must be poor and thirsty for God and that man&rsquo;s heart must be pure and seeking God. When man&rsquo;s spirit and heart take God as the object, man gains God within and lets God live out an extraordinary life through him. Those with such a living are the kingdom people. This is the living of the kingdom people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO SIDES OF THE LIVING OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</h2>
<p>This section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching reveals two sides of the living of the kingdom people. One side is our relationship with others, and the other side is our attitude toward ourselves. Our relationship with others is centered on peace. Someone who lives in the kingdom of the heavens makes peace with others; no matter who he is with, there is only peace. We must remember that peace is the highest requirement.</p>
<p>Most believers think that it is quite high to treat others with love. The requirement of love is not as high as the requirement of peace. Someone may not have peace when he treats others with love, but he must have love in order to be at peace with others. In the church it seems as though the more love there is, the more there are strife and opinions. This is because people have love, but their flesh is not broken; they are not under the ruling of the heavens, and there is disharmony among the saints. Some saints quarrel and report it to the responsible brothers; other saints are not on speaking terms. Two sisters might be best friends and love each other very much, but they can disagree over some things and even quarrel. It is not enough to merely have love.</p>
<p>The Lord is very wise. In Matthew 5 He did not teach concerning love but concerning peace, for the demand of making peace with others is higher than that of showing love to others. Love does not require our flesh to be dealt with, but making peace requires our flesh to be dealt with and also requires that we be under the rule of the heavens and restricted by the heavens.</p>
<p>We should not think that the Lord was being overly simple in speaking of the living of the kingdom people. The Lord seemed to speak only of peace, but peace covers many matters. The Lord did not mention other matters, because it was sufficient to mention this one central and crucial matter. If we can take care of peace, every other matter will be taken care of properly. It is not sufficient to merely be humble or loving; we must have peace with others.</p>
<p>The peacemakers shall be called the sons of God because the work that the Lord Jesus as the Son of God manifested on the earth is centered on peace (v. 9). Even His death on the cross is for making peace (Eph. 2:15-16; Col. 1:20). Therefore, the living of the kingdom people should be with peace toward men. This requires dealings related to our self and our flesh. It also requires that our whole being be ruled and restricted by the heavens.</p>
<p>The relationship that others have toward us is centered on persecution and evil speaking. The evil that people can do to us is to persecute us and speak evil of us (Matt. 5:10-11). If we can accept persecution and endure evil speaking, there is nothing more that men can do to us. Moreover, people persecute us because we seek righteousness, not because we are at fault. People speak evilly of us because we preach the gospel and testify of the Lord&rsquo;s name, not because we have done evil. To stand before persecutions and evil speakings means that no matter how people treat us&mdash;well or ill, with understanding or with misunderstanding&mdash;there is nothing that we cannot withstand. We are ready to take any treatment from any person.</p>
<p>When the kingdom people are peacemakers and withstand persecution and evil speaking, they are not only blameless in their living but also lack blemishes. Peace is the center and the criterion in their dealing with people, and the kingdom people receive persecution and evil speaking from others because they seek righteousness and testify of the Lord&rsquo;s name. There is no room to preserve the self and no possibility for the flesh to exist. Their whole being is under the rule of the heavens, and they are in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NATURE OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE<br />
BEING TO BE FILLED WITH GOD<br />
AND THUS UNDER THE HEAVENLY RULE</h2>
<p>A living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is not cultivated through human effort. Instead, a living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is God being lived out from within men. The spirit is for God; thus, to be poor in spirit is to seek God. To be pure in heart is to want God and then to see, gain, and be filled with God. As a result, the kingdom people live out the God whom their spirit desires and their heart seeks. God becomes their appearance, just as He is their content. Their content is the condition of their heart, and their appearance is their outward living. Within them there is no room for the self; there is room only to be filled with God. Outwardly, there is no expression of the flesh; there is only God lived out. Therefore, they are called sons of God, for their living is the same as the living of the Lord Jesus, the Son of God.</p>
<p>In addition, such a living is wholly based on man allowing heaven to rule, because the first blessing says, &ldquo;Theirs is the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo; (v. 3). Concerning their living, the Lord again said that theirs is the kingdom of the heavens (v. 10). The kingdom people can endure persecution for the sake of righteousness because theirs is the kingdom of the heavens. This means that they are under the heavenly rule. The kingdom people do not resist persecution, because heaven rules and has dominion over them; they are unable to resist, but this is not because they do not have the flesh. They are ruled by heaven to such an extent that if they feel indignant and disagree with persecution, they are rebuked within and sense that they are overthrowing God&rsquo;s authority and rebelling against God&rsquo;s ordination. For this reason, they can be meek and accept, not resist, persecution.</p>
<p>We should pay attention to two things. One is to be filled with God and to live God out, and the other is to accept the heavenly rule and to submit to the heavenly dominion. This describes a person living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. This is also the nature of the kingdom people. When we are filled with God, we can submit to the heavenly rule, and our submitting to the heavenly rule is for living God out. Both being filled with God and submitting to the heavenly rule are indispensable. Those who are filled with God and submit to the heavenly rule are spiritual. God wants to gain such ones in this age.</p>
<p>The Lord said that those who are thus filled with God and ruled by heaven are blessed. In this section the Lord said &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; nine times. In the original Greek <em>blessed</em> implies &ldquo;happy.&rdquo; Hence, <em>blessed</em> can also be rendered as &ldquo;blessed and happy.&rdquo; People in the world seek blessing and happiness, and they want to be blessed and happy. However, earthly things are not the real blessings, nor do they bring happiness. From the Lord&rsquo;s perspective, those who are filled with God, who let heaven rule, and who live God out are blessed and happy. Only such people have true blessings and genuine happiness.</p>
<p>Some are filled with fear when they hear a message concerning the kingdom of the heavens. They say, &ldquo;Who can do this? Is it not miserable to live under such conditions?&rdquo; However, the Lord said that such people are blessed; they are happy. Are human thoughts correct, or are the Lord&rsquo;s words correct? I hope that we will all have a change in concept to see that living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens does not require our doing. If the Lord wanted us to exercise our own efforts to live in the kingdom of the heavens, He would have presented the reality of the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 1. Rather, in chapter 1 He wants us to see that He is Emmanuel in order to save us into glory (vv. 21-23). The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the goal for which the Lord saves us. He has come to give us life, and He rules in order to save us into the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. This is the blessed and happy condition of a believer.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INFLUENCE OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 5:13-16</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that the first section of the Lord&rsquo;s word that relates to the reality of the kingdom of the heavens concerns the nature of the kingdom people (Matt. 5:1-12). In this chapter we will consider the second section of the Lord&rsquo;s word in verses 13 through 16. This section concerns the influence of the kingdom people on the world.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INFLUENCE OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE<br />
BEING TARGETED AT THE CONDITIONS OF THE WORLD</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:13-16 says, &ldquo;You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt has become tasteless, with what shall it be salted? It is no longer good for anything except to be cast out and trampled underfoot by men. You are the light of the world. It is impossible for a city situated upon a mountain to be hidden. Nor do men light a lamp and place it under the bushel, but on the lampstand; and it shines to all who are in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.&rdquo; This portion reveals that a person who lives in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens will surely have influence on the world. Today many Christians lack influence on the world because they are not living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. However, the more we have the condition of the kingdom people, the more influence we will have on the world.</p>
<p>Those who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens will have a certain influence on the people around them. This influence is not the result of human effort; rather, it is spontaneous. Verses 3 through 12 reveal that the kingdom people live out God because they allow the heavens to rule over them. Hence, their influence causes people to touch the authority of the heavens and to know God.</p>
<p>In verses 13 through 16 the Lord Jesus described the influence of the kingdom people and referred to them as the salt of the earth and the light of the world. This means that the condition of the world is the target of the influence of the kingdom people. Although the world is complicated, it has only two main elements: corruption, or rottenness, and darkness.</p>
<p>Christians acknowledge that the world is corrupt and dark, and even people in the world acknowledge that this world is corrupt and dark. The world is being corrupted and degraded daily. An organization may have a grand and noble appearance, but under the surface it may be rotten and corrupt. Just like the age before the flood, the present age is completely corrupt in the eyes of God. Furthermore, the world is dark and without light. The world is evil, and its future is perilous, but people in the world continue in their sins as if they do not see anything. They are completely ignorant regarding divine and spiritual matters. They do not know what they should escape from, nor do they know what they should gain. This proves that this world is in darkness.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus spoke concerning the influence of the kingdom people on the world, He specifically targeted the conditions of corruption and darkness. Only those who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens can influence this corrupted world and give light to this world.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SALT OF THE EARTH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Eliminating Corruption and Seasoning</h2>
<p>In verse 13 the Lord said that the kingdom people are the salt of the earth. If fish or meat is marinated in salt, it will not easily rot, because salt has the function of killing germs and preventing corruption. If the kingdom people have the nature spoken of in verses 3 through 12, they will be the salt of the earth. Wherever they are, they will manifest the functions of killing germs and preventing corruption. As a result, it is possible to deal with the corruption in the earth.</p>
<p>The other function of salt is seasoning. In the spiritual sense, to season is to blend together different elements that cannot otherwise be blended. In other words, to season is to make peace. Suppose the saints in a local church are full of the flesh and spiritual germs. These saints will always be in conflict and discord. When people visit this locality, they will smell a bad odor. However, if some saints in this locality live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, that is, allow the heavens to rule and allow God to live out from them, the flesh and the spiritual germs will eventually be killed. As a result, there will no longer be conflict, opinions, contentions, or discord, and the saints will be blended together. Then the people who come into their midst will smell a good fragrance. This is the function of seasoning.</p>
<p>The kingdom people can manifest the function of seasoning because they kill spiritual germs and because they blend different flavors together to produce a pleasant taste. This function comes out of their nature. As the salt of the earth, the kingdom people spontaneously have the function of killing germs and seasoning.</p><h2 class="head2">Putting Off Natural Goodness and Corruption</h2>
<p>It is significant that the Lord called the kingdom people the salt of the earth. There are two types of physical salt. There is rock salt, which is dug out from the ground, and there is sea salt, which is extracted from seawater. Hence, the earth and the sea are the two sources of salt. These two sources signify the two conditions of the believers before they were saved. In the Bible the earth refers to the world that God created and desires to gain, and the sea refers to the world that Satan corrupts and occupies. The earth is composed of dust, and the sea is composed of water. Hence, dust and water both signify our condition before being saved.</p>
<p>In the Bible dust often signifies the man whom God created, and water signifies the fallen man corrupted by Satan. Genesis 2:7 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground.&rdquo; First Corinthians 15:47 says, &ldquo;The first man is out of the earth, earthy.&rdquo; This means that he was a man of dust (cf. Gen. 3:19). Therefore, dust signifies the sinless and uncorrupted man created by God. In Revelation 17 the apostle John saw the harlot, Babylon the Great, sitting on the waters. Verse 15 says, &ldquo;The waters,...where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.&rdquo; Here <em>waters</em> signifies fallen men corrupted by Satan. With regard to creation, man is of dust from the earth that God created and desires to gain. However, with regard to the fall, man is corrupted in the world occupied by Satan.</p>
<p>That salt is produced out of the earth and from seawater signifies that the kingdom people were once like people in the world, because they were created and were natural and because they were fallen and corrupted. However, the Lord&rsquo;s salvation delivered the kingdom people out of the earth and the sea. Just as salt is different in nature from dust and water, so the kingdom people are neither earthy and natural nor fallen and corrupted. They are a different kind of people; they are people of the new creation (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
<p>In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord said that we are the salt of the earth, in order to show that we must be freed from the elements of dust and water so that we may manifest the function of salt. Of course, evil and sin should not be found in us, but even the goodness that is out of our natural being, which people praise, should not be preserved. Such goodness replaces the spiritual reality and prevents us from living in the reality of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Regrettably, many Christians still live in their natural goodness. Some even live in sins. It is difficult to distinguish salt when it is mixed with dust, and salt that is added to water will dissolve and disappear. Some saints are good Christians, but they are not spiritual Christians, for although they may have goodness, meekness, and humility, they do not have God. Because they remain in their natural goodness, they are still dust. Some saints are still mixed with worldly people and have a corrupt and evil element in their living. This indicates that they are still in the sea; hence, they are unable to manifest the function of salt. The kingdom people are the most unique people in the universe. They do not merely have the nature of the God-created man, nor do they have the nature of the Satan-corrupted man. Just as salt does not have the elements of dust and water, we should not possess the elements of natural goodness or corruption.</p>
<p>Salt that does not possess dust or water is not merely clean; it is also pure. Purity is different from cleanness. Something that is clean may still have mixture, but something that is pure has no mixture. Every grain of salt is transparent and clear, and it tastes pure. These characteristics indicate that salt is pure.</p>
<p>As the kingdom people, we should manifest the killing and seasoning functions of salt. On the one hand, we should eliminate corruption and blend flavors; on the other hand, we should deal with the elements of natural goodness and corruption. If we are under the authority of the heavens and allow God to live out of us, we will be delivered from the elements of dust and water to become pure, having no mixture. Then we will spontaneously have a germ-killing and corruption-preventing influence on the world. Both the church and the present corrupted world need such people. Wherever the kingdom people go, they make peace, eliminate discord, and remove factors of conflict. This is the function of the salt of the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Willing to Lose the Self</h2>
<p>In order for salt to manifest its function, it must be lost in the substance in which it is being blended. Likewise, for the kingdom people to manifest the function of salt, they also must be lost among the people with whom they are blending. This requires a great price. This price is perhaps greater than the price of dealing with the elements of natural goodness and corruption.</p>
<p>Some believers have a normal spiritual condition; that is, they seek the Lord and are under His dealings. They have attained the status of being salt. However, they are not able to manifest the function of salt in the church. If we carefully study this situation, we will realize that these believers try to remain whole and are unwilling to be lost among the believers whom they contact. For example, a brother may desperately ask such a believer for help, but the believer replies, &ldquo;I do not have time to talk, because it is my prayer time.&rdquo; This believer cares only for his spirituality and living before the Lord while neglecting the needs of others. As a result, he cannot manifest his function in the church.</p>
<p>The function of salt depends on its being dissolved and lost. If we are willing to lose ourselves, we will become a supply to others. Some believers are excessive in pursuing the Lord. It is right to pursue the Lord, but the purpose of our pursuit is the manifestation of our function. Someone who is unwilling to lose his self will not have any function. The Lord often requires us to lose our spiritual strength in order to help others. If we preserve our spiritual &ldquo;wholeness&rdquo; and our self, we will not be able to manifest our usefulness before the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Becoming Tasteless</h2>
<p>In Matthew 5:13 the Lord spoke of salt becoming tasteless. When salt becomes tasteless, it loses its function. Some believers do not manifest their function as salt, because they preserve the self. Other believers do not manifest their function as salt, because they have lost their taste. The function of salt comes from its salty taste. When salt loses its taste, it loses its function.</p>
<p>Salt becomes tasteless when it returns to dust or to water, that is, when it is mixed with dust or water. To be mixed with water means to be defiled by sin and to fall into sin. To be mixed with dust means to return to the world and to be occupied by the world. In Luke 17 the Lord said, &ldquo;Remember Lot&rsquo;s wife&rdquo; (v. 32). This is a warning. Lot&rsquo;s wife became a pillar of salt because she took a lingering look at Sodom, which indicates that she loved and treasured the evil world that God was about to judge and utterly destroy (Gen. 19:24-26). A pillar of salt is a huge rock of salt. Salt is useful when it is ground into fine grains. A pillar of salt is useless.</p>
<p>Both dust, which signifies our natural goodness, and water, which signifies corruption, will cause us to lose our salty taste. If the kingdom people become tasteless, they are &ldquo;no longer good for anything except to be cast out and trampled underfoot by men&rdquo; (Matt. 5:13). May we all become useful salt before God. Many Christians are prosperous in the world, but they may not be useful in the eyes of God. Whether our life is useful depends upon whether we manifest the function of salt. On the one hand, we need to be rid of the elements of natural goodness and corruption; on the other hand, we must not preserve the wholeness of our self, and we must be willing to be lost among the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING THE LIGHT IN THE WORLD</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:14 says, &ldquo;You are the light of the world.&rdquo; Salt and light both speak of the influence of the kingdom people upon the world, but there is a distinction between salt and light. With regard to salt, the emphasis is on the nature of the kingdom people, but with regard to light, the emphasis is on the conduct of the kingdom people. As far as nature is concerned, salt is salty both inwardly and outwardly. Light, however, is only seen when it is shining and manifested. If light is hidden or is not shining out, it cannot be called light. The light in verse 14 refers to the light of an oil lamp. When a lamp is lit, there is light, but when the light is put out, there is only oil. This shows that light is not a matter of nature; light is a matter of expression and manifestation. Therefore, <em>light</em> here does not refer to the inward nature of the kingdom people; rather, it refers to their outward conduct. Hence, in verse 16 the Lord said, &ldquo;In the same way, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Eliminating Darkness</h2>
<p>Salt eliminates corruption, but light eliminates darkness. What is darkness? Darkness is the absence of light. When light comes, darkness vanishes. If the kingdom people obey the authority of the heavens and allow God to live out of them, they become germ-killing and corruption-preventing salt in their nature as well as darkness-eliminating light in their living and conduct. Wherever the kingdom people are, there is brightness. Some people live in darkness and are confused inwardly; they have no understanding of spiritual things. However, when they enter into the church, they become bright inwardly and begin to see clearly. They are able to see what they were unable to see previously, they are able to solve what they were unable to solve previously, they are clear about things that confused them previously, and they are able to discern what they were unable to discern previously, because they have touched light, and light eliminates darkness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SHINING BY BEING FILLED WITH GOD,<br />
BEING DELIVERED FROM THE ELEMENTS<br />
OF CREATION AND CORRUPTION,<br />
AND ALLOWING THE HEAVENS TO RULE</h2>
<p>How do the kingdom people shine? In these verses light is generated by burning oil. Oil signifies the indwelling Spirit (Isa. 61:1; Heb. 1:9). In Matthew 25 the Lord spoke the parable of ten virgins going out to meet their bridegroom with their lamps (vv. 1-13). This parable shows that it is not enough to have oil in our lamp; we must have oil in our vessel as well. Although the light of a lamp depends on the oil in the lamp, we must have oil in our vessel in order to shine until the Lord comes. Man was created as a vessel for God (Rom. 9:21, 23-24), and man&rsquo;s person is in his soul. Hence, <em>vessels</em> in Matthew 25:4 signifies the souls of the believers.</p>
<p>To have oil in our lamp is to have the Spirit of God dwelling in our spirit (Rom. 8:9, 16). To have oil in our vessel is to have the Spirit of God filling and saturating our soul. In order to shine in the world, we need the Spirit of God not only to dwell in our spirit but also to spread into, fill, and saturate our soul. If the Spirit of God does not spread into our soul, we will not shine brightly. In order for us to shine, we must let the Spirit of God fill our soul. The Spirit of God is God Himself. Hence, to be filled with oil is to be filled with God. On the one hand, we are the salt of the earth; hence, we are being delivered from the elements of the natural man and of corruption. On the other hand, we are the light of the world; hence, we are being filled with the element of God. With regard to salt, the emphasis is on deliverance; with regard to light, the emphasis is on filling.</p>
<p>The kingdom people must first be delivered from negative things in order for their light to be manifested. Matthew 5:14 says, &ldquo;It is impossible for a city situated upon a mountain to be hidden.&rdquo; This indicates that the kingdom people are a city situated on a mountain; they are manifested before the world. This also shows that the kingdom people have a high and transcendent position. After the flood receded, the ark rested on the mountains (Gen. 8:3-4). There is not much dust or water on a high mountain. Therefore, a city situated on a mountain is delivered from the elements of dust and water. If the kingdom people are delivered from the elements of the natural man and corruption and are filled with the element of God, they are like a city situated on a mountain.</p>
<p>In the Bible a mountain also implies authority and ruling. According to Daniel 2, the Lord is the stone cut out without hands that struck the great human image and then became a great mountain that filled the whole earth (vv. 34-35). In the millennial kingdom the Lord will rule and reign over the whole earth. He will become a great mountain. Therefore, a mountain implies authority and ruling.</p>
<p>The city in Matthew 5:14 signifies our human living, because a city is the center of human living. The city situated upon a mountain signifies that the living of the kingdom people is situated and upheld on a mountain. Their living is their conduct and is based on the authority of the kingdom of the heavens and governed by the authority of the kingdom of the heavens. Thus, this living is a light that shines before men.</p>
<p>This light is the living of the kingdom people who are under the authority of heaven, and it is the conduct of the kingdom people who allow the heavens to rule. Such a living and conduct are delivered from the elements of the natural man and of corruption; such living and conduct are also completely subject to God&rsquo;s heavenly rule. Therefore, the Lord said that the kingdom people are a city situated upon a mountain.</p>
<p>As salt, we need to be dissolved, to lose the self, but as light, we need to be manifested. The function of salt depends on its being lost, that is, dissolved, but the function of light depends on its being manifested. As long as salt is lost, its function is fulfilled, and as long as light is manifested, its function is fulfilled.</p>
<p>In our spiritual experience what does it mean to be lost? To be lost requires us to lose the self. What does it mean to be manifested? To be manifested requires us to be filled with God and to allow the heavens to rule. When we are completely filled with God and allow the heavens to rule, we will be completely manifested. However, our person will not be manifested. Rather, our living and conduct will be manifested. On the one hand, our person is lost, and we do not assume a position, but on the other hand, our living and conduct are like a city situated upon a mountain, which is bright and manifested.</p>
<p>An example in the nineteenth century is the living of George M&#252;ller. His living is still like a city situated upon a mountain and manifested on the earth. Although we never contacted him, his living is manifested as light. He did not manifest the natural element, nor did he manifest the fallen, corrupted element. Everything related to George M&#252;ller was transcendent and heavenly and shined brightly before the world.</p>
<p>The Lord was on a mountain when He spoke concerning the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and concerning the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. This means that we must be delivered from dust, which signifies the natural element, and from water, which signifies corruption. A mountain has a high, fresh, and heavenly condition and atmosphere. Only when we live in such a condition are we able to understand the things of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Being Covered by a Bushel</h2>
<p>In Matthew 5:15 the Lord said, &ldquo;Nor do men light a lamp and place it under the bushel, but on the lampstand; and it shines to all who are in the house.&rdquo; A bushel is an instrument for measuring grain for the purpose of buying and selling. Spiritually speaking, a bushel signifies people earning money in order to make a living and have food to eat. This indicates that making a living can cover our light. On the one hand, while we live in the world, we should work with our own hands (1 Thes. 4:11), and we should not be lazy. On the other hand, we must realize that Satan often utilizes the matter of making a living to occupy God&rsquo;s people. If we carefully observe the situation among Christians, we will admit that the kingdom people often cannot shine for the Lord because they are too busy making a living. Those who are occupied with their eating, which is necessary for their living, do not care about shining for God.</p>
<p>If a lamp is placed under a bushel, its light will not be able to shine forth, and the lamp will eventually go out. We need to ask ourselves, &ldquo;Is my lamp under a bushel?&rdquo; If we cannot forget about making a living and about eating and are always afraid of going hungry, we are placing our lamp under a bushel. In order to shine for the Lord, we must first overcome the matters related to our living and our eating. Hence, in Matthew 6:25 the Lord said, &ldquo;Do not be anxious for your life, what you should eat or what you should drink; nor for your body, what you should put on,&rdquo; and in verse 32 He said, &ldquo;Your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.&rdquo; Let us give all these things to God! He is responsible for us and will take care of us. If many saints can break their bushels, our light will shine brighter.</p>
<p>Our lamp should not be covered or bound by a bushel; rather, it should be placed on a lampstand. A lamp placed on a lampstand is the same as a city being situated on a mountain. If we read 5:14 and 15 carefully, we will realize that the city in verse 14 is the lamp in verse 15, and the mountain in verse 14 is the lampstand in verse 15. Both the city on a mountain and the lamp on a lampstand indicate that the position of the kingdom people should be transcendent and heavenly. Such believers are transcendent and free. Everything related to their living, such as their reputation, position, education, and material riches, are not able to affect them; rather, everything is under their feet. However, if their lamp is under their bushel, the bushel will control them. The kingdom people are on the lampstand and above everything. Hence, their light is not covered but shines brightly.</p>
<p>We should not receive this word as mere doctrine. If our light is not shining brightly, it must be because we are still covered. We must ask the Lord to enlighten us so that we may see what is covering us. Any person, matter, or thing that controls us is a bushel that covers us. If we are befuddled by a romantic love, that love is a bushel. If our business occupies us such that we have no desire to draw near to the Lord, that business is a bushel. If our children occupy all our attention and time, our children are a bushel. When such persons, matters, and things touch us, we will be ruled by them and unable to transcend.</p>
<p>There is a common Chinese saying: &ldquo;A lamp set on a high place shines over a lower place.&rdquo; In Genesis 1 God set the sun, the moon, and the stars in the expanse of heaven, and they gave light on the earth (vv. 16-17). This shows that the position of the kingdom people has much to do with their light. When they leave the heavenly and transcendent position, they lose their ability to shine.</p>
<p>When a lamp is placed on a lampstand, it shines to all who are in the house. The house in Matthew 5:15 points to a realm. Our environment, such as a school, a store, an institution, or a home, is the realm where we shine. If our light is shining brightly, everyone in our realm will be enlightened.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Basis of Shining and the Realm of Shining</h2>
<p>Psalm 121:1-2 says, &ldquo;I will lift up my eyes to the hills. / From where will my help come? / My help comes from Jehovah, / Who made heaven and earth.&rdquo; These verses imply that God is in the hills. Isaiah 14:13 also indicates that God is on the mountain, in the highest place. First Timothy 6:16 says that God dwells in unapproachable light. Many verses in the Bible, such as 1 Kings 22:19; Psalm 29:10; 55:19; and Revelation 7:10, say that God is sitting on the throne. According to these verses, God is on the mountains, in unapproachable light, and on the throne. Therefore, when we touch God, we are on the mountain and in the light; that is, we touch the throne of God.</p>
<p>Instead of desiring dust and water, we should desire the mountains. If we are willing to pay the price to be filled with the indwelling Spirit, we will touch the high mountains. Whenever we are filled with the Spirit, we are on the high mountains. Revelation 21:10 says that John was carried away in spirit by an angel onto a great and high mountain and was shown the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. The throne of God and the light of God are in the holy city (22:3; 21:23).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 5 is simple, but the significance of His word is rich and profound. If we carefully consider verses 13 through 15, we will realize that this word is meaningful. The Lord first said that we are the salt of the earth and then that we are the light of the world. If He had first said that we are the light of the world and then that we are the salt of the earth, the order would have been incorrect, because our inward nature is the basis, and our outward conduct is the expression. There must be first the inward nature and then the outward conduct. We must first be delivered from dust and water to be salt before we can shine as light.</p>
<p>When the Lord spoke of being the light of the world, He used the picture of a city situated upon a mountain to indicate the position of our shining. He also used the picture of a lamp shining to all who are in the house to indicate the realm of our shining. When the kingdom people are shining, they have the position of a city situated on a mountain. As a result, they shine to all who are in the house. This implies that when the kingdom people are shining in the world, their position is high and great, because a city is great and a mountain is high. However, when the kingdom people function, they do not expect to be high or great; rather, they function in a smaller realm.</p>
<p>The basis for the kingdom people to shine on the earth is high and transcendent, because the God of glory is their life and power for them to live on the earth. However, the living of the kingdom people is humble and lowly; they are willing to be lowly people. They are not puffed up, nor are they haughty. They simply shine forth light upon those who come into contact with them. What a beautiful scene.</p><h2 class="head2">Glorifying the Father Who Is in the Heavens</h2>
<p>In verse 16 the Lord said, &ldquo;In the same way, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.&rdquo; The light of the kingdom people should shine before men like a city situated on a mountain and like a lamp placed on a lampstand. On the one hand, they are delivered from the natural element and from corruption. On the other hand, they are filled with oil, submit to the authority of the heavens, and are preserved from the covering of making a living and doing business. As a result, when their light shines, men see their good works and glorify the Father who is in the heavens.</p>
<p>In Mark 14:6 the Lord praised Mary by saying, &ldquo;She has done a noble deed on Me.&rdquo; Titus 2:14 says that the Lord has redeemed us from all lawlessness and purified to Himself a particular people as His unique possession, zealous of good works. The Greek words translated as &ldquo;good works&rdquo; in Matthew 5:16 are the same Greek words that are translated as &ldquo;noble deed&rdquo; in Mark 14:6 and as &ldquo;good works&rdquo; in Titus 2:14. Hence, the good works in Matthew 5:16 refer to a good, proper, and righteous conduct. Such good works are the conduct that is under the ruling of the heavens. They are the conduct of created men who are delivered from natural goodness and corruption to live out God. When people see this conduct, they will glorify the Father who is in the heavens.</p>
<p>The people who see such conduct glorify the Father who is in the heavens because such good, proper, and righteous conduct expresses and lives out God. If the disciples of Confucius could reach their ultimate goal, they would live out only human goodness. As a result, others would feel only that they are good, but God&rsquo;s glory would not be seen. The kingdom people, however, are different. The kingdom people live out God under the ruling of the heavens. They express God. Therefore, other people see the glory of God, which is God expressed. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was the expression of God. Hence, the Bible says that He is &ldquo;the effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance&rdquo; (Heb. 1:3). The kingdom people live out God in the same way that the Lord Jesus lived out God. As a result, people do not only see their good conduct; people also see the expressed God and thus glorify the Father who is in the heavens. It is crucial for us to realize that the kind of good works that glorify God are the works that live out God and express God. I hope that we will be deeply impressed with this point.</p>
<p>According to Matthew 5:16, glory is given not to the God who is in the heavens but to the Father who is in the heavens. When the Bible speaks of God, the emphasis is on His being the Creator. When it speaks of the Father, the emphasis is on His being our begetting Father. If God were only God, He could not be expressed through us. In order to be expressed through us, He must also be the Father to beget us by putting life into us (1 Pet. 1:3).</p>
<p>In Matthew 5 through 7 the Lord rarely spoke of God, but He constantly spoke of the Father. This is a matter of life. The kingdom people are born of God to have God as their Father. Hence, when they live by trusting in God, they have the Father&rsquo;s glory in them and are able to glorify the Father who is in the heavens.</p>
<p>In the phrase <em>Father who is in the heavens</em> the word <em>Father</em> is related to life, but the word <em>heavens</em> is related to authority. Daniel 4:26 says, &ldquo;The heavens do rule.&rdquo; This indicates that the heavens imply authority. The conduct of the kingdom people is the living out of the Father&rsquo;s life and is also produced out of the ruling of the heavens.</p>
<p>When the kingdom people are delivered from natural goodness and corruption, are filled with oil, and are subject to the ruling of the heavens, they will have a certain living and conduct. The people who see this living will sense the expression of God and the flavor of the ruling of the heavens. Such a living and conduct are not of men but of God. Such a living is not earthly but heavenly. Such a living is the issue of the ruling and the controlling of the heavens and results in people glorifying the Father who is in the heavens.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LAW OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 5:17-48</h1>
<p>In this chapter we come to the third section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching concerning the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, which concerns the law of the kingdom people. Because this section is at the center of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching, the Lord spoke at length concerning the law of the kingdom people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>First, we need to consider the meaning and significance of the law. Upon hearing the word <em>law,</em> many saints immediately say, &ldquo;The law is a demand, a bondage, that requires us to do what we cannot do and to behave in ways that we cannot behave. Those who are under the law are cursed; however, we are no longer under the law but under grace. We have nothing to do with the law.&rdquo; Although this word has a basis in the Scriptures, there is a positive aspect as well as a negative aspect to the significance of the law.</p>
<p>Apparently, the law speaks only of demands. However, the law speaks of demands because the law represents authority. If there were no authority, there would be no demands. Demands come from authority. Therefore, demands are based on authority.</p>
<p>Every country has its laws. Furthermore, every citizen in a country must keep the regulations of the law and meet the demands of the law, because every country has authority. The setting of the law is authority. A country has authority over its citizens. Therefore, a country can demand its citizens to keep its laws. In a family parents can make demands on their children, because parents have authority. A person who is unrelated to you is not qualified to demand anything of you, because he has no authority over you. However, our parents can ask us to do things, they can forbid us from doing things, and they can even punish us, because our parents have authority over us. Similarly, God has given us the law, and He can make demands on us because He has authority over us. The law is the embodiment of God&rsquo;s authority. God&rsquo;s authority rests with the law. If God&rsquo;s law and its demands were set aside, God&rsquo;s authority would become empty and vague. It is impossible for someone who has not accepted God&rsquo;s law or who has not met the demands of God&rsquo;s law to be under God&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<p>Many saints have only a negative understanding of the law. As soon as they hear the word <em>law,</em> they think that it refers to an unattainable demand and that the law is in some way annulled. Such a concept is inaccurate. Is it improper for God to require us to not worship idols or to not serve other gods? Is it wrong for Him to require us to honor our parents? Is God wrong in forbidding us to kill, commit adultery, or steal? These requirements are proper and right. Hence, Romans 7:12 says, &ldquo;The law is holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, although the law can demand that man do good, the law does not supply man with life or with the ability to do good (Gal. 3:12). Romans 8:3 speaks of &ldquo;that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh.&rdquo; Out of the works of the law no flesh can be justified before God (3:20). Hebrews 7:19 even says that the law perfected nothing. Although man cannot keep the law by his own effort, he does not know his condition nor does he trust in God&rsquo;s grace. Instead, man seeks to establish his own righteousness (Rom. 10:3). Herein lies man&rsquo;s failure.</p>
<p>Even though man failed, God did not annul His law. Because man cannot meet God&rsquo;s demand, God met His own demand through the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection and through His becoming man&rsquo;s life. This is the New Testament. The New Testament does not annul God&rsquo;s demand; rather, it adds God&rsquo;s supply. God did not annul the demand of the law, because His authority rests in the law. Throughout the generations God has desired to restore His authority, which is sustained by the law. Therefore, when the Old Testament age ended and the New Testament age began, that is, in the first book of the New Testament, the Lord spoke about the demand of the law when He preached the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>When the Lord preached the gospel, people heard the truth concerning the forgiveness of sins and concerning life. They also heard many gracious words from His mouth. With their own eyes they saw Him heal the sick, raise the dead, and perform many deeds of grace. They might have thought that the Lord Jesus was only being gracious to man, demanding nothing from man. However, when the Lord Jesus went up to the mountain with His disciples, He gave a lengthy teaching that began with demands, such as being poor in spirit, mourning, being meek, hungering and thirsting for righteousness, being merciful, being pure in heart, and being salt and light (5:1-8, 13-16). The disciples might have been perplexed because the Lord&rsquo;s tone on the mountain was different from His tone prior to going up the mountain. Before they went up the mountain, everything was grace and supply, but on the mountain there were only demands.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s teaching on the mountain is not different from the gospel of grace. There is no contradiction. Rather, the gospel of grace fulfills His teaching on the mountain. The Lord came to supply man and to give man grace so that man could be brought under the authority of the kingdom of the heavens and live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. The Lord became flesh and dwelt among men in order to establish this authority. Therefore, in the Gospel of Matthew the Lord spoke concerning the nature of the people of the kingdom of the heavens (vv. 1-12), concerning their influence on the world (vv. 13-16), and concerning the demands of the law that the authority of the kingdom of the heavens has on us (vv. 17-48). When we accept these demands and meet these demands by life, we are under God&rsquo;s authority and are living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>The third section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching concerning the reality of the kingdom of the heavens begins in verse 17, which says, &ldquo;Do not think that I have come to abolish the law.&rdquo; This means that we should not think that the Lord came to abolish the law. Such a thought is inaccurate. The Lord said, &ldquo;I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill&rdquo; (v. 17b). The Lord seemed to be saying that the Old Testament law made demands but that these demands were not perfect or complete. The Lord came to fulfill these demands in order to perfect and complete the law. The Old Testament law can be likened to a piece of light blue cloth. The Lord did not come to abolish the cloth but to deepen its color, that is, to make it deep blue.</p>
<p>In coming to the earth to give grace, the Lord did not annul authority, nor did He annul the demands of the law. Instead, He completed the demands of the law. A complete demand brings in a complete authority to the earth so that God can rule among men. The demand of the Old Testament was relative, but the demand of the kingdom of the heavens is absolute. The Lord did not come to lead people into keeping the Old Testament law. In fact, He said that the demands of the Old Testament law were not complete. Hence, He came to bring the kingdom of the heavens to man. Only the demand and authority of the kingdom of the heavens are complete and perfect.</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:19 the Lord said, &ldquo;Whoever annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whoever practices and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; This verse indicates that how we practice the laws and the commandments determines our greatness in the kingdom of the heavens. If we practice the law and are under its authority, we have more of the element of the kingdom of the heavens in us and are greater in the kingdom of the heavens. If we do not practice the law and are not under its authority, we have less of the element of the kingdom of the heavens in us and are less in the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>In verse 20 the Lord said, &ldquo;I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; Righteousness requires man to fulfill the demands of the law. God&rsquo;s demands are lawful, fair, and reasonable. If we meet these demands, we have righteousness before God. The scribes and Pharisees tried to meet the demands of the Old Testament law, but their righteousness would not have been complete even if they had been able to keep the law. The Lord came to fulfill the demands of the Old Testament law; hence, our righteousness should surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees. Their righteousness was a matter of fulfilling the incomplete demands of the Old Testament law, but our righteousness is a matter of fulfilling the complete demands of the kingdom of the heavens. The scribes and Pharisees sought for righteousness by fulfilling the law of letters through their own efforts. Our surpassing righteousness, however, comes from fulfilling the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens by God&rsquo;s life. We must have such a full and surpassing righteousness in order to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today and in order to reign together with the Lord in the coming manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>How do we know if we are living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and are under the ruling of the authority of the kingdom of the heavens? Having this surpassing righteousness depends on meeting the Lord&rsquo;s fuller demands. The living of the people of the kingdom of the heavens is a matter of being ruled inwardly by the kingdom of the heavens. The Lord&rsquo;s word in this section describes the living of a person who is inwardly ruled by the kingdom of the heavens. The inward ruling is the basis for our outward living, and our outward living is a proof of the inward ruling. Our outward living manifests the inward condition of our living under the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:21 through 48 the Lord spoke in detail concerning the various demands of the kingdom of the heavens. This proves that the Lord came to complete the Old Testament demands. From these verses we have a picture of the living of the people of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING ANGER</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:21 through 26 concerns anger. In verses 21 and 22 the Lord said, &ldquo;You have heard that it was said to the ancients, &lsquo;You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment.&rsquo; But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment.&rdquo; Concerning anger, the Old Testament law requires only that we not murder, but the kingdom of the heavens requires that we not be angry. The requirement of the kingdom of the heavens is fuller and more complete than the demand of the Old Testament law.</p>
<p>In the second half of verse 22 the Lord said, &ldquo;Whoever says to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the judgment of the Sanhedrin; and whoever says, Moreh, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire.&rdquo; The word <em>raca</em> means &ldquo;stupid, good-for-nothing.&rdquo; This is an expression of contempt. To say &ldquo;Raca&rdquo; to one&rsquo;s brother is to belittle and despise him. Saying merely raca to one&rsquo;s brother makes one liable to the judgment of the Sanhedrin. The Sanhedrin refers to the Jewish council. Because the Lord&rsquo;s audience was Jewish, this word refers to matters that would be understood from their Jewish background. The word <em>moreh</em> means &ldquo;fool.&rdquo; This is a Hebrew expression of condemnation. Therefore, to say &ldquo;Moreh&rdquo; to one&rsquo;s brother is more serious than belittling or despising him. The Lord&rsquo;s word here shows that those who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens cannot get angry, nor can they belittle or despise their brothers. Getting angry and belittling and despising others are related to our temper and our flesh. In other words, the Lord demands that we have no temper and no flesh. We must put our self to death, and we must deal with our temper and our flesh. Then we can meet the demand of the kingdom of the heavens, and our righteousness will surpass that of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>In verses 23 and 24 the Lord said, &ldquo;If you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.&rdquo; This example is based on the Jewish background. Some people think that because the Lord&rsquo;s word in this section refers to items from the Jewish background, this teaching was given to the Jews. This view is inaccurate. The Lord&rsquo;s teaching concerning the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is for all His disciples. The disciples who followed the Lord when He was on the earth were still in Judaism; therefore, the Lord sometimes gave examples from their Jewish background, and He also followed some Jewish regulations. For example, after the Lord cleansed the leper in chapter 8, He said to him, &ldquo;Go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded&rdquo; (v. 4). In 5:23 the offering of a gift at the altar is in this principle. As Christians, we do not have an outward, visible altar, nor do we need to offer up physical gifts. Spiritually speaking, however, we should offer up gifts at the altar.</p>
<p>The offering of a gift refers to fellowship with God. An offering was related to sin, but a gift was related to fellowship with God. Here the Lord was saying that if we remember that a brother has something against us while we are fellowshipping with God, we should deal with the matter first and then continue our fellowship with God. A person in the kingdom of the heavens must not have any barriers between him and others.</p>
<p>Verse 23 speaks of a brother having something against us. It does not say who offended whom. Therefore, we should not think that we need to be reconciled with our brother only if we are in the wrong. Even if we are not in the wrong, we must go and be reconciled to our brother if he has something against us. This is not a matter of offending but of having something against someone and of reconciliation. This is a severe demand that requires us to have no anger, no flesh, and no self. Someone under the Old Testament law might never murder and thus be according to the law&rsquo;s demand of not murdering, but he may be full of anger and the flesh. A person in the kingdom of the heavens should not murder, but even more he should not have anger, the flesh, or the self. The law of the kingdom of the heavens requires that we put our anger, our flesh, and our self to death. The Old Testament law requires man only to not murder, but the New Testament kingdom of the heavens requires us to die, to put to death our anger, our flesh, and our self, which is equal to dying.</p>
<p>In verses 25 and 26 the Lord went on to say, &ldquo;Be well disposed quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way, lest the opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out from there until you pay the last quadrans.&rdquo; The phrase <em>your opponent at law</em> indicates that we may be in the wrong. According to verse 23, a brother can have something against us even though we are not in the wrong. In verse 25 we are in the wrong and have an opponent at law. Whether or not we are in the wrong, we must seek to be well disposed toward all. This demand of the law of the kingdom of the heavens requires that we be unreasonable toward ourselves. If we argue that the brother is wrong but that we are not, this reasoning proves that we still have anger, the flesh, and the self.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word shows that those who have problems with other believers cannot have normal fellowship with God. The fellowship between us and the brothers is a prerequisite of our fellowship with God. God does not ask whether we are right or wrong; He asks about our fellowship with the brothers. If we have a problem with a brother, God will say, &ldquo;Do not come to offer a gift to Me, for it is not acceptable to Me. You must first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then you can come to Me.&rdquo; Therefore, the Lord is touching a very serious matter here.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>while you are with him on the way</em> signifies that we are still living in this life. We are not yet before the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10); we are still on this heavenly journey together. Therefore, we must grasp the opportunity to be well disposed toward our brother. If we lose the opportunity, the Lord will judge us in the future, and we will be chastised and suffer loss. The word <em>quadrans</em> in <em>until you pay the last quadrans</em> is not focused on material riches but on the smallest shortcoming that we have toward others. If we do not deal with our shortcomings today, one day the Lord will chastise us until we have dealt with every shortcoming.</p>
<p>The demand of the New Testament kingdom of the heavens concerning anger is much higher than that of the Old Testament law. The Old Testament law requires us only to not murder, but the kingdom of the heavens requires us to not reason and respond in anger. The focus in the kingdom of the heavens is not on whether our outward conduct or actions are right but on whether our heart and spirit have peace and are proper. Under the demand of the kingdom of the heavens, it is not a matter of actions but of our heart and spirit. If we are under the authority of the kingdom and allow the cross to deal with our temper and flesh, our heart will be at peace, and our spirit will be proper. Then, instead of disputing, we will seek to be well disposed toward others. This is the highest expression of those who are ruled by the kingdom of the heavens.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING LUST</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:27 through 32 concerns lust. In verses 27 and 28 the Lord said, &ldquo;You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;You shall not commit adultery.&rsquo; But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.&rdquo; The Old Testament law demands that man not act on lustful thoughts outwardly, but the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens demands that man not have lustful thoughts inwardly. A person under the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens must not only abstain from lustful conduct but also from lustful thoughts. Therefore, this demand is also more complete and perfect than the demand of the Old Testament law.</p>
<p>The Lord warned that if the sin of lust is not properly dealt with, a person is in danger of being cast into Gehenna. If our eye sins, we should deal with our eye, and if our hand sins, we should deal with our hand. We must not tolerate our sinning members. Verses 29 and 30 say, &ldquo;If your right eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you...If your right hand stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you&rdquo; (vv. 29-30). This does not mean that we should literally pluck out our eye or cut off our hand. On the night that the Lord was betrayed, Peter sinned by cutting off the right ear of the slave of the high priest with a sword, but the Lord did not cut off Peter&rsquo;s hand (John 18:10-11). To pluck out an eye or cut off a hand is equivalent to putting to death our members according to Colossians 3:5, which says, &ldquo;Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth.&rdquo; This means to put to death the sinning function of the eye and of the hand. Any member of the body that has a sinning function or sinning activity should be put to death. This is also spoken of in Romans 8:13: &ldquo;By the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body.&rdquo; If we continue to sin in our thoughts and deeds instead of putting to death the sinning function of the members of our body by the Spirit, we will suffer dispensational punishment through fire, being salted with fire (Mark 9:49), so that the corruption within us may be eliminated.</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:31 and 32 the Lord spoke concerning divorce. The Old Testament law says that divorce is permitted with a certificate of divorce, but the kingdom of the heavens forbids divorce. Divorce indicates that the matter of lust has not been dealt with. People have anger and lust but do not deal with them. Therefore, the Lord spoke of dealing with anger and lust as requirements of the kingdom of the heavens. If we are able to accept the heavenly rule concerning anger and lust, most of our sins and wrongdoings will be dealt with. There are not many sins that a person would commit if he does not have the elements of anger and lust. Man&rsquo;s sins are the issue of his temper, temperament, flesh, and disposition. These elements involve anger and lust. To deal with anger and lust is to deal with one&rsquo;s temper, temperament, flesh, and disposition. The demand of the kingdom of the heavens is that we deal thoroughly with our temper, temperament, flesh, and disposition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING WORDS</h2>
<p>Verses 33 through 37 are related to our words. The Old Testament law requires man to keep his oaths (v. 33). The kingdom of the heavens, however, requires that we not even swear. A person swears when others do not believe his word. He swears so that others will believe him. The Old Testament law allowed man to swear an oath so that he would not be dishonest or irresponsible with his words. People swore an oath to show that they were responsible. Therefore, the Old Testament law required that people not break their oaths (Num. 30:2).</p>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens requires that we not even swear: &ldquo;Let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no&rdquo; (Matt. 5:37). It is up to others to believe; we do not have to swear in order to persuade them to believe. If we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, we must be simple and honest; there is no need for pretense. If we have learned the lesson of the kingdom of the heavens, we will not need to convince others to believe us with an oath. This type of speaking differs from giving a message in a meeting. When giving a message, a brother tries his best to explain things clearly in order for others to understand. Generally speaking, we do not need to speak much, nor do we need to convince people to believe us.</p>
<p>In verses 34 through 36 the Lord said, &ldquo;I tell you not to swear at all; neither by heaven, because it is the throne of God; nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of His feet; nor unto Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King; neither shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.&rdquo; This word shows our smallness in the universe. Neither heaven, the earth, nor Jerusalem is ours. Even the growth of our hair is not under our control. Nothing is in our hand or under our control. Therefore, we are not qualified to swear by anything.</p>
<p>In verse 37 the Lord said, &ldquo;But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for anything more than these is of the evil one.&rdquo; Therefore, we must be careful, because Satan can be behind our words. Those who are experienced in spiritual warfare know that in order to engage in spiritual warfare, they must speak carefully and not leave any loopholes for Satan&rsquo;s attack. Satan is able to work in the churches and attack the churches because many people are not careful with their words and speak too much. When we speak too much, we provoke Satan&rsquo;s attack.</p>
<p>Concerning our words, the kingdom of the heavens requires us to be simple and honest; we should neither say too much, nor should we swear in order to persuade others to believe us. Rather, we should realize that we have no standing. This demand requires that we deal with our temper and our self, because those who have a temper and the self speak many words. The kingdom of the heavens demands that we deal with our temper and the self in relation to our words.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING VENGEANCE</h2>
<p>Verses 38 through 41 concern vengeance. The Old Testament law permitted vengeance: &ldquo;An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth&rdquo; (v. 38; Exo. 21:24). However, the kingdom of the heavens forbids vengeance. Not only should we not avenge ourselves; we should be prepared to endure others&rsquo; unjust treatment of us. According to the demand of the kingdom of the heavens, when we are slapped on our right cheek, we should turn our other cheek. Furthermore, if someone wishes to take our tunic, we should yield to him our cloak also, and we should go two miles with whoever compels us to go one mile (Matt. 5:39-41).</p>
<p>These demands are also related to the flesh. If someone can be slapped on his right cheek and would turn his other cheek, his flesh has been dealt with. Someone who tolerates his right cheek being slapped may still be in the flesh, but only those who can turn the other cheek have dealt with the flesh. Vengeance is an issue of the flesh. People contend over money, or they contend to be vindicated. The kingdom of the heavens demands that we deal with the flesh; thus, it does not permit vengeance. Moreover, the kingdom of the heavens demands that we endure more and give more.</p>
<p>According to the Old Testament law, if someone asks to borrow money from us, we do not need to consent. Furthermore, if we lend someone money, we can demand that he repay it immediately (cf. Lev. 25:37). However, the demand of the kingdom of the heavens is that we must not turn away someone who wants to borrow from us. Furthermore, when we lend him money, we should expect nothing in return (Matt. 5:42; Luke 6:35). This demand requires us to be free from the usurpation of material possessions. The kingdom of the heavens demands that we deal with the flesh and the usurpation of material possessions. If we would be such people, the Lord will have sufficient ground in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING LOVING OTHERS</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:43 through 48 speaks of loving others. The Old Testament law says, &ldquo;You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy&rdquo; (v. 43). But the kingdom of the heavens demands that we love our enemies (v. 44). This is also related to the flesh. If we love those who love us but hate those who do not love us, we are still living in the flesh. As Christians, we know that hatred is a matter of the flesh, but our love can have even more of the element of the flesh.</p>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens demands that we have the same love toward everyone. This is to demand that we put to death our flesh. The Lord said, &ldquo;If you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what better thing are you doing? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?&rdquo; (vv. 46-47). If we love only those whom we like, we are no different from people in the world. Such love is natural; it is the love of the Gentiles. Such love proves that a person still lives in the natural man.</p>
<p>The Lord wants us to love our enemies so that we can be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect (v. 48). Our Father has the same love for both the good and the evil; there is no distinction (v. 45). Therefore, we must love others in the same way. The words <em>heavenly Father</em> imply life and authority. If we let the heavens rule, live in God, and let His life live in us, we will be the same as our heavenly Father; we will be delivered from our natural love, and we will deal with our temper and flesh in the matter of loving others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>The above points are the demands of the kingdom of the heavens. They are also the living of a person who is under the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens. The demand of the kingdom of the heavens is that we deal with our temper, the flesh, the self, and the usurpation of material possessions. On the one hand, we are living under the ruling of the heavens. On the other hand, we are living by the Father&rsquo;s life and giving Him all the ground in us. This is the demand of the kingdom of the heavens. This demand is higher, fuller, and more perfect than the demand of the Old Testament law. Our Savior wants to save us to such a glorious and complete living.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RIGHTEOUS DEEDS<br />
OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 6:1-18</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the fourth section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching on the mountain, which concerns the righteous deeds of the kingdom people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GENERAL SKETCH</h2>
<p>Matthew 6:1 is the general sketch of this section concerning the righteous deeds of the kingdom people. The Lord said, &ldquo;Take care not to do your righteousness before men in order to be gazed at by them; otherwise, you have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens.&rdquo; The Lord asks us to do our righteous deeds in secret, not before men, because His central intention is that we would be delivered from our temper, flesh, and self.</p>
<p>In chapter 5 the Lord desires that we would allow the kingdom of the heavens to rule. In the matter of hatred, we should not deal with others but with ourselves. In the matter of lust, we should not give any place to our lust. In the matter of speaking, we should be simple and clear, not speaking for ourselves. In the matter of revenge, we should not contend with others but go along with them, and we should not allow things to touch us, giving the Lord all the ground in us. In the matter of loving others, we should not follow our choices and preferences; rather, we should love both those who are lovable and those who are unlovable. We should be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect (vv. 21-48). All these matters require that we forsake our temper and flesh, live in the life of God, and be under the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>In chapter 6 the Lord spoke concerning the righteous deeds of the people of the kingdom of the heavens. His intention in this section is that we would still be delivered from our temper, flesh, and self, because our temper, flesh, and self can still be present in matters related to righteous deeds. When we commit sins and do evil, surely we are full of temper, flesh, and self; but even when we give alms and do good, our temper, flesh, and self can still be a factor. Hence, after the Lord spoke concerning how the authority of the kingdom of the heavens rules over us in matters related to the filth and corruption that men condemn, He continued to speak concerning how the authority of the kingdom of the heavens rules over us in matters related to righteous deeds that men praise.</p>
<p>The ruling of the kingdom of the heavens over righteous deeds requires that we do these things in secret. This requirement seems very easy on the surface, but in reality it is very hard, because a person must be delivered from the self in order to do righteous deeds in secret without making himself known.</p>
<p>Most people in the world do good deeds in order to make a show of themselves. If they cannot make a show, they often are unwilling to do good deeds. This proves that they are full of the self in doing good deeds. If the kingdom people can do righteous deeds without making a show, however, this is a proof that they have been delivered from the self. To do righteous deeds before men is to make a show of oneself. To do righteous deeds in secret is to deny and reject the self, not giving any place to the self.</p>
<p>After giving a general sketch in Matthew 6:1, the Lord lists three things. In principle, these three things include all the righteous deeds of man before God. In the first section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching on the mountain in chapter 5, regarding the condition of the kingdom people&rsquo;s heart, there are three aspects: toward oneself, toward others, and toward God (vv. 1-12). On the one hand, the Lord teaches us what is required toward ourselves; on the other hand, He also teaches us what is required toward others and toward God. In the section on the kingdom people&rsquo;s righteous deeds in chapter 6, the Lord also speaks of these three aspects, because these three aspects include all the righteous deeds of man before God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GIVING ALMS</h2>
<p>The giving of alms represents the righteous deeds of the people of the kingdom of the heavens toward others. Giving alms is to treat others graciously and mercifully with material things; hence, it is a righteous deed. A citizen of the kingdom of the heavens should have such righteous deeds in his living. In 6:1-4 the Lord does not speak of whether we should give alms but rather of how we give alms. The Lord said that we should not do our righteousness &ldquo;before men in order to be gazed at by them&rdquo; and that we should not give alms with the sounding of a trumpet (vv. 1-2). This means that we should give alms in secret instead of doing it in order to be gazed at, like the Gentiles. To be gazed at is to make a show of oneself. The people of the kingdom of the heavens should give alms without letting the left hand know what the right hand is doing (v. 3). This is an extreme description, but it means that we should not let others know by doing this in absolute secrecy.</p>
<p>In the Bible the right hand usually refers to divine matters, which is the top portion (Gen. 48:14; Exo. 15:6; 29:20; Psa. 48:10). The left hand usually refers to human matters. Therefore, according to the spiritual principle, the Lord&rsquo;s word implies that we should not allow our flesh to have any part in what we do according to God. We should not let our flesh have any part in our giving alms according to God&rsquo;s leading, God&rsquo;s power, and God&rsquo;s life. For the flesh to have no part requires secrecy. Whenever we want others to see our righteous deeds, our flesh is involved. A righteous deed may be of the Lord and may be carried out by the Lord&rsquo;s strength, signified by our right hand, but if we also want others to know and make a show of it, our left hand will be involved. It is possible to do something according to God but still allow some ground for the flesh. This is related to the self. By asking us to give alms in secret, the Lord requires that no element of the self be involved.</p>
<p>Sometimes, whether in the church or toward unbelievers, it is not possible to give alms in secret for some reason. This does not mean that we need to refrain from giving because of the Lord&rsquo;s speaking concerning not doing something &ldquo;in order to be gazed at by them&rdquo; (Matt. 6:1). As long as we are not doing something in order to be gazed at by others, it is good enough. We should try to do things in secret, but when circumstances do not allow this, we do not need to keep the letter in a dead way.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYER</h2>
<p>Prayer represents the righteous deeds of the people of the kingdom of the heavens toward God. Concerning prayer, the Lord mentioned five key points.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying in Secret</h2>
<p>Our prayer should be in secret. In Matthew 6:5 the Lord said, &ldquo;When you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, so that they may be seen by men.&rdquo; To want our prayer to be seen and heard by men is of the flesh and the self. Hence, the Lord said, &ldquo;Enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret&rdquo; (v. 6). Some people say that to enter into the private room and shut the door is for us to be absorbed in quiet prayer. However, the Lord&rsquo;s emphasis in verse 6 is that we should not make a show of our prayer. The kingdom of the heavens rules over us not only for us to be absorbed in prayer but for us to pray without making a show, without the flesh and the self. Many people in the church do not know the central point of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching on the mountain. His teaching emphasized the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens over us. This ruling causes us to have no flesh and no self. The Lord&rsquo;s word in verses 5 and 6 shows that even in divine things such as prayer, our flesh and self can be involved. If we can be delivered from our flesh and self in prayer, then it will be easy for us to be delivered from the flesh and self in other things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Praying with Repeated Words</h2>
<p>People pray with repeated words because they have an intention to make a show of themselves. If a person does not want to make a show of himself, his prayer is always simple. A certain saint may pray only for two or three minutes at home, but in the meetings he stands up and prays with many words for more than ten minutes. This is proof that he has the element of making a show. There is an element of making a show in a long and repetitious prayer, because the person who prays wants to make a display before others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Principles of Prayer</h2>
<p>In verses 9 through 13 the Lord said, &ldquo;You then pray in this way: Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.&rdquo; Here the Lord presented a pattern of prayer. Although many people use this as a script for prayer, reciting it whenever they need to pray, this was not the Lord&rsquo;s intention. The Lord&rsquo;s intention was to show the principles of prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Asking on God&rsquo;s Behalf</h2>
<p>The first principle of prayer is to pray on God&rsquo;s behalf. The beginning sentence in this prayer says, &ldquo;Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth&rdquo; (vv. 9-10). This is a prayer offered on God&rsquo;s behalf. We need to see that the first thing in prayer is not to ask on behalf of ourselves or others but to ask on God&rsquo;s behalf. Genuine prayer asks on God&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>God wants us to ask on His behalf because He still has important things that have not been accomplished on the earth. There are three things that still need to be accomplished. First, God&rsquo;s name has not been sanctified on the earth. Today people still reject and mistreat God&rsquo;s name, ranking many other gods&rsquo; names equal to God&rsquo;s name, without sanctifying His name as the uniquely holy name. Second, the kingdom of God has not yet come upon the earth, and the authority of God has not yet been brought to the earth. Today God rules in heaven but not on earth. People do not honor God&rsquo;s authority on earth. His authority will not be brought to the earth until the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ (Rev. 11:15). Third, the will of God has not yet been done on the earth, because the authority of God has not yet been brought to the earth. The will of God can be done in the heavens, but how many people on the earth care about God&rsquo;s will? How many people are obeying God&rsquo;s will?</p>
<p>These three things cannot be fulfilled on the earth because Satan is hindering and undermining them. Therefore, God needs a group of people to pray on His behalf. Such a prayer, actually, is a prayer of warfare, because this group of people rises up to deal with Satan&rsquo;s authority so that God&rsquo;s authority may be brought to the earth, that God may return to the earth to establish and reign in His kingdom, and that God&rsquo;s name may be sanctified on the earth. These can only be accomplished through warfare.</p><h2 class="head3">Praying for the Necessities of Our Living</h2>
<p>The second principle of prayer is to pray for the necessities of our living. Since our prayer is to fight for God, we also need to ask for food for ourselves in order to maintain our living. The enemy tries to undermine by cutting off our food supply so that we cannot live. Hence, the Lord asks us to pray for our daily bread and for the necessities of our living. However, the Lord only teaches us to pray, &ldquo;Give us today our daily bread&rdquo; (Matt. 6:11). The Lord does not teach us to ask for two days&rsquo; portion of food. This matches His subsequent word, &ldquo;sufficient for the day is its own evil&rdquo; (v. 34), and it indicates that asking for daily bread is not only for our living but also for God&rsquo;s warfare.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Confessing Our Sins</h2>
<p>The third principle of prayer is to confess our sins. All proper prayer involves the confession of sins, because all of us have some wrongdoings. Verse 12 says, &ldquo;Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.&rdquo; A person who prays in this way does not have the self. Whoever does not forgive others is full of the self. Only a person who forgives others from his heart is without the self. He can ask God for forgiveness because he can say to God, &ldquo;I have forgiven others.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">Asking God to Keep Us and Deliver Us</h2>
<p>The fourth principle of prayer is to ask for God&rsquo;s keeping and delivering: &ldquo;Do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one&rdquo; (v. 13). To ask for God&rsquo;s keeping and delivering is to ask God to deal with His enemy, Satan, the evil one.</p>
<p>The four principles of prayer mentioned above include four aspects of prayer: first, prayer is toward matters related to God; second, prayer is toward matters related to ourselves; third, prayer is toward matters related to others; fourth, prayer is toward matters related to Satan. Toward God, we pray for the accomplishment of His plan; toward ourselves, we pray for our living so that we can be for God; toward others, we pray to forgive and to be forgiven by God; toward the enemy, we pray for God to deal with Satan. We may say that all prayer includes these four aspects.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Reason for Prayer</h2>
<p>We pray because the kingdom, power, and glory belong to God (v. 13). The kingdom is the realm where He rules, power is equal to His ruling, and glory is His expression. All our prayers should be for God&rsquo;s kingdom to come, for God to rule, and for God&rsquo;s glory to be expressed. If our prayer is not for God&rsquo;s kingdom, power, and glory, it amounts to nothing in God&rsquo;s eyes. Hence, the purpose of prayer is always for God. Genuine prayer involves man praying on God&rsquo;s behalf so that God&rsquo;s kingdom, power, and glory may be manifested.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Condition of Prayer</h2>
<p>At the end of this section, the Lord spoke of the condition of prayer, which is to forgive others. Verses 14 through 15 say, &ldquo;If you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also; but if you do not forgive men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses.&rdquo; If we do not forgive others, neither will God the Father forgive us, and our prayer will not be answered. The Father&rsquo;s forgiveness of us is based on our forgiveness of others. Those who do not forgive others cannot pray. Forgiving others implies that there is no self. If we continue to remember others&rsquo; wrongdoings while praying, we are full of the self. The condition of prayer is to have no self.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FASTING</h2>
<p>Fasting represents the righteous deeds of the people of the kingdom of the heavens toward themselves. Fasting deals with our own legitimate enjoyment. Eating is the most legitimate thing to man, but we need to deal with even these legitimate things. This is to treat ourselves strictly.</p>
<p>Giving alms is to treat others generously and to bring them out of suffering. Fasting is to stop our legitimate enjoyment and to treat ourselves harshly. Hence, fasting is a righteous deed of man before God. However, even in such a righteous deed as fasting, there is the possibility of making a show of ourselves. Therefore, we also need to do this without letting anyone but God know (vv. 16-18) so that we may be delivered from the self and terminate the self.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>With each of these righteous deeds, the Lord spoke of reward and repayment (vv. 1-2, 4-6, 16-18). Those who do righteous deeds in public will receive reward from men. Those who do righteous deeds in secret will receive repayment from God, whereas those who do righteous deeds in public seek praise and glory from men (v. 2). Since they have received praise and glory from men, God will not repay them.</p>
<p>In this section concerning the righteous deeds of the kingdom people, the Lord shows that there is the possibility of making ourselves known in anything. Even in divine things, such as prayer and fasting, there may be the element of the self. Therefore, the people of the kingdom of the heavens need to be delivered and freed from the self even in their righteous deeds and to allow the kingdom of the heavens to rule absolutely. The Lord&rsquo;s teaching requires that we be delivered from the self. We should be diligent in this matter.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">MATERIAL RICHES<br />
AND THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 6:19-34</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the fifth section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching in Matthew 5 through 7, which concerns the material riches of the kingdom people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MATERIAL RICHES<br />
BEING RELATED TO RIGHTEOUS DEEDS</h2>
<p>After the Lord spoke concerning the righteous deeds of the kingdom people (6:1-18), He spoke concerning material riches (vv. 19-34). Righteous deeds are related to material riches because we must first settle the matter of material riches in order to have righteous deeds. No one has righteous deeds in a proper way without thoroughly settling the matter of material riches. According to a common Chinese saying, &ldquo;When one takes righteousness more seriously, he takes material riches more lightly.&rdquo; A person must choose between righteous deeds and material riches. If he thinks more highly of righteous deeds, he will spontaneously lightly esteem material riches. However, if he thinks more highly of material riches, he will lightly esteem righteous deeds.</p>
<p>When speaking about the righteous deeds of the kingdom people, the Lord first spoke of giving alms. This shows that righteous deeds are related to material riches because giving alms is the giving of material riches. If a person has not dealt with material riches, it is unlikely that he will be righteous in the giving of alms (vv. 1-4).</p>
<p>In verses 5 through 15 the Lord spoke concerning how to pray to God. Apparently, praying is not related to material riches; however, our experience shows that prayer and material riches are related. If a person loves material riches, he will depend on them, and his heart will be set on them. Consequently, he will not depend on God or pray to God. Whenever we rely on something other than God, we cannot pray. If we are looking for a job and know a reliable person who has connections, we will stop praying, or at best we will merely go through the motion of prayer. It is when we are hopeless that we are willing to pray desperately. Therefore, it is not easy for us to pray when we are rich, nor is it easy for us to pray when we depend on something or someone other than God. The more we lack and the more difficulties we face, the easier it is for us to pray. Therefore, if we want to pray, we must settle the matter of material riches.</p>
<p>In our human life material riches can replace God. Unbelievers take material riches as their god, and it is easy for Christians also to allow material riches to replace God. If we do not deal with material riches, it will be hard for God to gain ground in us. In order to follow the Lord as His disciples, we need to pay a price. To pay a price means to give up anything that replaces God and to receive God. Material riches are the greatest replacement of God. There is a common Chinese saying: &ldquo;Loving money as one&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; This shows how much material riches can replace God. It is difficult for someone who has not dealt with material riches in a proper way to have genuine prayers. Genuine prayers are for God&rsquo;s interest. The highest expression of our living for God is that we pray for His interest, not for ourselves. However, a person who loves and relies on material riches cannot pray for God&rsquo;s interest. In order to be righteous in the matter of prayer, we must address and deal with material riches.</p>
<p>The Lord also spoke concerning the righteous deed of fasting (vv. 16-18). To fast is to deal with a legitimate enjoyment. The principle of fasting refers not only to buffeting our body by not eating but also to our not being loose by limiting our spending on our needs and enjoyments in our living. For example, a brother might be able to spend one hundred dollars for a garment, but for the sake of the Lord and for the sake of his service, he limits his spending to only fifty dollars. This principle can also be applied to eating, housing, and transportation. The principle of fasting is also related to material riches. Therefore, the righteous deeds that the Lord spoke of are all related to material riches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT STORING UP FOR OURSELVES<br />
TREASURES ON THE EARTH</h2>
<p>In His first words concerning the material riches of the kingdom people, the Lord said, &ldquo;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth&rdquo; (v. 19). The basic principle of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching on the mountain is that we would be delivered from the self and not live for the self. Material riches are the best test for the self and the best expression of the self. Anyone who loves and treasures material riches and who cannot overcome material riches is filled with the self. This is why the Lord began by saying, &ldquo;Do not store up for yourselves treasures.&rdquo; The thoroughness of our dealing with the self depends on how thoroughly we deal with material riches. If we do not store up treasures for ourselves, the Lord will gain more ground in our being, and the self will spontaneously decrease.</p>
<p>The Lord said that we should not store up for ourselves treasures on the earth. This shows that the self is related to the earth. The things that we plan for the self are things on the earth, not things in heaven. The more we plan for the self, the more we are earthly, not heavenly.</p>
<p>The Lord said that we should not store up for ourselves treasures on the earth, &ldquo;where moth and rust consume and where thieves dig through and steal&rdquo; (v. 19). The treasures that we store up on the earth will be consumed by moth and rust or will be stolen by thieves. To be consumed by moth means that our treasures are consumed by circumstances. To be consumed by rust means that our treasures are consumed of themselves. To be stolen by thieves means that our treasures are consumed by other people. Our treasures on the earth are unreliable. They are ours today, but they may no longer be ours tomorrow. Someone may store up treasures on the earth, but his treasures will be either consumed by rust, consumed by the environment, or stolen by others. Eventually, what we gain on the earth is mere vanity. Hence, the Lord said, &ldquo;Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven&rdquo; (v. 20).</p>
<p>Why did the Lord ask us to store up treasures in heaven? Is there a need for money in heaven? Of course, there is no need for money in heaven. There also was not a need for money in the garden of Eden. God did not create money. Money did not come from God; it came from the devil and belongs to the fallen and corrupted earth. Therefore, in Luke 16:9 the Lord referred to money as &ldquo;the mammon of unrighteousness.&rdquo; <em>Mammon of unrighteousness</em> does not mean that money comes from an unrighteous source. Rather, it means that money itself is unrighteous. If money is unrighteous, why did the Lord ask us to store up treasures in heaven? Furthermore, how can we store up treasures in heaven? The treasures that we store up on the earth are for ourselves, but the treasures that we store up in heaven are for God. The self is related to the earth, but God is related to heaven. The money that we store up on the earth is for ourselves, but the treasures that we store up in heaven are for God. In order for our material riches to be used by God, these material riches must be stored up in heaven now.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH MATERIAL RICHES</h2>
<p>In Matthew 6:21 the Lord explained why we need to store up treasures in heaven: &ldquo;Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s teaching concerning material riches is not merely a matter of our material riches being consumed by moth and rust or being stolen by thieves; it is a matter of our heart. Material riches attract our heart. Wherever our treasures are, there will our heart be also. If we store up our treasures on the earth, it will be extremely hard for our heart to mind the things in heaven. As a result, instead of submitting to the authority of the heavens, we will live outside the kingdom of the heavens. The Lord wants us to live in the kingdom of the heavens and to submit to the authority of the heavens; therefore, our heart must be on the things in heaven. Our treasures must be in heaven.</p>
<p>In verses 22 through 23 the Lord said, &ldquo;The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light; but if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!&rdquo; Just as our eye is the lamp of our body and can make our body full of light or full of darkness, so also our heart is a lamp that determines whether there is light or darkness within us. If our heart is set on earthly treasures, then our heart is covered, and we are full of darkness. Hence, material riches cause our heart to be full of darkness.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&rdquo; The children of Israel could not see, because there was a problem with their heart. However, whenever their heart turned to the Lord, the veil on their heart was taken away. Hence, in Matthew 5 the Lord said, &ldquo;The pure in heart...shall see God&rdquo; (v. 8). To be pure in heart means to be single and focused in one&rsquo;s heart. In 6:22 the Lord said, &ldquo;If therefore your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light.&rdquo; Our eyes cannot look at two things at the same time. If we try to look at two things at the same time, our vision will be blurred. If we love the Lord and also love mammon, our eye will not be single, and we will be full of darkness.</p>
<p>Verse 24 says, &ldquo;No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.&rdquo; This verse speaks of service. Whatever our eyes focus on and our heart desires becomes what we serve. Some people want to love the Lord and the world at the same time. On the one hand, they serve God, but on the other hand, they also serve material riches. The Lord said that we cannot serve God and mammon. If we love God, we have to leave material riches behind. If we continue to carry material riches with us, God will leave us. For this reason, the Lord spoke emphatically in this section concerning material riches. If we want to follow the Lord in a proper way and learn to live in the kingdom of the heavens, we must thoroughly deal with our attitude toward material riches. Those who do not thoroughly deal with material riches cannot live properly in the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING ANXIOUS ABOUT CLOTHING AND FOOD</h2>
<p>Many people store up treasures for themselves and serve mammon because they want to take care of their living; they worry that there might not be something to eat, to drink, or to put on. The Lord touched these practical matters to teach us not to be anxious about these things. He said, &ldquo;Do not be anxious for your life, what you should eat or what you should drink; nor for your body, what you should put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than clothing?&rdquo; (v. 25). The Lord wants us to consider: If God can give us life, can He not give us food? If God can give us a body, can He not give us clothes? Since God has given us life and a body, He will surely give us the food that our life needs and the clothes that our body needs. In verse 27 the Lord asked, &ldquo;Who among you by being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?&rdquo; Even though these things are small in God&rsquo;s eyes, they are not in our hands. Therefore, it is useless for us to be anxious about them.</p>
<p>In verse 26 the Lord asked us to look at the birds of heaven: &ldquo;They do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father nourishes them.&rdquo; In verses 28 and 29 He asked us to consider the lilies of the field: &ldquo;They do not toil, neither do they spin thread. But...not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.&rdquo; We are of much more value than the birds of heaven and the lilies of the field. So why should we fear that God would not nourish us?</p>
<p>In verses 31 through 33 the Lord said, &ldquo;Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed? For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.&rdquo; The Lord said that we should not be anxious about our food or our clothing. God gave us our life and our body. The length of our life and the stature of our body are ordained by God. Hence, He will surely prepare food to nourish us and clothes to cover us. The Gentiles are anxiously seeking these things, because they are like orphans who do not have a heavenly Father, but we have God as our Father. He knows our every need. Therefore, we do not need to be anxious about these things. We need only to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to us.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEKING FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD<br />
AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2>
<p>The Lord said that we should not be like the Gentiles who seek what to eat, what to drink, and what to put on, but we should seek first God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness. Because God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness seem to be hidden, we need to seek and pursue them. God&rsquo;s kingdom is different from His righteousness. God&rsquo;s kingdom refers to His authority, but God&rsquo;s righteousness refers to His ways. To seek God&rsquo;s kingdom is to seek to obey His authority, but to seek God&rsquo;s righteousness is to seek to follow His ways. Both God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness are a matter of subjecting ourselves to God&rsquo;s ruling. The Lord&rsquo;s entire teaching on the mountain concerns allowing the kingdom of the heavens to rule. This is a matter of God&rsquo;s ruling. If we subject ourselves to God&rsquo;s authority, His kingdom will be with us, and if we follow God&rsquo;s ways, His righteousness will be with us.</p>
<p>For example, a young brother who is considering marrying a young woman in the world may have an inward sense of disapproval from the Lord. The brother understands that God disapproves of such a marriage, but because he likes her, he does not want to give her up. As a result, he marries her according to his own will, and he disobeys God&rsquo;s will. Hence, the brother overturned God&rsquo;s authority, and the kingdom of God is not with him. However, if this brother loves the Lord and is willing to obey the inward sense of disapproval from God by discontinuing his courtship, he will acknowledge God&rsquo;s authority and subject himself to God&rsquo;s ruling. As a result, the kingdom of God will be with him.</p>
<p>The emphasis with God&rsquo;s righteousness is on being in accordance with God&rsquo;s ways. For example, yet another brother&rsquo;s marriage may be of God and under God&rsquo;s ruling, and God&rsquo;s kingdom may be with the brother. However, the way in which the wedding is carried out may be full of the fashion and flavor of the world, not according to God&rsquo;s ways. As a result, God will not approve of the brother. Thus, in this matter the brother does not have God&rsquo;s righteousness.</p>
<p>When a worker of the Lord speaks for the Lord, he first needs to submit to the authority of God and confirm whether God is allowing him to speak. If God is not allowing him to speak, he should obey God and not speak. In this way the brother will not rebel against the Lord but rather allow the heavens to rule. The saints will see that the kingdom of God is with him. But even if he speaks for the Lord, he still needs to ask whether he is speaking according to God&rsquo;s ways. Are his attitude, expressions, utterances, and mannerisms compatible with the saints? Or are they exaggerated and inaccurate? If his attitude, expressions, utterances, and mannerisms are not compatible with the saints, but instead are exaggerated and inaccurate, he does not have God&rsquo;s righteousness even though he has God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>Our entire living can be measured by God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness. On the one hand, we need to submit to God&rsquo;s authority; on the other hand, we need to be according to God&rsquo;s ways. God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness are indispensable to us. The Lord charged us to seek God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness so that we would allow God to rule in our living and conduct. Then people will see God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness in our practical living.</p>
<p>Many people overturn God&rsquo;s authority and His ways in order to take care of their daily needs of eating, drinking, and clothing. Many believers do not submit to God&rsquo;s authority and ignore God&rsquo;s ways because of their living. In the Lord&rsquo;s eyes these believers are foolish and pitiful; they have forgotten that their heavenly Father is able and willing to supply all their needs. Therefore, the Lord charged us to put God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness first. If we care first for God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness, God will take responsibility for our eating, drinking, and clothing. Some believers do not care about God&rsquo;s kingdom or His righteousness, because they are anxious about eating, drinking, and clothing. Therefore, they see matters related to eating, drinking, and clothing instead of seeing God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness. Some believers seem to not care about their eating, drinking, and clothing, but God adds the things that they need for their living. As a result, these believers fulfill God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness, and they are not lacking in their daily needs of eating, drinking, and clothing.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word is clear and definite. The children of God do not need to store up treasures on the earth, nor should they serve mammon. If we seek God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness, He will take care of our every need. This is the blessing that God gives to the people of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRINCIPLES OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE<br />
IN DEALING WITH OTHERS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 7:1-12</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the sixth section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching in Matthew 5 through 7, which concerns the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others. In the previous chapters we looked at the key points in the first five sections of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching. The Lord&rsquo;s word is concise, but every point touches our specific condition. Hence, the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens is not a theory or doctrine. The Lord examines our inward and outward condition, and He requires us to bring every detail of our living under His ruling by forsaking and denying the self and by living according to the life of God. God wants to rule in our heart in matters related to our attitude toward God, our attitude toward others, and our attitude toward ourselves. In order to do this, our flesh must be terminated. This is the way to practically live in the kingdom of the heavens as kingdom people.</p>
<p>The way that we deal with others and contact them is also important. We need to know the principles of the kingdom of the heavens that are involved in dealing with others. Hence, after speaking concerning material riches, the Lord unveiled the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT JUDGING OTHERS</h2>
<p>Concerning the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others, the Lord first spoke of how the kingdom people should view others. In Matthew 7:1 the Lord said, &ldquo;Do not judge.&rdquo; Our judgment of others is the expression of our view of others. Our view is inward, but our judgment is outward. If we have a certain view inwardly, we will spontaneously judge outwardly. The Lord does not want us to judge others; He does not want us to have opinions concerning others.</p>
<p>Most people share a common problem; they automatically form an opinion of others. This leads them to evaluate and criticize others. This common weakness is not allowed by the ruling of the heavens. Isaiah 42:19 says, &ldquo;Who is blind except My servant, / And as deaf as My messenger, whom I will send? / Who is as blind as the one at peace with Me, / And as blind as the servant of Jehovah?&rdquo; This describes the Lord when He was on the earth. Like a blind and deaf man, He was not sensitive to the things around Him. Those who are under the ruling of the heavens do not like to touch the affairs of others. The kingdom people are deaf and blind to persons, matters, and things that they encounter. It is hard for them to form an opinion of others.</p>
<p>In order for us not to judge others, we must not have an opinion of them. If we do not form opinions about the people we contact, we have learned a lesson before God. Those who are fleshly and live according to their temper form opinions of the people they contact, and this inevitably leads to judging. However, if we live in the Lord&rsquo;s presence and are restricted by the Spirit, we will not want to observe or to know the affairs of others. We will not form an opinion or have a feeling about those whom we contact; we will have a feeling only concerning someone who is under our care. Without opinions, it is hard for us to judge others.</p>
<p>Not judging others is not merely a matter of wanting to be delivered from the self. Those who are under the ruling of the heavens cannot judge others, because they want to avoid God&rsquo;s judgment. In Matthew 7:2 the Lord said, &ldquo;With what judgment you judge, you shall be judged.&rdquo; This reveals that in the future God will judge us according to how we judge others today. If we judge others harshly, God will judge us harshly.</p>
<p>Whenever we judge others, we need to be reminded that the judgment with which we judge others today will be the judgment with which the Lord will judge us in the future. If we want to avoid judgment in the future, we must not judge others today. If we do not want to fall under God&rsquo;s judgment in the future, we must not pass judgment on others today.</p>
<p>In verse 3 the Lord said, &ldquo;Why do you look at the splinter which is in your brother&rsquo;s eye, but the beam in your eye you do not consider?&rdquo; In other words, when we see others&rsquo; wrongdoings, we should realize that there are greater wrongdoings in us. Only when we remove our wrongdoings can we see others&rsquo; wrongdoings clearly. Hence, before we judge and condemn others, we must first judge and condemn ourselves. When we judge ourselves, our view will be clear.</p>
<p>Verses 1 through 5 reveal that we should not criticize or judge others carelessly. If we judge others carelessly, we will fall into two dangerous situations. The first danger is that we will bring judgment upon ourselves. The second danger is that our judgment may be incorrect and inaccurate. In order to avoid these two dangerous situations, we must be under the heavenly ruling in order to be delivered from the self.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT GIVING OTHERS THE TRUTH<br />
OR OUR EXPERIENCES CARELESSLY</h2>
<p>In verse 6 the Lord brings up another matter: &ldquo;Do not give that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the hogs, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn and tear you.&rdquo; In order to understand this verse, we need to consider the background in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>According to Leviticus 11, the animals of the earth are either clean or unclean. Animals that have a divided hoof and chew the cud are clean and may be eaten by God&rsquo;s people. Animals that do not have a divided hoof or that do not chew the cud are unclean and may not be eaten by God&rsquo;s people (vv. 1-8). For example, dogs do not have a divided hoof, nor do they chew the cud. Hogs have a divided hoof but do not chew the cud. Hence, both dogs and hogs are unclean and may not be partaken of by God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>Spiritually speaking, God&rsquo;s intention in Leviticus 11 is to show principles for His people in their dealing with others. Chewing the cud signifies receiving God&rsquo;s word and pondering over it. A divided hoof signifies being separated in our living and walk by receiving the word of God. Those who receive and ponder over the word of God are separated in their living and walk before God. God&rsquo;s people are allowed to contact and deal only with such ones.</p>
<p>The Gentiles do not receive the word of God, and nominal Christians can be no different from the Gentiles in their living and walk, even though they seem to receive the word of God. In the eyes of God, such ones are unclean like the dogs and hogs in Matthew 7:6. God&rsquo;s people should not have dealings with them.</p>
<p><em>That which is holy</em> in verse 6 refers to the truth of God, the word of the Lord. In particular, it refers to the Lord&rsquo;s teaching on the mountain, which belongs to God. <em>Your pearls</em> refers to our experiences of life. If we receive the Lord&rsquo;s word, obey the truth of God, and live according to the life of God, we will have pearl-like experiences. We should not speak carelessly about the Lord&rsquo;s word and His truth to those who do not receive the Lord&rsquo;s word and who have no separation in their conduct. Nor should we speak with such ones concerning our experiences of life. People who do not receive the Lord&rsquo;s word and have no separation in their being neither know that which is holy nor treasure pearls. Hence, they are likely to trample God&rsquo;s truths and our experiences and will cause us to suffer loss.</p>
<p>For example, a brother may testify to an evil man, saying, &ldquo;Whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also, and to him who wishes to take your tunic, yield to him your cloak also.&rdquo; The evil man, however, may not treasure or appreciate such a testimony. Instead, he may take advantage of the brother by slapping his face and taking his clothes. This is to turn and tear the brother.</p>
<p>We often encounter such situations in our practical living. Therefore, we need to be careful when speaking to others. When we preach the gospel, we should not carelessly speak the words in the Bible, lest they are presented to people who are like dogs or hogs, and we suffer loss. Whether we should speak to others about God&rsquo;s truths and the extent to which we should speak depend on the kind of person we are speaking to.</p>
<p>Matthew 7:1-6 reveals that we need to exercise caution and should not be careless in dealing with others. We should not judge others carelessly. We also should not speak of the truth and our experiences of life in a careless way. Just as we need to be careful in our views of others, we also need to be careful when speaking the truth to others. If we are not careful, we will bring judgment upon ourselves and suffer loss.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DOING TO PEOPLE WHAT WE WISH GOD TO DO TO US</h2>
<p>In verses 7 through 12 the Lord turned to the matter of prayer. It seems as if He was speaking about how God deals with us, but He was speaking about how we deal with others. If we read these verses carefully, we will realize that they are related to how we deal with others, because at the end of this section the Lord said, &ldquo;Therefore all that you wish men would do to you, so also you do to them; for this is the law and the prophets&rdquo; (v. 12). According to the context, this is a concluding word. In this section the Lord seemed to be saying that we should do to people what we wish God to do to us. We often pray and hope that God would be good to us. Therefore, the Lord was saying that we should treat others in this way as well.</p>
<p>According to the principles in our dealings with others, we should do to others what we wish God to do to us. If we want God to be generous to us, we need to be generous to others. If we want God to be gracious to us, we need to be gracious to others. If we want God to give good things to us, we need to give good things to others. God never gives us inferior things. Even when we ask for the wrong things, God still gives us good things. We should also deal with others in this way. This is the principle of the kingdom people in their dealing with others.</p>
<p>How does God deal with us? In verse 7 the Lord said, &ldquo;Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.&rdquo; Asking, seeking, and knocking all refer to prayer, but each step is deeper and more advanced than the previous step. For some matters we need only to ask, and God will give them to us. For other matters it is not sufficient to ask; we also need to seek. For yet other matters we cannot stop with seeking; we also need to knock. There is a distinction between these three steps of prayer. With asking, the emphasis is on asking God for blessings; with seeking, the emphasis is on gaining God; but with knocking, the emphasis is on gaining God&rsquo;s presence. However, whether we are asking for blessings, seeking God, or gaining His presence, God will always give us something good.</p>
<p>Even when we ask for the wrong thing, God gives the right thing to us, because He knows the difference between a loaf and a stone. He knows what is profitable and what is harmful. For example, a sister, who wants to study abroad after graduating from college, may ask God about going abroad every day in her prayer. In the eyes of God this matter may be a stone, not a loaf, in relation to this sister. He may consider it to be a serpent instead of a fish (vv. 9-10). Hence, God does not give her what she asks; rather, He gives her a different future. Although the sister may not initially understand God&rsquo;s arrangement, she will eventually realize that God has given her the best.</p>
<p>We need such wisdom when dealing with others. For example, a young brother may want to borrow three thousand dollars from us, but we know that if we lend him this money, we will be doing him harm. Hence, we need to exercise wisdom and help him. The brother is asking for a stone, thinking that it is a loaf. If we give him the stone, we will harm him.</p>
<p>There are two implications in the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 7:1 through 12. The first implication is that we should do to others what we wish God to do to us. The second implication is that God will do to us what we do to others. These are the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRINCIPLES OF<br />
THE KINGDOM PEOPLE&rsquo;S LIVING AND WORK</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 7:13-27</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the last section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching in Matthew 5 through 7. In the first six sections the Lord spoke concerning the living of the kingdom people. The last section is a conclusion that speaks of the principles of the kingdom people&rsquo;s living and work. This section shows how a person under the ruling of the heavens should live and work on the earth, and it reveals the basis on which his living and work will be judged. These principles are the foundation of the living and work of the people of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF GATES AND WAYS</h2>
<p>The Lord first spoke of the gate and the way. In Matthew 7:13 and 14 He said, &ldquo;Enter in through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it. Because narrow is the gate and constricted is the way that leads to life, and few are those who find it.&rdquo; There are two kinds of gates and two ways before the people of the kingdom of the heavens. There are the wide gate and the broad way that lead to destruction, and there are the narrow gate and the constricted way that lead to life. The people of the kingdom of the heavens must not take the wide gate or the broad way; they should take the narrow gate and the constricted way. The first principle for the living and work of the people of the kingdom of the heavens is to enter the narrow gate and to take the constricted way.</p>
<p>There are no restrictions with the wide gate and the broad way, but the narrow gate and the constricted way are restricted. When people enter or leave a house, they prefer to take a wide gate and a broad way because it is more convenient to pass through a wide gate than it is to pass through a narrow gate. Sometimes, a person who is carrying many things finds it difficult to pass through a narrow gate. He needs to put some things down in order to pass through a narrow gate. Similarly, it is more convenient to walk on a wide way than on a narrow way.</p>
<p>As believers, there are two ways in which we can live. The first way is easy to walk on because it is wide. Christians who take this way have few problems, no matter how they live or work. Everything seems easy for them. The second way is inconvenient to walk on because it is narrow. Christians who take this way are inwardly restricted regarding their words and actions.</p>
<p>There are many examples of Christians who live on the broad way and Christians who live on the narrow way. For example, every living person has to make friends. Concerning making friends, unsaved people have a wide gate and a broad way; they can make friends with any kind of person. However, many Christians have not dealt with the matter of making friends. They may not be as undisciplined as they were prior to their salvation, but they are still loose in the matter of making friends. Such Christians are taking the wide gate and the broad way. There are some Christians, however, who are restricted in the matter of making friends. They are governed by the kingdom of the heavens and dare not be so free. They do not make friends loosely, nor do they have friendships with all kinds of people (cf. 1 Cor. 15:33). This indicates that they take the narrow gate and the constricted way.</p>
<p>In the matter of clothing it is also obvious that some Christians are not restricted; they wear whatever they want to wear and adorn themselves according to their desires. Some Christians, however, are restricted inwardly and cannot be loose about the material, color, or style of their clothing (cf. 1 Tim. 2:9).</p>
<p>The kingdom people should take the narrow gate and the constricted way as a principle in their living and work. It is convenient to take the wide gate and the broad way, but the Lord said, &ldquo;Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction.&rdquo; The wide gate and broad way lead to destruction. The word <em>destruction</em> does not refer to eternal perdition but to suffering destruction in one&rsquo;s deeds and work (1 Cor. 3:15). It is a great loss for everything that one has done to be destroyed. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s word is quite serious. We must be delivered from the wide gate and the broad way in our living, walk, and work and in the administration of the church; otherwise, our living, walk, work, and administration of the church will end in destruction.</p>
<p>The narrow gate and the constricted way lead to life; they result in life. Hence, a living and work that are according to the narrow gate and the constricted way will last forever and be approved by the Lord. Because the gate is narrow and the way is constricted, few believers find them. We must ask for the Lord&rsquo;s mercy so that we may walk this way.</p>
<p>In Matthew 13:31 through 33 the Lord spoke in parables concerning the great tree and the leaven: &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field, and which is smaller than all the seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches...The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.&rdquo; A mustard seed is small and should grow into a small mustard plant. However, in this parable the mustard seed becomes a great tree. The three measures of meal should be pure, but the whole lump is leavened by a little leaven (cf. 1 Cor. 5:6). Something was added, and the lump was rejected by God. The leaven was added through the wide gate and the broad way. Someone who takes the wide gate and the broad way must compromise. As a result, many improper things can be added. Therefore, the growth of the great tree and the adding of leaven are related to taking the wide gate and the broad way. In order to avoid the great tree and the leaven, we must enter through the narrow gate and take the constricted way.</p>
<p>Why did the Lord talk about the gate and then the way? The gate and the way relate to the same thing, but the gate emphasizes the beginning, and the way emphasizes the continuation. We have to enter through the gate and then walk on the way; we cannot walk on the way and then enter through the gate. This is significant. If we first tried to walk on the way and then enter through the gate, there would be many ways that lead to the same gate. In the world people think that the means do not matter as long as they achieve their goal. There is even a Chinese saying that speaks of using different routes to arrive at the same destination. However, in spiritual matters this is never the case. In spiritual matters we must first enter through the gate and then walk on the way. In spiritual matters we cannot take different routes to end up at the same destination. In other words, different beginnings do not lead to the same result, and wrong beginnings do not bring in the right result. In order for the result to be right, the beginning must be right. Hence, the beginning of spiritual matters is crucial and must be right and proper.</p>
<p>The beginning is the gate. God wants us to pass through a gate in every spiritual matter. The principle of the gate is that it is narrow and tight. Even in such a matter as making friends, the kingdom people must pass through a gate and have a severe dealing in the beginning. Previously, there was no gate and no way; hence, we made friends indiscriminately. But now that we are under the authority of the heavens, we must pass through the gate in the matter of making friends. There is a strict limitation, a strict principle, in relation to the kind of people we can befriend. To say that we should befriend good people but not bad people can still be a wide gate and a broad way. The narrow gate and the constricted way are not only a matter of not befriending bad people; they may include not having friendships with good people. We do not keep friendship with the world (James 4:4), nor do we commune with unbelievers (2 Cor. 6:14). We pursue only with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart (2 Tim. 2:22).</p>
<p>Concerning clothing and adornment, we must pass through a gate in order for us to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and be restricted. Formerly, we wore the current fashions. But now that we live under the authority of the kingdom of the heavens, we are restricted from things that are not befitting for a saint. This is to pass through a gate. Working for God is another example. Formerly, because we did not understand the meaning of being ruled by God, there was no work that we could not do. However, now that we are living under the heavenly rule, we must pass through a gate in our spiritual work and undergo rigorous examination. This is a strict principle in the Lord&rsquo;s work. We can do things only that are in accordance with this principle; we cannot do things that contradict this principle.</p>
<p>In order to be restricted by the heavens, our living and our walk must enter through the narrow gate. This is pleasing to the Lord. Only those who have entered through the narrow gate have entered into the realm of the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens. If we are to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord wants us to first enter through the narrow gate and reject everything that is incompatible with the heavenly nature. However, it is not sufficient for us to pass through the narrow gate; we must still take the constricted way. The way is the continuation of the gate; it is an extension of the gate. The way for us to maintain the narrowness and strictness of our entrance through the gate is to take the constricted way. The narrowness and the strictness that we experience when we enter through the gate are the same narrowness and strictness that we should maintain as we walk on the way. We did not experience looseness when passing through the gate, and we should not experience looseness when walking on the way. Passing through the gate helps us to walk the way, but passing through the gateway cannot replace our walking on the way. After entering the gate, we must continue walking on the way. If we are willing to be restricted and ruled by the heavens so that every aspect of our living and walk is narrow, we will be full of life and gain something of eternal worth.</p>
<p>Although the Lord did not speak of salvation or of perdition in this section on the gate, this section includes the matter of reward and punishment. The word <em>destruction</em> in Matthew 7:13 refers not only to our living and work being devoid of the eternal worth of life but also to our suffering destruction. This means that before the judgment seat of Christ we will suffer loss by being punished. However, if our living and work are based on the narrow principle, we will have the eternal fruit of life and also the reward of life before the judgment seat of Christ. The principle of the gate and the way is the basis for the living and work of the people of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF TREES AND FRUITS</h2>
<p>The second principle for the living and work of the kingdom people is related to a tree and its fruit. In verses 15 through 17 and verse 20 the Lord said, &ldquo;Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you will recognize them. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles? Even so every good tree produces good fruit, but the corrupt tree produces bad fruit...So then, by their fruits you will recognize them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These verses say that the kingdom people must discern the type of leading they receive from others. Prophets are ministers of the word, who speak for God and who are servants of God. The kingdom people need the leading of the servants of God. However, the kingdom people should not accept the leading of a person simply because he calls himself a servant of God or a prophet, just as they cannot enter any gate or take any way. Just as there are different gates and different ways that need to be discerned, there are different leadings that also need to be discerned. We will suffer destruction if we choose the wrong gate and the wrong way. Likewise, we will suffer loss if we choose the wrong leading or follow false prophets. If this were not a serious and crucial matter, the Lord would not have concluded His teaching with it.</p>
<p>The kingdom people must discern those who lead them. This discernment is not based on words but on the fruit of their living and work. By their fruits we can know whether they are good trees or bad trees. No matter how good or spiritual someone&rsquo;s message may sound, we should not be quick to accept his person. Although we may accept his message, we should not accept his person too quickly.</p>
<p>We must be cautious about accepting others&rsquo; leading, lest we be deceived by false prophets. False prophets may seem more genuine than real prophets. Outwardly, they wear sheep&rsquo;s clothing and speak the word of God, but inwardly, they are ravenous wolves from whom we may suffer great loss if we are not careful. For this reason, we need to discern cautiously. We should not only listen to people&rsquo;s words but also look at their living and deeds, that is, the fruits of their walk. Such discernment cannot be done too quickly; it requires a period of time. Time is the best test; any imposter will be manifested in time.</p>
<p>Because it was not easy to exercise discernment, believers who were traveling to a different local church in the times of the apostles took a letter of commendation, which was a letter of introduction. Even a minister of the word took a letter of introduction from his locality. This letter was not to introduce him to join the breaking of bread but to confirm his standing in preaching the word of God. Hence, it is risky for a believer or a local church to accept the leading of a prophet without first seeing his fruit, his letter of commendation. Regrettably, not many Christians discern the leading that they accept. Many Christians do not know how to discern; instead, they believe every word and readily follow others&rsquo; leading. As a result, false prophets are rampant in their damage to God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>An individual Christian who does not discern the leading he accepts has no spiritual pursuit and is not living under the heavenly rule. The same applies to a Christian group that does not discern the leading it accepts. If a Christian is seeking God and is ruled by heaven, he will be very particular about accepting others&rsquo; leading. He will discern and examine before he accepts. Similarly, a Christian group that seeks God and is ruled by heaven will also discern and examine the leading of others.</p>
<p>Such discernment and examination require that one deals with the self. Many accept a wrong leading because they have the element of the self, not because they do not understand. It is easy for a Christian who has not dealt with the self to accept a wrong leading. The same applies to a Christian group. Conversely, if a Christian is willing to be governed and restricted by the heavens, he will not easily accept a wrong leading. When the element of the self is present, the preferences and tastes of the self are also present. False prophets deceive people by echoing these preferences and tastes so that people feel good about accepting his words and his leading. Hence, it is easy for a person who is according to the self to accept a wrong leading.</p>
<p>Discernment demands that we have no tastes or preferences of our own. We should not consider whether a preacher fits our tastes but whether his leading brings us to God. We should not carelessly ask others to give messages, nor should we carelessly accept their leading. We must first know whether the walk of a prophet bears grapes and figs or thorns and thistles. Just as the people of the kingdom of the heavens must discern the wide gate and broad way from the narrow gate and constricted way, they should also discern the two kinds of leadings. The principle of the gate and the way is narrow and small, and the basis of leading is examination. We should take the narrow gate and the constricted way and accept only that which has been examined. We must pay attention to these two points.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF WORK</h2>
<p>Matthew 7:21-23 says, &ldquo;Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens. Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power? And then I will declare to them: I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness.&rdquo; The kingdom people must take care of their living and also their work. In verses 13 through 20 the Lord spoke concerning the principles of their living, but in verses 21 through 23 He spoke concerning the principle of their work.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of work that we can do for the Lord: One work is according to man&rsquo;s will, and the other work is according to God&rsquo;s will. Both kinds of work are for the Lord, but the source is different. One work is done according to the will of man; the other work is done according to the will of God. Furthermore, both works have different results. The Lord said, &ldquo;Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens&rdquo; (v. 21). Whoever works according to the will of man will not enter into the kingdom of the heavens. Only those who work according to the will of God will enter into the kingdom of the heavens. Hence, there is a great distinction between these two kinds of work.</p>
<p>The believers who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today will enter into the coming manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. The believers who work according to the will of man will not enter into the coming kingdom of the heavens, because they do not live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens or allow the kingdom of the heavens to exercise authority over them today. Believers who work according to the will of man work according to their own will and preferences. These believers are full of their own will and preferences and are not ruled by the heavens. The ruling of the heavens does not give ground to the will of man or to human preferences. Therefore, when a person is ruled by the heavens, his will and preferences are cast out. Those who are ruled by the heavens do not have their own will or preferences in the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;How is it possible for the element of the human will to be mixed into the Lord&rsquo;s spiritual work? Would such a work be spiritual?&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s word, however, clearly reveals that human will and preferences can be mixed into the Lord&rsquo;s spiritual work. The Lord said, &ldquo;Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power?&rdquo; (v. 22). These people prophesied, cast out demons, and did many works of power. They truly did these works; otherwise, they would not dare to say this before the Lord, because they know that He is omniscient. It is possible to deceive man, but it is not possible to deceive the Lord. Moreover, when the Lord rebuked them, He did not deny what they did. The Lord acknowledged that they did indeed do those things. Therefore, they were doing the Lord&rsquo;s work, a spiritual work.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Lord rebuked them, saying, &ldquo;Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness&rdquo; (v. 23). <em>Lawlessness</em> here does not refer only to evil things; it also refers to good things. For example, a school dormitory may have the rule that students must switch off the lights at ten thirty at night. If a student studies past ten thirty, he is lawless. Studying is a good thing, not an evil thing, but studying after the lights are supposed to be turned out is lawlessness. Similarly, prophesying, casting out demons, and doing works of power are all good; however, if they are done according to the human will, not the will of God, they involve lawlessness.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters may ask, &ldquo;How is it possible for a person to cast out demons and do works of power if he is lawless?&rdquo; This is not difficult to understand. Everything in the universe has a law. If the law is fulfilled, there will be a result. For example, even though a school says that the lights should be switched off at ten thirty, the electrical current does not cease to exist after ten thirty. As long as there is a law of electricity, the lights will work if they are switched on after ten thirty, just as they will work when they are switched on before ten thirty. This also applies to studying. A student can understand and remember what he studied after ten thirty, just as he can understand and remember what he studied before ten thirty.</p>
<p>Another example is the law of having children. Children can be born to illicit unions, just as they can be born to lawful marriages. Having children depends on the fulfillment of a law, not on whether it is lawful or lawless. Another example is sowing seeds. When seeds are sown into the ground, they grow. Seeds that are stolen will grow, and seeds that are purchased will also grow. Many matters concern the fulfilling of a law, not to lawfulness or lawlessness.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to God&rsquo;s work. If the gospel is preached according to God&rsquo;s will, people will be saved. Conversely, if the gospel is preached according to man&rsquo;s will, people will still be saved. Preaching the gospel depends on the fulfillment of a law. The Scriptures are God&rsquo;s word and can give man life. This will not change. Whether someone preaches the gospel according to God&rsquo;s will or man&rsquo;s will, people will receive life from God&rsquo;s word if they receive the gospel. Hence, it is not sufficient to look merely at the fruit in measuring a believer&rsquo;s work. The Lord warned us in this section that His judgment would be based on whose will worked according to the Father&rsquo;s will; His judgment will not be according to the fruit of our work.</p>
<p>Almost everything in the Old Testament is a type. For example, Abraham&rsquo;s begetting of Isaac typifies man accepting God&rsquo;s promise by faith, and Abraham&rsquo;s begetting of Ishmael typifies man fulfilling God&rsquo;s promise by his own strength (Rom. 9:7-8; Gal. 4:22-23). Lot&rsquo;s begetting of Moab and Ben-ammi (Gen. 19:30-38) typifies the lawless preaching of the gospel. The sons of Lot were not begotten according to the accepted code of human conduct or law. The way that many preach the gospel is not according to spiritual regulation. People can be saved even if the gospel is preached lawlessly, but those who are saved in this way are like the Moabites and Ammonites.</p>
<p>In Philippians 1:15 and 17 Paul says that &ldquo;some preach Christ even because of envy and strife...The others announce Christ out of selfish ambition, not purely.&rdquo; Such preaching of the gospel surely saved some; perhaps a very large number were saved. But the ones who were saved in this way were like the Moabites and Ammonites. Moab and Ben-ammi were born, and God recognized them as human beings. Likewise, people believe in the gospel, and God recognizes that they are saved. However, those who preach the gospel in such a way will not be approved; instead, the Lord will call them men of lawlessness. This is a serious matter.</p>
<p>According to the context of Matthew 7:21-23, being called lawless by the Lord is the issue of not doing the will of the Father. Any work that is not the will of the Father who is in the heavens is a work of lawlessness. The Lord&rsquo;s work is being done everywhere on the earth, but is this work lawful in the eyes of God? This is a great question. Many works and activities among Christians are not according to the Father&rsquo;s will. I am afraid that one day the Lord will say to such workers, &ldquo;Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness.&rdquo; Is our work lawful or lawless? On the surface our work may not be a problem, but we should not stop there. We must have the assurance that our service is according to God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>In order for our work to be according to the Father&rsquo;s will, we must deny the self. If we are not subject to the authority of the heavens or restricted by the heavens, having our own will and preference, our work will lack the element of the Father&rsquo;s will. As a result, our work will produce Moabites and Ammonites. When the Lord rebuked the men of lawlessness, He said, &ldquo;I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness&rdquo; (v. 23). Some say that these men of lawlessness are false Christians, because the Lord said that He never knew them. The words <em>never knew</em> mean &ldquo;never acknowledged, never approved.&rdquo; Hence, the Lord was saying that He never acknowledged or approved these lawless men. It is right to prophesy, cast out demons, and do works of power, but the Lord did not approve of their doing these things. The Lord told them to depart from Him. Since the Lord is in the kingdom, this means that they will not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>According to verse 21, those who do the will of the Father will be able to enter into the kingdom of the heavens. To do the Father&rsquo;s will is to work according to God&rsquo;s will. Believers who prophesy, cast out demons, and do works of power according to God&rsquo;s will are under the governing of the heavens. Verse 21 refers to the one &ldquo;who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens.&rdquo; This proves that these believers work by the Father&rsquo;s life under the ruling of the heavens according to God&rsquo;s intention. They are under the authority of the heavens and live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. Therefore, they will be able to enter into the kingdom of the heavens at the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>Matthew 7:21 through 23 reveals that the work of the kingdom people should be based on God&rsquo;s will, not on prophesying, casting out devils, or doing works of power. Such a work demands that we set aside our will, our feelings, and our preferences in order to learn to live by God&rsquo;s life in us, that is, to live under the authority of the heavens and to be restricted and ruled by the heavens. This is the way for us to know God&rsquo;s will and to know what we should and should not do.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is a good example of doing the will of the Father. When the Lord was on the earth, He sometimes healed the sick and cast out demons, but at other times He did not (Luke 4:23-27). Sometimes He performed miracles, such as feeding the five thousand with five loaves and two fish, but at other times He did not (Matt. 14:19-21; 12:1). Even when He did not perform a miracle, He was under the restriction of the heavens. He had the authority and the ability to do many works of power, but He did not abuse His authority or ability. He carried out God&rsquo;s will both in His performing of miracles and in His not performing of miracles. Therefore, He could say, &ldquo;I have come...to do Your will, O God&rdquo; (Heb. 10:7). People say that the Lord prophesied, cast out demons, and did works of power, but the Lord would say that He was merely carrying out the Father&rsquo;s will. Prophesying, casting out demons, and doing works of power require only that we have a gift, but carrying out the Father&rsquo;s will requires that we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, being governed and restricted by the heavens. Only when we live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and are governed and restricted by the heavens can we know and do the Father&rsquo;s will.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF FOUNDATIONS</h2>
<p>Matthew 7:24-27 says, &ldquo;Everyone therefore who hears these words of Mine and does them shall be likened to a prudent man who built his house upon the rock. And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they beat against that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not do them shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand. And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they dashed against that house; and it fell, and its fall was great.&rdquo; In His conclusion the Lord spoke of two kinds of foundation. One foundation is upon a rock, which can stand the test. The other is built on sand, which cannot stand the test. The rock refers to the Lord&rsquo;s word. In particular it refers to His teaching on the mountain. If we accept His teaching and live by it, we are building a house upon the rock. The Lord&rsquo;s word is the foundation.</p>
<p>The foundation of sand refers to not living by the Lord&rsquo;s words. It also refers to human methods, opinions, and ways, which are outside the Lord&rsquo;s teaching. If a person hears the Lord&rsquo;s teaching but does not live by it, his living and walk will be based on his own method and opinions. These methods and opinions are all sand. If he remains in his methods and opinions, he will build a house upon the sand.</p>
<p>The word <em>house</em> may refer to human life, that is, our living and work. If we hear the Lord&rsquo;s teaching and live by it, we are building our life on the Lord&rsquo;s word as the eternal rock, and our life has an eternal foundation. If we hear the Lord&rsquo;s teaching but ignore it, we are building our life on the will of man. Such a life will not stand the test of time but will fall, and we will suffer loss.</p>
<p>No matter what our foundation is, our life will be tested. There are three kinds of tests. One test is the descending of rain from above. This refers to the trials that God gives us. Another test is the coming of rivers from the earth. Water refers to the corrupted people of the world, whom Satan uses to attack and destroy us. The third test is the blowing of winds in the air. This refers to the attack of Satan and his angels. If our life is based on the methods and opinions of the world, it will fall as soon as we encounter any of these three tests. However, if our life is based on the Lord&rsquo;s word, it will be unshakable and immovable no matter how it is tested.</p>
<p>There are four principles for the living and work of the kingdom people. The first principle is to enter the narrow gate and take the constricted way. The second principle is to discern the fruits of a person&rsquo;s living before accepting his leading. The third principle is to work according to the will of the heavenly Father. The fourth principle is to have our living and work according to the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>These four principles will test our living and our work. If we have these four principles, we will let the heavens govern us, and we will be under the ruling of the heavens. Furthermore, if we have these four principles, we will deny ourselves, reject our flesh, and not live according to our own will. However, if we do not have these four principles, we will not be under the authority of the heavens, we will not let the heavens rule, and we will be full of the self and the flesh. As a result, we will live according to the self.</p></body></html>
