   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Four Major Facts Concerning</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the World before God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are four major facts concerning the world as shown in the Bible: 1 The world is condemned in the eyes of God, 2 the world lies in the evil one, 3 the world has crucified the Lord Jesus, and 4 the world is at enmity with God; it is God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These are the four major facts concerning the world before God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as a person is in the world, he is already condemned and will perish regardless of his conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please remember that the salvation of men is not a matter of personal conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are wrong because their position is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We know that it is not easy to be delivered from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How can I forsake the world if it is still attractive to me?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, when I realize that the world is in a wrong position with respect to God, I will have to forsake it no matter how lovely it may be to me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, salvation is not just a matter of our personal conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The corporate body to which we belong is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to be saved from our relationship with and our position in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the Jews tried to do away with the Lord Jesus, they cried, "His blood be upon us and upon our children!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Matt 27:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although we are not the ones who killed the Lord Jesus, our forefathers did.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even though we did not commit the act, the corporate body to which we belong did.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The corporate body to which we belong is an enemy of God and is condemned to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whether we are right or wrong individually is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I hope you can see not only that we are sinners individually and need to be saved individually, but that we also belong to a corporate body which is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The world to which we belong is God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The world we are in is condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to be delivered from that relationship and that position.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Salvation Being to Come Out of the World</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Salvation is a deliverance from a certain corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a deliverance from a certain position and certain relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, it means to come out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Most people pay much attention to their personal salvation, but the question before us is what are they saved from.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The salvation highlighted in the Bible involves being saved from the world, not from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The world as a whole is condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no doubt that he who believes has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have been preaching this for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once a person believes in the Lord Jesus, he has eternal life and is saved forever.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But please remember that if a person believes but is not baptized, he is still not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Indeed, you may have believed and you may have eternal life, but are you saved in the eyes of the world?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you are not baptized, you are not saved, because no one knows that you are different.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You must rise up and be baptized, declaring that you have terminated your relationship with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only then will you be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Believing Being on the Positive Side,</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>and Baptism Being on the Negative Side</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What then is baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Baptism is a deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Believing is on the positive side and baptism is on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Baptism delivers you out of that corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many people in the world may say that you are one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the moment you are baptized, they will realize you are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The one whom they have known for years is now saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Your friendship with them is terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You are in the tomb; you have reached the end of your road.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You already know that you have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now that you are baptized, you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>From now on, everyone knows that you are the Lord's and that you belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"He who believes and is baptized shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is true because once a person believes and is baptized, everyone will know where he stands.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Without believing, there is no inward reality, and what one does will be nothing but an outward display.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>With believing, there is inward reality, and if one takes a further step to be baptized, he will be separated from the world, having terminated his relationship with it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Baptism is a separation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It separates us from others.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>"He who believes and is baptized shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord Jesus' word is quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It goes on by saying, "He who does not believe shall be condemned."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Unbelief alone is sufficient for condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As long as a person belongs to that corporate body, his unbelief is sufficient for condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But if one has believed, he still needs to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If he is not baptized, he still has not made an exit outwardly.</S>
