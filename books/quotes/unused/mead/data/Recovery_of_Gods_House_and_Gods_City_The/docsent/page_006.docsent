   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE KINGSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is something more in Ezra 3:2.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The names of two people are mentioned: Joshua and Zerubbabel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From the books of Haggai and Zechariah, we know that Joshua was the high priest at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to Haggai, Zerubbabel was the governor of Judah, and if we trace his genealogy, we see that he was the descendant of David.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So he was in the line of the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, there are these two people: Joshua, representing the priesthood, and Zerubbabel, representing the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the books of Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, and Zechariah, these two things are always represented.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is because these books are connected with the recovery of the building of the house and the city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The building up of the house of God always requires the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For the building of the tabernacle, Moses represented the kingship and the authority, and Aaron represented the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For the building up of the temple, Solomon represented the kingship, and the high priest represented the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And for the recovery of the building, the priesthood and the kingship are still necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the original building, there was first the kingship and then the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But with the recovery, there is first the priesthood and then the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The kingship is the divine authority, and the priesthood is simply to contact God, to be saturated with God, and to be occupied and possessed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For the recovery of the building of the local churches, it is not only a matter of giving up the denominations in order to come back to the local ground, but also a matter of the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Praise the Lord that many have come back!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But in the past years, I have noticed that in many places, although the people came back, they were still short of the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They did not have Joshua and they did not have Zerubbabel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They left the denominations and came back with the intention to recover the church life, but they failed because they did not have the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They thought that when they came back they could use a certain way to practice the church life, but it did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church life is not a matter of a certain way; it is a matter of the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Are we in the priesthood, and are we under the kingship?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need the priesthood in order to have a real contact with God, that our whole being may be saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not a matter of having a certain way to conduct our meetings this will never work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is a matter of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Are we in the priesthood?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do we know something of the priesthood by experience?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Are we helping others to experience the priesthood?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not a matter of this or that; it is a matter of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all must contact the Lord, be filled and saturated with the Lord, and be occupied with Him day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must have the priesthood in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the dear ones in the Lord's recovery must be helped to realize the proper priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all must contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To shout for joy in the meetings is good, but what about your contact with the Lord in your private life?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How much do you contact the Lord, and how much are you being saturated with the Lord in your daily life?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Lord's recovery we must have the priesthood; we must have Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We also need the kingship, the divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>People always ask if we have someone ruling the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I always reply that it is rather hard to say.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you say that we do, I say that we do not.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you say that we do not, I say that we do.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Who rules the meetings of the church in Los Angeles?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you say that no one rules, I will not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if you say that someone does rule, I also will not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is all a matter of learning how to submit to divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is a kind of divine kingship among us, and we are all under that kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We do not need an election for a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to be under divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In some places the saints have told me that it is really difficult to decide who will be the leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes I have spoken to the people in this way: whoever wants to be a leader is not qualified to be a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If someone is ambitious to be a leader among the saints in the Lord's recovery, that is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A leader is simply a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you are a leader, everybody knows that you are a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You are what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we know divine authority and realize the kingship among us, we all will know our place.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We will know who we are, what we are, and where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We will know because we are under the kingship and authority which is the headship of the Lord Jesus.</S>
