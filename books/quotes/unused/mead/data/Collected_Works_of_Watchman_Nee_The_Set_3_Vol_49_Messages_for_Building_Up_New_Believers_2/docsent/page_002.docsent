   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN WITNESSING Scripture Reading: Acts 9:19-21; 22:15; 1 John 4:14; John 1:40-45; 4:29; Mark 5:19 I. THE MEANING OF WITNESSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How long will the light of a candle last?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Of course, the light will go out when the candle burns out.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But if we light another candle with this one, the light will double in intensity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Will the light of the first candle diminish because it has lit the second?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No. If we use the second to light a third, will the light of the second diminish? No. The light of each candle will last until the candle burns out.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when the first light goes out, the second will still be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the second light goes out, the third will still go on shining.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we keep on lighting more candles ten, a hundred, or a thousand candles the light will never go out.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This explains the testimony of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Son of God was on earth, He lit the first candle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After that, more candles were lit one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For the past nineteen centuries, the church has been like candles; when one candle burns out, it is continued by another one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This goes on and on even today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church has never ceased shining on this earth, just as salvation has never stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some have lit ten candles; some have lit a hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Candle after candle has been lit, and the light continues on.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brothers and sisters, do you want your light to continue, or do you want to see it end when your candle is extinguished?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have been lit by someone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He does not expect the light to end with you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every Christian must try his best to bring salvation to others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He must do his best to testify to others and lead others to the Lord so that the testimony may continue on this earth from generation to generation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is unfortunate that with some people their light ends and their testimony ceases.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is most pitiful!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church has been propagating itself for generations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some people find their testimony continuing, while others have unfortunately gone without posterity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The light of a candle can only shine while it is still burning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Likewise, a man's testimony continues only while he is still alive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order for the light of a candle to go on, other candles must be lit before the first one burns out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way the second, the third, the hundredth, the thousandth, and even the ten thousandth candle will carry on the light.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This light will continue forever and spread to all parts of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such spreading will not diminish the light of each candle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We suffer no loss when we witness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But by witnessing, the testimony goes on.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What is witnessing?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Acts 22:15 the Lord sent Ananias to speak to Paul: "For you will be a witness to Him unto all men of the things which you have seen and heard."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From this we see that the basis of witnessing is what we have seen and heard.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You cannot be a witness to what you have not seen with your own eyes or heard with your own ears.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul saw something with his own eyes and heard something with his own ears.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God charged him to be a witness of what he had seen with his own eyes and heard with his own ears.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First John 4:14 tells us what witnessing is: "We have beheld and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A person is a witness to what he has seen.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thank God, you have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You have met Him, believed in Him, received Him, and gained Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You have been delivered from sins, received forgiveness, and obtained peace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now that you have believed in the Lord, what joy you possess.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This joy is something which you did not have before.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Formerly, how heavy was the load of sin upon you!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But now, thank God, this load of sin is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You have seen and heard something.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What should you do today?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You should testify of your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This does not mean that you have to leave your job to be a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It means that you should witness to your friends, relatives, and acquaintances of what you have seen and heard, and bring them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The gospel will stop with you if your testimony does not continue.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is true that you are saved; you have the life of the Lord and you are lit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But if you do not light others, you will be finished when your candle burns out.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You should not meet the Lord empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You should bring many with you when you meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>New believers must learn from the very beginning to witness to people and bring them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Never be lazy in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If a believer does not open his mouth from the very beginning, after a few days he will form a habit of keeping his mouth closed, and then it will take much effort to turn the matter around.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For the first time you have tasted so great a love, received so great a Savior, obtained so great a salvation, and experienced so great an emancipation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yet you do not testify for the Lord or light others with your light!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You really owe the Lord something!</S>
