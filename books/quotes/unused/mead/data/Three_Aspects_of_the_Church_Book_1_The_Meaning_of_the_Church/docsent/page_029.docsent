   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Zipporah Typifying the Church in the Wilderness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Moses is another type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hebrews 3 explicitly says that Moses typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Moses was the apostle sent by God to deliver the children of Israel from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He typifies Christ as the Apostle sent by God to save the children of God from their degradation, that is, from Satan s usurpation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moses typifies Christ in four aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, Moses was persecuted soon after he was born because the Egyptians were seeking to kill every son born of the Hebrew women; consequently, many sons were killed Exo 1:16, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This type was realized when Christ was born.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>King Herod sought to kill Him, and as a result, many sons were killed Matt 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second, Moses was born of his parents in the flesh, but he was raised by another woman Pharaoh s daughter Exo 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the same way, the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit but was raised by a woman Mary Matt 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Third, in order to flee Pharaoh s persecution, Moses fled to the wilderness of Midian Exo 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus also fled to Egypt to escape Herod s persecution Matt 2:13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Fourth, Moses was sent by God to save God s people from the ill treatment of Pharaoh in Egypt Exo 3:7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This typifies Christ being sent by God to the earth to save God s people from the bondage of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, Hebrews 3 points out that Moses is a type of Christ as the Apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since Moses is a type of Christ, his wife Zipporah typifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Zipporah is the wife whom Moses married when he was persecuted and wandering in the wilderness Exo 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, Zipporah typifies the aspect of the church in the wilderness, being gained by Christ when He was forsaken and wandering in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After Moses, Joshua typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, because the Bible does not speak of Joshua s wife, it is difficult to speak of her as a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ruth Typifying</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>the Church Being Redeemed Boaz Being the Lawful Heir</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>of God s Inheritance</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Old Testament Boaz is yet another type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Boaz married a special woman who occupies a particular place in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Her name was Ruth She typifies the aspect of the church being redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The entire book of Ruth can be considered a story of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rebekah portrays the church as the called one, Zipporah portrays the church in the wilderness, and Ruth portrays the church in redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Old Testament pays much attention to the matter of the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Boaz was a lawful heir of the inheritance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After God called Abraham, He gave Abraham every blessing: heavenly and earthly, material and spiritual, and even God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Abraham received all the blessings that God prepared for man in His eternal plan, the blessings in both His creation and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the blessings of God s creation and even God Himself were given to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There was a problem, however, of who would inherit the blessing that Abraham had received from God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eliezer of Damascus was not qualified to inherit the blessing; neither was Ishmael, who was born of Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only Isaac, who was born according to the promise, could inherit the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Of the two sons born of Isaac, Esau and Jacob, God chose Jacob to be the heir.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In principle, only the one with the birthright could be the heir to inherit the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Jacob was a crafty person, and he stole the birthright from his brother through trickery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even if Jacob had not used any tricks, God s blessing and the birthright would still have come to him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jacob had twelve sons, and since they were all born of Jacob, they all had a part in the blessing of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, among these twelve, only the first one should have received the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to the Old Testament, the blessing of the birthright consists of three items: a double portion of the land, the kingship of God, and the priesthood of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These three items are the blessings of the birthright inherited by Jacob s sons.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Reuben, as the firstborn of Jacob, should have inherited all three blessings of the birthright; however, he lost the birthright because he defiled his father s bed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, the blessings of the birthright went to three of his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The double portion of land went to Joseph Gen 48:22 , the kingship went to Judah 49:8 , and the priesthood went to Levi Exo 28:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the time of Boaz, the inheritance of land was not an important issue, and the priesthood had become desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only the kingship needed to be confirmed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, at that time the kingship was the most important of the blessings related to the birthright, and Boaz was the lawful heir of this blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Scriptures say that Boaz begot Obed, and Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David the king Matt 1:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The kingship of Judah came from Boaz because he was an ancestor of King David.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, the kingship among the Jews was produced through Boaz.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Moreover, the Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious eternal King, was also a descendant of Boaz according to genealogy.</S>
