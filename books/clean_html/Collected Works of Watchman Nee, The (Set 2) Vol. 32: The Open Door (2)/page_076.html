<h2 class="head2">Tsinan, Shantung Province</h2><p>Brother Chao Bi-chen returned to Tsinan from Tsingtao. Beginning on January 9 there will be a week of prayer, followed by a week of perfecting meetings, and then a week of home meetings. The time for all the meetings will be from six to eight o'clock. May the Lord bless all the meetings. Brother Witness Lee will pass by on the railway line before the Chinese New Year and will probably be able to come to Tsinan. May the Lord bless his footsteps. There are about twenty brothers and sisters at the table meeting in remembrance of the Lord. The atmosphere before the Lord is somewhat depressed at the present moment. There is a lack of brothers and sisters who can go out to visit others. May the Lord raise up some among us. Please pray for us.</p><p>Brothers representing the meeting in Tsinan,<br />Chen Shi-chen, Ren Yi-cheng, Yu Jia-chi</p><h2 class="head2">Chefoo, Shantung Province</h2><p>Greetings to those who are members together in the Lord:</p><p>A brother in the Lord learned from Issue No. 11 of The Open Door in the "A Word on Behalf of the Editor" column that the saints in Chekiang and Kiangsu had needs because of the war, and that there was also a need of supplies for saints in Szechuan, Hunan, and Hankow.

May the Lord hide us in Himself until that day, amen. May He receive the rightful place in the church, and may He be exalted in the church. May the Lord's redeemed say, "Give thanks to Jehovah, for He is good, for His lovingkindness is forever." Enclosed please find X dollars of the Lord's money.

Half of the amount has gone to the needy saints, and the other half to co-workers in various places&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Chou County, Shantung Province</h2><p>Brother Chen Bo-heng passed away as a result of the war's turmoil. This brother had a pure heart for the Lord. But the Lord allowed him to go first. Not only are the believers grieved about him, but even the unbelievers felt sorrowful about his death. Brother Sun Shi-bih returned to Chou County and has temporary lodging. I returned to Dong-Tan-Dien Village. There is still a Lord's table meeting every Lord's Day at Si-Kwan in Chou County. The correspondence address is [omitted]. Presently, Brother Sun and I are engaged only in some personal evangelistic work. We are also studying the Bible, praying, and taking turns meeting in the saints' homes. Please pray for the brothers in Chou County so that we can walk with God in all things and so that glory can go to the Triune God.</p><p>Brother Liu Tien-min, November 3</p>
