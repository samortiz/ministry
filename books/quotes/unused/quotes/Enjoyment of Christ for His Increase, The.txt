At the beginning of the Scriptures, two matters are mentioned in relation to man-the image of God and the life of God
God created man according to His own image, which is Christ, with the intention of putting Christ into him as life
John's first Epistle tells us that he who has the Son, Christ, has the life, and he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life
We can forget about being humble being patient being good and doing good and simply contact Christ as life day by day and moment by moment
In verse 35 the Lord said that He is the bread of life, and in verse 57 He said that he who eats Him shall live because of Him
The last half of the last week lasts for three and a half years, which is equal to forty-two months or one thousand two hundred sixty days
She stood up and gave a very living testimony, telling the saints how much the Lord meant to her after she contacted Him
The way is not to learn many doctrines, to listen to many teachings, or even to read much from the Scriptures merely by our mentality
The more we stay in contact with the Lord, the more the Lord will occupy our whole being and the more the Lord will be our life supply
If we contact Christ all the time, we will be wonderful, glorious persons in Christ, having Christ living within us
When we help children put on a glove, we have to help them to put their fingers into the glove gradually one by one
Christ is now within us, but He may be within us in an unformed way, like a hand inserted into a glove improperly
There may be no way for Christ to occupy our whole being, to expand Himself into all the inward parts of our being
If we stay in contact with Christ, day by day and moment by moment Christ will expand into all our inward parts and occupy us completely
They need to give up the way of knowledge and simply take the way of life, to stay in contact with Christ all the time
God put man before the tree of life with the intention that man would partake of this very tree and receive the life of God
Before man partook of God's life, he was tempted by the enemy, Satan, to pay attention to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead
The Bible reveals clearly and simply that God in the Son and as the Spirit desires to impart Himself into us as life
Between the two ends of the Bible, there is one book among the sixty-six which specifically deals with the matter of life
Since Christ is the Word of God and Christ is God, this indicates that Christ is the expression and explanation of God
One day the crowds had the intention to make Him a king because they thought that He was so marvelous and wonderful
God's eternal intention is not to be worshipped in a religious way nor to be served by us, but to be eaten as food
Many of us may think that since our Lord is so glorious, great, and wonderful, we should enthrone Him in the heavens
There are many people who think that the Lord is in the heavens stretching out His arms to help them in this way
He is both the Son of David and the Lord yet as the Son of David and the Lord Himself He comes as bread to the children to be eaten by them
Before, we may have had the thought that the best way to contact the Lord was to worship Him, serve Him, and do something good to please Him
Now we see that we need to take Him as food, enjoy Him as our life within, and apply Him moment by moment in everything in our daily living
By shedding His blood, He redeemed us from our sins, cleansed us from all defilement, and made us clean and pure
Not only so, He told the disciples that He would not leave them as orphans but that He would come back to them
After His death in the flesh, He would be resurrected from the dead and come back to them not in the flesh but as the Spirit
In resurrection the disciples would realize that He is in the Father, the disciples are in Him, and He is in them
Still others consider how to worship the Lord and how to do their best to serve the Lord for their entire life
When we go to the Lord we need to praise Him and thank Him that He is in us as our life our food our drink our strength and our everything
If we simply abide in Christ, all the human virtues, such as humility, patience, love, and goodness, will be manifested effortlessly
Fruit as the overflow of Christ flows out of us spontaneously without our consciousness or intention through our constant abiding in Christ
In order to put this matter into practice, we need to know the secret of maintaining our abiding in Him and His abiding in us
If we maintain our standing and position in Christ, we will enjoy the constant flowing of the life of Christ within us
Whenever we discover a problem between us and Christ, we should go to Him right away and open to Him, telling Him, 'Lord, there is a problem
Similarly, whenever we intend to do something, we have to speak to the Lord first concerning what we intend to do
We may graduate from a school after four years of study, but we cannot graduate from eating, drinking, and breathing
We may have the idea that the Lord wants to give us a big 'battery' so that one empowering from Him will last us for at least three years
Whenever we realize that there is insulation between us and the Lord, we have to go to Him and ask Him what it is
The secret to being a living Christian is not merely to listen to messages, learn doctrines, or gain knowledge in letters
We can make sure that a current of life is flowing within us all the time by keeping a sweet fellowship between us and Him
Whatever we do, whatever we speak, and wherever we go, we will maintain His smiling presence by the flow of life within us
When we rise up every morning, there is no need to go to Him to pray for so many things, asking Him for help to do this and that
We must give up all of the other ways and take the way of life realizing that the Triune God is everything to us in Christ and as the Spirit
In the last two messages we saw that God's eternal purpose is to impart Himself into us as life in Christ through the Holy Spirit
The Scriptures tell us that we Christians are predestinated by God to be conformed to the image of His Son, Christ
Although we possess a natural life by our first birth, we receive another life, the divine life, by receiving Christ as Lord and Savior
It is used once in 2 Corinthians 3:18 where Paul tells us that we are being transformed into the image of Christ
The second time it appears is in Romans 12:2, where Paul charges the believers to be transformed by the renewing of their mind
Although we are indeed regenerated persons, we need to realize that we are now in the process of being transformed
Born with a Cantonese mind and exhibiting a Cantonese temper and habit, he is totally Cantonese, yet he is now a regenerated Christian
He, too, must be transformed, not from the Cantonese form into the American form but from the Cantonese form into the form of Christ
Different in form, we all need to be transformed from the natural and original form into one form-Christ Himself
They were very good and nice but very lacking in the form of Christ, that is, in the reality of Christ within, which is expressed outwardly
Our mind must be renewed in many respects, and the first thing that needs to be renewed is the thought that we can do something for God
You must give up this thought of doing things and realize the fact that you need to take in something of God to be filled with Him
As a rule, most of us have the thought that since the Lord is so good to us, we can express our gratefulness by doing something for Him
May we abandon the thought of doing something for the Lord and realize the fact that we need to receive something of Him
If we receive the Lord into us and enjoy Him, something will spontaneously issue forth from our enjoyment of Him
When our mind is renewed in this way, we will be clear that we need to enjoy the Lord and be filled and satisfied with Him day by day
Not only will there be a change in the way we think but many things will be different our way of choosing and deciding will also be renewed
When we are genuinely filled with the Holy Spirit, our entire being is saturated with Christ, and our mind is totally occupied by Christ
We need to learn the lessons of denying our natural mind, yielding our mind to Christ, and handing over our mind to Him
If we let the Lord fill our mind, we will be renewed in the spirit of our mind , and we will have the mind of Christ
Eventually this Spirit will extend His renewing work to reach our entire being-to renew our mind, our emotions, and our will
In whatever we think, choose, or decide to do, there will always be the sense, the registration, that Christ is expressed from within us
We will not only have the life of Christ and the mind of Christ, but even more we will have the form of Christ
When we deny our natural mind, the way we think, the way we decide, and the way we love, we will experience such a renewing
Following the renewing of our mind, our emotions and will also are renewed; that is, our entire being is renewed
If we learn the lesson to be transformed day by day, it will be easy for us to overcome sins and the worldly things
If we daily learn this lesson of denying ourselves practically and strictly, we will be occupied, filled, and saturated with the Lord
The people around us will be surprised to see that although we are typical Americans, we do not live by the American culture
John the Baptist told people not only that Christ is the Bridegroom who has the bride but that Christ must increase
The Lord Himself is the one grain of wheat who fell into the ground and died and grew up in resurrection to bear much fruit
Since a bride is a wife, this indicates that the Son of God should have a wife, not in a natural sense but in a very holy and divine sense
There is a principle in the Scriptures that in order to properly understand a matter, we must look at the first mention of it
According to the record in Genesis 2, God caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep, opened up his side, and took out a rib
When God caused Christ to die on the cross, one of the soldiers pierced His side, and blood and water flowed out
The way for the many grains to become one Body, one bread, is found in John 17, where the Lord prayed that all the believers would be one
We may have thought that as far as being a Christian is concerned, it is all right to do everything by ourselves
We can sing hymns, we can pray, we can read the Scriptures, and we can preach the gospel independently of others
One day the Lord will open our eyes and cause us to realize that we are nothing but members; we are not complete units
If you ask my hand to whom it is joined, it will say it is joined to my arm, and if you ask my arm, it will say it is joined to the shoulder
Some believers make the practice of baptism by immersion the center of their oneness, and based on this they set up a Baptist Church
They also form their own church and hold as their center and focus the best methods by which to live a holy life
Christians are divided over the practice of baptism, the systems of church government, and the methods of holiness
May we all abandon our insistence on matters such as baptism, the presbytery, and methods of holiness and not make them our centers
Regardless of our views on the above practices, we need to realize that we are the saved ones, the regenerated ones
Because the Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Father, and we believers are in Christ, we can be one even as They are one
Now that the Son in turn has given this life to us, we also have the life of the Son, which is the very life of the Father
Just as the Son and the Father are one in the divine life, we are one in the Son because we possess the same life
Whether or not we believe in baptism by immersion or the presbytery, every one of us has the same life of Christ
The Lord says that He, the Son of God, is in the believers, and the Father is in Him that the believers may be perfected into one
Christ's increase comes into being because Christ died, rose, and imparted His life into us to make us His counterpart
If we are living for ourselves or for something else, it is difficult to realize the reality of the Body of Christ
Everything we do and accomplish needs to be unto Christ, because we have consecrated ourselves with all of our living to Him
Since we have been enlightened by the Lord concerning the oneness of the believers, we need to do our best to practice the oneness
If there is no possibility of this happening, it is out of our control, and we are not responsible for the result
The answer is that if we go along with the Lord, the Lord's Word will be opened to us; then we will have the light
If we are in the proper church life, we will realize the oneness, the building of God, and we will have the divine light
They have forsaken the building of God's house, the church, and have established something by themselves and of themselves
If we are seeking the Lord's mind and heart, we need to do our best by His grace to practice the oneness if at all possible
When we as children of God practice the oneness of the Body and come together to serve the Lord, there will be an impact
The first record of the church's preaching of the gospel was with the one hundred and twenty on the day of Pentecost
Although there are already a great number of divisions and sects in existence today, they are the doings of others
Our standing and ground is one of openness to all the Lord's children regardless of their particular backgrounds
Other believers may want to remain in their respective groups or organizations, but they bear the responsibility for this before the Lord
They claim that He was not born of the virgin Mary, that He did not die on the cross for our sins, and that He did not resurrect bodily
Receiving all real believers regardless of their doctrinal views and practices is presented in Romans 14 and 15
