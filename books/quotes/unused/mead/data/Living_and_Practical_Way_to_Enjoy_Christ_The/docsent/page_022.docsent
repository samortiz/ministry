   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN BABYLON Scripture Reading: Gen 11:4, 7, 9; 2 Chron 36:6-7; Ezra 1:11; Rev 17:3-5; 18:2a, 4 THE PRINCIPLE OF BABYLON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter and the next, we want to see two cities in the Bible: Babylon and Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that God's intention is to have a universal, corporate vessel to contain Himself, and this vessel will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, the last city named in the Bible is Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of all God's operation throughout all the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But before Jerusalem there is a counterfeit called Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Bible, Babel, or Babylon, is first mentioned in Genesis 11, but the name of Jerusalem is not mentioned until much later.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Babel is the Hebrew word for Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Babel is Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Babylon came first because the enemy of God, Satan, knows that God's purpose is to have a living city composed of living persons to be a corporate vessel to contain Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the enemy of God tried his best to make a counterfeit, and this counterfeit was the city of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man Wanting to Make a Name for Himself</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Genesis 11 with Babel you can see four main points.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, man at that time was trying to do something against God by attempting to make a name for himself v. 4 . That was why man was trying to build up a city with a tower reaching to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Babylon is good for man to make a name, not for man to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Babylon's purpose is to make a name for man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Confusion</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second, Babylon means confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of course, you may say that God came in to confuse the people there, to confound them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But you have to realize that this confounding from God was a punishment to man due to his trying to make a name for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He confounded them by causing them to have different languages.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I speak my language and you speak yours.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have my opinion, you have your thought, and we all are different; I do not understand you, nor do you understand me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a punishment from God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christianity is under God's punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The denominations do not speak the same thing, nor do they understand one another.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Presbyterians do not understand the Baptists, nor do the Baptists understand the Presbyterians.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Methodists understand the Methodists, but they do not understand the Episcopalians, etc. Each denomination is different from the others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This situation of division and confusion is a punishment from God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Scriptures reveal that the local churches are not confounded or confused like Babel but are united as one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With Babel the second point is confounding, confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those at Babel did not understand one another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He exercised His judgment upon the rebellious human race.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Scattering</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The third point with those at Babel is that all of them were scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead of being gathered, they were scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the local churches we have a gathering, not a scattering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible reveals that God's people always gathered together in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the ancient time all the Israelites came together three times a year Deut 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They had the "togetherness," the gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They came together at Jerusalem, but at Babel there was a scattering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In today's Christianity the first point is that man is going to make a name.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The second point is the misunderstanding between all the Christian groups and denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The third point is the scattering.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Each one goes his own way and direction.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Man's attempt to make a name for himself, confusion, and scattering are the significant points with Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All these points are still remaining with Christianity because it has become today's Babylon.</S>
