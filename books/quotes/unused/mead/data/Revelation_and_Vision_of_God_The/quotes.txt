[3]  CHAPTER ONE CONCERNING THE DIVINE TRINITY 1 Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; John 14:16; Gen 1:26; Exo 3:14-15; John 4:24 OUTLINE The first point of the vision concerning the Divine Trinity: The revelation in the Bible the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[4]  Theological expressions used throughout the ages: In Greek hupostases, prosopa, ousia.
[5]  The opening of the veil is a revelation; behind the veil is the mystery hidden in God.
[6]  However, in the Bible throughout the ages the seekers of God, from Adam to John the Baptist, were only groping at the veil.
[7]  A number of times people have brought me to take a tour of manufacturing plants, showing me all the interior furnishings and machinery, but I could not understand the things I saw, nor was I interested in them.
[8]  I. THE FIRST POINT OF THE VISION CONCERNING THE DIVINE TRINITY A. The Revelation in the Bible the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
[9]  My burden is not to give you lessons one after another; rather, my burden is to give you a secret so that you will have something to apply when you go out to preach the gospel by door-knocking.
[10]  The secret is the revelation and vision of God.
[11]  Beginning with this message we will use one scene after another to speak about the revelations of God and explain the visions that we have seen therein.
[12]  The first scene of the revelation in the Bible is the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[13]  The Study concerning the Triune God in Theology throughout the Ages
[14]  Now we will go on to see the study concerning the Triune God throughout the ages.
[15]  Concerning the Development of the Theology of the Trinity in the Latin Language Personae, Essentia
[16]  THE PURE REVELATION OF THE BIBLE CONCERNING THE TRIUNE GOD
[17]  We all acknowledge that the matter of God's being triune is a mystery, and it is also a difficult subject.
[18]  As the incarnated God, the Lord Jesus lived a human life on the earth, died on the cross, and resurrected after three days; then in resurrection He came to His disciples and said, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
[19]  In the record of the four Gospels, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit being coexistent.
[20]  Concerning the Divine Trinity, we have seen the revelation of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in the Scriptures and the theological terms used throughout the ages.
[21]  In theological history there was a group of people called modalists who advocated that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit were three modes of the unique God in the carrying out of redemption and that afterwards, fulfilling Their respective missions consecutively, They returned in succession to Their original unity.
[22]  Most readers of the Bible, including some who are among us, think that in the Old Testament the emphasis is on the work of God the Father; that in the four Gospels the emphasis is on the work of God the Son, the Lord Jesus; and that from Acts to Revelation the emphasis is on the work of God the Spirit, that is, the work of the Holy Spirit.
[23]  Although the Gospels are concerned mainly with the Lord Jesus and take Him as the center and the subject, in these books the Father, the Son, and the Spirit still coexisted.
[24]  This also proves that the teaching which says that when the Son came, the Father was over, when the Son was there, the Spirit was not there, and when the Spirit came, the Son was over, is altogether without any basis and is therefore a great heresy. c.
[25]  It is true that we believe the Son is the Firstborn of all creation, but our belief is not according to the teaching of Arius but according to the pure revelation of the Bible.
[26]  The Bible says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation not according to His divinity but according to His humanity.
[27]  According to His divinity, He is the eternal God, the Creator; however, since He became flesh and put on a body of flesh and blood, He also possesses humanity.
[28]  The three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit not only coexist but also coinhere.
[29]  In John 14:7-10 the Lord said to the disciples, "If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him."
[30]  Because I have been stressing in America that the Triune God is one and that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one, they interpreted my teaching out of context and thus condemned me for advocating modalism like Sabellius.
[31]  They said that when the Lord Jesus was standing in the water after His baptism, the Father spoke from the heavens while the Spirit was soaring in the air like a dove; at that time, all three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit were present but They were in three different places.
[32]  He taught adoptionism, saying that Jesus was merely God's adopted Son and had become the Son of God by being exalted to a status that was not His by birth; thus, he denied that Jesus had been conceived by the Spirit.
[33]  We have covered three crucial points concerning the Divine Trinity.
[34]  The Apostles' Creed declares that we believe "in Jesus Christ His only Son our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; He descended into Hades; the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead."
[35]  The revised Nicene Creed declared that we believe "in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by whom all things were made; who, for us men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; he suffered and was buried; and the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again, with glory, to judge both the quick and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end."
[36]  The result was a new creed called "The Chalcedonian Confession of Faith"; its contents are as follows: "Following the holy fathers, we unanimously teach one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, complete as to his Godhead, and complete as to his manhood; truly God, and truly man, of a reasonable rational soul and human flesh subsisting; consubstantial with the Father as to his Godhead, and consubstantial also with us as to his manhood; like unto us in all things, yet without sin; as to his Godhead begotten of the Father before all worlds, but as to his manhood, in these last days born, for us men and for our salvation, of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God; one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, known in of two natures, without confusion, without conversion, without severance, and without division; the distinction of the natures being in no wise abolished by their union, but the peculiarity of each nature being maintained, and both concurring in one person and hypostasis.
[37]  We confess not a Son divided and sundered into two persons, but one and the same Son, and Only-begotten, and God-Logos, our Lord Jesus Christ, even as the prophets had before proclaimed concerning him, and he himself hath taught us, and the symbol of the fathers hath handed down to us."
[38]  From then on the creed had been revised and expanded again and again until A.D.
[39]  553, when a creed that was richer and more exhaustive than the previous ones was produced.
[40]  This creed was called "The Athanasian Creed," and its contents are as follows: Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic faith.
[41]  Now we come to the heresy in the creeds the Mother of God Theotokos .
[42]  Second Corinthians 3:17 says that "the Lord is the Spirit."
[43]  That the Lord is the Spirit, that the Son is called the Eternal Father, and that the Son is the image of the Father all these truths are extremely important yet they are lacking in the creeds. g. The Spirit Being the Eyes of the Son
[44]  The Son as the Angel of Jehovah; as Jehovah, the Self-existing and Ever-existing One; and as Elohim, the Triune God
[45]  The Angel of Jehovah mentioned in Exodus and Judges is the Son Exo 3:2-15; 14:19; 23:20-21; Judg.
[46]  According to the humanity of the Son, the Bible says that He is a creature.
[47]  In the book entitled Concerning the Person of Christ we have clearly said, "According to the complete revelation of the Bible, Christ is both the Creator and the creature, because He is God and He is man He is God who creates, He is also man who is created .When Christ became a creature He did not lose His eternal, uncreated nature He remains the Creator.
[48]  But Acts 7 says that Stephen, before he was stoned to death, saw the Lord Jesus still standing as the Son of Man at the right hand of God v. 56 . In Revelation 1, the apostle John saw that the Lord Jesus, who is walking in the midst of the golden lampstands, is like the Son of Man v. 13 . In Matthew 26, when the high priest interrogated the Lord Jesus, saying, "Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God" v. 63 , the Lord replied, "You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven" v. 64 . This indicates that the Lord will still be the Son of Man at His coming back.
[49]  CHAPTER FOUR CONCERNING THE DIVINE TRINITY 4 Scripture Reading: Col 2:2, 9; Isa 9:6; 2 Cor 3:17; John 1:14; Heb 2:14; Col 1:15, 18; Acts 2:36 OUTLINE The all-inclusiveness of Christ: In His divinity: He is the mystery of God, and in Him all the fullness of the entire Godhead the Father, the Son, and the Spirit dwells bodily.
[50]  He comes in the name of the Father and works also in the name of the Father.
[51]  He is the image of God to declare God.
[52]  In this chapter we will see the fifth point concerning the Divine Trinity, that is, the all-inclusiveness of Christ, including eight items in His divinity and ten items in His humanity.
[53]  In His Divinity a. He Is the Mystery of God, and in Him All the Fullness of the Entire Godhead the Father, the Son, and the Spirit Dwells Bodily
[54]  Colossians 2:2 says that Christ is the mystery of God.
[55]  That Christ is the mystery of God means that Christ is the story, the history, of God.
[56]  All the fullness of the Godhead refers to all that the entire Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is, has, can do, has done, has obtained, has accomplished, and has attained; all of this fullness dwells in Christ bodily.
[57]  He Sends the Holy Spirit from and with the Father, and the Holy Spirit Also Comes from and with the Father
[58]  John 15:26 says, "But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality, who proceeds from the Father."
[59]  Concerning the Triune God, sometimes you feel that He nourishes and cherishes you as the Son, while other times you feel that He disciplines and gives grace to you as the Father; but most of the time you sense that He is interceding for you as the Spirit.
[60]  He Is the One Who Fills All in All
[61]  That the church is the Body, the fullness, of Christ means that through the enjoyment of the riches of Christ the church becomes the fullness of Christ for His expression.
[62]  Since He includes God, in the Divine Trinity He is not only the Son, but He is also called the Father, and He is also the Spirit.
[63]  Colossians 1:18 says that Christ is "the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead."
[64]  The Spirit of Jesus is mainly related to the Lord's humanity and human living; the Spirit of Christ is mainly related to the Lord's resurrection; the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of God compounded with the Lord's incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.
[65]  He Was Begotten with His Humanity in Resurrection to Be the Firstborn Son of God with Many Brothers
[66]  We must very clearly see the divinity and humanity of Christ to be able to understand the mystery of the Divine Trinity.
[67]  In conclusion, God is three, having three persons the Father, the Son, and the Spirit yet He is surely one, being the one God.
[68]  CHAPTER FIVE THE ECONOMY OF GOD Scripture Reading: Eph 1:9-11; 3:9-11; 1 Tim 1:3-4; Eph 1:5; Rom 8:3; Gal 4:4, 6; John 3:6; 4:24; Rom 8:16, 14; John 17:2; 2 Pet 1:4; Eph 2:19; John 14:2; 1 Cor 1:30; Acts 2:38; Matt 28:19b; Rom 6:3b, 4a; Eph 2:5-6; John 20:22; Acts 1:8a; Rom 11:17-24; 1 Cor 12:12; Eph 5:30; 1:22-23; 2:15; Rev 1:11; Acts 26:18; Heb 2:11; 1 Pet 1:3a; Rom 9:21; Eph 5:27; 1 Pet 2:5 OUTLINE The second item of the vision the economy of God: Being His household administration, dispensation, and plan.
[69]  That they may have an organic union with the Divine Trinity in Christ to become the members of Christ that constitute His Body as the corporate expression of the Triune God in Christ.
[70]  I have recommended the book Concerning the Person of Christ for your reading.
[71]  B. To Work Himself, in His Divine Trinity, into His Chosen Ones
[72]  The purpose of God in His economy is to work Himself, in His Divine Trinity, into His chosen ones.
[73]  C. That They May Become His Children as His Sons with His Life and Nature to Become His House So That He May Have a Dwelling Place for His Rest
[74]  When God works Himself into us, He makes us His children as His sons.
[75]  According to the Greek, in the New Testament there is only one place 2 Corinthians 6:18 that says we are God's sons and daughters.
[76]  On the one hand, the believers are joined to God the Spirit by receiving Him essentially as the Holy Spirit John 20:22 , the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 , for their existence, their being, their life, and their living; on the other hand, they are joined to God the Spirit by being baptized into Him economically to receive Him as the Spirit of power Acts 1:8a; Luke 24:49b for their spiritual work and function that they may witness for the Lord and spread forth His gospel.
[77]  Brothers and sisters, you all must clearly see the economy of God.
[78]  Today if you ask Christians, "What is the economy of God?", some Christians who have studied theology will say, "There are two great needs of man today.
[79]  The economy of God is that He wants to work Himself as the Triune God into us that we may become His house so that He may have a home, a dwelling place for His rest, and that we may become the Body of Christ for His own expression.
[80]  CHAPTER SIX THE REALIZATION AND EXPERIENCE OF GOD'S ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Matt 1:23, 21, 18; John 12:24; Rom 8:29; 2 Cor 13:14; Eph 1:4, 7, 13; 3:17-19; Rev 1:4-5; Matt 16:16, 18
[81]  In the previous chapter we saw four points concerning the economy of God.
[82]  At the end of the last century, this school of theology was very prevailing and strongly influential in Europe.
[83]  But at the beginning of this century, in 1914, war broke out in Europe, and the fighting was very severe.
[84]  The Lord Jesus Being the Mingling of God with Man
[85]  Therefore, Matthew 1 does not simply tell us how God was conceived within the virgin Mary through the Holy Spirit and born as the Son, Jesus, who is Jehovah the Savior and whose name is called Emmanuel which is translated, God with us .
[86]  C. The Center of the Entire Bible the Triune God Working Himself into Man and Mingling with Man to Produce the Church 1.
[87]  I have spoken so much because I have a burden to show you that our God is the Triune God and His heart's desire, His longing, in eternity has been to work Himself into man.
[88]  The Bible with its sixty-six books is very rich in content, but its emphasis is very simple: the Triune God wants to work Himself into man.
[89]  God is the almighty God who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being Rom 4:17 ; why did He not get into man immediately, be born immediately, and grow up to be the God-man Jesus immediately?
[90]  The divine revelation concerning the Triune God desiring to work Himself into man extends throughout the entire New Testament.
[91]  Verses 9 and 10 say that the Spirit of God dwells in us, that we have the Spirit of Christ in us as the indwelling Spirit, and that Christ is in us.
[92]  At the end of Revelation, in chapter twenty-two, again we see "a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street" v. 1 . Here we have God, the Lamb the Son , and the Spirit signified by the river of water of life . This depicts how the Triune God dispenses Himself into His redeemed under His headship.
[93]  When a saved person feels he has the Lord's presence inwardly, that means the Spirit is in him.
[94]  Where the Spirit is, there the Lord is 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Cor 3:17 , and where the Lord is, there the Father is Rom 8:9-10 .
[95]  This is because the Spirit is the reality, the realization, of the Son John 14:17 , and the Son is the embodiment of the Father 10:30; 14:10-11 .
[96]  In the record of Matthew 16, the Lord asked the disciples, "Who do you say that I am?"
[97]  Having the accurate knowledge, Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[98]  The Lord said that the vision of Him being the Christ, the Son of God, which Peter saw was correct.
[99]  The central message of the Gospel of John is found in chapters fourteen through sixteen and in the concluding prayer in chapter seventeen.
[100]  Mostly they told us that the Lord Jesus said, "I am the way and the reality and the life" v. 6 . They also said that the Lord Jesus was going away, but because He was very concerned for us, He asked the Father to give us another Comforter that He might be with us forever v. 16 , and now the Comforter has come and is taking care of us.
[101]  THE THIRD ITEM OF THE VISION THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF CHRIST
[102]  In this chapter and the following chapter I feel burdened to speak to you concerning another basic truth the accomplishments of Christ.
[103]  B. Becoming Flesh Bringing God into Man That God and Man Might Be Joined as One
[104]  God created the heavens and the earth and then He created Adam.
[105]  Although they have a very good hymn Hymns, #84 written by Charles Wesley concerning the birth of Christ, there is not one place in that hymn that definitely and solemnly tells people that, through His birth, the Lord Jesus brought God into man that God and man may be joined as one.
[106]  The Word became flesh, and this Word was God v. 1 , not just a partial God, but the entire God, including the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[107]  C. Experiencing the Human Life Living God among Men That God May Be Expressed in Humanity
[108]  The Lord Jesus did not go to die on the cross with His flesh immediately after His incarnation.
[109]  The four Gospels show us that the Lord lived out God in His humanity when He was in the process of experiencing the human life.
[110]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: Gen 3:15, 21; Isa 53:7; Dan 9:25-26; Zech 12:10; John 8:44; 1:29; Rom 8:3; Matt 1:21; Heb 9:28a; 1 Pet 2:24; John 3:14; Heb 2:14b; John 12:31; Gal 6:14a; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20; 6:14b; Col 1:15b, 20; Eph 2:14-16; John 12:24; Rev 13:8 OUTLINE Passing through death dealing with sin, Satan, the world, the flesh, the old man, and the old creation with its ordinances and releasing the divine life to accomplish redemption: The types, prophecies, and fulfillment in the Bible.
[111]  The death of Christ dealing with sin, Satan, the world, the flesh, the old man, and the old creation with its ordinances and releasing the divine life: Dealing with sin: 1 Sin and sins.
[112]  The truths concerning the accomplishments of Christ have been made shallow by the majority of today's Christian teachers.
[113]  Perhaps some will say that Christianity also preaches the gospel and speaks about the Lord Jesus' crucifixion, shedding of blood, forgiveness of sins, and accomplishment of redemption, as well as His resurrection and ascension.
[114]  Now we will go on to see how the death of Christ dealt with all the negative persons, matters, and things in the universe, such as Satan, the world, sin, the flesh, the old man, the old creation with all its ordinances and all persons, matters, and things involved.
[115]  2 The Source of Sin the Devil's Private Possession
[116]  In John 8:44 the Lord Jesus said to the Jews, "You are of your father the devil .He was a murderer from the beginning .When he speaks the lie, he speaks it out of his own possessions."
[117]  In the old creation we are the old man.
[118]  Since the Lord Jesus dealt with sin on the cross, is sin still in us today?
[119]  CHAPTER NINE AN EVALUATION OF THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY 1
[120]  In this and the following chapter, we review the practice of the new way so that we may make some changes and adjustments.
[121]  For this reason we need to have more research.
[122]  Recently, the brothers from Tainan came to make a request.
[123]  More than ten saints serving full-time in their locality were not accepted into the training because they did not have sufficient education.
[124]  From now on, once every week we will have a study of the new way for its improvement.
[125]  I hope that in every session of study we can draw a conclusion according to which you can all go and experiment again.
[126]  FOLLOWING THE TRAINING'S PRESCRIBED RULES, NOT DEPENDING ON THE NATURAL WAYS
[127]  You all can testify that the most effective way for door-knocking is to follow the way established by the training.
[128]  In this chapter, first we will speak about research and then about improvement.
[129]  In your most recent going out to visit people by door-knocking, you baptized more than one hundred persons, and some of the teams even baptized more than ten.
[130]  Not only should we have the right seeds, but we should also have the right techniques.
[131]  When we visit people by door-knocking, we should not say too much, nor should we speak our own words.
[132]  THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY BEING THE MOST EXCELLENT WAY
[133]  My intention in speaking to you repeatedly about all these things is to change your concept.
[134]  Second, in the training we also want to study how to help you manage your time.
[135]  After you lead someone to be saved and baptized, it may be all right if you do not revisit him in a week, but it is not so good if you do not visit him again for two weeks, and you may lose him if you do not revisit him for three weeks.
[136]  The third step, which is still being experimented on, is to set up the small group meetings.
[137]  After you have baptized a person and have continued to visit and take care of him three to five times, you must fellowship with him about gathering the new ones in his neighborhood and taking turns having small group meetings in each other's homes.
[138]  THE SPIRIT AND THE BURDEN OF THE NEW WAY
[139]  We have to see clearly the goal of the new way.
