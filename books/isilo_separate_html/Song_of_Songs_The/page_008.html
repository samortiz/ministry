"Sons" signifies something objective. These sons of the mother are strong in doctrine and in objective things, and they are somewhat authoritative. Because of the maiden's love for God and the discipline of the chambers, there is a change in her work. Her mother's sons begin to despise her and even become angry with her.</P><P>"They made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept." The first mention of "vineyard" is plural in number; it is organized by man. The second mention of "vineyard" is singular in number; it is ordained by God. "They made me the keeper of the vineyards." This was her former work. After she has received God's enlightening and is dealt with by Him, she realizes the vanity of her former work&#151;she has only done what man entrusted to her, but not what God ordained for her.</P><P>Verse 7 says, "Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?" The word "loveth" is a verb. "Turneth aside" can be translated as "wanders astray."</P><P>In the chambers, she has already realized the vanity of her outward works. She already realizes that a Christian's need is not work, but personal food and rest. The word "feedeth" speaks of food. From now on, she will only seek after food and rest. This "rest" is a complete rest, because "noon" is the time of perfection. The path of the just is as the shining light, that shines more and more unto the perfect day, which is noon (Prov. 4:18). Noon is the perfect position. When the sun reaches noon, it will not grow any brighter. (The Lord suffered from noon to the ninth hour. His sufferings descended upon Him all at once; they came with great intensity from the beginning, and did not increase gradually.)</P><P>"Why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?" These "companions" are the Lord's companions. The flock, however, is not the Lord's flock, but the flock of His companions. Being turned aside is to be put to shame. She is outside of the flock, and she has to say, "Why are You not telling me where to find food and rest? I have been searching for food and rest; I have searched here and there." Because she has been led astray by the flock of His companions and is being ridiculed and criticized, she asks, "Lord, why would You not tell me?"</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
