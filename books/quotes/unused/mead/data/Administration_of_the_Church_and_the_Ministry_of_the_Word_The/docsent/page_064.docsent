   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT GIVING UNDUE EMPHASIS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO SPIRITUALITY AND THUS NEGLECTING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to build a house, there must be a site, the ground for the house.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Similarly, the building of the church must have a ground.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother Austin-Sparks overemphasizes spirituality and neglects the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>May the Lord cover me with His blood to say this: the work of Brother Austin-Sparks at Honor Oak is quite spiritual, but because he neglects the ground of the church, his work has no future.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who meet in Honor Oak learn many spiritual matters and are helped spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, they have no place to go after they leave Honor Oak.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There was a good Brethren assembly in London; D. M. Panton also had a meeting there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since these meetings were not in organized Christianity, why did Brother Austin-Sparks separate himself from them and begin another meeting in Honor Oak?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This matter touches the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brother Austin-Sparks may have said that those groups were not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If those groups are not spiritual, where should the brothers who meet with him go when they leave Honor Oak?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Should they go to the Presbyterian Church, the Baptist Church, or should they follow the pattern of Brother Austin-Sparks and start another meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Spirituality is relative, but the ground is absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just as we received help from Madame Guyon and honor her spiritual portion, we also received help from Brother Austin-Sparks and respect his spiritual portion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, we disagree with Madame Guyon and Brother Austin-Sparks in the matter of the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We respect Brother Austin-Sparks spiritual portion, but we disagree with his view concerning the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot accept his correction; rather, we would refute his view.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is absolutely a matter of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who receive help from Honor Oak have no place to go and no way to advance because they have spirituality without the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, those who leave Honor Oak become wanderers when they go to various places in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We cannot allow our brothers to be wandering stars without a definite place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the churches in Taiwan pursue only spirituality, there will be many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brother Austin-Sparks emphasis on spirituality is too subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He can do this in Honor Oak, but he cannot correct us to match his way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such a correction will cause our work to fall apart and make us the same as the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>STANDING ON THE LOCAL GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>AND WALKING ON THE WAY OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even though we might not understand the scope of these matters, my speaking is for our future work in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today there are many believers from different backgrounds.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we want to build the church of the Lord, we need to understand the ground of the church; otherwise, there is no way to have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot take the way of exclusion and reject all those from the West.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to receive them and acknowledge them as brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need proper discernment concerning how to receive those from the West.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Otherwise, much of our work will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we think that we should not contend for the ground of locality but should rather be as tolerant as the denominations, then we should save our energy and join them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, we want God s children to know that God has no way in the denominations, because they cannot produce the building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The best that they can do is lead people to salvation and give them spiritual edification.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Over the past thirty years the Lord has shown us that in order to build up the church, we should be spiritual on the one hand and hold on to the ground on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are spiritual but do not have the ground and the building, the brothers will have no way to proceed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we change our attitude and drop the matter of the ground, the brothers will become wandering stars with no way to proceed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every matter has principles and laws.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do not take the way of the truth, others will, and when those who take the way of the truth question us, we will be speechless.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We will not be able to withstand their questioning, because we have not taken the way of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A person may consider that baptism by immersion is unnecessary and that baptism by sprinkling is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, when a brother who is baptized by immersion questions him, he will be unable to reply and will fall under the condemnation of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, for the sake of God s building, we need to have a precise view concerning the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only when we are firm concerning the ground of the church will we have the way to build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to love the Lord and be spiritual, and we need to be mingled with God and have His authority so we can be joined together with others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, we cannot be in the Baptist Church or in the Lutheran Church but only on the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On this ground we can speak the truth, and our speaking will be clear and logical.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The way to build is on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we do not have the ground, our speaking can only go halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We will be the same as Brother Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May the Lord have mercy on us that we would clearly see the matter of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We admit that the brothers from the West are good brothers and that their hearts are clean.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, they do not have enough light concerning the truth and therefore are not clear about the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They also have a sense of Western superiority that frustrates our ability to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If they did not have such a sense and were willing to be humble and fellowship with us concerning the Lord s Word, they would gradually become clear.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Their pride causes them to make changes to everything they touch.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hence, they are unable to see the light, and it is difficult for us to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This shows that organized Christianity has problems, and even those who are spiritual and pure have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Their conduct and view force us to be passive and maintain a distance even though we do not break off fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, because there is no active fellowship, it is difficult to have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we were to maintain active fellowship with them, our work would disintegrate.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have a way to advance, but we do not have a way to advance in our relationship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, we would rather maintain our position.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The matter of the church is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We need to see the truth and the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We receive all the spiritual riches from those who preceded us over the centuries, regardless of their ground.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But we are sure of the way the Lord wants us to take.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Nobody can change us in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We admire their spirituality, but this is not our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We know with certainty that the Lord has raised us up for the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When Brother Nee spoke on the principle of the line of Antioch in 1937, his stress was on the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The notes of the messages were compiled and published as Rethinking the Work, now published with the title The Normal Christian Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Brother Nee saw this light.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Over the past twenty years we have become clearer concerning his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But there is still more to see on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>My desire is for us to understand this matter because the administration of the church among us depends on our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Today transportation in the world is convenient and available to everyone; people come from different places to fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The brothers from the West may be spiritual and good, but we must be aware of the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I cannot tell you everything, but I beg you to believe me.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I am speaking to you earnestly because this is not something I have decided in haste.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I have been considering this for several months.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I will be held accountable for my words, but you must also understand me correctly.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We are not breaking away from the West.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We are not an Eastern sect.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We need to be clear concerning the Lord s desire when He raised us up.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We need to know who we are, what others have, and the help we should receive.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Knowing our condition and that of the enemy guarantees victory in every battle.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In this way we will not fall short of what the Lord has entrusted to us.</S>
