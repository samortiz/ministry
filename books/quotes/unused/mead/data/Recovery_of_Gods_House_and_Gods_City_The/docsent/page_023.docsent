   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PURIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ezra not only strengthened and enriched the recovery, he also purified it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before he arrived, there was a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some of the Israelites had married heathen wives and children were born of this mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a type which we should not apply literally, but spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The recovery is the holy seed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Anything we receive which is not holy is a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In some places where there were recoveries in the past, a mixture existed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The recovery is holy, but some of the things taken in are not so holy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, there is a mixture, and Ezras are needed to purify.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ezra was the one who purified the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the local churches we must be so pure, so simple, with no mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The problem is that many of us who have come back from Babylon have brought our background with us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our background creates the mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Lord's recovery, there is the need of purification to separate the holy seed from anything that is heathen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not bring into the local churches the things that you did in the denominations, no matter how good they are.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That is the bringing in of heathen wives.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This does not mean that we are proud, but that we must let go of our background.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all must learn to give up the things of our background, regardless of how good they are.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must be so pure that the holy seed will never be mingled with anything heathen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the recovery is holy, we will see the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In some places, the reason the blessing was frustrated was the mixture caused by the background.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have been condemned many times for not inviting others to speak in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are not proud, but we are really careful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we invite outside speakers to come, they will bring in "heathen wives."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the past we tried this, but it only caused trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So we have learned the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This does not mean that we are narrow, but that the recovery is so pure, so single, and so holy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do need the Ezras to do a purifying work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord does not like any kind of mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Lord's creation, everything was "after its kind."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If it is an apple, it must be from an apple tree; if it is a peach, it must be from a peach tree.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must be simple and after our kind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to be pure, strict, simple, and after our kind!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we are the denominations, we should just be the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are the free groups, we should just be the free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not say that we are anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are the local church, we should just be the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must be so simple, so single, so pure, and so genuine after our kind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord never honors any kind of a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It must be after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Ezra's work was to strengthen, enrich, and purify.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He not only purified the people after the building up of the temple, but he purified them again for the building up of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In both Ezra and Nehemiah, there was the purification: one was after the building of the temple, and the other was after the building up of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In all the steps of the Lord's recovery, there is the need of purification.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE PROTECTION OF THE CITY</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have seen the work of Zerubbabel, Joshua, Haggai, Zechariah, and Ezra Is not this good enough?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is the return, the recovery of the building, the strengthening, the enriching, and the purifying.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is good, but it is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is still the need of the work of Nehemiah for the protection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is the temple, but not the city.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The temple needs the protection of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The temple is the house, and the city is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The house of God needs the kingdom of God as the protection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>So after Ezra, there is the need of Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nehemiah eventually became the governor of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The kingship must be brought in for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have seen these six persons: Zerubbabel, Joshua, Haggai, Zechariah, Ezra, and Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Zerubbabel represents the kingship, and Joshua the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Haggai and Zechariah represent the prophets Haggai to stir up and Zechariah to reveal Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Ezra is the priestly scribe to strengthen, enrich, and purify.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Nehemiah came in for the protection, which is the submission to divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the local churches, we must have the house of God, and we must also have the city of God, which is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The house of God depends mostly upon the priesthood to contact the Lord, to be saturated with the Lord, and to be one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the start of the recovery, but there is still the need of the headship, the kingdom, and the divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The church is for the kingdom that is, the house is for the city.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Eventually the house of God becomes the holy city, the New Jerusalem Rev 21:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the New Jerusalem, there is no temple Rev 21:22 , because the temple has been enlarged into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This means that the city and the temple are mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the eternal protection.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Simply to have the house is not adequately safe.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need the protection of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the ministry of Nehemiah, the last governor in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The first was Zerubbabel, and the last was Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the Lord's recovery, there is the need of these six persons.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>One by one they all contributed something which was necessary and vital.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I love these recovery books.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They have exactly the things that we need today in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We need Zerubbabel; we need Joshua; we need Haggai; we need Zechariah; we need Ezra; and we need Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Nehemiah brings in the protection of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As long as we do not have the city, we are not safe.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We need a certain kind of protection as the outskirts of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The city is just the outskirts of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>With this there is the protection to the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Eventually the house, the temple, will be mingled with the city in the New Jerusalem, providing protection for eternity!</S>
