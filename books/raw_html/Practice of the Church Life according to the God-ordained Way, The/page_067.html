<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Being Built Up Together<br>to Be a Priesthood, a Priestly Body</H2><P>Romans 15:16 tells us that the New Testament believers are the New Testament priests and that we, the New Testament priests, are priests of the gospel. Then 1 Peter 2:5, 9 says that we as priests should be built up together to be a priesthood, that is, a priestly body. Thus, if we are going to convert sinners into members of Christ, we must do it in a corporate way. Two or three priests must be built up together as a priesthood. As used in the Bible, the word priesthood bears two denotations. First, it denotes the priestly service, and second, it refers to the priestly body, a group of priests built together to become a priesthood. Merely to go out to preach the gospel by yourself is not adequate. You must be built together with others. However, it would not be effective to call together the entire congregation in your locality to promote the priesthood of the gospel. You should simply contact two or three of the saints and be built together with them as a priestly body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Going Out to Contact People</H2><P>Then you must go to contact people. You should not excuse yourself by saying that you do not have time to do this. You may feel that you do not have time to contact people for the gospel, but you may have time to speak at length on the telephone or to watch television. If you account for your time, you will see that every day you waste a certain amount of time. Especially in speaking on the telephone, we need to learn to shorten our conversations, speaking only what is necessary, in order to save our time.</P><P>Saving money is not as important as saving time. Hence, just as we count our dollars and cents in order to save money, we need to count our hours and minutes in order to save time. From the moment we rise up in the morning, we need to budget our time. Then we will see that we do have time to visit people for the gospel. At least two days a week we will be able to spend two hours a day for gospel preaching. We can write to our friends; we can call our friends; we can go to visit people; or we can invite them to our home, either for tea or for dinner. There are many things that we can do to contact people and bring them to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Telling Out the Virtues of Our God</H2><P>First Peter 2:9 says that the priesthood of the gospel is to declare, or tell out, the virtues of our God. Here Peter does not directly speak of preaching the gospel; rather, he speaks of declaring, proclaiming, or telling out, the virtues of God. The virtues of our God are many. God's love is one of God's virtues. His mercy, His grace, His forgiveness, and His dying on the cross for our sins also are His virtues. You and your companions in the gospel priesthood should study all these things and become familiar with them. Then, whenever you meet someone, you can declare to that one some virtues of God, some virtues of Christ, not in a legal way but in a very particular way according to what the Bible reveals.</P><P>If you have the heart to begin to practice the priesthood of the gospel, you must study, budget your time, and go to contact people. You can knock on "cold" doors, and you can also knock on "warm" doors. To knock on people's doors does not necessarily mean that you literally go up to a door and knock on that door. That is not the only meaning of knocking on doors. Your writing a letter to your schoolmate can be considered your knocking on his door. To call people on the telephone also is to knock on doors to contact people.</P>
