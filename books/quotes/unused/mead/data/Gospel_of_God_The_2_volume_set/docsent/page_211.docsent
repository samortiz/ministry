   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN SALVATION BEING ETERNAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT 3</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we will continue to look at the verses which seem to argue against salvation being eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE ARGUMENT BASED ON 2 CORINTHIANS 2:7</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second Corinthians 2:6-7 says, "Sufficient for such a one is this punishment by the majority, so that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with excessive sorrow."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In some translations, the words "swallowed up" are translated as "perish."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A brother in Corinth had received punishment by the majority because of his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul was concerned that the brothers and sisters had dealt with him too severely.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He asked them to forgive and encourage such a one, lest he should "perish" with excessive sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some may argue that if excessive sorrow can cause such a one to perish, is this not an indication that a believer can still perish?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must realize that this brother is the same one that is mentioned in 1 Corinthians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This one committed a gross sin, the sin of fornication of an abnormal sort.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul said that such a one needs to be removed vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The saints in Corinth took Paul's word and removed him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After being removed, he realized that he was sinful, and was in much sorrow and agony over his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul told the saints in his second Epistle that they had to comfort and encourage him, lest he be swallowed up with excessive sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are careless, we may think that "perish" here means to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet Paul in 1 Corinthians 5:5 says "to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Based on this word, we can say boldly that such a one was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is mentioned in 2 Corinthians 2:7 is definitely not a matter of the perishing of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second, the word for "be swallowed up" is not a commonly used word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is a special word in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word katapino denotes something being swallowed up, as a ship sinking in the sea and being swallowed up by it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After such a brother sinned and was excommunicated, he repented.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He thought that he was excommunicated and fully rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He thought that he had lost all hope.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, he continued in his sorrow and agony.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul's thought is that if the church would not forgive and comfort him right away, he would be swallowed up by sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not a matter of the saving or the perishing of the soul.</S>
