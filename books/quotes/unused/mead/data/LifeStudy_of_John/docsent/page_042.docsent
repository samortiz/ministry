   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Worker for Christ Decreasing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must let Christ increase.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all must decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The entire following must go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If all of today s Christian preachers and leaders would say, Lord, let my following be Yours that You may increase and that I may decrease, there would be no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some people seem to say, He must increase, and I must decrease, but I must hold my following.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As long as you hold your following, you will never decrease and He cannot increase.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The increase or the decrease all depends upon the following.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To whom does the following belong?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the problem today: every preacher has his own following.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many think that we are the same as they are because, according to their concept, every worker must maintain his following.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we say that we do not keep a following, they do not believe us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May the Lord have mercy upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need His mercy not to keep a following under our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we do, sooner or later, we shall be cast into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let the following go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He must increase, and we all must decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE IMMEASURABLE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 3:31-36 bothers many translators of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They do not know where to place these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One version even puts them in another place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some translators have argued whether these words were spoken by John the Baptist, by the Lord Jesus, or by John, the writer of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Several suppositions have been made.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But, by the Lord s mercy, we have come to see that these verses should be where they are, because they continue what has transpired up to verse 30.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 30 says that Christ must increase and that we all must decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because Christ is unlimited and all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These verses reveal an unlimited Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was the little Jesus who was born in a manger and raised in Nazareth in the house of a poor carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He had no outward beauty or attractiveness and He was very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, He is all-inclusive, immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is higher than the heavens and broader than the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is everything, and everything is for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us read these verses and see what they unfold of the immeasurable Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth is of the earth and speaks of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He who comes from heaven is above all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What He has seen and heard, of this He testifies, and no one receives His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He who receives His testimony has sealed that God is true.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for He gives the Spirit not by measure.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Father loves the Son, and has given all into His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These verses reveal that the Christ in whom we believe is unlimited and immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A. Coming from Above</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ by then was a person on earth physically.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But He was One coming from above.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was on earth, but His source was above.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So, He is above all.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>B. Coming from Heaven</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As Christ is a person from above, so He is also from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Heaven is above earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was on earth, yet His source was heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>C. Being above All</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ is above all.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this portion of the Word, the word all does not mainly mean all things or matters, but all people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ is above all people, especially John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At that time, John was in a position of rivalry with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Both Jesus and John accepted disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the eyes of John s disciples, John was on the same level as the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But that was not right.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, verse 31 tells us that Christ is the One who is above all.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is above you, me, and everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>D. Being from Heaven yet Still in Heaven</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Christ was from heaven; yet while He was on earth He was still in heaven 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is universal; He is immeasurable.</S>
