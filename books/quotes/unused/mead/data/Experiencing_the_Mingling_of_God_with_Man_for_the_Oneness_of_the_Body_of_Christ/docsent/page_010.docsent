   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE BEING MINGLED WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO REALIZE THE ONENESS OF THE BODY 2 Scripture Reading: John 14:20; 3:26-30; Eph 2:21-32; 1 Cor 3:4-12; Rev 1:12-13, 20; 4:2-3; 21:2-3, 9-12, 14, 18-19, 21, 23; 22:1-2 THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE ONENESS OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>BEING THE CENTRAL MATTER IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AND IN OUR CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we will continue to fellowship about the mingling and the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The mingling is related to life, and the oneness is related to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we thoroughly study the Scriptures, we will see that these two matters life and the Body, or the mingling and the oneness are two central matters in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God s eternal purpose is that He would be life to us and as our life be mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, the matter of life involves the mingling of divinity with humanity, and the result of this mingling is the Body, the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are two pictures in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first picture, which is in Genesis 2, is a picture of life, and the central item in this picture is the tree of life v. 9 . At the end of the Scriptures is another picture portraying a holy city Rev 21:2 22:5 . A city is a single entity composed of many pieces of material.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, this city is a picture of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Within this city is the tree of life 22:2 , showing us that the oneness is the issue of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This city comes into being through the flowing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first picture in the Scriptures contains a tree of life and a flowing river, issuing in the material for the building gold, bdellium, and onyx, which is a precious stone Gen 2:9-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the first picture there is only the life with the material; there is no building yet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the second picture, however, the material has been built together into a building, the holy city, New Jerusalem, which is built with gold, pearl, and precious stones Rev 21:18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we study these two pictures carefully, we will realize that God s desire is to build a city by the growth of His divine life in many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, His desire is for life and building, for mingling and oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What the Lord has been doing and is still doing throughout the generations is building up a city, a Body, by His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This thought runs throughout the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The ministry of the apostle Paul, who represents all the gifted ones, is very much concerned with these two matters of life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, he tells us that Christ is life to us and that we have to take Christ as our life and live by Christ Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He even says that to live is Christ Phil 1:21a .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand, Paul says many things about the building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As those who enjoy Christ as life, we should be built together as the habitation of God Eph 2:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, in the ministry of the apostle Paul there are these two central matters life and the Body, that is, the mingling of God with man and the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to spend some time to consider what is most important to us as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we would spend a little time with the Lord to do this, I believe that the Holy Spirit would show us that there are only two matters that are important and vital to us as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One matter is that of taking Christ and experiencing Him as life day by day and moment by moment, even to the extent that we could say with Paul, To me, to live is Christ Phil 1:21a .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christians like to talk about spirituality and being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, what is spirituality, and what does it mean to be spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be spiritual is simply to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Genuine spirituality is nothing less than Christ being lived out by us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is our taking Christ as our life and experiencing Him in a very practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ as our life must be everything to us in our Christian life; whatever we do must be Christ lived out by us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The result of such a Christian life is the second important matter the building together of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Spiritual building is produced only by spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The apostle Paul tells us that we are God s farm and God s building 1 Cor 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The farm implies our growth, and the building implies our being built together.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The way to be built together is simply by growing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do not grow in the life of Christ, we can never be built together with others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are built together only by growing in Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If I live by my own life and another brother lives by his own life, we will never be built together.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead of being built together we will quarrel or even fight with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the same for husbands and wives.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I do not believe that there has been one couple who have been married for several years without quarreling.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is only one way that we can be joined, blended, and built together by the growth of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Each of us is so peculiar that we would never get along if the Lord were not our life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If an American brother lives by his American culture and a Chinese brother lives by his Chinese culture, they will frequently have problems with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can never work together or be blended as one in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, praise the Lord for the divine cement, the divine life, which holds us together!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are like stones; when we are by ourselves, we are separate, but when we are put into the divine cement, which is the divine life, we are cemented together as one, and nothing is able to break us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Oneness is the issue of the mingling of the life of God with us.</S>
