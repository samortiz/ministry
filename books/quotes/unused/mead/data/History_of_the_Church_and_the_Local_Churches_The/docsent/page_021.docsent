   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brother Nee came into contact with her soon after his conversion, and he received so much help from her.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He spent at least several times with me personally to tell me the things concerning his relationship with Miss Barber.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Initially, Brother Nee was among a group of young brothers and sisters who had just been saved and went to contact Miss Barber.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Miss Barber was deep and also very strict.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In her strictness, she used to rebuke the ones under her perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, the only one that still went to see Miss Barber after a period of time was Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brother Nee told me that whenever he went to her, he was always rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He told me that the more she rebuked him, the more he sent himself to her for her rebuking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He said that he did this because he received the help from her.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1936 I was invited to the central part of China.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After a few days, Brother Nee was also invited there, and we stayed together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He said to me, "Brother Lee, if Miss Barber were still living, we would be much better than what we are today."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then he said, "In 1933 I went to Europe to visit many spiritual persons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In my being, according to my weighing, no spiritual person whom I visited in the Western world at that time could compare spiritually with Miss Barber."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows us the kind of preparation the Lord made for Brother Nee as His gift, His servant.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Miss Barber went to the Lord in 1929.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That was nearly the same year in which Brother Nee finished his writing of The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Miss Barber, in her will, gave all her things to Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of course, she did not have many personal things, but she willed Brother Nee her Bible with all her notes in it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That was very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Later, Brother Nee told me that he was thinking of writing a biography of M.E. Barber, but he could not find the time to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was a real loss to us that Brother Nee never found the time to write such a biography.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he had been able to do this, it would have been a great help to us even today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to what Brother Nee told me, Sister Barber was a person who always lived in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One day Brother Nee went to see her.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She was in another room while he was waiting in the living room.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He told me that while he was waiting there, he had a deep sense of the Lord's presence there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She was a deep person in the Lord, and she composed a number of excellent hymns which are in our hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All her hymns were very deep in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, day by day she was waiting for the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the last day of 1926, she was taking a walk with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When they turned the corner to another street she said to Brother Nee, "Maybe as we turn this corner, we will meet Him."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She was a person waiting for the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She lived and walked in the presence of our returning Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I never met her, but after I heard what Brother Nee told me, I received a great help.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was through M.E. Barber that he received the foundation of his spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brother Nee would tell people that it was through a sister that he got saved, and it was also through a sister that he was edified.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As a British person from the Western world, Sister Barber came to know the famous spiritual giants in Christianity at her time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through Sister Barber, Brother Nee came to know the top spiritual books by people such as Robert Govett, D.M. Panton, and Jessie Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The best publications on the exposition of the Bible and church history were introduced to Brother Nee through her.</S>
