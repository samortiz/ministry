   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Mysteriously Making Home</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in Our Hearts That We May Be Filled</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>with the Breadth, the Length, the Height,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and the Depth of What Christ Is,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>to Become All the Fullness of God</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Seventh, the church, being strengthened in its members into the inner man with power by God through His Spirit, has Christ mysteriously making home in the believers' hearts, with the result that it is filled with the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of what Christ is, to become all the fullness of God Eph 3:15-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not only do we have Christ in us as the rich supply, this Christ is also making home and living in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason, we need the Holy Spirit to strengthen our whole being into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this way, Christ will have the chance to occupy the different parts of our heart our mind, emotion, will, and conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In addition to our spirit, Christ will spread and occupy our whole soul step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, for Christ to make home in our heart is for Him to be constituted in the hearts of the believers in the church and to spread within them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we will gradually experience the boundless dimensions of what Christ is His breadth, length, height, and depth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This points to the boundless and immeasurable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the end, we will be filled to become all the fullness of God as the full expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Mysterious Life Union</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>of Christ and the Church Being</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>the Great Mystery in the Universe</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this way, we have point number eight, which is the mysterious life union of Christ and His Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This union is a great mystery in the universe Eph 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This mystery is the processed Triune God being joined and mingled with the regenerated and transformed tripartite man to become a universal couple.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the ultimate point of the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is the principal character, and man is His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The two share the same nature; they live and walk together.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, divinity is living in humanity to become the reality of humanity, and the human virtues are living out the divine glory and beauty to become the expression of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Divinity and humanity are mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Divinity is the content and the reality within, and humanity is the manifestation and beauty without.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The virtues manifested by us Christians should be the manifestation of the glory and beauty in the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is different from the morality of the world, which is only proper human behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But a Christian is one who has divinity as his element and reality, from which the divine glory and beauty are expressed through the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the expression of God.</S>
