   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SWEET REMEMBRANCE OF CAPTIVITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we have another wonderful Psalm, Psalm 137, one which we should never forget.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a Psalm regarding the remembrance of the experience of desolation, the remembrance of the experience of captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What I am about to say may sound strange to you, but please try to understand me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must believe that our Lord is really sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since He is sovereign, if He had never allowed us to be captured, we could never be captured.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Though we had attempted to be led into captivity, unless He had allowed it, it could not have been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is sovereign, and all His people were brought into captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So many of us have had the same experience as the Psalmist in Psalm 137.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But we can even praise the Lord that we have been captured!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In eternity, when we recall how we failed the Lord so miserably, how we were captured, and how the Lord eventually brought us back, the remembrance will be sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do you not agree with me?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the captives of old returned, when they were enjoying the Lord together in His house, they reminisced concerning their time in captivity: "By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion" v. 1 . This kind of remembrance is so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Though the Lord allowed us to be captured, it was for our ultimate enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times when I have spoken concerning my experience in Christianity, I have bowed and worshipped the Lord and told Him, "Lord, without that experience I could never have realized how sweet your house is."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we have never fallen and been brought back, we have never tasted the sweetness of the Lord's mercy in restoring us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even that kind of failure and captivity is sovereignly a part of the Lord's own economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Just recall all your experiences throughout the past two years, and you will taste something of this sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let us read this Psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It shows how much Zion and Jerusalem were to the captives.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am much inferior to the Psalmist; I could not utter anything better than he did it is really poetic.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Zion was in the remembrance of the captives.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When they remembered Zion, the tears flowed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There they were at some other rivers; they were not drinking at the river of the house of God, the river which makes glad the city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They were sitting by the rivers of captivity, and when they remembered Zion, they wept.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof" v. 2 . We went on strike.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We shut our mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was prison; this was not the place for us to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How meaningful!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To sing praises to the Lord requires a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How can we sing praises to the Lord in Babylon?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot play our harps in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The only thing we can do in Babylon is weep.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How significant!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and our tormentors required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion" v. 3 . To sing one of the songs of Zion in Babylon would be a real shame to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>So the saints said, "How shall we sing the Lord's song in a foreign land?" v. 4 . It is really good! I could never utter anything better than this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verses 5 and 6: "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her skill.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Psalmist was saying, "If I would not strike, let my tongue and my hands strike.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If I would not hang up my harp, let my tongue and my right hand be hung up.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jerusalem is not only my chief joy, but better than my chief joy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is something which is better than the best."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Psalm 137 is the sweet remembrance of the sorrowful experience of captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we are in eternity, we will never forget all those experiences of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 7: "Remember, O Lord, against the children of Edom, the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is poetry, but according to the present situation, the principle is exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You simply do not know how much some of the so-called Christians I do not say the unbelievers hate the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They hate the recovery of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the church in Los Angeles would close today, so many would clap their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Their desire is expressed in the words, "Rase it, rase it, even to the foundations thereof!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Get rid of the whole thing."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 8: "O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rendereth unto thee as thou hast meted out to us."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the book of Revelation we read of the rejoicing that occurs when Babylon is fallen: "And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen" Rev 18:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"And again they said, Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>And her smoke rose up for ever and ever" Rev 19:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"Happy shall he be, that rendereth unto thee as thou hast meted out to us."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the vengeance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Time will vindicate His word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The enemy of Jerusalem is to be punished and Babylon is to be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Babylon will fall, but Jerusalem will stand forever.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Regardless of how much the haters say of Jerusalem, "Rase it, rase it," we and God are saying, "Build it!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Build it!"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Eventually Babylon will be rased, and Jerusalem will be built twelve thousand furlongs high.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Jerusalem will stand forever.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hallelujah, praise the Lord!</S>
