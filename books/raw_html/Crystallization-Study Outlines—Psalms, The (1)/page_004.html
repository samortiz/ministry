<h1 class="title">The God-man Who Satisfies God&rsquo;s Desire<br />
and Fulfills His Good Pleasure</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 15:1; 16:1-11</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Psalm 16 is &ldquo;A Michtam of David&rdquo; (title); the meaning of the Hebrew word <em>michtam</em> is uncertain, but some understand it to mean &ldquo;a golden jewel (of a poem).&rdquo;</li>
<li>Psalm 16 reveals that only Christ, the God-man, can satisfy God&rsquo;s desire and fulfill His good pleasure&mdash;Matt. 3:17; 17:5; cf. Psa. 15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Only He&mdash;the very God who became a man, lived a human life full of the divine attributes expressed in human virtues, died, resurrected, and ascended to the right hand of God&mdash;is perfect according to the law and can sojourn in God&rsquo;s tabernacle and dwell with God on His holy mountain&mdash;v. 1.</li>
	<li>In God&rsquo;s economy only the God-man Christ as the firstborn Son of God with His many brothers as the many sons of God (Rom. 8:29) can satisfy God&rsquo;s desire and fulfill His good pleasure.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Preserve me, O God, for I take refuge in You&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 16:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ took refuge in God and trusted in God&rsquo;s preservation.</li>
	<li>The life that the Lord Jesus lived on earth was a life of continually trusting in God; His life was a trusting life&mdash;1 Pet. 2:23; Luke 23:46.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;I say to Jehovah, You are my Lord; / No good have I beyond You&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 16:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When the Lord Jesus was a man on earth, He always held the attitude of recognizing God the Father as His Lord&mdash;Matt. 4:7, 10.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus had no good (no blessing, no pleasure, and no enjoyment) beyond God the Father as His portion&mdash;cf. Luke 18:19; Isa. 53:2a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;As for the saints who are on the earth, they are the excellent; / All my delight is in them&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 16:3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In His human living, the Lord Jesus loved God the Father (John 14:31), and He had His delight in the saints in God&rsquo;s kingdom.</li>
	<li><em>The saints</em> implies the church, the Body of Christ; Christ delights in the saints, the excellent people on the earth, because they are the members who constitute His Body.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;The sorrows of them who bartered for some other god will be multiplied; / Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, / Nor will I take up their names upon my lips&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 16:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ in His human living had nothing to do with other gods and their offerings, nor did He take up their names upon His lips.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Go away, Satan! For it is written, &lsquo;You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 4:10.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Jehovah is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup; / You maintain my lot&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 16:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is the portion of the inheritance and of the cup; <em>inheritance</em> refers to a possession, and <em>cup</em> refers to enjoyment.</li>
	<li>God the Father was the portion of the inheritance and of the cup to Christ as a man on earth; in Christ&rsquo;s human living, God was His possession and enjoyment.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;The measuring lines have fallen on pleasant places for me; / Indeed the inheritance is beautiful to me&rdquo;&mdash;v. 6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ chose nothing for Himself; He left His destiny and all the choices to His Father&mdash;Matt. 11:25-30.</li>
	<li>Christ appreciated the possession given by God to Him under the measuring lines on pleasant places and the beautiful inheritance given to Him by God&mdash;Psa. 2:8; Rev. 11:15; cf. 2 Cor. 10:7-18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;I will bless Jehovah, who counsels me; / Indeed in the nights my inward parts instruct me&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 16:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord Jesus denied Himself and received the Father&rsquo;s counsel, taking God the Father as His Counselor&mdash;Isa. 50:4.</li>
	<li>The inward parts of Christ were one with God; when God counseled Him as a man, His inward parts instructed Him through His contact with God; this is the proper experience of a God-man&mdash;cf. Phil. 1:8.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;I have set Jehovah before me continually; / Because He is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 16:8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ set God before Him continually to be His security, and He was not shaken, because God was at His right hand.</li>
	<li>While the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was never alone, because the Father was always with Him&mdash;John 8:29.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Therefore my heart rejoices and my glory exults; / Even my flesh dwells securely&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 16:9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In His death Christ&rsquo;s heart was rejoicing, and His glory, His spirit with His tongue, was exulting.</li>
	<li>Christ was willing and happy to die for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s economy.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus rested physically in His burial, waiting to be resurrected.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol, / Nor let Your Holy One see the pit&rdquo;&mdash;v. 10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God would not abandon Christ&rsquo;s soul to Sheol (Hades), nor let His body see corruption, decay.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s soul would be raised up from Hades, and His physical body would be resurrected from the tomb&mdash;Acts 2:31; Matt. 28:6; John 20:5-9.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;You will make known to me the path of life&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 16:11a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God would make known to Christ the path of life&mdash;resurrection.</li>
	<li>In His incarnation Christ brought divinity into humanity; in His resurrection He brought humanity into divinity&mdash;John 1:14; Rom. 8:3; 1:2-4; Acts 13:33.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;In Your presence is fullness of joy; / At Your right hand there are pleasures forever&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 16:11b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is in God&rsquo;s presence participating in fullness of joy; this indicates that Christ has ascended to the heavens to God&rsquo;s presence in order to enjoy His attainments and His obtainments&mdash;Acts 1:9-11; 2:36; 5:31; Phil. 2:9-11.</li>
	<li>In His ascension Christ is enjoying pleasures forever at God&rsquo;s right hand.</li>
	<li>Christ is at the right hand of God in His ascension for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy concerning the church, the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:20b-23.</li>
	</ol></li>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
