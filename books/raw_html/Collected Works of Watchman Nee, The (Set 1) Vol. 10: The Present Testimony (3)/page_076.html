<P>Mr. Austin-Sparks is a servant much used by the Lord today. The most precious truth to him is "in Christ." The turning point in his life came when the Lord opened his eyes to see the riches in Christ. He showed him that he was a rich man living in poverty, that he had forgotten about the riches in Christ. Brothers and sisters, this is one gate we have to pass. May the Lord open our eyes through the spirit of wisdom and revelation to see the oneness we have with the Lord.</P><P>However, after we have seen the oneness we have with the Lord, does this mean that we will no longer lose our temper or that we will never be jealous again? Does it mean that we will have meekness and love from that point on? The devil will be like the Canaanites; he will block and stumble us all the way. If we do not stand firm in the victory of Christ, we will fail. All those who have not passed the gate of faith will never be able to walk the way of faith. Once God has opened our eyes, we will see the riches in Christ, and the devil will come and tempt, saying, "You say that all the blessings are in Christ. Why then are you still losing your temper and steaming with wrath? You say that all the blessings are yours. Which one do you now have? The revelation you have received is not real; it is just cheating you. You say that God has given you the land of Canaan. Why then is the wall of Jericho so high and the gate shut so tight? How can the seven tribes of Canaan be driven out? All that God has said is false and in vain. Maybe you should return to the east side of Jordan." But crossing the Jordan without encircling Jericho is like entering the gate of faith without walking on the way of faith. Crossing the Jordan without encircling Jericho will never bring down the walls of Jericho. Entering the gate of faith without walking on the way of faith will never result in any spiritual progress. The spiritual experience of every Christian is built on the footprints of faith.</P><P>Satan will never easily loosen his grip on the things we possess. We have heard that everything is in Christ. But after a little while, Satan will say, "You do not have love. You do not have meekness. Nothing is yours." Are we going to say, "Since these are not mine, I will just go home?" No, we should not say that. Instead, we should be like a property owner, claiming our property based on our title deed. We should walk east, west, south, and north all over our land and manage it according to our title deed. There is no need to beg or dispute; just take out the title deed and announce it. This title deed is a sealed document; it has an official seal on it. Satan can do nothing about it. When temptation comes, we should apply the appropriate verses to withstand the temptation. If it is a matter of temper, we should take care of it with the verses that deal with temper. If it is love that we need, we should apply verses that speak about love. Once we find the right verse, we should declare, "God said that this is my property. Therefore, this is my property." We can tell Satan that he is a liar and that he should go away. By faith we should say, "By the grace of Christ, I can be patient and meek." What should go away is our temper, not our faith. What should be removed is the mountain, not our faith. Faith should not bow down and surrender; the temper should bow down and surrender. Faith does not have to move; the mountain has to move. If we stand by faith, no city will be too high for us to bring down. Did the Israelites fight with dozens of wooden staffs? No, they did not need even one wooden staff. They circled the city and went home. Then they circled the city again and went home. They continued this for six days. To the inhabitants of Jericho, this must have been child's play. However, on the seventh day, having circled the city seven times, the Israelites cried with faith, believing that Jericho would surely fall down, and Jericho did indeed fall down.</P><P>Some Christians have crossed the gate of faith but have not walked the way of faith. They may say, "Oh, my temper, my jealousy, my pride, and my lust are still here. What should I do?" At this point please remember that first you must see the riches you have in Christâ€”this is the gate through which you enter into faith. After the gate, you need to stand firm in your position. When temper comes, you withstand it. When lust comes, you withstand it. When jealousy comes, you withstand it. When pride comes, you withstand it. You should stand firm and declare, "All these should fall down," and they will fall down. Hallelujah, this is a fact! The Israelites encircled Jericho, shouting and believing that the city would certainly fall down. How foolish this was from man's view. But just as Jericho fell at the Israelites' shouting, so will our temper, lust, pride, and jealousy fall at our shouting. To cross the gate is to see that everything is in Christ; this is the first step of faith. You need to lay hold of everything in Christ in the same way that you lay hold of a title deed. It is the devil's work to tell you that once you lose your temper you are done, and your "title deed" is gone.</P><P>Colossians 3:3 says, "For you died." God has shown you that you are dead; you can no longer lose your temper. If you believe this, then you have entered the gate. Satan will come at once, perhaps through your wife, daughter, a student, or someone else, and cause you to lose your temper. Immediately, you will think, "Perhaps the words `for you died' are not a fact to me." If you trust in your feeling, your faith will immediately disappear. Suppose my father has bought a piece of land and has given me the title deed. He has told me to go to a certain place to locate the land and manage it. Suppose I come to the countryside and encounter a ruffian, who asks me, "Sir, what are you doing here?" I say, "I have come to look for my father's land." Suppose he says, "How could this be your father's land? It is my father's land!" If I think that my father's word is not dependable and that it is the other man's land, I will go home. But if I say, "No, my father cannot be wrong; according to the title deed, the land is mine," he will have to leave. Either I go or he goes; one has to go. God has given you the blessings in Christ. The Bible is the "title deed" that God has given to administer the property. It is the "title deed" by which you can exercise your ownership. When you believe in the Bible, Satan will have to leave. Unfortunately for many people, when a little temptation from Satan comes, they toss away God's word and lose their faith. It is not enough to receive God's word once; we must stand firm on His word every time we are tempted. This is to walk on the way of faith.</P>
