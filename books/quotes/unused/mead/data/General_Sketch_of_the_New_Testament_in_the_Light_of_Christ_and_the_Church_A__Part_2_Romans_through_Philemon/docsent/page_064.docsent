   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY CHRIST AS EVERYTHING IN COLOSSIANS 2 Scripture Reading: Col 2:6-8; 1:9-11; 2:11-12; 3:1, 3, 9-11; 1:27; 2:16-17, 19 RECEIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapter we saw seven main points in Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The next main point is that we receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Colossians 2:6 begins, "As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Received is a very meaningful and important word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only two books, the Gospel of John and Colossians, speak of receiving Christ in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John 1:12 says, "But as many as received Him."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was young I did not properly understand the meaning of believing in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, after many years I realized that to believe in the Lord Jesus simply means to receive the Lord Jesus, like a radio receives the radio waves in the air and people receive breath into their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Colossians stresses that we have received Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>WALKING IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The ninth main point in Colossians is that we walk in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Colossians 2:6 concludes by saying, "Walk in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse tells us to walk not according to Him but in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Him means that Christ is a sphere, a realm in which we walk, signified by the good land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Him also includes the meaning of walking by Him, just as travelling in a car means that we travel by the car.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rejecting Human Philosophies and Distracting Teachings</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the early days of the church, the Colossian believers were confused and carried away from the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to church history, they were distracted by Gnosticism, a philosophy composed of Jewish, Egyptian, Persian, and Greek teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those teachings appeared to be good, in the same way the teachings of Confucius appear to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word Gnosticism itself indicates the word of knowledge and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 8 speaks of philosophy; in writing this, Paul had in mind Gnosticism, the teaching and thoughts of human wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He also speaks of the elements of the world, the rudimentary teachings of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This also is related to the teaching of the Gnostics.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This Gnostic philosophy was brought into the church and caused confusion regarding the proper knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, many believers were distracted from experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was the reason that Paul wrote Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The principle of this portion of the Word is that throughout all the centuries there have always been good teachings invented and taught by man that distract Christians from the real knowledge and experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In China, for example, many Christians were distracted by the ethical teachings of Confucius from the real and living experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must realize that when we were regenerated, we received Christ as our life and our everything, so Christ has become the sphere, the realm, and the means for us to live on the earth and walk in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we must reject and abandon not only the bad things but even the good things, the best teachings invented by man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The best thing invented by man in human culture and civilization is not science.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times science has produced awful things, such as machines to kill many people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The best human invention is philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, we must never be distracted by human philosophy; it is a subtle substitute for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Satan uses philosophy in a subtle way to distract people from the real experience of Christ, but many times we do not realize that we have been distracted.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may consider that philosophy is good because it helps us to be better persons, to have a better living, which is a glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We Christians have received Christ as our life and as our everything, and now we must learn not to know any good thing other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should abandon all the other good things and learn to live and walk in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I would caution the young brothers and sisters about studying books of philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I do not like to see that a young person would major in philosophy at a university.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To do this is to put yourself into the mouth of a tiger; at any time the enemy, Satan, can swallow you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Human philosophy is very deceiving for Christians.</S>
