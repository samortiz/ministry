   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINISTRY OF THE GIFTED PERSONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Following this, Paul goes on to speak in Ephesians 4 about the functions of the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, we all are one in the Spirit, in the Triune God, in the saving faith, and in all the matters in verses 4 through 6.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the other hand, though, the ministries of the gifted persons seem to be different.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are the apostles ministry, the prophets ministry, the evangelists ministry, and the ministry of the shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are at least these four categories of ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, the purpose of all the ministries is still one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the different ministries are for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consider the situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do the evangelists care for the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many evangelists forget about the Body and neglect the Body; they are only for evangelism.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why there are divisions today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A prevailing evangelist with his prevailing preaching may spontaneously form a division.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likewise, a great teacher may live and work only for his teaching and not for the Body, and eventually a division may come out of his teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead of being for the building of the Body, these ministries often create divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should apply all these things to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If many of us go out to work for the Lord, some may be more evangelical, but others will care more for teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It may be that the evangelists will form something for their evangelism, and the teachers will form something for their teaching, both neglecting the building of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to see the vision that all the different ministries are for one purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If someone preaches the gospel, he should not keep the result, the fruit, of his preaching in his own hand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He must keep his own hand away from the result of his preaching and let the fruits of his preaching be for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, regardless of how much we help people by our teaching, we should not keep the result of our teaching in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must let the fruits of our teaching be for the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is a shame to say that even among us there is a secret trend of certain gifted persons keeping the result of their work in their hand.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not for the building up; rather, it is a tearing down.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to practice the church life, we must be clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same way, all the saints should not be for any one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They must be for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Someone may say, I have received much help from this teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am for him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, if you are for this teacher, he should not receive you in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some in Corinth said, I am of Paul, but Paul answered by saying that he was for them 1 Cor 3:4, 21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not be for any one person or his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, we are for the church where we live.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should forget about any minister who does something for his own ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, we should not blame the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to blame ourselves, the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is too easy for people to be the followers of an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To say, I am of Paul; I appreciate him or I am of Apollos, or I am of Peter is fleshly 1 Cor 1:12; 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must not say that we are for someone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should say, I am for the church in my locality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the saints are clear about this, no one will be able to create a division.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If anyone tries to create a division, he will be by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No one will follow him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, we will all go along with the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may be kind to that brother and say, Brother, we do appreciate your ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, we are not for your ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are for the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Moreover, we believe that you also know that your ministry is for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When people said, I am of Paul, Paul was not happy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, today people like to hear this kind of statement.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If someone would tell us, I am for your ministry, we may be very happy, but if they would say, I am not for your ministry; I am for the local church, we may be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To be this way is shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nevertheless, we must blame ourselves because it is too easy for us to follow a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all have to share the responsibility of the wrongdoing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To receive a ministry is right, but we are not for the ministry, and we do not follow that ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are for the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From now on, wherever we are, we must be only for the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then no gifted person will be able to create a division among us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The reason there is nearly no real practice of the church life today is simply that people are not clear about these points.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the one hand, some always keep something other than the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the other hand, others too easily follow certain ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As a result, there is no church life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These two items alone are sufficient to annul and destroy the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>First, we should not have anything within us that divides.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must keep only one thing, the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Second, we appreciate all the helpful ministries, but we must not be for any one of these ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must be for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>THE CHURCH BEING BUILT UP</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>NOT DIRECTLY BY THE GIFTED ONES</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>BUT BY ALL THE PERFECTED MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The gifted persons do not build up the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>On the one hand, the Lord told us in Matthew 16:18, I will build My church, but on the other hand, even Christ the Head does not build His church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Head builds the church through the gifted persons the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Likewise, the gifted persons also should not and do not build up the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Ephesians 4:11 mentions the different gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Then verse 12 tells us that all these gifted persons are not for the building up of the church directly but are for the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If you are a gifted person, you should not build up the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Your responsibility is to perfect all the local brothers, who build up the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What you need to do is perfect others, train them, qualify them, enrich them, empower them, and teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then let them do the work of building.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Your duty is not to build up the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Your duty is to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Let the perfected saints do the building work directly.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is a very important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Many times I do not do much in the meetings because I do not want to give the impression that the meetings are my business.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>They are not my business.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When I come to the meetings, I come as a guest.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The saints are the host, so they need to serve, and I simply enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I must say this because of our background in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In the Catholic Church there are priests, in the denominations there are ministers or pastors, and among the Brethren there are responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We may compare these different persons to styles of clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I may put on Western clothes today, Japanese clothes another day, and traditional Chinese clothes the next, but I am still the same person.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Likewise, whether we call certain ones pastors, ministers, or responsible brothers, they are the same kind of clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We should not have any clergy or laity among us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>For the past two years we also have had leading brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>All the leading ones in the meeting must be careful about the way they act, not giving people the impression that they are taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Here again there are two responsible parties.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>On one side, the leading ones may carelessly act in a way that gives people the impression that they are taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>On the other side, many of the dear brothers and sisters are weak and not right in their spirit, and they also have a wrong concept, coming to the meetings in a passive way, not in an active way.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>However, now we need to be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In order to practice the church life, the gifted persons should not build up the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>What they must do is perfect the saints and let them build up the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is the third aspect for the practice of the church life.</S>
