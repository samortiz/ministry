<h2 class=head2>A. A Disease on the Head</h2><p>A disease on the head (Lev. 13:29a) signifies something wrong in the subjection to authority and in the thinking of the mind. Any wrongness in thinking involves a wrong attitude toward authority. The source of wrong thinking is rebellion. If one’s attitude toward authority is wrong, his thinking will be wrong. But if one’s attitude toward authority is right, there will not be any wrongness in his thinking.<h2 class=head2>B. A Disease on the Beard</h2><p>A disease on the beard (v. 29b) signifies considering oneself as somebody, being self-dignifying, hunting for others’ exaltation. Instead of considering ourselves as somebody, we should regard ourselves as nobody.<p>It is leprous to be self-dignified or to hunt for others’ exaltation. This hunting for exaltation can be observed in the behavior of children. For example, in the presence of guests, visitors, and relatives, a little boy will often make a show of himself in order to be praised by them. He behaves in such a way because he is hunting for others’ exaltation.<p>It is possible even in giving messages for us to seek to be exalted by others. The one speaking may assume dignity by trying to make a display of how learned, knowledgeable, and eloquent he is. It is very easy for one speaking in public to become leprous in this way.<h2 class=head2>C. Yellow Thin Hair</h2><p>Leviticus 13:30 says, “The priest shall examine the diseased spot; if it appears to be deeper than the skin with yellow thin hair in it, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a scall, it is leprosy of the head or the beard.” Yellow thin hair signifies the deteriorating of the strength for living a normal Christian life. Spiritually speaking, if we are strong in our spirit to live a proper and normal Christian life, we shall have black hair. But if our hair becomes yellow and thin, that is a sign that our spiritual strength is deteriorating. Yellow thin hair is a sign of disease, and this disease comes from rebellion. Such hair is a sign of rebellion against God; it indicates that, at least in certain things, one is not submissive or obedient to God’s word. Even the slightest disobedience to God’s word in the Bible will cause our hair to become yellow and thin.<p>Sometimes a sister will notice that her husband has become weak spiritually, that he is weak in the things of God and in taking the word of God. This brother has yellow thin hair, which is a sign of leprosy, a sign of rebellion.<h2 class=head2>D. The Disease Not Appearing to Be Deeper Than the Skin and There Being No Black Hair in It</h2><p>Verse 31 goes on to say, “And if the priest examines the disease of the scall, and it does not appear deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall isolate him who has the disease of the scall for seven days.” This verse speaks of the disease not being deeper than the skin and there being no black hair in it. This signifies that a person’s sin is not covered and that he does not have the strength to resist it. For the disease not to be deeper than the skin is a positive sign; it indicates that a person’s sin is not covered, that he does not have the tendency to cover his sin. There being no black hair is a negative sign; it indicates that the strength to resist sin is lacking. Actually, the situation described in this verse is neutral, and for this reason the priest was required to isolate the diseased person for seven days.<h2 class=head2>E. Shaving the Beard but Not the Hair</h2><p>Shaving the beard but not the hair (v. 33) signifies dealing with considering oneself as somebody, with self-dignifying, etc., but keeping the subjection to authority. As 1 Corinthians 11 indicates, not to shave one’s hair is to keep one’s subjection to authority. Shaving the hair is a sign of rebellion. Spiritually speaking, we should keep our hair but shave our beard. Some, however, cut off their hair and keep their beard. This indicates that they are rebellious and self-dignified and seek exaltation from others.
