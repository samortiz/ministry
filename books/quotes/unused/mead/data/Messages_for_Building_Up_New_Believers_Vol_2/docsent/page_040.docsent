   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>XII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUR REACTION BEING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR THE INCREASE OF THE LORD S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why do we have to turn our left cheek when others strike our right cheek?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Lord grants us sufferings through man s hand, we should rather enhance His work than annul His work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why we turn our left cheek.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord is using man s hand to enlarge our capacity and to help us grow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The hand stops at the right cheek.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But we can add our left cheek.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that we do not react by frustrating the Lord s work through man s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the contrary, we further this work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord is striking us, and we also strike ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord is dealing with us, and we also deal with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When others strike our right cheek, we join in to strike ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not stand with ourselves to oppose our attacker.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the contrary, we stand with our attacker.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One strike is not enough; we need more striking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord is dealing with us, and we are also dealing with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord s hand is on me, and my prayer is for His hand to remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If I lose everything, I have nothing more to lose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If I die completely, I cannot die any further.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If I can still die, it means I have not died enough.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If I can still lose, it means I have not lost enough.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I want the Lord s hand to be heavier on me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I do not want to reduce the weight of His hand upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you can stand on the Lord s side and deal with yourself this way, you will have no grudge against anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man s demand can never be higher than the Lord s. Man s demand is, at most, one mile.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord s demand is the second mile.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The most that man can do is force you to go a mile.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But you can give him more; you can add something to it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You can do your best to enhance what the Lord has already done.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>XIII.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>STANDING FAST ON OUR CHRISTIAN STANDING</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let me ask you another question: Is it better to be the one who strikes or the one who is struck?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you envy others?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Others are striking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Are you going to do the same?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who strike are not acting like Christians, and those who endure others striking are not acting like Christians either.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only those who take the striking willingly and who turn their left cheek to their strikers, saying, Please do more, are acting like Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today if a brother strikes you, do you know what he has given you?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has given you the greatest opportunity to be a good Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He honors you by striking you, having offered you the opportunity to be a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please remember that a Christian who strikes others has lost his Christian dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not envy those who have lost their Christian standing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every time you are mistreated or are threatened, you are given the opportunity to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In fact, those who treat you this way are saying, So-and-so, I no longer want to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I will let you be a Christian in my place!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their actions are equivalent to this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a brother takes you to court or demands money or clothing from you, he is, in effect, saying, Today I do not want to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I will let you be one in my place!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He has resigned from the position of a Christian and put you in his position instead.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Should you not thank God for this?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You need to say, O God!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I thank You and praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You have put me in the position of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is truly Your grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brothers and sisters, we should learn to strive for our Christian standing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once, I had some business dealings with a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By common understanding, I did not owe him any money, but he demanded perhaps sixty-eight thousand dollars from me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>My first reaction was to be angry.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I felt that he did not have the slightest ground to ask for it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How could this man be a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He was too much.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If he had any sense of righteousness, how could he want this money?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But my next reaction was that of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Although he was wrong, I still enjoyed giving it to him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I asked him, Brother, do you really want it?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He said, Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At that moment, the Lord put this word in me: This man is giving you the opportunity to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This was the first time the Lord spoke such a word to me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I said, That is right, and went away to prepare the money for him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>From that day on, I learned this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When a person behaves the way this man did, he is giving up his position as a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When a person does this to us, what a shame and pity it is if we also resign from our Christian standing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should learn to say, The Lord has put me here, and He is giving me the opportunity to live as a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should say, Lord, I want to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>No loss is greater than the loss of our Christian standing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To be struck is a great loss; to lose our possessions is also a great loss; and to be put to shame and deprived of freedom are even greater losses, but the Lord has entrusted us with the responsibility of expressing His grace and forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we fail in this, we have suffered the greatest loss.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Some may think that the strong ones are those who can strike others.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But I say that the ones who are really strong are those who can afford to be struck and not strike back.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>A person who cannot control his own temper is a weak person.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A strong person is one who can control his own temper.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We need to know how to evaluate things spiritually before God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should not evaluate things according to the worldly way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should not hold to worldly views.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We need to have a spiritual view.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I hope that new believers will see what our Christian reactions should be from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We should set this course right from the start.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Do not allow three, five, eight, or ten years to go by before taking this way.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Do not think that the teaching on the mount is that profound.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>No Christian should wait a long time before picking up the teaching on the mount.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The teaching on the mount should be the first teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It should be something one finds at the main entrance, not something he sees after years of advancement.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The teaching on the mount is the fundamental Christian response to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It is the reaction that issues from our Christian nature.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When a person believes in the Lord Jesus, he spontaneously reacts this way and behaves this way.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Walking the second mile results in joy in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>A person cannot have real peace and joy until he practices this.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This life calls for persecution, disgrace, and mistreatment.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The more severe the persecution, the stronger the manifestation of the power of God s life.</S>
