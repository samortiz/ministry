   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN SAMUEL IS SEEN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE VOLUNTARILY CONSECRATED NAZARITE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>REPLACING THE ORDAINED PRIESTS,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ENDING THE AGE OF THE JUDGES,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>AND SPEAKING FOR GOD AS A PROPHET A. The Voluntarily Consecrated Nazarite</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Replacing the Ordained Priests</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord had given Moses a supplement in chapter six of Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This supplement was His special provision against the degradation of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord had appointed and ordained only the house of Aaron, of the tribe of Levi, to be the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The rest of the Levites who served in the tabernacle were not the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s intention had been to make the whole nation of Israel a kingdom of priests; however, through Israel s failure, the Lord chose the Levites as a tribe of priests to replace a nation of priests in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But not all of the tribe of Levi were chosen by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only those of the house of Aaron were to be the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the house of Aaron eventually came to the point of being fully and utterly fallen at the time of Eli s sons 1 Sam 2:12-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the Lord foresaw the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Besides His ordination of the house of Aaron as priests, He had made a supplement in the sixth chapter of Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This supplement was given in case there should be an inadequacy in the ordained priests.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the house of Aaron fell, this supplement was put into practical use.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The principle of the Nazarite is voluntary consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not by being appointed, ordained, or even chosen by the Lord, but by voluntarily consecrating yourself to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the time of Eli, the Lord was really poor as far as the priesthood was concerned; so Hannah lent Samuel to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She told the Lord that if He would give her a son, then she would lend him to the Lord 1 Sam 1:11, give...unto in the original has the meaning of lend...to .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the situation is abnormal, the Lord becomes poor with respect to His administration, and there is the need for someone to voluntarily lend himself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Samuel was of the tribe of Levi 1 Chron 6:33-38 , of Mount Ephraim 1 Sam 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was not of the house of Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But he became a priest by being consecrated, separated, and lent to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Samuel became a priest by coming through the side door, not by coming through the main entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He became a priest according to the supplement provided in Numbers 6, not according to an appointment or ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By the principle of the Nazarite he became a voluntarily consecrated person to replace the ordained priest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>B. Ending the Age of the Judges</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Samuel was not only a priest, but also a judge.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The judges were in the line of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was a person both in the priesthood and in the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In such a position he ended the age of the judges and turned the age into the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>C. Speaking for God as a Prophet</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Samuel was also a prophet, one who spoke for God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First Samuel 3:19-21 says, And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord...for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With Samuel there was the priesthood, the kingship, and the prophethood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through him the age of degradation was turned into the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Samuel could be so much used by God simply because he came into God s administration through the principle of the Nazarite and became a voluntarily consecrated person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the section from Moses to Samuel, Aaron is the second important figure.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In him we see the priesthood and all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Afterwards, in Joshua we see God s power destroying the enemies in the land of Canaan and bringing His chosen people into the rest of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Following this is the age of the judges where we see the confusion caused by God s chosen people forsaking God and the revival gained by their turning back to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Next, we see the fall of the priesthood in Eli.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Finally, in Samuel we see a person voluntarily consecrated as a Nazarite, replacing the ordained priests, ending the age of the judges, speaking for God as a prophet prophesying for God , and bringing in the age of the kings.</S>
