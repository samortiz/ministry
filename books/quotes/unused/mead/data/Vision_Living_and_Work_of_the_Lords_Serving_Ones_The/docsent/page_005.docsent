   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will consider how to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After young people consecrate themselves to serve full time, the first thing they need to do is preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, what is the best way to preach the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we preach the gospel, our main goal is to be effective.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be effective means to get people saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we speak vividly and eloquently, but no one gets saved, our gospel preaching is a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, it is crucial for us to learn how to preach the gospel effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some say that the best way to preach the gospel is to sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not wrong; it is one way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, singing hymns as the first step in preaching the gospel can be compared to walking with one s hands.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Others say that the best way is to use the booklet The Mystery of Human Life, which uses four keys to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The key of God s creation unlocks the mystery of human existence, the key of man s fall unlocks the mystery of the two natures of man, the key of Christ s redemption unlocks the mystery of the God-man, and the key of God s dispensing unlocks the mystery of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lastly, it tells a person how to receive the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is good material for preaching the gospel, but we need to begin preaching the gospel from a basic level.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE GENERAL WAY Being a Person with a Spirit of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must consider the matter of preaching the gospel from the most basic level.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A certain kind of task requires a certain kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we want to preach the gospel, we must be persons who are for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As soon as the apostle Paul was saved, he proclaimed Jesus Christ Acts 9:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the first thing that he did.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every serving one, including the New Testament apostles, such as Peter and John, and those throughout church history, such as Moody and Spurgeon, begins his service by preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every person who is saved and loves the Lord has a spirit of the gospel, the desire to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In particular, those who love the Lord and consecrate themselves to the Lord have a strong desire to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all must be persons who preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Immediately after I was saved, I felt within that I should preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At that time no one was shepherding me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, in Chefoo the members in the various denominations were very cold toward preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It seemed as if I was the only person who was zealous for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I went to the villages to preach the gospel every Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since there were no buses, I walked.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I would walk about twenty miles in a day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By the time I returned home, I would be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, I did not cease preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There was a shortage of gospel material, so there were no gospel tracts for purchase.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, I began to write gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This spirit of the gospel is in every one of us, but some of us suppress it instead of cultivating it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The spirit of the gospel is like fire that can either be extinguished or set ablaze.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, we need to cultivate the spirit of the gospel, and we even need to fan it into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The bigger the fire, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Praying to Kindle the Fire of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to preach the gospel, we first must be a person for the gospel, having the spirit of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Next, we must pray.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we lack prayer, all our labor will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, we must pray.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, we should not pray for any specific persons; our prayer should be general.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should pray for the Lord to strengthen the spirit of the gospel within us so that the fire of the gospel would burn among us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, we must pray for the Lord to give us a heart of love toward men, to give us a sense of urgency toward the thousands of people who are perishing every day, and especially to give us an interest in sinners and a desire to contact them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This kind of prayer fans the fire of the gospel into flame; the more we pray, the more the fire of the gospel will be burning in us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually, when we see a sinner, we will be moved to tears, and we will love the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The young saints should exercise in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we feel nothing in our heart when we see people, the gospel tracts that we give them will be cold.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, if the fire of the gospel is burning within us, we will be burdened when we think of the unbelievers going to the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then every tract that we give out will touch people s hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the fire of the gospel is kindled within us, we will become crazy for the gospel and go everywhere to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The young people should be crazy for the gospel on their college campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whenever they see an unbeliever, they should be enlivened, even to the point that they forget about eating and care only for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should distribute gospel tracts and booklets every day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When I was young, there were always gospel tracts in my pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On my way to and from work, I would give them to the people I met.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should never be without gospel tracts, and we should give them to everyone we see.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whether we are in a store or eating in a restaurant, we should give out gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we are the kind of people who preach the gospel everywhere, we will see the effect of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The economical Spirit, the Spirit of power, will be upon us, and we will be full of power in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What I have fellowshipped is the common way, the general way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Every full-time serving one must have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must be on fire for the gospel, crazy for the gospel, for at least two to three years.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All those who are crazy for the gospel will become thick-skinned, bold, not shy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we have not already learned this spiritual lesson, we must make it up.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All the young ones who are serving the Lord full time must be crazy for the gospel.</S>
