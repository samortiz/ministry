   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRIUNE GOD DWELLING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to understand the Man-Savior s resurrection as His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit, we need to read John 14:10-20 carefully again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 14 we see that when the Son came, the Father was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, when the Spirit comes, the Son is with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the Spirit comes as the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that the Spirit comes as the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the Spirit comes, the Triune God comes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible the Hebrew word for Spirit is ruach; the Greek word is pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both words denote spirit, breath, air.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may say that our processed Triune God is like the air so available for us to breathe in. Now we can understand why Romans 10:8 says that the word is not far from us but is very near, even in our mouth and in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we recognize this and respond by calling on the Lord Jesus, the Lord Jesus comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the Lord is in us, the Spirit, the Son, and the Father are all in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The spiritual air we breathe is actually the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes when I consider this, I am beside myself with joy in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do you know where the Triune God is?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Triune God is now in us!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is according to the Lord s word in John 14.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He said that He would ask the Father to give us another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, who would be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But eventually the Lord went on to say that He Himself would be in us v. 20 . From the revelation in John 14 we see that the Triune God now dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>DISPENSED INTO THE TRIPARTITE MAN</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our study of the Bible we need to pay close attention to portions such as John 14:10-20.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should pay much more attention to verses such as these than to verses that speak about husbands loving their wives and wives submitting to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What we have in John 14:10-20 is far beyond our natural thought, which is easily occupied with teachings concerning love, submission, and humility.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In chapter fourteen of John, however, the Lord Jesus says nothing about being humble, or about wives submitting to husbands and husbands loving their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here He speaks concerning Himself, the Father, and the Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we need to pay close attention to this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before I was saved, I studied the writings of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Confucius had much to say about a wife s submission to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In fact, whereas the Bible teaches a wife to have a onefold submission, Confucius teaches a threefold submission.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I read the Bible after I was first saved, I was still under the influence of such teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But eventually I learned to pay attention to what the Bible reveals concerning the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the main subject of all my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the focal point of all my messages in conferences and trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I encourage all the saints to pay their attention to the crucial matter of the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man and to speak of this to others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do you know what is revealed in John 14:10-20?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we have a revelation of the Triune God dispensed into the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Concerning this, John 14:20 says, In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this verse the you is the tripartite man, and the I is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, I in you indicates that the Triune God is in the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course, in order to see this in full, we would need a thorough study of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order for the Triune God to be in the tripartite man, it was necessary for Him to pass through certain processes: incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Having passed through all these processes, the Triune God is now not only on the throne but also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Man-Savior s resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit, and as this Spirit He now dwells in us.</S>
