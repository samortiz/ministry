   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE UNIVERSAL BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is easy to know the church because it is visible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But to know the Body of Christ is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Seventy-four years ago the Lord reached China and raised up Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was saved as a young student.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Two years after he was saved, he put out publications to preach the gospel and teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He expounded the Scriptures in a way that shocked even the top missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brother Nee first presented us a clear view of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The missionaries brought the gospel to China and preached it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We thank the Lord for that.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But God's full salvation was never made clear as a complete spiritual thing until Brother Nee was raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After presenting a clear view of God's salvation, Brother Nee went further and presented the church to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the missionaries went to China, they did not bring the church to the Chinese people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, they brought their denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Chinese believers honored the denominations because it was through the denominations that they heard the gospel and were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They were grateful to the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All of a sudden, to their surprise a young "native boy" put out clear publications telling them what the church is and strongly declaring that all the denominations are divisions of the church, not the church itself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, Brother Nee made the local churches so clear and precious to us who were attracted by the Lord to follow Him according to His holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We treasured the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Later, Brother Nee brought us further to see Christ as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That was sweet and precious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then in 1939 he began to unveil to us the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all received his ministry concerning salvation, the local churches, and Christ as life to us; but very few among us received his ministry concerning the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We did not reject it; we simply could not enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Brother Nee's speaking to us concerning the Body of Christ, it was as if he were playing the piano to a group of cows.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that time I heard the term the Body of Christ and I came to know the doctrine of the Body of Christ, but I did not see the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brother Nee gave message after message from 1939 to 1940, but instead of our seeing the Body of Christ, there arose a great turmoil among us that forced Brother Nee to stop his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By this you can see that to enter into the reality of the Body of Christ is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the reason that, although the recovery has been in the United States for more than thirty-two years, it has been only in these recent years that we have felt the need to enter into the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the purpose of the blending.</S>
