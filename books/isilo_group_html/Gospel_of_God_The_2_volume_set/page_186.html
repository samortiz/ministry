For one to say this proves that his mind is fallen. He does not know God's Word, and he does not know himself. After a person is saved, if he were to perish, would it be because he himself wants to perish? Or would it be because of the temptation of the world, the seduction of the enemy, and the attack of Satan? For a Christian to perish would mean that lust can snatch man from God's hand; it would mean that the devil and the world can snatch man from God's hand. Man does not go to hell because he wants to go to hell; even sinners themselves do not want to go to hell, not to mention Christians. It is clear that man is dead in sin because of the evil spirits' binding work. Everyone in the world is possessed by demons. All the sinners have demons working in them. If the believers can be snatched from the Father's hand, then the evil spirits are greater than the Father of all creation. Here is a sheep in the hand of the Father of all. If nothing is greater than the Father of all, there is no possibility that this sheep can be snatched away. Moreover, it is impossible even for us to escape ourselves, because even we are part of the all things. The Lord Jesus said, "My Father is greater than all." You cannot put yourself outside of the all things.</P><P>Thank God that verse 28 shows us the hand of the Lord Jesus and verse 29 shows us the hand of the Father. Verse 28 tells us about the hand of the Shepherd. This is not a matter of law, nor a matter of curse, nor a matter of mercy, but a matter of the keeping by the Lord's hand. Verse 29 says that the Father's hand is greater and more powerful than all. We should consider ourselves securely held by two hands: the Father's hand and the Shepherd's hand.</P><P>Not long after I believed in the Lord, Brother Leland Wang and I went to listen to a message in Jiang Wan. The preacher said that we Christians should be fervent. We should preach the gospel and serve the Lord; otherwise, we would be dropped. After the message, I asked Brother Wang, "When do you think you will be dropped?" He said, "I am afraid that I will be dropped tonight." I said, "Yes, I am afraid that I will also be dropped. If I am dropped, I will go to hell." I further said, "If we can be dropped, what is the use of exhorting people to believe in Jesus any longer?" He agreed, saying, "I cannot even eat tonight." I said that not only would we not be able to eat, but we would not even be able to sleep that night. Those in the world do not know the danger of eternal death; they can still eat and sleep. We know the peril of eternal death; we know that we are like chaff before the wind. How can we not worry? This was my story before I knew about this aspect of the truth.</P><P>Thank God that it is my Father who keeps the salvation for me. It is my Lord who keeps my salvation for me. Therefore, I know that I am very secure. Twelve years ago, I was in Southeast Asia. Once I rode a bicycle through a big forest on my way to preach the gospel. In the forest, I saw a big mother monkey carrying many little monkeys stacked up one upon another on her back. They were like the human pyramid seen in acrobatic shows. The mother monkey carrying the little ones was running amid the trees. Every so often, she had to jump from one tree to another with a long distance in between. The mother monkey would jump and grab onto a branch of another tree. After swinging over a little, all the little monkeys on her back would fall onto the ground. The mother monkey would then jump down and let the little ones climb up and pile themselves onto her back again. On that day I watched them there for about two or three hours. They were very intriguing to me.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_185.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_187.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Gospel of God, The (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 186</div><br></body></html>
