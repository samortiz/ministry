   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since the creation of the world, God s eternal power and divine characteristics have been manifested to men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although men cannot see God, they can know Him through His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, creation is a proof of a creating God: The heavens declare the glory of God, / And the expanse proclaims the work of His hands Psa 19:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All creation is a proof of the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The order in the universe and the regulation of all things is a proof of the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even the existence of human beings is a proof of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we consider the existence of all things and the regulation of the universe, we should realize that there is a God who created and governs the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we consider the things related to ourselves and to our origin, this should also cause us to seek God...grope for Him and find Him Acts 17:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With such proof and evidence, a man will say, There is no God, only out of stubbornness Psa 14:1; 53:1 .</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God not only reveals Himself through His creation in the universe, but He also explains and reveals Himself through His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a person speaks, his speaking reveals his inner thoughts so that others may know him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If I stood in front of you without speaking, you would not be able to know or understand me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If God only created the universe but did not speak, we would be able to know of His existence, but we would not be able to know Him or the things in Him.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Just as the creation is a proof of God s existence, the Bible is a revelation of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can know Him by the creation, and we can know and understand Him by the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>GOD HAVING COME FORTH</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His creation pointed man to His existence, and His speaking enabled man to understand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, His incarnation enabled man to see Him and meet Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thank the Lord that God has not only created and spoken but also manifested Himself in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The God who revealed Himself through His creation and His speaking has manifested Himself through His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Prior to His incarnation He revealed Himself to man, but through His incarnation He has manifested Himself to man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Jesus Christ was the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This great mystery in the universe, the mystery of godliness, manifested God so that man could see God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>2.</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When men saw the Son, they saw God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To believe in the Son is to believe in God, to receive the Son is to receive God, and to honor the Son is to honor God because God is in the Son, and the Son is in God.</S>
