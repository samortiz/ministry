   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE THE MOVE OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR S</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOSPEL SERVICE 15 Scripture Reading: Mark 10:1-31</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall continue to consider 10:1-31.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this portion of the Gospel of Mark we have four matters: the Lord s coming to Judea v. 1 , the teaching against divorce vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>2-12 , the blessing of young children vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>13-16 , and the teaching concerning the rich and the kingdom of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>17-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that three matters that may frustrate our entering into the kingdom of God are marriage, oldness, and riches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen that if we are replaced by Christ, we surely shall have the way to handle these matters properly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us now consider in more detail what the Lord says in 10:2-31 concerning marriage, oldness, and riches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>TEACHING AGAINST DIVORCE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When God created man, He did not create all the people He needed for His purpose at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If God had wanted to create a great number of people at the same time, He certainly could have done so.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He could have created billions of people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, this was not God s way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead, God created a couple and charged them to multiply and replenish the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to God s ordination, the propagation of mankind takes place through marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Marriage, therefore, is second only to God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should never despise marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hebrews 13:4 says, Let marriage be held in honor among all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Marriage is holy, and we must honor it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Mankind was brought into existence through God s creation, and God ordained that mankind be propagated through marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to see that marriage is honorable and holy, for it is ordained for the propagation of mankind for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Apart from the creation of man and the propagation of mankind through marriage, there cannot be the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to look at marriage from this point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we consider marriage in this way, we shall honor it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We shall realize that marriage is for the propagation of mankind so that God s eternal purpose may be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In our marriage life we need to be honest, faithful, and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are not honest, faithful, and pure, we shall offend God in a very serious way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the Bible, God condemns fornication and adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hebrews 13:4b says, Fornicators and adulterers God will judge.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fornication and adultery are second only to idol worship as sins that are most offensive to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, we need to care for marriage in a proper way before God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to see that fornication and adultery damage the proper propagation of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the reason that God does not allow divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because marriage is such a serious matter, I would caution the young people against entering into it in a hasty way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Young people, before you get married, you need to have much prayer and consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not simply consider marriage from your point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You need to consider marriage especially from God s point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not get married in haste, for once you are married, you no longer have any alternative.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Divorce is highly offensive to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since we are on our way to enter into the kingdom of God, we especially need to be firm in our standing regarding marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to realize that once we are married there should not be any divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All married people should be blind to the shortcomings of their mate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They should not try to learn the faults of their spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the investigating concerning the other party should be done before the time of engagement.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After you are engaged, and especially after you are married, you should close your eyes to the defects of the other party and be blind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Unless you are willing to be blind in this way, you will not have a proper married life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to 10:2, the Pharisees questioned the Lord Jesus whether it is lawful for a man to put away a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When He asked what Moses commanded them, they replied, Moses permitted us to write a certificate of divorce and put her away v. 4 . This commandment was not a part of the basic law, but a supplement to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was given by Moses, not according to God s ordination from the beginning, but temporarily because of the hardness of man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 10:5-8 the Lord goes on to say, In view of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But from the beginning of creation, He made them male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>And the two shall be one flesh; so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here the Lord s word not only recognizes God s creation of man, but also confirms God s ordination of man s marriage, that is, one male and one female to be joined and yoked together as one flesh, inseparable by man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The commandment concerning divorce given by Moses was a deviation from God s original ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But Christ takes us back to God s ordination in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In 10:9 the Lord says, What therefore God has yoked together, do not let man separate.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Here we see that divorce is not merely against the law of God; divorce is against God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What God has yoked together man should not separate.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the one hand, marriage is a necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the other hand, married life is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Nevertheless, we must learn to love this difficulty and even care for it with affection.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This means that we should love our marriage and take good care of it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Otherwise, we shall be hindered in entering into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We believe that God is true, and we also believe that His Word, the Bible, is true.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hence, we must honor what God says in His Word concerning marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is a serious matter not to handle our married life properly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Failure to take care of our married life according to God will keep us from entering into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Yes, we now are on our way to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But whether we shall actually enter into the kingdom in the coming age is still pending.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>According to chapter ten of Mark, whether we shall enter the kingdom in the coming age depends in the first place on the way we handle our married life.</S>
