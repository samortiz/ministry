<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Enemy's Further Attack</H2><P>In 37:9-11 we read of the enemy's further attack. The king of Assyria heard the report about the king of Ethiopia which said, "He has come to make war with you" (v. 9). When he heard this, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying to him, "Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. Indeed, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them thoroughly. And will you be delivered?" (vv. 10-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Hezekiah's Further Seeking after Jehovah</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Hezekiah Spreading the Letter before Jehovah<br>and Praying concerning the Enemy's Attack</H2><P>In his further seeking after Jehovah, Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the house of Jehovah, spread the letter before Jehovah, and prayed to Him concerning the enemy's further attack (vv. 14-20). Hezekiah ended his prayer by saying, "O Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone are Jehovah" (v. 20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Word Spoken by Jehovah<br>concerning Sennacherib</H2><P>In 37:22-29 we have the word spoken by Jehovah concerning Sennacherib. Verses 22 and 23 say, "The virgin daughter of Zion/Has despised you and laughed at you;/The daughter of Jerusalem/Has shaken her head at you./Whom have you reproached and reviled;/Against whom have you lifted up your voice/And lifted up your eyes haughtily?/Against the Holy One of Israel." In verse 29 Jehovah says to Sennacherib, "Because your raging against Me/And your arrogance has come up into My ears,/I will put My hook in your nose/And My bridle in your lips,/And turn you back on the way by which you came."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Hezekiah's Trusting in Jehovah<br>according to His Answer to Him<br>and Winning the Victory<br>in Jehovah's Fulfillment of His Answer</H2><P>Hezekiah trusted in Jehovah according to His answer to him and won the victory in Jehovah's fulfillment of His answer.</P>
