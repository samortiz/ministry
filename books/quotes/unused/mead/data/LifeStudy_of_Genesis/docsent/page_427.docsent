   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>13 Jacob's Fleeing from Laban</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the changes in Jacob's environment were indicators that he should go back home.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jacob did go, but not in a noble way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do you think that Jacob fled from Laban in a proper way?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No, he stole away from Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But what would have happened if he had not fled from Laban in the way he did?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Laban would have exercised his power to detain his daughters and their maids and all their children.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He probably would have told Jacob, "Jacob, if you want to go, then go, but you must leave everyone and everything with me."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because Jacob feared this, he stole away.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although Jacob's way of leaving was not the right way, God allowed it to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because he was not yet mature, Jacob had a weak point.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why did Jacob not put his trust in God?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since God is all-powerful and all-capable, Jacob should have trusted Him to protect his wives and children.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is easy to talk about trusting God, but it is not easy to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Trusting God is not a doctrinal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you had been Jacob, would you have dared to go to Laban and say, "Uncle Laban, I am leaving"?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not easy to do this, for it requires the maturity of life and a measure of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to have the necessary measure of faith, we need the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jacob, however, did not have this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I do not condemn Jacob; rather, I wholly sympathize with him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many times we also have been placed in situations where we had no choice except to flee, to steal away.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It would be easy to rebuke Jacob for not leaving Laban publicly in an honorable and noble way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if we examine ourselves, we shall see that many times we have done things without letting our husbands or wives know about them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this chapter we are told that Jacob stole the heart of Laban v. 20, Heb . While Jacob stole Laban's heart inwardly, Rachel stole the household images outwardly v. 19 . Even among those God-fearing people there were still idols.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These were not the temple idols but the household idols, the idols which they worshipped in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because they were considered so important, Rachel stole them and Laban searched for them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not think that because Jacob was a saint called by God that he had an upright family.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Apparently some of us have a very proper family, but God knows that we still have some household images.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the Bible did not mention these idols, no one would have ever believed that Laban or Jacob had idols in his family.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But even Jacob's weakness in stealing Laban's heart was permitted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all make mistakes, but God can never be mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Certainly it was not noble of Jacob to run away, but even this was under God's permission.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not regret your mistakes, for even your mistakes work for your transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>None of us is absolutely honest, noble, faithful, or upright.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only the Lord Jesus is such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all have our weak points, our natural weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jacob fled from Laban because he was weak in faith and weak in the ability to sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps Jacob should have said, "Regardless of what I would lose, even if it would be my life, I must be honest with God."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is easy to say this, but try to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the time comes, you will also flee and steal another's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All our mistakes, even our wrongdoings, are under God's sovereignty, and He uses them to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now I am not encouraging you to make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I hope that you do not make any mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Forty years ago, I charged people not to make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But I no longer do this, because I realize that it is foolish to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However strongly I encourage you not to make mistakes, you will continue to make them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No one wants to make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I can testify that day after day and year after year, I have prayed to the Lord that He would keep me from making mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although I hate mistakes and have no intention of making them, I still have made some big mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What then is the use for me to charge others not to make mistakes?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If I were a teacher of ethics, I would command you not to make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But I am not a teacher of ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am one who is helping you to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In order to transform us, God will use our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I can testify that if I had not made certain mistakes, I would not be as transformed as I am today.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The greatest amount of transformation in my life has come about through my mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nothing troubles me more than my mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whenever I thought that I was all right, the Lord allowed me to make a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Nothing helps us to be transformed like our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This does not mean that I am saying that we should do evil that good may come.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No, if you intentionally make mistakes, those mistakes will not help your transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They will depress and condemn you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But as we try our best to avoid mistakes, we may pray, "O Lord, keep me in Your presence and never allow me to be mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Lord, I fear and tremble in Your presence."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although we may pray like this, after a period of time we may still make another mistake, and the Lord will sovereignly use it for our transformation.</S>
