   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE CHURCH 1 Scripture Reading: Psa 84:1-12; Matt 16:16-18; 18:15-17; Acts 8:1; Eph 1:22-23; 2:22; 4:24; 5:25-32; 6:11-13; Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; 21:10-14; 22:1-2, 16-17 HYMNS BEING EXPRESSIONS OF A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our hymns were written not according to our own ideas but according to the truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To explain the biblical truths is not an easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To express the truths in poems and lyrics requires even the more that we have a thorough understanding of the truths.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we desire to study and pursue the profound truths in the Bible, we must do it by using our hymnal along with the Bible and by being assisted by the life-studies and spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes even one line of a hymn is full of the riches of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I compiled our present hymnal in 1966.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You cannot find a hymnal in Christianity that is like our hymnal, which is so full of truths in its contents.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The table of contents alone occupies five pages, pointing out the sequence of the truths, so that by reading it, one can easily receive light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The study of this hymnal alone is the study of the highest theology in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To study the table of contents of our hymnal until we thoroughly understand it and find the basis of the biblical truth of each hymn would require at least four years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our spiritual books and life-studies are the expressions of the truths in written words, and hymns are the conversion of the words into poems and lyrics.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To compose hymns is to reach the peak, to arrive at the ultimate point, of the study of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the table of contents of our hymnal there is a category called "The Church."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It covers the church as the mystery of Christ, the increase of Christ, the fullness of Christ, the vessel of Christ, and the lampstand of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It also covers the church's general definition, course, faith, unity, foundation, building, attraction, coordination, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hymns, #824 is on the general definition of the church, whereas #852 is on the attraction of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps many of us have been in the church life for a number of years, yet we are still not clear about the definition of the church, nor do we know what kind of price we need to pay when we are attracted by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These two hymns reveal to us these two aspects of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I hope that we all can earnestly study the truths contained in our hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Bible, the Old Testament never mentions the church in plain words, but it contains the types of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the types in the Old Testament, on the one hand, the church is a woman to be a counterpart, and on the other hand, the church is a dwelling place for God to dwell in. Other than the lamb and the offerings, which are types of the Lord's redemption, most of the types in the Old Testament are concerned with these two aspects of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, the church is typified by a woman as the counterpart of God for His satisfaction; on the other hand, the church is typified by the tabernacle and the temple as the dwelling place of God for Him to dwell in.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Old Testament, the first type of the church as God's counterpart is Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eve, the wife of Adam, was formed of Adam's rib and thus had the same nature as Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then she was given back to Adam as his counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 5:14 says that Adam is a type of Him who was to come Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the marriage of Adam and Eve is a type of Christ taking the church as His wife.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church comes out of Christ, having the same nature as Christ, and is given back to Christ as Christ's counterpart, as revealed in Ephesians 5:25-32.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although the Old Testament does not mention the church in plain words, it portrays the church in typology in a perfectly clear and suitable manner.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Old Testament, the tabernacle and the temple are types of the church as God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Psalm 84 the psalmist tells us that he longs, even faints, for the courts of Jehovah, which are the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The function of God's dwelling place is not only for God's rest but also for His people's rest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is based upon this psalm that Hymns, #851 was written.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Old Testament time, the children of Israel sang of the dwelling place of God in psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that they had the subjective experience of the holy temple as God's dwelling place.</S>
