   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPLENDOR OF CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 3: "Thy people are voluntary offerings in the day of thy power."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The day of His power is to come.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In a sense it has not yet come, but in a spiritual sense we are now in the day of Christ's power.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As long as we are in the local churches, we are in the day of His power.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the day when all His people are voluntary offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all need to offer ourselves as voluntary offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Young lives offered in this way are exceedingly precious.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Are you a voluntary offering?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you mean it?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have another very significant phrase in verse 3: "in the splendor of consecration."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The "beauties of holiness" as in the King James Version should be translated "in the splendor of consecration."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we consecrate ourselves voluntarily to the Lord, it is a kind of beauty, a splendor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a recent conference in Los Angeles, the Spirit moved mightily among us, and so many stood to offer themselves in consecration to Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We had the sense then of the splendor of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The poetry in this Psalm is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 3: "Out of the womb of the morning shall come to thee the dew of thy youth."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Youth" here refers to young men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that all the young people who come to the Lord are just like the dew in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Out of the womb of the morning, young men will come as the dew to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is so refreshing to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Praise the Lord that so many young people today are coming to Christ as the dew of the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What a privilege they have in offering themselves to become the refreshing dew to Him!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whether we are old or young does not depend upon our physical age, but upon our spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have been to many places and have seen numerous "old" young people and numerous "young" old people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We love to see so many "young" old folks in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am among these young men as the dew to Christ out of the womb of the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am not of the womb of the night.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all need to be the voluntary offerings as a refreshing element to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CHRIST IS PRIEST, JUDGE, AND VlCTOR</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 4: "The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ is not only appointed to be the King, but also ordained as the Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is the King-priest: the King to rule over the nations, and the Priest according to the order of Melchizedek to care for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To understand fully the meaning of the order of Melchizedek, we must read Hebrews, chapters five, six, and seven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 5: "The Lord at thy right hand shall smite through kings in the day of his anger."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The "Lord" here is not Jehovah, as in verses 1 and 4, but "Adonai," which means simply "the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not God who is mentioned here, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ, at God's right hand, shall smite through kings in the day of His anger.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This day will come.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 6: "He shall judge among the nations, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall smite through the chief head over a broad land."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>See Psalm 2:10, 12; Daniel 2:44; Rev 17:12-14; 19:11-21.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All these verses show the fulfillment of all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He will smite through kings and His enemies in His anger, and He will judge among the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This will happen both at His coming back and at the end of His thousand year reign.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 7: "He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means, as in verse 3, that Christ also needs refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He needs both the dew in the morning and the fresh water in the way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"Therefore shall he lift up the head."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What is this water of the brook from which Christ drinks?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not forget that this is poetry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to the context of the entire Psalm, the brook mentioned here must be the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>While Christ is on His way, while He is fighting through to defeat His enemies, He needs refreshment; He needs a living fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is our living water, and we are His drink.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is our refreshment, and we are His refreshment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are the dew to Him in the morning, and we are the brook to Him in the daytime, while He is on His way to fight with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I do believe deeply within my spirit that this is right.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ is riding on and riding through triumphantly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>And on His way, He needs you, He needs me, He needs all of us as a kind of refreshment to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are the dew and the refreshing water to Christ, so that He may lift up His head.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Are you willing to be as the dew and as the brook?</S>
