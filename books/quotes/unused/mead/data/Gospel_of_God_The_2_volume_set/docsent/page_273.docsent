   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was never provoked to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is completely free.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Tonight we cannot say this for ourselves, for we are not free people.</S>

   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have been provoked by sin and are not our own masters.</S>
