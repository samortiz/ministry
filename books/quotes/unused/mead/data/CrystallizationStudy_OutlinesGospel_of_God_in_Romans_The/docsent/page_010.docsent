   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The human spirit of the believers is the believers spirit regenerated and indwelt by the divine Spirit of life and mingled with the divine Spirit of life as one spirit; it is through such a human spirit that the people chosen by God participate in the dynamic salvation of God as their living in this age and their destiny in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the Spirit...with our spirit in verse 16 of Romans 8 the key chapter of the book of Romans concerning the Spirit of life and the spirit of the believers is the most crucial secret in the whole book of Romans for God to execute His dynamic salvation and for the believers to participate in it.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>14-15: The spirit of sonship is our regenerated human spirit, mingled with the Spirit of the Son of God.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The mutual membership and organic relatedness in the Body for the proper church life is the ultimate work of the Spirit of life and the Spirit of the Son of God for our sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The key point of the entire Christian life is that Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit lives in our spirit, and as the Spirit He mingles Himself with our spirit to make these two spirits one 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17: In our mingled spirit there is no problem, so there is no need of solutions; whatever we need is in our spirit Phil 1:19; 4:23.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to be burning in spirit by praying in order to spend more and more time in the presence of the Lord; when we are genuinely burning in spirit, we are beside ourselves and are fools because of Christ Matt 6:6; 2 Cor 5:13; 1 Cor 4:10.</S>
