   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We need to ask ourselves what we are seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today's religious system with its traditions is a big problem to many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, Christianity seemingly brings people to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But on the other hand, it also becomes a barrier, a hindrance, keeping people from the inner experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The many Christian activities, Christian works, and Christian programs on the one hand bring people to Christ, but on the other hand keep people from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They bring people to Christ up to a certain point.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then they become a barrier, a limitation, a hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even the desire to be spiritual can become something that takes the ground in our being to replace Christ Himself I have seen some who take care of being "spiritual" more than the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need many conversions from everything other than the living Christ Himself</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Another conversion that I experienced was related to my love for the study of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After I was saved, I loved to study the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Word was so sweet to me, just like honey.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I was a young believer, I would take the Bible to bed with me so I could look at it as soon as I awoke in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, this love to study the Word became something taking the ground of Christ in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I loved the study of the Word much more than Christ Himself Many times I had the anointing and the burden to pray, but because I was addicted to the study of the Word, I would not give up this study to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually and sovereignly, the Lord intervened and now I dare not study the Word in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was also very fond of teaching the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I loved to interpret and expound the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now I have to take care of the limitation within me whenever I give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even this matter can become something between you and the Lord Himself Now I am careful not to go beyond what the Lord is speaking in me 2 Cor 13:3 and what He needs me to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There could be many things in our life which take the place of the Lord Himself My burden is to fellowship with you and help you to realize that God's plan is to work Christ Himself into you Gal 1:16; 2:20; 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is God's goal, His ultimate intention.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not think God's intention is to make you merely spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even spirituality might become something in you that is in contradiction to God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The work for the Lord, the activities in Christianity, the progress for the gospel, and so many other good things could possibly be a hindrance, a substitute for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You need to be converted all the time from something other than Christ to Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever anything becomes a hindrance between you and Christ, you have to be converted from that to Christ Himself</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I knew some sisters who loved to fellowship with other sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This kind of fellowship eventually became a hindrance between them and the Lord and took the place of the Lord in their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They loved this kind of fellowship more than Christ Himself With these sisters there was the need to be converted, not from anything sinful but from this good fellowship to Christ Himself You have to consider whether or not something in your life is taking the place of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Is something in your life more important than Christ Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If so, you have to be converted from this very thing to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Regeneration is a conversion, but a conversion to us Christians is not just once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need many conversions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Anything, no matter how good it might be, can become a hindrance, a barrier between you and Christ, taking the place of Christ in your life and substituting Christ in your life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>May we all be converted from everything other than Christ to the living Person of Christ Himself</S>
