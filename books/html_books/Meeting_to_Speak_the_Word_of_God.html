<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>The messages contained in this book and in two related books entitled <em>The Full Knowledge of the Word of God</em> and <em>Everyone Speaking the Word of God</em> were given in October, 1985 in Taipei, Taiwan during a training in which the author spoke three times daily. These messages have been translated from the Chinese.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>

</ol>
<p>I would like all of you to know that this training is not just to train the elders, or the co-workers, or the full-timers, but this training is to train all the brothers and sisters. The intention in this training is to tear down hierarchy and eliminate class structure among us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONE SPEAKING WITH MANY LISTENING<br />
PRODUCING A &ldquo;SUNDAY SERVICE&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Chapter fourteen of 1 Corinthians says that whenever we come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation (v. 26). &ldquo;Has&rdquo; is used five times here; five is the number for responsibility. What each one has is not definitely set. In following the Spirit, nothing is definitely set. Nevertheless, we have to be responsible to prepare. Only when we have fallen into a degraded condition will the meeting follow a set pattern. Forgive me for exposing your weakness. The concept of rank, the thought of class structure, this way of taking the lead&mdash;these things have entered into our blood. We are too accustomed to depending on the leading ones to direct the meeting.</p>
<p>In church history, the matter that is most condemned by the Lord is the matter of the Nicolaitans, which later developed into religious organization. For example, in Catholicism the pope is at the top; under the pope are the cardinals; under the cardinals are the archbishops and bishops; and under the bishops are more levels. This is religious organization.</p>
<p>Among us it seems that there is no religious organization, but the germ is still here. In our concept, a meeting is led by the elders with a few co-workers. Then what do the rest of the brothers and sisters come to do? They come to do nothing, because the leading ones and the responsible ones are present. When prayer is needed, someone will do it. When a message is needed, even the more, there are the experts who will do it. So the brothers and sisters have nothing to do except to sit there, producing a &ldquo;Sunday service.&rdquo; Some look around, some look at the ceiling, and some stare at the floor. A carpenter produces chairs, a shoe factory produces shoes, and a &ldquo;church&rdquo; with its pastor and congregation produces a &ldquo;Sunday service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I describe these situations to show you that the Lord&rsquo;s church on the earth has degraded to such an extent. Christians come to the meetings and sit motionless in their chairs. It seems as if their tongues have been cut off, their teeth have fallen out, their lips have been removed, and even their vocal chords have become mute. Do not think that I am joking. If you come to the meetings without opening your mouth, allowing only one person to speak while the rest listen, you are producing a &ldquo;Sunday service.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THE LORD&rsquo;S PEOPLE BEING PROPHETS</h2>
<p>I have been studying the Bible for sixty years, but there is one verse that I noticed only very recently. This verse is Numbers 11:29, where Moses said, &ldquo;Would God that all the Lord&rsquo;s people were prophets.&rdquo; Those who translated the Chinese version did not dare to translate it exactly as &ldquo;all...were prophets&rdquo;; rather, they translated &ldquo;all...were prophets&rdquo; into &ldquo;all...were inspired to speak.&rdquo; If you knew Hebrew, you would see that the original meaning is &ldquo;all the Lord&rsquo;s people were prophets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prophet mentioned in this verse is not what we usually think of as a prophet, that is, one who predicts the future. In the book of Isaiah, which has a total of sixty-six chapters, all the portions of prediction added together do not exceed six chapters. There are still another sixty chapters that are not predictions but speaking for God. The primary qualification for being a prophet is not predicting, but speaking for God and speaking forth God. This was what the prophet Isaiah did and what the prophet Jeremiah also did, that is, speaking for God and speaking forth God.</p><h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING ONE BY ONE</h2>
<p>Those who translated the Bible into Chinese translated 1 Corinthians 14:31 as, &ldquo;For you can all be prophets to teach.&rdquo; &ldquo;To teach&rdquo; still has the old flavor of religion. Our Chinese Recovery Version has gone a step further by translating it into &ldquo;prophesy to speak.&rdquo; Over ten years ago in the United States, based on this portion of the Bible I said, &ldquo;We can all be apostles, evangelists, and teachers; we are all speakers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:23-25 says, &ldquo;If therefore the whole church comes together in one place...But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all...and so falling on his face, he will worship God, reporting that God is really among you.&rdquo; Perhaps you would argue with me that Paul said &ldquo;if&rdquo; all prophesy. That is right. However, if it were not possible for all to prophesy, how could Paul speak this word? Hence, if we read the context, we would see that it was Paul&rsquo;s desire that when the whole church comes together in one place, all would prophesy. If some gospel friends come to our meeting tonight and see the meeting hall full of saints upstairs and downstairs all standing up to prophesy one by one, they would be completely subdued by what they see and hear.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WHATEVER FALLS BELOW THE STANDARD<br />
OF THE BIBLE BEING DEGRADED</h2>
<p>Twenty-eight years ago in Taipei, five leading ones from Christianity came to see me. They said, &ldquo;It is a very serious matter that you speak of Christianity as &lsquo;degraded Christianity.&rsquo;&rdquo; Right away I checked with them, &ldquo;If today&rsquo;s Christianity is not degraded, then what is degraded?&rdquo; My speaking of degraded Christianity is not for the ears of the outsiders. Including ourselves, whatever falls below the standard of the Bible is degraded. Today, all of Christianity is degraded, and we also have become accustomed to degradation. We have the Lord&rsquo;s life and the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit, and we read His Word daily. How can we come to the meeting without saying a word? Is this not a great miracle? I do not like to speak unpleasant words, but I speak in this way because I love you&mdash;and not only because I love you, but because I have a burden within me. This burden causes me to exhaust my entire being, even unto death. This burden causes me grief and makes it difficult for me to sleep or eat well.</p>
<p>In the beginning of September there was a special meeting in the San Francisco Bay area. On the weekend the young people of the seven churches in the area invited me to attend their evening love feast. I went there happily. I was rejoicing within to see the entire room filled with young people. I thought that I could at least rest and enjoy for two hours. However, to my surprise, suddenly a leading brother in one of the localities, who is also a co-worker in the Bay area, stood up to call a hymn. Since I knew them quite well and did not need to be so polite, I quickly got his attention and said, &ldquo;What are you doing? Are you taking the lead?&rdquo; Then I turned to the young people and asked, &ldquo;Whose meeting is this?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;This is our meeting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That day I purposely wanted to show everyone that the elders and co-workers should not do this anymore. Since the young people initiated that love feast, why did we need co-workers to call hymns? This is like a big family where the elderly father has been in charge for so long that even when the son is fifty-eight years old, having grandsons of his own, the elderly father is still the one who handles all the family problems. Once he appears, who would dare to say anything? After hearing this the young people in the Bay area responded, &ldquo;We have failed today. Let us try again tomorrow.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Very good!&rdquo; This is why I like young people. When they fail, they will try it all over again. Then I asked, &ldquo;How long has this brother who made the announcement for another love feast tomorrow been saved?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;He was saved three months ago.&rdquo; This is marvelous! Someone who had been saved for only three months was already taking the lead.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF THE LORD<br />
GROWING MIGHTILY AND PREVAILING</h2>
<p>A Christian meeting is not a &ldquo;Sunday service&rdquo;&mdash;it is like a basketball game. Since we come to the meeting to &ldquo;play ball,&rdquo; the first thing we should do is to put on the uniform. Second, we need to be in position, ready to play. What is the &ldquo;ball&rdquo; in a meeting? It is speaking. We meet to speak the word of God. We do not meet merely to speak, but we meet to speak the word of God. If we come together merely to talk, there is no need for me to labor so much to teach you. On the way to the meeting, have you not been talking constantly? You have talked all the way up to the door of the meeting hall, but when the meeting is about to begin, all the mouths close. We come to the meeting to speak the word of God. Brothers and sisters, do you know how to speak the word of God? Are you able to speak the word of God? Do you want to speak the word of God? Do you love to speak the word of God? I hope that from today our meetings will have a change.</p>
<p>If you would all come to the meetings to speak the word of God, then my burden would be released. Do not think that I am too much. Today&rsquo;s Christianity is short of the word of God. Much of what you can hear in a &ldquo;church&rdquo; building are stories and parables. Everyone laughs heartily and then goes home. Perhaps you will say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord, there is so much speaking in the church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery!&rdquo; It is true that in the church the Lord&rsquo;s speaking is abundant. However, I would like to ask, Do you speak the word of God? Would you speak the word of God? Can you speak the word of God? Do you love to speak the word of God?</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Key to a Home Meeting&mdash;<br />
Everyone Speaking the Word of God</h2>
<p>The key to having a good home meeting is to have everyone speak the word of God. If each one in the home meeting speaks the word of God, this meeting will surely grow with much increase in numbers. Recently, a leading brother in Anaheim told me that he had counted the occurrences of the term &ldquo;the word of God&rdquo; in the book of Acts and found that it is mentioned more than &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Acts at least three times it is said that &ldquo;the word of the Lord grew.&rdquo; Acts 19:20 says, &ldquo;The word of the Lord grew mightily and was strong.&rdquo; Although the Lord&rsquo;s word is rich in His recovery, we cannot say that the Lord&rsquo;s word has been propagated through us nor that the word of the Lord is growing and is strong or prevailing. The reason that it is not prevailing is that you do not speak the word of God and others do not speak the word of God. Nearly no one speaks. Only the elders and the co-workers speak a little. With only a few speaking, it is difficult for the word of God to grow mightily and prevail.</p>
<p>Suppose the four thousand brothers and sisters who meet with us regularly in the church in Taipei all speak every day, everywhere, and at all times. When you see people, speak to them. If there are no people available, speak to the cats, the dogs, the flowers, and the grass. Just keep speaking. Speak to the angels. Speak to the Devil. If everyone speaks unceasingly, do you not think that the word of God will grow in Taipei? In the past years it is not as if we have not preached the gospel. We preached the gospel every year, and people were saved and baptized every year. But why were there not many who remained? We kept delivering babies, yet the survival rate was not high. This should alert us to thoroughly change our ways. Our supplying the word of the Lord must be divided into different levels with different teaching materials at each level. In this way, thousands of young people can be sustained and fed. From now on, our service is to labor on the word of God. We all need to learn to play this ball game.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Moving When Everyone Speaks</h2>
<p>From now on I hope that all the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery on the island of Taiwan would practice this, that is, that everyone would speak the word of God as soon as he arrives at the meeting. No one should wait for the leading brothers to arrive. The young ones, as well as the older ones, should learn to speak the word of God. The elders and the co-workers should never replace others. To replace others is to have class structure. There should be no replacing among us. We have many &ldquo;players,&rdquo; with some older ones and some younger ones. If twelve hundred saints come to the meeting, these twelve hundred should all be players. Once you come, play the ball one by one, each proclaiming the word of God.</p>
<p>Our meetings should not have any form. A particular meeting could be started by anyone. Whoever comes first should begin to play the ball game. You may pray-read, sing a hymn, or stand up to speak something. You may say, &ldquo;No one is here yet. To whom will I speak?&rdquo; You can speak to the meeting hall, &ldquo;O Lord! Fully sanctify this meeting hall. Anoint every seat so that whoever sits on it will touch You, will sense Your presence.&rdquo; Brothers and sisters, we do not realize how much we have been poisoned by religion. The New Testament did not tell us to sit still in the meeting and wait quietly for the pastor to arrive. On the contrary, 1 Corinthians 14:26 says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.&rdquo; It says that we should not wait for others to bring something, but everyone &ldquo;has&rdquo; something.</p>
<p>At Paul&rsquo;s time, if there were five hundred Corinthian believers gathered together, do you think that they would all arrive at the same time like an army troop? Of course not. It must have been that some came early, &ldquo;had&rdquo; a psalm, and began singing it. The ancient psalms might not have been numbered, so they would just begin singing whichever one came to their mind. In this way they would start the meeting. Then a few sisters would arrive and join the singing even before they sat down. Then a few more saints would arrive, and, hearing the singing from downstairs, they would also start to sing. How wonderful, living, and fresh such a meeting would be, and how the Spirit would be flowing out!</p><h2 class="head2">Having the Word First, Then the Spirit</h2>
<p>I would like to ask, Which do you have first, the Spirit or the word? I tell you that first you have the word, and then you have the Spirit. The electric current runs from the power plant to the meeting hall. I ask you, Do you first have electricity, or do you first have the cables? You cannot say that, since there is no electricity in a certain place, there is no need to install any cables; neither can you say that, since there is no current, it would be a waste to install cables. To say this seems reasonable, but you need to know that if you do not speak, the Spirit will not move.</p>
<p>Especially we Chinese have been taught from our youth not to talk very much in public. Remember the Chinese sayings: &ldquo;Sickness comes from what you eat; calamities come from what you speak,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t embarrass yourself if you have no goods,&rdquo; and &ldquo;For a person like you, to speak is just to lose face.&rdquo; Consequently, we have developed a habit of listening to others. We have become dumb in public. If tonight, I would only look at you and you would only look at me, with no one speaking, how could the Spirit move? But on the contrary, suppose that one by one everyone here would speak. As soon as one person would speak the Spirit would move, and when another would speak the Spirit would come. The Spirit would be prevailing here and we would all ascend to the heavens. How wonderful that would be!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROOF OF THE SCRIPTURE</h2>
<p>Acts 5:42 proves that meeting is for speaking the word of God: &ldquo;And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ.&rdquo; To teach is simply to speak the word of God. As long as you speak the word of God, you are teaching, even if you have no intention to teach. You are not only teaching, but you are also preaching the gospel of Jesus as the Christ. Teaching is speaking; preaching is also speaking. They taught and they preached. Every day they met from house to house doing just this one thing&mdash;speaking the word of God, which is simply teaching and preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>The second instance which proves that meeting is for speaking the word of God is found in 1 Corinthians 14:23-24: &ldquo;If therefore the whole church comes together in one place, and...all prophesy.&rdquo; Paul said, &ldquo;All prophesy.&rdquo; This means that everyone in the church can speak the word of God.</p>
<p>The third verse which proves that meeting is for speaking the word of God is 1 Corinthians 14:26: &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Each one&rdquo; here means not just a few, but everyone. Everyone has a psalm. Ephesians 5:19 says, &ldquo;Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; A psalm is not merely for singing; it is for speaking, even speaking to one another. Speak to one another, not in common talk nor merely in Scripture verses, but in psalms.</p>
<p>The fourth proof that meeting is for speaking the word of God is in Hebrews 10:25, which says, &ldquo;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together...but exhorting one another.&rdquo; All those who meet regularly are very impressed by &ldquo;not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together,&rdquo; yet very few have the concept of &ldquo;exhorting one another&rdquo; in the meetings. The Lord&rsquo;s word here indicates that exhorting is a mutual matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Not only is there proof from the Bible, but the Spirit also manifests that the meeting is for speaking the word of God. First Corinthians 12:8-10 says, &ldquo;For to one through the Spirit is given a word of wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge...and to another prophecy...to a different one various kinds of tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues.&rdquo; Nine items are mentioned in these verses. Among them five are a matter of speaking. The first two are the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge. The last two are tongues and the interpretation of tongues. The most crucial items among the nine are the first two: the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge. We all have to dig into the Word of God. When you dig deeper, you will not only gain the word of knowledge but also the word of wisdom.</p>
<p>I hope that the fellowship in this message has given you a deep impression that our coming to the meeting is for speaking the word of God. Only by everyone speaking the word of God in the meeting can clerical rank and religious organization among us be torn down. Only by everyone speaking the word of God can death, tradition, and habitual ways of doing things thoroughly be eradicated from among us. This all depends on our rising up one by one to speak the word of God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

<p>Hymn #791 in our hymnal is very suitable for the new way of meeting today. In this hymn there are three important points. The first point is to burn the incense, that is, to pray. The second point is to light the lamp, that is, to be enlightened by the word in the Bible, or to read the Word. The third point is to sing praises to the Lord. In the Chinese version of this hymn, the last phrase of the chorus can also be rendered &ldquo;Always speaking before the Lord.&rdquo; However, in the Chinese there is a unique rhyme throughout the entire hymn, and if the word &ldquo;praising&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;speaking,&rdquo; the rhyme is spoiled. I point this out to you to show you that concerning the things of the Lord, we need to study more.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING RAISED UP BY THE LORD<br />
AND NOT NEEDING ANY NAME</h2>
<p>The hymns we are using were first edited by Brother Nee, who selected them from ten thousand hymns used in Christianity. In the beginning the number of selected hymns was less than one hundred, and the number later increased to one hundred and thirty-three. In 1966 I felt that this number was not adequate; therefore, I added two hundred more, most of them emphasizing six categories: the Spirit, life, Christ, the church, prayer, and the reading of the Word.</p>
<p>Among those hymns related to Christ, the ones I like the best are hymn #501, &ldquo;O glorious Christ, Savior mine&rdquo;; hymn #499, &ldquo;Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!&rdquo;; and hymn #539, &ldquo;O Lord, Thou art in me as life and everything to me!&rdquo; After singing these hymns, I am full of enjoyment, touching the Spirit and receiving the life supply. Where can you find this kind of hymn among Christians today?</p>
<p>In this message we will look at a special topic that has not been covered before, that is, &ldquo;The Nature and Characteristic of a Meeting of the Believers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everything has its own nature and, therefore, its own characteristic. Nature is inward and characteristic is outward. A meeting of the believers also has its nature and characteristic. For example, Matthew 18:20 says, &ldquo;For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst.&rdquo; The Brethren use this verse as the foundation of their meetings. They say that the Lutheran church meets in the name of Luther, the Methodist church meets in the name of John Wesley, and the Presbyterian church meets in the name of the elders. The Bible tells us not to meet in other names. Hence, today we meet in one unique name, that is, the name of Jesus Christ. The Brethren considered that the denominations were not scriptural; therefore, they forsook them and did not take any name. When we were raised up by the Lord, we also saw the light from the Brethren and did not take any name ourselves.</p>
<p>In 1938, I went back to Cheefoo from Tien Tsien. Each of seven denominations in Cheefoo selected a representative to invite me for dinner. They said to me at the table, &ldquo;Brother Lee, we thank the Lord that He is using you greatly. Your preaching is very helpful. However, there is one thing that we disagree with. You have been speaking that the Body of Christ is one, that the church is one, and that all Christians should be one and should not be divided. We all agree with this truth. However, we cannot understand why you take the lead to create a division while you tell others not to make divisions. You took those who have accepted your teachings and formed another denomination. Your deeds do not match your words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;You all are my elders. I have longed for this opportunity to discuss this matter with you. In chapter one of 1 Corinthians, Paul spoke to the Corinthians, saying, &lsquo;Each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ. Has Christ been divided?&rsquo; At that time, they were only divided into groups and not yet into the denominations of Paul, of Apollos, of Cephas, and of Christ. While they were still the church in Corinth, Paul rebuked them. If Paul were here today seeing so many denominations&mdash;the Presbyterian church, the Inner China group, the Baptist church, the Seventh Day Adventists, the Church of Christ&mdash;would Paul approve of this?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeing the Light concerning the Church<br />
and Practicing the Truth of the Church</h2>
<p>They responded with sincerity, saying, &ldquo;Of course, Paul would not have approved of this.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;If Paul would not approve of it, why are there still denominations here? In reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word I saw the light, and I knew that I could not go to any denomination. At the same time, by the Lord&rsquo;s grace I preached the gospel, and some were saved. Let me ask you, to which denomination should I bring them after they have believed in the Lord? I would not have peace in my conscience to bring the saved ones to places where I myself could not go. I have no other way but to rent a room and to meet with them. We do not have a name; we only have a place to meet. As we meet, we are waiting for you to put aside your denominations; then we will be one. You are representatives of different denominations. If you promise to take down the names of your denominations, I promise that I will go back immediately and tell the brothers, &lsquo;Close the door! We will meet together with them.&rsquo;&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;It is impossible for us to do this.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Since you cannot do it, who will bear the responsibility of division? Truth is truth, and fact is fact; do you not obey the truth?&rdquo; They were silent.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord, light is light, and truth is truth. From 1952 until now, I have been proclaiming this truth, from my home town of Cheefoo, to Chin-Dao, to Shanghai, to Taiwan, to Southeast Asia, to the United States, to South America, to Europe, and to Australia. Today I received a letter from Australia, saying, &ldquo;Brother Lee, would you seek the Lord concerning your coming to Australia to have a conference with us? This will greatly benefit the Lord&rsquo;s move in Australia.&rdquo; This letter was signed by the leading brothers of twelve local churches in Australia. In Australia there are already twelve local churches. In Ghana, Africa, there are also a number of churches.</p>
<p>For thirty years I have been proclaiming the truth concerning the church. The more I proclaim this truth, the bolder I become. Throughout all these years I have never changed my tone. In 1949 I went to Taiwan under the arrangement of the work. At that time there were only two or three churches there. Altogether there were fewer than ninety churches, including the churches in Southeast Asia&mdash;in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. Today, thirty-six years later, the Lord has raised up more than five hundred additional churches in six continents. Now there are over six hundred churches. We do not have mission boards; neither do we have missionaries, pastors, Bible colleges, or fund-raising programs. When I went to the United States of America I went empty-handed.</p><h2 class="head2">The Fellowship between East and West<br />
Causing the Lord&rsquo;s Body to Be Living</h2>
<p>The brothers in the West thought that I, as a well-known evangelist, had friends all over the world, and therefore that I must have been receiving financial support. At the same time, the brothers in Taiwan considered the United States as a land of gold, and since I was there, there was no need for them to support me. At the beginning of 1965 I asked a brother who was an accountant to file my 1964 income tax return. It is difficult to imagine that, under his investigation, the offerings that I had received from the church in Los Angeles that year were less than eight hundred U.S. dollars. This amount was just enough to cover one month&rsquo;s living expenses. Perhaps you would ask what I lived on for the remaining eleven months. Of course, I did not steal or rob; I just lived. I did not starve; rather, I ate well. Now, in the hand of this ministry there are two large ministry stations, one in Anaheim, California and the other in Irving, Texas. The property value of each is approximately four to five million dollars. This is all the Lord&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to give a testimony. Because the truth I brought to the United States was fresh and new, some became jealous, saying, &ldquo;Can anything good come out of Nazareth? In the past, American missionaries went to China to preach the gospel. Yet today, an old Chinese is here to teach us Americans.&rdquo; I began the Lord&rsquo;s work in America at the end of 1962. It was a good start. The local churches were flourishing, and I was invited to speak in one place after another. Wherever I went I was told the same thing: &ldquo;Brother Lee, in the past it was the Americans who went to China. Today, it is the Chinese who come here to America.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that proper? Isn&rsquo;t that the case with the circulation of the blood in the body? It flows from the left side to the right side and from the right to the left; from the top to the bottom and vice versa. In the past the Lord flowed from the West to the East; today, why should He not flow back from the East to the West? Without circulation, the body becomes dead; with circulation, the body becomes living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a conference in December 1962 I spoke from Deuteronomy 8:7-9 concerning the all-inclusive Christ. Once these messages were released, the eyes of the Americans were opened. They invited me from all over. I went from the East Coast to the West Coast, from the South to the North. Through this the Lord gained a group of people who truly loved Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BECOME FAMILIAR<br />
WITH THE HYMNS AND THE TRUTHS,<br />
AND THE NEED TO HAVE SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES</h2>
<p>This evening I purposely set up this meeting as a pattern so that you might see that a meeting does not need to be conducted in a formal way and that it does not need to have a sermon. I feel that this meeting tonight is quite sweet. At the beginning of the meeting we sang three hymns. Then I mentioned that the denominations invited me for dinner and that I challenged them concerning the truth. I have the boldness and perseverance because what I preach is the truth. I proclaimed the truth all over China as well as in the United States, and I desire to proclaim it all over the world. This truth cannot be put down. Then at the end of the meeting I gave a testimony.</p>
<p>What do you think about such a meeting with hymns, truth, and testimonies? Do you think it is good or not? If you desire to have such a meeting, you need to have some capital. Suppose those three hymns were never written; or suppose that they were written, but that you do not know how to sing them, or that you can sing them, yet you do not have the understanding. If this were the case, there would not be any response within you. Then I used a kindergarten teaching method to give a message concerning the truth of the church. This kind of speaking seems quite shallow, but to speak in this way is not so simple. Finally, I gave a testimony. I want you to see that to have a meeting requires capital. First, you need to be familiar with the hymns; second, you need to be equipped with the truth; and third, you need to have spiritual experiences. Having these three things, you may use them in whatever way you like. A meeting with hymns, truth, and testimonies will surely be living, fresh, and rich.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PARTICULAR NATURE<br />
OF A MEETING OF THE BELIEVERS&mdash;<br />
BEING GATHERED INTO THE NAME OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Now we need to consider the nature of a meeting of the believers. According to the meaning in the original Greek text, the most accurate translation of Matthew 18:20 is, &ldquo;For where two or three are gathered together into My name, there I am in their midst.&rdquo; Generally this verse is translated, &ldquo;For where two or three meet together in My name.&rdquo; Apparently it is we who take the initiative, but actually it is the Lord who takes the initiative. It is He who gathers us into His name.</p>
<p>We all have the experience of being reluctant to come to the meeting. At such a time, either some brothers or sisters may call you on the telephone to remind you of the meeting, or some saints may come to your house to invite you to the meeting. The fact that you come to the meeting is actually not your own doing but the Lord&rsquo;s. In this evil generation, who would want to go out in the evening? Who would not want to stay home and watch television? Who would want to come from a distance for a meeting and sit for one to two hours? Who brought us here? It is the Lord. He is the One who gathers us together. We are gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name. In every meeting the Lord digs us out of everything that is not of Himself and gathers us into His name.</p>
<p>In the principle of the New Testament, the name denotes the person. The name is the person. To be gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name is simply to be gathered into the Lord Himself. At home we are always occupied. The sisters are busy washing dishes and taking care of the children; the brothers are also busy at the office. When it is time for the meeting, the Lord digs us out of everything and gathers us into Himself to meet together. This is the nature of our meeting.</p>
<p>After reading Matthew 16 and 18, we can see that in chapter sixteen is the revelation and in chapter eighteen is the practice. In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, &ldquo;On this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; This denotes the universal church, while the church mentioned in chapter eighteen is the local church. Matthew 18:15-17 says that if there is a brother who sins against you and does not confess his wrongdoing, then take with you two or three witnesses. If he refuses to hear them, then tell it to the church. In the practice of the local church, whenever two or three are gathered together into the Lord&rsquo;s name, the Lord is in their midst. Some may ask, &rdquo;Is it all right to have only four meeting together?&rdquo; I would answer, &ldquo;Four already exceeds the required number; the Lord said &lsquo;two or three.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For example, suppose there is a saved couple who does not have a neighbor or anyone else in their home before the meeting. As the wife is washing dishes and disciplining the children, the husband may be angry with his wife&rsquo;s disciplining. When the time comes for the home meeting, the husband may look at the wife, and the wife may look at the husband. Then the wife may stop washing dishes and stop disciplining the children, while the husband may also calm down. They then may go to the living room and sit down. Initially, there may be a little reluctance; however, they may begin to pray. The husband may say, &ldquo;Lord, though we are not good, we can still come to meet.&rdquo; The wife may follow, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I am really sorry, but no matter what happens, by Your grace we can still meet here.&rdquo; This is being gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name. In such a situation, the Lord will surely be in their midst. How could the Lord not be in their midst? They have been dug out from all things and brought into the Lord Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHARACTERISTIC OF A MEETING<br />
OF THE BELIEVERS&mdash;MUTUALITY AND SPEAKING</h2>
<p>The characteristic of a Christian meeting is, first, mutuality, and second, speaking. Speaking in mutuality is not talking about common things but speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and exhorting one another. Mutuality is not one-sided. It is not only one speaking, but everyone speaking. You speak to me and I speak to you. This is the characteristic of a Christian meeting.</p>
<p>The big meetings in today&rsquo;s Christianity are not proper. This is not God&rsquo;s ordained way for the saints to meet. God&rsquo;s ordained way of meeting has a characteristic, that is, speaking to one another in mutuality (Eph. 5:19), exhorting one another (Heb. 10:25). Speaking to one another is speaking, while exhorting is also speaking. In a proper Christian meeting each one has a psalm, a teaching, or a revelation (1 Cor. 14:26). These are all speaking. The teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ in Acts 5:42 are also speaking. When believers gather together without speaking, the characteristic of a meeting of the believers is gone. However, when everyone cannot wait to speak, the characteristic of a meeting is manifested.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LETTING THE WORD OF CHRIST<br />
DWELL IN US RICHLY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 3:16; Eph. 5:18; 2 Cor. 4:11, 13, 9</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman" start="3">
<li>Letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly, that we may be ready to speak in the meetings&mdash;Col. 3:16.</li>
<li>Being filled in spirit, speaking the word of God&mdash;Eph. 5:18-19.</li>
<li>Speaking the word of God according to the experience of life&mdash;2 Cor. 4:11, 13.</li>
</ol>
<p>I do not know what kind of response the brothers and sisters have had to the previous two messages concerning the matter of speaking for the Lord. We ought to speak for the Lord to the extent that we speak everywhere: at home, at school, in the office, and even the more in the meetings.</p>
<p>If what we speak is merely doctrine, eventually we will run out of words. That is, there will be nothing left to say it will all have been said and exhausted. However, God&rsquo;s word can never be exhausted by speaking. Our teaching can never be exhausted. Heaven and earth are on our side. The more we speak, the more teaching we have. But although we do have the teaching, I am afraid that we do not have words to express it. Without the proper vocabulary, we cannot adequately expound it. We will speak and speak, stammering, unable to fully express it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF CHRIST BEING A LIVING PERSON</h2>
<p>The Bible is complete. In Colossians Paul says that Christ is the Head (2:19), the portion of the saints in the light (1:12), the image of the invisible God (1:15), the Firstborn of all creation (1:15), the Firstborn of the new creation (1:18), the Head of the church (1:18), the mystery of God (2:2), and the embodiment of God (2:9). Then, in chapter three Paul says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom&rdquo; (v. 16). The word &ldquo;let&rdquo; is very significant, and the word &ldquo;dwell&rdquo; is also very meaningful. You cannot let a table dwell in you. You cannot even say that you let a dog dwell in your house. The word &ldquo;dwell&rdquo; is a verb of dignity, proving that Paul regarded the Lord&rsquo;s word as a living person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rdquo; implies that this living word is waiting outside your heart, knocking on the door of your heart as a guest would knock on the door of your house. When you hear the knocking, you let him in. To let the word of Christ dwell in us richly means that this word is living, waiting outside the door of our heart for us to welcome Him and to let Him in. If we let Him in, the word of Christ will make home in us.</p>
<p>The Chinese version of the Bible translates this verse, &ldquo;Store the doctrine of Christ in your heart richly.&rdquo; In this translation the word is something dead; it is fully under the control of man. If the word is something lifeless, it is like money that you can either put in your pocket or save in the bank. However, you cannot treat a living person in this way. You must let him come in and let him settle down in your house.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD WITHIN US<br />
BEING ABLE TO DISPLAY HIS RICHES</h2>
<p>Paul says that we should let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. This is consistent with the Bible&rsquo;s teaching that the word of the Lord is the Lord Himself (John 1:1). Strictly speaking, to believe in the Lord is to directly receive the word of the Lord. To believe in the Lord is to believe in the word of the Lord. The word of the Lord is the Lord Himself, and it is the Spirit (Eph. 6:17). Therefore, the word of the Lord is spirit and life (John 6:63).</p>
<p>This living word is an entity of life; it is a person with life. He is waiting for us to let Him in. He is waiting for us to open the door. His living in us richly depends on whether or not we exercise wisdom. If we use wisdom, then He can dwell in us richly; if we do not use wisdom, then He will dwell in us poorly. During the past number of years, I have been like a wandering sojourner on the earth, like a leaf floating on the water. I have traveled through many places in the world. I have had much experience in being a guest, and I have stayed with virtually every kind of family. No home, whether it is the home of a high and famous official or the home of a poor and lowly man, can compare with my own home. This is because I cannot dwell in another person&rsquo;s home; I can only dwell there in a restricted way. As a guest, I cannot bring too many things with me. Even if I do bring many things, sometimes it is not convenient to use them. At other times I do not even have space to put my things. How can this compare with dwelling in my own home?</p>
<p>To dwell richly is a matter of being able to display everything. In my home all my books are displayed. All my reference books are valuable books that I have accumulated over several decades. I have over fifty English translations of the Bible and eight Chinese translations, as well as many dictionaries of various sizes. In my home it is very convenient for me to use them. Therefore, I dwell in my home richly. I use this illustration to show you that the Lord does not dwell in us richly because we have given Him too little space.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE EXERCISE OF WISDOM<br />
IN LETTING THE LORD MAKE HIS HOME IN US</h2>
<p>We all love the Lord and are willing to let the Lord make His home in us. However, He cannot feel at ease within us. The Lord cannot make His home in us comfortably. He walks in one direction, and He hits the door; He walks in another direction, and He bumps His head. Sometimes it is unintentional, and at other times it is because we have no wisdom. In Colossians 3:16 Paul says &ldquo;in all wisdom.&rdquo; You must give careful consideration to the design of a house. You must use a ruler and measure to see if it will be comfortable and fitting to live in. You need to exercise wisdom to measure a house and to test it to see if it is suitable for use. For example, in one place where I was a guest, the brothers received me with a loving heart, and they let me stay in the best house. But the closet was too large, with two big sliding doors that were like two city gates. When I opened the door to hang my clothes, I bumped my head, and once the clothes were hanging in the closet, the door would not close easily. I was also a guest in a home where there was a step at the front entrance and another step in front of the bathroom. As an elderly man, I was afraid of falling, so I lived there in fear and trembling.</p>
<p>When I stay in my own house, I do not have these problems. The whole house is on the same level, with no steps. I can walk around my house with my eyes closed because I designed it myself with much consideration. I measured everywhere with a ruler, and I also used other houses as references. I measured the house many times, and then I tested it and adjusted it. In preparing a suitable dwelling place, elderly people have their own problems, weaknesses, and complications. Our Lord Jesus also has His own complications. The Lord Jesus is not that simple. We may say to Him, &ldquo;Lord, I love You. Come in. Make Your home in my heart.&rdquo; After He comes in, we only give Him a large room; all the other small rooms may be locked. In such a situation, how can He be at home? If you desire to prepare a good dwelling place for the Lord, you must use wisdom to make Him feel at home everywhere. Then He can dwell there richly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BE FAMILIAR WITH SCRIPTURE VERSES<br />
IN ORDER TO SPEAK THE WORD OF GOD TO OTHERS</h2>
<p>On our side, we need to use wisdom. If wisdom is properly exercised, the word of the Lord will dwell in us richly. In these days we are talking about speaking for the Lord. We all know that in order to learn a language well, we must pay attention to three things: first, a broad vocabulary; second, correct grammar; and third, the use of idiomatic expressions. If we have these three points, it will be very easy to practice. Whether we are speaking or writing, it will not be difficult. Today if we want to speak God&rsquo;s word, we must ask ourselves whether we have a broad vocabulary in us. Is our vocabulary sufficient? If you know many words and have an extensive vocabulary, you can speak in any way you desire. You will have a great deal to express, and you will be able to speak fluently. However, often when we speak to others concerning the Lord, we do not have sufficient words to express ourselves. We stammer, not knowing what to say. We are not familiar with the Scripture verses, and after a few sentences we run out of words. This means that the word of the Lord is not dwelling in us richly. Therefore, we find it very difficult to speak, and we have no way to speak. When we speak, we are very restricted.</p>
<p>In 1960, when I first arrived in the United States, I found that my grammar was adequate but that my vocabulary and familiarity with idiomatic expressions were not sufficient. Therefore, my speaking was quite restricted. Then I practiced speaking. During the past twenty years I have been learning English every day. Whenever I see a new word in a verse, I look it up in the dictionary. In this way I have learned many new words.</p>
<p>Today, for the Lord to go on, we all must speak for Him. If we do not speak for Him, the word cannot go out, and He will not have a way to go on. The book of Acts tells us that the word of the Lord grew and multiplied, and that it was strong to the extent that it finally gained the victory. The word of the Lord being victorious is the Lord being victorious; this is the way for the Lord to go on.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord for His mercy that in the past fifteen years the word of the Lord has been rich among us. However, does the word dwell in us richly? We have been listening to messages for twenty to thirty years, and we have taken in quite a number of spiritual matters. However, when the time comes for us to speak, there seems to be a faint outline within, yet we cannot speak it out. We may say, &ldquo;It is true that I have heard that message, and it is something like...&rdquo;; but we do not know how to speak it because we have not allowed the word of the Lord to dwell in us richly.</p>
<p>The word of the Lord is like a living person. The word is the Lord Himself. We must welcome Him, and we must open the door to let Him in. Not only do we need to let Him in, but we also need to give Him the ground, the room, and the suitable environment for Him to settle down. Then He will be able to open everything to us, and He will be able to exhibit everything in us. This is to let Him dwell in us richly. At this time we need to use all wisdom to love the Lord, to desire the word of the Lord, and to let the word of the Lord dwell in us to become our expression, our utterance. Then we will be able to use the word freely.</p><h2 class="head1">SPEAKING FOR THE LORD DEPENDING ON<br />
OUR BEING EQUIPPED AND HAVING A RESERVE SUPPLY</h2>
<p>You need to exercise all wisdom to open your whole being to let the word of the Lord as a living person dwell in every inward part comfortably and freely. Then, when you want to speak for Him, this word in you will be living, rich, and available. You will be able to use it freely. Because of the educational standard in Taiwan today, the level of knowledge of everyone in Taiwan has been raised. The age has also changed. As Christians in the twentieth century we cannot speak for the Lord in an unsophisticated way, saying, &ldquo;It is so good to believe in Jesus. We can eat and sleep in peace. After we die, we will go to heaven and not to hell.&rdquo; No one would listen to this kind of speaking today.</p>
<p>You must have something substantial to speak. For example, you must be able to speak clearly on Romans 8:2, which says, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; Such a clear speaking would shock the knowledgeable university students. They would ask, &ldquo;What is the law of sin and of death? I want to hear about it.&rdquo; Then you may show them a &ldquo;diamond&rdquo; by saying, &ldquo;All who sin are the slaves of sin. But if the Son of God shall set you free, you shall be really free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When you let the word of the Lord dwell in you richly, you will have wisdom to bring out different verses for the different people you meet. You may read Genesis 1:26, which says, &ldquo;And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.&rdquo; Or you may read John 1:1, which says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Try reading these verses. All those who hear will be amazed because they had no idea that such deep and mysterious things are in the Bible.</p>
<p>I hope that through my fellowship with you today you will be enlightened to see that we must speak for the Lord. Only through our speaking for the Lord can the Lord have a way to go on, and will we also have a way. To speak for the Lord, we must be equipped and we must have a reserve supply. We must use all wisdom to receive this living Lord, to let this living word dwell in our being. If so, we will have the words to speak at school and at work. Even when the sisters go to the market or to the fabric store, they will have words to speak to whomever they meet. They will be able to preach the word of God to others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING THE WORD OF GOD TO OTHERS<br />
AT EVERY TIME AND IN EVERY PLACE</h2>
<p>I exhort all of you always to carry a Bible. The older brothers and sisters who cannot read small print can purchase a Bible with large print and separate it book by book. They can make a booklet out of the Gospel of Matthew and a booklet out of the Gospel of Mark. I did this when I was young. I used to bring the Bible to work so that I could read it at any time. Every word and every phrase of the Bible is a diamond. It is unfortunate that few would show these diamonds to others. I hope that each of you will learn to speak the word of the Lord, using all wisdom to receive the word of the Lord into you as you would receive a living person, that He may feel at ease and richly dwell in you.</p>
<p>We need to equip ourselves daily. We need to be those who have a reserve supply. For example, when we meet an older person, first we need to consider what an older person would most like to hear. What the older Chinese people like to hear most is &ldquo;Children, honor your parents.&rdquo; Therefore, when speaking to an elderly Chinese lady, I would open up my Bible and show her Ephesians 6:1-3: &ldquo;The children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise, that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth.&rdquo; This elderly lady would think to herself that she has never heard this kind of word in Buddhist teaching. She would think, &ldquo;This is very good. I want to believe in Jesus. After I believe in Jesus, my children and grandchildren will all have to honor me. They will all have a long life and will be blessed.&rdquo; This is wisdom.</p>
<p>Perhaps the lady next door often quarrels with her husband. The best verse for you to use to preach the gospel to her would be Ephesians 5:25. You may say to her, &ldquo;Look at what the Bible says: &lsquo;Husbands, love your wives.&rsquo;&rdquo; This word would be the gospel to her. It would certainly touch her heart, and she would think, &ldquo;Not for any other reason, but just so that my husband will love me, I need to believe in Jesus. If I believe in Jesus, and he also believes, then he will love me.&rdquo; The word in the Bible is too rich. We should use it. We must have a reserve supply that we may use it freely.</p>
<p>When you meet a young person, you can read Proverbs 1:7 with him: &ldquo;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.&rdquo; We need to receive the word of the Lord into our being. There are sixty-six books in the Bible with over 1,200 chapters. If we would only choose one golden verse out of each chapter to be stored in us, we would have over 1,200 verses to speak. If every brother and sister in the church would do this, we would all become a house of scholars, and whatever we utter would be a scholarly composition. I hope that the church in Taipei will become such a church where every saint, whether old or young, will speak the word of the Lord everywhere in a logical, meaningful, valuable, and skillful manner, speaking until others are attracted, until everyone has heard the word of the Lord. This must not be practiced in a rigid way. We must spend time to research continuously.</p><h2 class="head1">TEACHING AND ADMONISHING ONE ANOTHER<br />
IN PSALMS, HYMNS, AND SPIRITUAL SONGS</h2>
<p>What we have just said concerns speaking in a general way. Now we come to the matter of the meetings. Following the word &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly&rdquo; is &ldquo;teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.&rdquo; When our daily speaking becomes so fine, songs and hymns will issue forth. But if our ordinary speaking is not adequate, it will be difficult to bring forth songs and hymns. For example, if you speak Romans 8:2 to people all the time, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death,&rdquo; repeating it again and again, eventually a short song will be composed and you will spontaneously sing it. When you come to the meeting, you will have more words, and the words will again become a song. That is why Paul could say, &ldquo;Teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.&rdquo; It is very difficult to discern whether this teaching is by speaking or by singing. According to the context, it is teaching by singing. When you sing to me Romans 8:2, you are teaching me; then when I sing to you Genesis 1:26, I am also teaching you.</p>
<p>It is not only a matter of teaching, but also of admonishing one another. Your singing admonishes me, and my singing also admonishes you. This is to admonish one another. We are still far from this condition, but I believe that if we would be willing to practice, this condition will be among us in less than three years. Then there will be much variety in our meetings. You will speak, I will speak, he will speak, and everyone will speak. You will sing, I will sing, he will sing, and everyone will sing. There will be speaking to one another, singing to one another, and the teaching and admonishing of one another. What an enjoyment it will be to come to such a meeting!</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT BY PRAYING AND SINGING</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:18b and 19 say, &ldquo;Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; Bible readers all know that this verse is a sister verse to Colossians 3:16. These two verses are parallel; they speak concerning the same matter. The difference is that in Colossians 3:16 the word comes into our being, and in Ephesians 5:18b-19 the Spirit comes into our being. This also proves that when the word comes, the Spirit also comes. Where the word is, there the Spirit is also. The word and the Spirit are inseparable.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:18b does not mention the Holy Spirit, but it does say, &ldquo;Be filled in spirit.&rdquo; This is quite significant. This means that from the time that you let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, you need to learn to exercise your spirit; you need to stay in your spirit. The word of the Lord is already in your mind, but how do you cause the word of the Lord to become spirit? You need to exercise your spirit. When you exercise your spirit and use your spirit, the Holy Spirit will fill your spirit. The best way to exercise the spirit is by praying and singing. I encourage you to try it. Keep on praying and keep on singing. The more you pray and the more you sing, the more you exercise your spirit. The result will be that your spirit will be filled with the Holy Spirit. When you come to the meetings, spontaneously you will speak and sing with psalms and hymns. I hope that from now on the brothers and sisters will all receive this new concept. I hope that from today you will prepare yourselves according to these two verses, opening yourselves to the living word of the Lord, letting Him dwell in you richly, and then exercising your spirit to pray, sing, and be filled in spirit with the Holy Spirit. When you are equipped, it will then be easy to speak to your colleagues, and it will also be easy to speak in the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING THE WORD OF GOD<br />
ACCORDING TO THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>In the meetings we have often heard some very shallow testimonies. In 2 Corinthians 4:11 Paul says, &ldquo;We who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh.&rdquo; This was Paul&rsquo;s experience. Paul was always being delivered unto death for the sake of the Lord, the Lord&rsquo;s work, the Lord&rsquo;s ministry, and the Lord&rsquo;s gospel. The death of the Lord Jesus was doing the killing work in his being. The result was that the life of the Lord Jesus was also manifested in his body. He experienced the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection, and what he spoke was his experience of the Lord.</p>
<p>We who follow the Lord, who are faithful to Him, who serve Him, and who speak for Him are persecuted everywhere, being put to death by others. This is to allow the death of the Lord to operate in our being. The result is that a fragrance will come forth from our being. What we should speak is this experience, this kind of testimony. When we are speaking to others or in the meetings, we should have this kind of speaking as our basis. We should not speak God&rsquo;s word in a vain way without any experience of our own. We all must spend time to experience the Lord daily and then speak the word of the Lord according to our experience.</p>
<p>For example, we may speak Romans 8:2 to others: &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; Merely to speak these words is a speaking without experience. However, after speaking this verse, if we would add a testimony of our experience, speaking Romans 8:2 according to our experience, this speaking would carry much more weight and have a much richer taste.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, according to the revelation of the Bible, every member of the Lord&rsquo;s Body needs to let the living word of the Lord dwell in him in all wisdom. We should never comfort ourselves with the thought that we can speak a little better than the brothers and sisters in the denominations. Christianity gives people the impression that whoever wants to be a preacher must study at a seminary. Unconsciously, we have also been influenced to think that we are not preachers. The revelation of the New Testament demands that every brother and sister use all wisdom to let the word of the Lord dwell in him freely. We all need to be up to the standard of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT TO SPEAK FOR THE LORD<br />
IN EVERY SITUATION</h2>
<p>If we all practice this way, eventually everyone will be an apostle, a prophet, a shepherd, a teacher, and also an evangelist. Thirty years ago, while I was living in Manila in the Philippines, several brothers and I went to the hospital to visit a brother who was ill. The sick brother&rsquo;s relatives and friends were all from the denominations. When one of them saw us praying around this sick brother, he asked in amazement, &ldquo;Are you all pastors?&rdquo; What do you think his concept was concerning prayer? He must have thought that prayer was the pastor&rsquo;s business. His concept must have been that one normally seeks out a pastor for prayer just as one would seek out an attorney for a lawsuit or a physician for an illness. When a Christian has fallen to the point where he cannot pray and must seek out a pastor for prayer, he has been totally damaged by the concept of the clergy-laity system in Christianity.</p>
<p>The basic principle of Christianity is to let the clergy be the priests. At a funeral a pastor is needed to preach a sermon about going to heaven, and at a wedding a pastor is needed to give a word of exhortation. A newborn baby is to be brought to the church to be blessed by the pastor. Most Christians consider spiritual matters as specific duties of the ministers. In their concept church members only need to attend the church services. When I was a member of a denomination, I attended a prayer meeting at which only three people were present: the pastor, his wife, and the caretaker. When they saw me they were shocked, and they said, &ldquo;You are not a pastor. Why have you come to the prayer meeting?&rdquo; We have not fully put off this fallen condition among us. Three hundred people may come to the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting, but only thirty may attend the Tuesday prayer meeting. The other two hundred seventy people, or ninety percent of the saints, apparently have disappeared. The ninety percent come to hear the message. In other words, the ninety percent come to attend the service, but not to pray.</p>
<p>A few days ago I attended a memorial meeting for a co-worker. When I saw that the two elders were functioning as pastors for the funeral, within me I was blaming the brothers who were merely sitting there. I believe there were many who knew the brother who passed away in a more thorough and intimate way than the two elders who were speaking. Why were they not willing to come forth to speak? Why did the elders need to do the speaking? Could not the brothers do it? I believe if we had let the brothers and sisters do the speaking it would have been done in a better and more beautiful way. We still have the poison of Christianity among us. Once the leaven is mixed with the flour, it is very difficult to clear it out. I hope that we will clear away those traditions, turn from the past, and learn to speak the word of the Lord. I hope everyone will practice exercising his spirit, letting the Holy Spirit fill his spirit, and rise up to speak for God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<p>I want to bring your attention to hymn #84 in our hymnal. This was written by the master hymn writer Charles Wesley. At that time, two hundred years ago, the light of the truth was not as clear as it is today. In verse 4 he refers to the &ldquo;second Adam.&rdquo; Most people would not sense anything wrong when they read this. However, in 1 Corinthians 15 Paul speaks of &ldquo;the second Man&rdquo; (v. 47) and the &ldquo;the last Adam&rdquo; (v. 45). The first Adam became a living soul; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. The last Adam is not the second Adam, but the second Man. The first man came out of the dust; the second Man came from heaven. To say that the Lord is the second Adam is a great error. There can only be the second Man, not the second Adam. Therefore, we changed it to &ldquo;final Adam.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">WRITING HYMNS ACCORDING TO<br />
THE TRUTH OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Many things should be considered in revising a hymn, because once a word or a phrase is changed, the meter and the rhyme are affected. We all know that whenever the literature of a language reaches its peak, poems, songs, and lyrics come forth. In the past twenty years the Lord has given us much light. I hope that the young generation will learn to write hymns. This is a very scriptural point. In the Old Testament there are the Psalms. In the New Testament both Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3 say that we should use psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Psalms are long, hymns are medium in length, and spiritual songs are short. As we are speaking and experiencing the word of the Lord, hymns should spontaneously come forth from our midst.</p>
<p>When writing a hymn, we must lay hold of the truth. Every line of the hymn should contain some truth, so that every word is a gold nugget and every phrase is truth. Pay attention to the rhyme and also to the meter. For example, verse 4 of hymn #84, which we just mentioned, says &ldquo;Come, Desire of nations, come.&rdquo; Here, &ldquo;Desire&rdquo; is used as a noun. Suddenly it switches from &rdquo;Come, Desire of nations, come&rdquo; to &ldquo;Fix in us Thy humble home.&rdquo; From the initial objective desire, it turns to speak concerning the Lord making home in us. This is excellent! The next line says, &ldquo;Rise, the woman&rsquo;s conquering seed, Bruise in us the serpent&rsquo;s head.&rdquo; &ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s...seed&rdquo; is taken directly from Genesis 3:15. &ldquo;Bruise...the serpent&rsquo;s head&rdquo; is also out of Genesis 3. Then this verse continues, &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s likeness now efface, Stamp Thine image in its place.&rdquo; Each of us has Adam&rsquo;s likeness, but may the Lord stamp His image on us. This is transformation, to be transformed into His image from glory to glory. The fourth line in the Chinese version says, &ldquo;The fullness of the last Adam my whole being revives.&rdquo; The revival within us comes from His making His home in our heart. The Lord not only destroyed the old serpent on the cross, but also, as the seed of the woman, the Conqueror, He destroys the old serpent within us. There is an old serpent, Satan, within us today. The Lord in us would destroy this old serpent. The fullness of the last Adam is the issue of His being resurrected and becoming the life-giving Spirit. If He did not become the life-giving Spirit, His fullness could not have come into us, and He would still be objective to us. But He became the life-giving Spirit, and a subjective relationship has been thus produced between His fullness and us.</p>
<p>Perhaps you may say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, how could you change others&rsquo; hymns?&rdquo; I would answer, &ldquo;What is wrong is wrong.&rdquo; If we would sing, &ldquo;The fullness of the second Adam our whole being revives,&rdquo; it would imply that there is a third, a fourth, and so on. We changed it to the &ldquo;final Adam&rdquo; according to the truth. He is the last Adam. He terminated Adam. After Him, there are no more. He was resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit. The riches of all things are here. In the last Adam everything has been terminated; in the life-giving Spirit everything has a new beginning. This is the truth. As long as I was correcting this hymn for the right reason, I did have the boldness to change it. This is not because I am proud. Which version do you think is better&mdash;the original one, or the one I changed according to the Bible?</p><h2 class="head1">PRACTICING TO SPEAK WORDS<br />
THAT OTHERS CAN UNDERSTAND</h2>
<p>Tonight we want to say that, when we speak God&rsquo;s word in the meetings, we must learn a basic skill, that is, to coordinate with each other. Our meeting is an assembly. It is not a meeting of one person. Therefore, we must learn to coordinate with each other. Just as in basketball or soccer, there is no way for you to play by yourself, keeping the ball for a long time before you pass it. Then the other player politely says thank you as he receives the ball, and he plays until the others doze off, still not passing the ball. He does not care if others are bored, sighing, or dragging their feet; he fully enjoys playing by himself.</p>
<p>Please remember, we have come to a meeting, and in the meeting there is only one &ldquo;ball&rdquo;&mdash;the Spirit. The ball we are playing is the Spirit. We move according to this Spirit. Do not keep the ball too long in your hands. Those who know how to play receive it quickly and also pass it quickly. After dribbling two or three times, they make a basket. In our meeting we have to learn this. Do not dribble the ball too long. If there is such a player, surely the coach would not like to spoil the game by using him.</p>
<p>I want to point out a few mistakes made in the last few days. Some people just love to speak in the meetings, and whenever they do so, they get off the subject. Of course, we treasure a person who is willing to stand up to speak in the big meetings. However, he should be sensitive. When others are not responding, he should quickly stop speaking and not be foolish. Then there are those who not only get off the subject when they speak, but also go around in circles. They do not care a bit for others&rsquo; ears, nor are they concerned whether others are listening. They speak with their old tone and accent. Out of ten words people can only understand three, yet they still continue to speak.</p>
<p>You all know that I am from Shantung. Even today, I still carry the Shantung accent. Praise the Lord, having practiced for fifty years, I have nearly gotten rid of half of my native accent. In 1933, when I first went to Shanghai, after the first week the brothers arranged a conference, asking me to speak. By that time, I had already realized that the old Shantung way of speaking could no longer be used. I tried my best to speak Mandarin. Although my pronunciation was a little poor, I kept one principle: I must speak words that others can understand. I must not use the native slang of my hometown. My reason for mentioning this is not to discourage those who do not speak perfect Mandarin. What I mean is that you must try your best to practice speaking clearly, to raise your voice so that everyone can hear and understand what you are saying. We must learn to care for others&rsquo; ears. In principle, we must learn to coordinate with each other.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING TO ONE ANOTHER<br />
AND CARING FOR OTHERS</h2>
<p>The first verse in the Bible which proves that we need to coordinate with each other in speaking in the meetings is Ephesians 5:19, &ldquo;Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; Here it does not say, &ldquo;All speaking in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.&rdquo; It says, &ldquo;Speaking to one another.&rdquo; This means that when you speak you must care for others. Since it is &ldquo;to one another,&rdquo; there is a mutual relationship. When there is such a mutual caring there will be harmony and not confusion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO UPLIFT THE SPIRIT IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The second verse in the Bible which proves that we need to coordinate with each other in speaking in the meetings is Colossians 3:16, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.&rdquo; Here the thought of speaking to one another is most precious. It does not refer to ordinary speaking, but to teaching and admonishing. It continues, &ldquo;...singing with grace in your hearts to God.&rdquo; Suddenly it turns from speaking to men to singing to God. When we speak, we speak to one another. This is man to man. Then at a certain point, it is no longer man to man, but man to God. The speaking up to such a point will surely produce hymns for singing to God.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;to&rdquo; in &ldquo;singing...to God&rdquo; is very meaningful. In the meeting, you speak and I listen, I speak and you listen. Everyone is speaking to one another. As our speaking becomes joyful and exciting, our words are changed into praises. Then everyone&rsquo;s speaking will change direction, and we will all be praising God together. Those who have even a little experience of the meetings know that if for a period of time after the start of the meeting everyone speaks, then the spirit of that meeting will issue in everyone praising. At this time, you and I should stop our speaking to one another, and our whole direction should turn to God and to praising God.</p>
<p>We all must learn to follow the flow of the meeting. We must not stand up to speak after everyone has already turned to praising God. If we do, the spirit in the meeting will be killed. The more we speak, the more the brothers and sisters will feel suffocated. All our speaking and prayer in the meeting are for cultivating the spirit, uplifting the spirit, supporting the spirit, and causing the spirit to rise. They should not kill the spirit. This is a fine work. Those of us who attend the meetings regularly have no choice but to learn this fine work. Otherwise our meetings will not have a fresh flavor and, meeting after meeting, will cause people to lose interest.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO EXERCISE OUR SPIRIT, SOUL, AND BODY<br />
IN COMING TO THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The reasons that our meetings do not interest people are because, on the one hand, we speak little and our experience is poor and, on the other hand, when we do stand up to speak the truth, we do not know how to change direction. This does not mean that we must praise unceasingly; that is not so good either. We must also be able to turn again from God to one another. This way the taste will stay fresh and rich. I hope that the brothers and sisters will learn this. Even the older ones should also learn. This is not too difficult. In Anaheim a group of older brothers and sisters have moved there because their children have settled in the United States. These older brothers and sisters are learning English very well. One sister who is eighty-one years old still goes to the community center to learn English, and the teachers and students in the whole class all consider her very precious. Thus, I hope that the older brothers and sisters will be encouraged.</p>
<p>If we were here just to have worship services, it would be very easy. Then as long as people attend the meetings, it would be fine. But these are the church meetings. Our whole being should be exercised. Our body, soul, mind, and spirit all should be exercised. If we go to the field to play ball, as soon as we are in position, all our skills must be exercised. Even our clothing must be changed. When we go to the meetings, we should also have a meeting conduct.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ADDING EXPOSITION, TESTIMONIES,<br />
PRAYER, AND HYMNS</h2>
<p>The third verse in the Bible which proves that we need to coordinate with each other in speaking in the meetings is 1 Corinthians 14:26, &ldquo;Each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation.&rdquo; The three verses we have spoken of thus far tell us that there must be coordination. There needs to be coordination and cooperation. Whenever there is a lack in coordination, none of these three verses can be applied. From our experience, we see that four items need to be added. The first is to add exposition. A brother or sister may speak three to five sentences, yet not be able to fully express himself. Then you may add a little, but not merely in the way of repeating his words. Expounding is not to lengthen, but to strengthen and to uplift. If you are only repeating what others have said, people will feel that it is too repetitious. To repeat would be unnecessary because everyone already understands. Therefore, when you speak you must have the confidence that others will not be bored and that you are strengthening and uplifting, not repeating.</p>
<p>The second point is to add testimonies. Some brothers and sisters may speak in a good way, but you may have a testimony to add to their speaking. That would be excellent. This is like a person getting dressed; the color of his shirt should coordinate with the color of his pants. You need to know how to coordinate with others. This matching testimony really causes people to feel that the meeting has a pleasant taste.</p>
<p>The third point is to add prayer, and the fourth point is to add hymns. Exposition, testimonies, prayer, and hymns are four items that should not be lacking in the meetings. If there is no strengthening word in the meeting, the sense will be that the meeting is weak. There must be the strengthening word, the strengthening testimonies, prayers, and hymns. These four items should be blended continuously: speaking, singing, praying, and testifying. If a meeting has these four items, surely it will be rich and living.</p>
<p>At the same time, we need to practice in our exposition, our strengthening word, not to show off. It is not to show others that I have again added a few sentences, and that I am better than them. That is the flesh. Our exposition is to strengthen the meeting. It is not to correct others nor to show off ourselves. The best way to learn to expound is to have those living in the brothers&rsquo; or sisters&rsquo; houses come together to practice expounding to each other. You speak, and I strengthen; I speak, and you strengthen. We first learn the basic skills at home. The couples can also practice expounding at home. Let the wife speak first, and let the husband add a few sentences; then correct each other. In this way it will be very easy to improve.</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE TRAINING<br />
TO BE ENLIGHTENED BROTHERS AND SISTERS</h2>
<p>Perhaps you think that it is very difficult to be a believer in the local church. We all have responsibilities at home, yet we are not only required to come to the meeting, but also to practice meeting at home. We cannot even relax at home. But I would say that whether you practice or not depends upon you. It depends upon what kind of Christian you want to be.</p>
<p>I will never forget the time in 1953 when, while I was conducting a four-month training in Taipei, I was concerned that the brothers and sisters might not be able to follow along. At that time I remembered an old story. Once there was a king who went to see how the tutor was teaching the prince his lessons. Looking through the window, he saw the tutor being very strict and severe with the prince. When he could bear it no longer, he said from outside the window, &ldquo;If the prince studies, he will be king. If he does not study, he will still be king.&rdquo; This tutor, who was not afraid of being beheaded, replied from inside the study, &ldquo;If he studies, he will be an enlightened king. If he does not study, he will be a foolish king.&rdquo; This story gave me great encouragement. You asked me to conduct the training, so I will be strict. Whether you will be enlightened or foolish is your choice.</p>
<p>Today the situation is the same. Those who practice and receive the training will be enlightened brothers and sisters. Those who would not practice and would not receive the training will be foolish brothers and sisters. This is entirely up to you. I believe that you all care. What we have spoken in the past few days is not any amazing, deep, or profound doctrine, but all are points that need to be practiced.</p>
<p>We need to study the sixty-six books of the Bible carefully and remember them well. We even need to carefully read through the table of contents of the hymnal. The table of contents of our hymnal is divided into more than 370 categories. There is much for us to learn. Not only do we need to spend time to read the table of contents, but we also need to spend time reading carefully through the hymns. This is surely worthwhile. If you do not read the hymns, you will not know them. If you do not know them, how will you be able to choose the right hymns to match the meetings?</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL FULLY SUPPORTING THE CONSTRUCTION<br />
OF THE MEETING HALL IN LIN-KO</h2>
<p>Since many brothers and sisters have come to this meeting from the central and southern regions of Taiwan, I want to say something about the matter of building the meeting hall in Lin-Ko. We hope that every year we will be able to produce 200 full-timers. In order to train the full-timers, there is the need of a training center. There is not only the need for classrooms for training but also for living quarters for hospitality. In addition, we need a large meeting place for our large gathering. Last year we rented a place, but the acoustics were not adequate. It was a real distraction to the meetings. If we had our own large meeting hall, we could design our own sound system, and it would be very convenient.</p>
<p>In addition to using that meeting place for training and conferences, we could also use that site for the campus work. Today the most worthwhile and productive place for the gospel work is the colleges and universities. Because everyone in today&rsquo;s society emphasizes education, university graduates are able to enter all levels of the society. Those who are gained now in the colleges will soon enter into all levels of society. Therefore, we want to use the property in Lin-Ko as a campground. Every weekend we will be able to bring a group of people to the mountain. There we will have a place for camping, a place for meals, and also a place for hearing the gospel. If you preach the gospel at home or on the campuses and people do not get saved, you can bring them to the mountains for a walk during the holidays. When their hearts are opened, it will be easy for them to receive the Lord.</p>
<p>Chung Li and Sheenchoo, which are south of Lin-Ko, and Taipei and Cheelung, which are north of Lin-Ko, can all use this property. If out of the fifty-two weeks of the year, two groups come to camp every week, then there will be at least 104 camping trips per year. Thus there will be the need to sign up beforehand to arrange the schedule. Young people like to come together for gatherings. If we promote this matter among the young people, then in the future Lin-Ko will be filled with groups of three or five fellowshipping and singing hymns under the trees. This is a matter with great potential. At this time we have only purchased the land. There are still many expenses that need the full support of the brothers and sisters. This matter also requires everyone to pray much.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SING THE HYMNS<br />
IN ORDER TO HAVE GOOD MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Hymn #837 is an excellent hymn. First, this hymn contains truth; it is a hymn on the truth related to the matter of building. After presenting the truth, it then brings in the matter of experience. Verse 6 of this hymn says:</p>
<p class="hbody">Here, Lord, we give ourselves to Thee;<br />
Receive us into Thy wise hands;<br />
Bend, break, and build together in Thee<br />
To be the house to meet Thy demands.</p>
<p>Verse 7 continues:</p>
<p class="hbody">Break all the natural life for us,<br />
Deal Thou with each peculiar way,<br />
That we no more independent be<br />
But with all saints are one for aye.</p>
<p>What is written here is all related to experience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this hymn, with eight syllables per line, is composed of two groups of four stanzas that convey a very rhythmic feeling as we sing. A hymn composed of excellent words and matching rhyme coupled with a good meter and an appropriate melody is a very successful piece.</p>
<p>Let us now look at hymn #841. Although this is a hymn on the experience of life, it eventually leads to the building. The first two lines of this hymn are:</p>
<p class="hbody">Thou art all my life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, In me Thou dost live...</p>
<p>The final stanza of this hymn says:</p>
<p class="hbody">I would cease completely<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my efforts vain,<br />
Let Thy life transform me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full release to gain;<br />
Build me up with others<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till in us Thou see<br />
Thy complete expression<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glorifying Thee.</p>
<p>I am speaking these things to you so that you can realize that in order to have good meetings we must know how to sing the hymns.</p><h2 class="head1">A MEETING WITH THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENCE<br />
SURELY HAVING A PARTICULAR ATMOSPHERE</h2>
<p>In this message we have come to the conclusion of the matter of meeting to speak the word of God, that is, to follow the flow and atmosphere of the meeting. Although there is no clear evidence for this in the Bible, in our experience we can surely sense that there is a flow in the meeting. That flow is the atmosphere. From our experience we can surely sense that there is a flow, a certain atmosphere, in the meeting. For example, when we attend a memorial meeting for a brother, those attending the meeting are rather solemn because there is an atmosphere of mourning. If, while the family of the brother is weeping, someone were to walk in shouting &ldquo;Hallelujah,&rdquo; he would violate the flow of that meeting. He would violate the spirit of that meeting. Such a person would be like either a block of wood or a piece of stone, insensitive to whether the atmosphere is cold or warm.</p>
<p>Similarly, at a wedding meeting, if someone were to come in weeping, others would feel that this was absolutely improper. Such a person does not realize that there is a flow of joy there. Does not the Bible say, &ldquo;Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep&rdquo;? When you rejoice with those who rejoice, everyone is happy. Today we have been called out of every person, every matter, and every thing that is not Christ. We have been called to meet into the name of the Lord. Surely the Lord&rsquo;s presence is here, and the meeting surely has a certain atmosphere. Therefore, every time we come to a meeting, every time we enter a meeting, we should not treat it lightly. It is not a small thing, but a great matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Coming to the Meeting in a Loose Way<br />
but Exercising the Spirit</h2>
<p>When a person comes into a meeting, he should have a high regard for that meeting, realizing that it is a meeting in the Lord&rsquo;s presence and that in that meeting there is a certain atmosphere. Actually, that atmosphere is the Spirit of the Lord. When the Spirit of the Lord is moving, that moving is the current of the spiritual atmosphere, and it becomes the flow of the meeting. If there is no flow in our meetings, there either must be a problem with our meetings or our condition is not acceptable to the Lord, causing us all to sense that the Lord&rsquo;s presence is not manifested among us. Sometimes when we walk into a meeting, we feel that the meeting is very dull, dead, and cold, without the presence of the Lord. At other times, at the minute we walk in we can sense that the meeting is very high and exalted. In fact, we can sense this even before the meeting has begun.</p>
<p>When the saints are called by the Lord and are gathered to meet into the Lord&rsquo;s name, He has promised, &ldquo;I am in their midst&rdquo; (Matt. 18:20). The Lord is with us not only when thousands are meeting together, but the Lord is also in our midst even when two or three are gathered to meet into His name. Therefore, in the meeting there is definitely an atmosphere, a flow. We all need to learn to follow the flow and the atmosphere of the meeting.</p>
<p>I believe all those who regularly attend the meetings have had this experience. Nonetheless, we all have become loose. We may come to a meeting with the thought that since we are not giving the message in that meeting, the meeting is not our responsibility, and we can just relax. We should not be like this. As long as we come to the meeting, we must exercise our spirit. We should come to the meeting as if we have come to play ball. Suppose we are a team of five players, and one player walks in wearing a dazzling suit and tie, another wears a checkered shirt, and yet another wears a pair of slippers. Of the remaining two, suppose one wears a pair of leather shoes and the other is barefoot. As soon as these five walk onto the court, the atmosphere of the game is gone. On the other hand, if each of the five would put on the team uniform and walk onto the court with enthusiasm, all those who had come to watch the game would sense the excitement of the game.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taking the Meeting Seriously<br />
and Preparing Ourselves before the Meeting</h2>
<p>When we come to a meeting, whether it is a big meeting or a small one, everyone must take it seriously. We may have been busy the whole day. After work the brothers return home for dinner and then get ready to go to the meeting. This is when the Lord begins to call us out of a host of different preoccupations. The sisters temporarily lay aside their housework, even leaving the unwashed dishes until later, and hurry to the meeting. Thus, one by one, everyone is called out of his different preoccupation and out of everything to meet into the Lord&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>On the way to the meeting, some walk, some ride bicycles, some take the bus, and some drive, but everyone is exercised, praising the Lord. Upon arriving at the meeting hall, they are all like players coming to a game. Everyone is charged. Not only is there the atmosphere of the meeting in the meeting, but each one brings in a certain atmosphere as he enters the meeting. I believe that all of you have had this experience. A meeting in which three weighty brothers are absent will always taste a little bland and will be a little low. Then if two of these brothers suddenly arrive, even as they enter, the meeting place is brought to life. Shortly thereafter, the third brother may also come in. Once these three persons are in the meeting, the atmosphere of the whole meeting place becomes fully charged; the whole meeting is lifted up.</p>
<p>On the contrary, a wonderful meeting can become deflated by one person dragging in sloppily, leaving after a short while, and then returning again in a few minutes. His going in and out kills the atmosphere of the meeting. I am not exaggerating; such things actually happen. We need to see that to meet is to gather into the Lord&rsquo;s name. If such is the case, the Lord is in our midst. In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul clearly says that if, as we are meeting, an unbeliever comes in to listen and to observe, he will eventually be subdued (vv. 23-25). He will fall on his face and say, &ldquo;God is really among you.&rdquo; Any outsiders who come to the meeting will sense that there is an atmosphere here&mdash;God is really among us.</p>
<p>When we meet together, there is the matter of the flow and the atmosphere of the meeting. When we participate in other social activities, it is not as easy to sense a flow there. It is only in our meetings that this matter stands out. The more we love the Lord, the more seriously we should treat this matter. The better we prepare ourselves before the meeting, the easier it will be for us to touch the flow in the meeting. The greater the number who are prepared before the meeting, the mightier is the flow in the meeting and the richer is the atmosphere of the meeting.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT ACTING INDEPENDENTLY<br />
BUT CARING FOR THE FEELING OF THE MEETING</h2>
<p>After we have touched the spirit of the meeting and have realized what the flow of the meeting is, the first thing we should take care of is not to act independently. Therefore, we must not speak loosely. To speak loosely is to be out of the flow. This disrupts the flow of the meeting. Then what should we do? We must follow the flow. Whether in singing, praying, testifying, or speaking, we must follow the spirit of the meeting, going along with the flow of the meeting. For example, suppose when you enter the hall the flow is that of praising, yet right after you sit down you ask everyone to read the Bible. You have disrupted the spirit of praising. When everyone is praising, you should also jump into the flow of praising and join with the others in the flow of praising. Even the words of your praises should be in the flow, taking the same direction as the praises of everyone else. We all should learn to do this.</p>
<p>Perhaps some may say, &ldquo;It is altogether not a simple thing to attend a meeting. First, we must lay down everything to be called to meet in the Lord&rsquo;s name. Then, in the meeting we must touch the flow of the meeting. If the flow is that of mourning, we must also mourn; if it is that of rejoicing, we must also rejoice; if it is that of praising, we must also praise in the flow. These are things for the &lsquo;professionals.&rsquo; It is too difficult for me.&rdquo; In response, I would say this: Please tell me, is it difficult for you who are in this meeting to speak Chinese? We are all accustomed to speaking Chinese; we have never felt that it is difficult to speak Chinese. However, in the past twenty years, all that I have spoken abroad is in English. What I have written has also been in English. Because of this, I have forgotten how to speak many Chinese expressions and how to write many of the Chinese characters. My point is to show you that whether it is difficult to speak depends on whether you will practice. If you keep on speaking and you speak unceasingly, speaking will not be difficult for you.</p>
<p>I hope you will practice this earnestly, because speaking is our life pulse. This is where the prosperity of the church lies. If our meetings are good, when people come they will be saved. We will also be able to supply them, educate them, and build them up. Thus, the church will become more prosperous day by day. However, if our meetings are poor, we will not have much growth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ADMONISHING AND CORRECTING<br />
WITH A TENDER SPIRIT AND THE HUMBLE<br />
AND AMIABLE TONGUE OF A LEARNER</h2>
<p>Second, we should not speak too long so as to encroach upon other people&rsquo;s portion, nor should we replace others by doing everything ourselves. Not only in the big meetings, but even in a home gathering of four or five, each has his portion. You should not take up all the time, thus usurping and replacing others.</p>
<p>Third, you need to learn to exercise your spirit and speak from the depths of your being with a strong voice so that others may hear. An old Chinese saying is that you should speak by sending out the words from your abdomen. The one speaking should raise his voice a little, open his throat a little more, increase his volume, and care for others&rsquo; hearing. Do not make others feel uncomfortable because they cannot hear you.</p>
<p>Fourth, if someone&rsquo;s speaking is too soft, repetitious, or time consuming, admonish and correct him with a tender spirit and the humble and amiable tongue of a learner. This fourth point touches a common sickness among us. The rest of the brothers and sisters are not able to do anything about it; therefore, everyone just tolerates the situation. Actually, it is best not to tolerate this situation. It is better to stop it. However, those who are going to stop others must have a tender spirit. Even having a tender spirit is not adequate; they must also have the humble and amiable tongue of a learner, saying, &ldquo;Brother, would you please leave a little time for others?&rdquo; Sometimes when such an admonition is not received by someone, everyone should bear some responsibility. Do not think that only the leading brother is a policeman. Everyone else should not merely hope that he will come forward to keep things under control. This concept is incorrect. In the meeting all are policemen; everyone is a policeman. By everyone bearing responsibility, I hope that the church in Taipei can thoroughly eliminate all the old problems in the meetings. Then the condition of our meetings can take a new turn.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARING FOR THE NEEDS<br />
OF THOSE ATTENDING THE MEETING<br />
BY BEING FLEXIBLE TO MAKE CHANGES<br />
ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION</h2>
<p>First, we must care for the need of those attending the meeting and minister the word according to their need. If unbelievers are present, we should be flexible to make changes and minister the word of the gospel according to the situation. Even as we are following the flow of the meeting, we may sense that the attendants have diverse needs. We may notice that some brothers are heavily burdened with cares and that others are not yet clear concerning salvation. At that moment we should care for their need and minister the word according to that need. In order to do this we must spend time in the Lord&rsquo;s Word regularly. We also need to practice speaking regularly. Then we will be like an excellent physician who is able to make an accurate diagnosis, and then write the correct prescription with an adequate dose. Such a physician is ready to make a diagnosis and to write a prescription at any time. We all must learn to discern the need of a meeting. Especially those who are the responsible ones should take the lead to do this. They will then be an example to the whole flock. When unbelievers are present, be flexible to make changes and minister the word of the gospel according to the situation. Even if there is only one unbeliever there, you still need to care for him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DOING OUR BEST TO MAKE UP<br />
THE LACK OF THE SUPPLY OF REALITY<br />
AND TO STRENGTHEN THE SUPPLY OF THE WORD</h2>
<p>Sixth, there should be the supply of reality in every meeting. Whenever the supply of reality is lacking, there should always be someone doing his best to make up this lack, to strengthen the supply of the word, and to give a concluding word. Although we do not want anyone to assume a responsible role in the home gatherings, in actuality there is the need for a strengthening word. One whole hour may go by in a meeting of one and a half hours&rsquo; duration, and yet the meeting may still be empty and without reality. At this time some brothers should do their best to make up this lack. If this is done, those attending the meeting will not feel empty when they go home. If a person feels that he is still empty and has gained nothing after a meeting of one and a half hours, he may not want to come back the next time.</p>
<p>Every meeting should give people the sense that they have gained something; only this can keep them. I believe that by the Lord&rsquo;s grace there are at least one or two stronger brothers or sisters in every home gathering. Therefore, they need to be prepared to make up the lack in every meeting and to strengthen the supply of the word. This requires practice. You should not give others the impression that you are the one who always makes up the lack and strengthens the supply of the word. If everyone would practice so that the meeting would have the supply of reality, and if everyone would strengthen the supply of the word and make up the lack, the result would be that everyone in the meeting would experience the enjoyment. Such a meeting would not end in an unpleasant way; instead, everyone would be satisfied. I hope that every one of you would receive these points and fellowship and practice them with one another.</p></body></html>
