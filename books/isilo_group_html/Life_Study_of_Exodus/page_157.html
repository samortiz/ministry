By Putting the Flesh to Death<br />with the Fighting Spirit</h2><p>We also fight against Amalek by putting the flesh to death with the fighting Spirit (Rom. 8:13; Gal. 5:17, 24). Romans 6:6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, in Romans 8:13, we see that we still must by the Spirit put to death the practices of the body. Furthermore, in Galatians 5:24 Paul tells us that those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh. If we do not believe that our old man has been crucified with Christ on the cross, we shall not be able to deal with our flesh. Based upon the fact that our old man has already been crucified, we have the boldness and encouragement to put the flesh to death.</p><p>According to Romans 8:13, when we put to death the practices of the body, the Spirit works with us. This means that how much the Spirit works depends on how much we are willing to do. If we crucify the flesh, the Spirit immediately works together with us. We all appreciate the work of the Spirit. However, the Spirit does not work unless we work. The Spirit helps those who help themselves. However, it is a fact that even when we endeavor to help ourselves, we are still not able to accomplish anything. We need the Spirit, and the Spirit needs our cooperation. He waits for us to help ourselves. As soon as we do this, He comes in to do everything for us. By the Spirit who dwells in us, we thus put to death the practices of the body.</p><p>In principle, the matter is the same in Galatians 5. According to the context of this chapter, the Spirit and the flesh are fighting against each other. However, those who are Christ&rsquo;s must still crucify the flesh. As the Spirit fights against the flesh, we crucify the flesh. This is accomplished by our cooperation with the work of the Spirit.</p><p>On the one hand, we must pray with Christ; on the other hand, we must slay the flesh with the fighting Spirit. Today Christ is both in the heavens and within us as the fighting Spirit. In the heavens He is the interceding Moses, and in us He is the fighting Joshua. We need to be in union with the heavenly Christ in order to cooperate with the indwelling Christ. Then in a very practical way the flesh will be put to death.</p><h2 class="head2">C. By Putting to Death All Good or Bad<br />That Is of the Flesh</h2><p>If we would fight against Amalek, we must put to death all that is of the flesh, whether good or bad. Actually, nothing of the flesh is good. But to our eyes certain aspects of the flesh seem to be good.</p><p>In 1 Samuel 15:3 the Lord charged Saul to &ldquo;go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.&rdquo; Although Saul utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword, he &ldquo;spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and of the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly&rdquo; (1 Sam. 15:9). Saul excused this by saying that &ldquo;the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the Lord&rdquo; (1 Sam. 15:15). It is difficult to say whether or not Saul was lying. He may have kept the best of the sheep and oxen for his own use, not to sacrifice to the Lord. According to 1 Samuel 15:12 (ASV), Saul set up a monument, perhaps to commemorate his victory over Amalek. This indicates that he did not care for God&rsquo;s word or intention, but cared for his enjoyment and glory. When Samuel confronted Saul about what he had done, Saul continued to excuse himself by saying that he had obeyed the voice of the Lord, but &ldquo;the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the Lord&rdquo; (v. 21). This indicates that the evil flesh was destroyed, whereas the seemingly good aspect of the flesh was allowed to remain.</p><p>Often we destroy the evil flesh, but we preserve the choice flesh, the good flesh. We all have certain good points, certain matters in which we think we are better than others. These aspects of the flesh are the &ldquo;bleating sheep&rdquo; and &ldquo;lowing oxen.&rdquo; Whenever we claim to be better than others, we allow the bleating of the sheep and the lowing of the oxen to be heard. Saul claimed to have performed the commandment of the Lord. However, Samuel said, &ldquo;What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?&rdquo; (v. 14). When Saul claimed that these were kept to be given in sacrifice to the Lord, Samuel replied, &ldquo;Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offering and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry&rdquo; (vv. 22-23). Preachers often speak on these verses. Nevertheless, instead of obedience and hearkening, among today&rsquo;s Christians there is much bleating of the sheep and lowing of the oxen. If we would deal with our flesh, we must deal with it thoroughly, utterly putting to death all that is good or bad. As long as something is of the flesh, it must be dealt with.</p><h2 class="head2">D. By Obedience to the Lord&rsquo;s Word</h2><p>Fighting against Amalek also requires obedience to the Lord&rsquo;s word (1 Sam. 15:22-23). At the time of Saul, obedience was only to the word in an outward way. Today we must obey the inner anointing. Whenever we disobey the anointing within, the flesh immediately becomes prevailing. But if we always obey the inner anointing, we shall pray with Christ and cooperate with the indwelling Spirit. This will enable us to overcome the flesh and put it to death. This is the way to fight against the flesh.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_156.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_158.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Exodus &nbsp; pg 157</div><br></body></html>
