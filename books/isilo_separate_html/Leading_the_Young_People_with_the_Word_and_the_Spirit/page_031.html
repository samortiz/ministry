<h1 class="title">LEADING IN SPIRITUAL LIFE&mdash;<br />
THE APPLICATION OF THE CROSS</h1>

<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS PUTTING PEOPLE<br />
IN THE PLACE OF DEATH</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the cross and the application of the cross. When we speak of the cross, we must be clear about God&rsquo;s intention related to the cross, because only then can we lead others to have a proper knowledge of the cross. In order to experience the cross, we must have a proper and genuine understanding of it. The cross is what God wants in man; He wants all that is of man to be put to death.</p>
<p>All God&rsquo;s purpose for man and all His work related to man are to bring man to the place of death. God fulfilled this purpose through the work that He accomplished on the cross at Golgotha, where He not only dealt with man&rsquo;s sins but also dealt with man himself. At the cross, at this point in the history of the universe, God dealt with man&rsquo;s sins, and He also dealt with man. Both man&rsquo;s sins and man himself were dealt with by the Lord Jesus when He was nailed on the cross at Golgotha. God wanted man to die, and God brought man to the place of death. God&rsquo;s purpose is for man to die, and God put man into such a place at the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PATTERN OF JESUS</h2>
<p>The age of the New Testament began with termination brought in by John the Baptist, and the life of a Christian also begins with termination. When a Christian is baptized after believing, he is put into a place of death. This is how the New Testament age began, and this is how the Christian life begins. Death also marked the beginning of the ministry of Jesus. When the Lord Jesus was ready to carry out His ministry and serve God, He went to the river Jordan to be baptized before preaching any message and doing any work. The humanity that the Lord Jesus put on in His incarnation was buried in the water by John the Baptist. If the Lord Jesus were only God but not also a man, there would have been no need for Him to pass through death by going into the water. However, Jesus was a man, and as such, He needed to die; He needed to be buried.</p>
<p>Without Jesus&rsquo; being put into the place of death, the God who indwelt Him could not have been lived out through Him. On the first day of the Lord&rsquo;s work, He delivered Himself to John the Baptist to be buried in the place of death. From that day onward, He continuously remained in the position of death. This enabled Him to truthfully say, &ldquo;The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing&rdquo; (John 5:19). He also said, &ldquo;I am in the Father and the Father is in Me...The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works&rdquo; (14:10). Because the Father was in Him, He had to die; only then could the Father do His works in Him. If the Lord still lived, the Father would not have been able to do His works in Him. He died so that the Father could live; the Lord remained in the place of death so that the Father could do His works from within Him. The Lord not only worked in this way; He also spoke in this way. He did not do anything or speak anything from Himself. When He spoke, it was the Father who did His works. When the Lord Jesus spoke and preached the word, it was the Father who was speaking and working in Him because He had been buried in the river Jordan. In His ministry of three and a half years and throughout His entire life, the Lord remained in the place of death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S LIFE NEEDING TO DIE SO THAT<br />
GOD&rsquo;S LIFE CAN LIVE</h2>
<p>If the Lord Jesus had only one life, His death would have had no meaning. If He only had the human life, His death would have been the same as any other man. If He only had the divine life, He would have been unable to die, because God&rsquo;s life is eternal. But the Lord Jesus had two lives, the human life and the divine life. His human life needed to die so that the source of His living would be God&rsquo;s life. Thus, even though His human life was terminated as the source of His living, He still lived because He had another life, God&rsquo;s life. Because He had two lives, one life could die so that the other life could be lived out. Even though He lived in the place of death in regard to His human life, He was able to live because He had the divine life.</p>
<p>The life that needs to die is our human life, whereas the life that needs to be lived out is God&rsquo;s life. The need for man&rsquo;s life to be terminated is not related to its being evil or corrupt. In the human life of Jesus the Nazarene, there was no corruption or evil, but His human life needed to die so that it would not be the source for His living. Only God&rsquo;s life must be the source of our living. The human life of a man needs to be terminated in order for God&rsquo;s life to be lived out. If our human life is not terminated, God&rsquo;s divine life cannot be lived out of us. Hence, our need for termination is not related to corruption. Even if our humanity were not corrupt or evil, it would still need to be terminated in order for God&rsquo;s life to have the first place in all the things related to our human living. Man&rsquo;s life must yield to God&rsquo;s life; man&rsquo;s life needs to be removed by death so that God&rsquo;s life can be our source.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> </body></html>
