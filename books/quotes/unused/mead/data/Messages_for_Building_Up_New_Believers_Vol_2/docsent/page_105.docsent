   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR FRIENDS Scripture Reading: James 4:4; 2 Cor 6:14-18; Psa 1; 1 Cor 15:33 I. THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NOT EMPHASIZING FRIENDSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One thing special about the Bible is that it does not say much about friendship among God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This does not mean that the word friend is never used in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word is used numerous times in the Old Testament; we find it in Genesis and especially in Proverbs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the New Testament we find the word in Matthew and Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the friendship spoken of in the Bible primarily refers to friendship outside of Christ; the Bible does not say much about making friends with those who are in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If I remember correctly, the word friends is spoken of twice in Acts in relation to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the first instance, some among the Asiarch leaders were Paul s friends.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They entreated Paul not to venture into the theater 19:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the second instance, Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to go to his friends to receive care 27:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In addition to these two verses, 3 John 14 says, The friends greet you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Greet the friends by name.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As far as I know, these are the only three places in Acts and the Epistles that speak about the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows us that the Bible does not say much about the matter of friendship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible does not emphasize friendship but instead emphasizes our relationship as brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It emphasizes the relationship of the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the basic and primary relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible puts much more emphasis on this than on friendship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>FRIENDSHIP BEING</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE MOST IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP IN THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What does friendship mean?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>An old man can be a friend to a young man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There can be friendship between husbands and wives.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Fathers and sons can be friends with each other, and brothers and sisters also can be friends.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Being a friend to someone means loving and communicating with that one; this is the only relationship that counts in a friendship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Among the different kinds of human relationships, there are blood relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This kind of relationship exists only between relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Friendship, however, is different from such relationships; it is sealed in mutual love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Friendship disregards all other relationships and binds two persons together through love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Friendship often exists between husband and wife, father and son, mother and daughter, or teacher and student.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Friendship can develop between people of similar age, similar social standing, or similar era.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Friendship is an important relationship for a person who has not believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before a person accepts the Lord as Savior, he does not share any spiritual relationship in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why friendship is the most important relationship in the world to him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But among us, friendship is no longer the most important thing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Friendship is rarely mentioned in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our emphasis is on the relationship that exists between us as brothers and sisters in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our relationship as friends in the Lord is much less significant.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Friendship is not important among God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before we believe in the Lord, we do not have a spiritual relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We only have father and son, mother and daughter, teacher and student, and master and servant relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why friendship is an important matter to those who have not believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Two persons can be father and son to each other, but they can still have differences in standing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The same can be said of a mother and a daughter, a husband and a wife, and a master and his servant.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everyone can have his or her own standing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Blood relationships, however, are limited in number.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Most persons can have between three and five blood relationships; those who have eight and ten such relationships are considered unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Other than these relationships, all other contacts are with friends.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Man cannot be satisfied with family relationships alone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He cannot be satisfied with the teacher-student relationship or any other social relationship alone.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man needs friendship.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Friendship is based on love, not on the blood relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many of our human relationships are inherited from birth; only friendship is by personal choice.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is why friendship is a most important matter to an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everyone has friends.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A person can have three, five, eight, or ten friends.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He can have dozens or hundreds of friends if he is sociable enough.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He can enjoy companionship, love, and fellowship among these friends.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Friendship indeed occupies an important place in an unbeliever s life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If an unbeliever does not have any friends, he must not be a very likable person.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He may be somewhat abnormal or have a sick personality; he may be very hard to get along with; or perhaps his untrustworthiness or peculiarities have discouraged others from making friends with him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Under normal circumstances, a man always has friends.</S>
