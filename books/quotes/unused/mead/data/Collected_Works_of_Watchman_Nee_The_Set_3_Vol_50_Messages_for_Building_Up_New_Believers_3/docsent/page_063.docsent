   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How to Reject Thoughts from Satan</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How do we reject thoughts from Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is easy to reject these thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has given us our mind; it is ours, not Satan's. We are the only ones who have the right to use our mind; Satan has no authority over our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All we need to do is not allow him to think.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Satan can only usurp our mind with deception.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He will give us a thought, and we may think that this thought is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, it is from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As soon as we recognize that it is not ours, we have overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Satan always tempts and attacks a person by stealthy, surreptitious, and covert ways.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He does not shout loudly, "Here I come!"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, he deceives with lies and falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He does not let us know that he is the one who is doing the work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once we are aware of an attack from Satan and expose him and his disguise, it will be easy to withstand him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus said, "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free" John 8:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The truth is the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will be set free once we know the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The power of Satan is in his lies; once his lies fail, his power is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, as soon as we realize that Satan is attacking us and that this is the fact, we are freed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some children of God say with their mouth that Satan is the instigator behind everything, but their spirit has no assurance that those things are actually from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although they say that they are withstanding Satan, they do not know the reality of Satan's work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a result, they cannot withstand him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, as soon as they identify Satan's work, they can withstand him, and as soon as they withstand him, he flees.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Satan attacks our mind mainly through deception.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He makes us think that his thoughts are ours when in reality they are from him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once we expose his lies, we will reject the thought from him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To withstand means to refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Satan gives us a thought, we should say, "I do not want it."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is what it means to withstand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When he injects one thought into us, we should say, "I do not take this."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When he injects another thought into us, we should repeat, "I do not accept this."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do this, he will not be able to do anything with us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One servant of God in the Middle Ages said, "You cannot stop birds from flying over your head, but you can at least stop them from nesting in your hair."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a good word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We cannot stop Satan from tempting us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, we can stop him from nesting, from gaining a beachhead in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This power is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we ignore the thoughts that enter our mind, these thoughts will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the positive side, we need to exercise our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people have lazy minds.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This makes it easy for Satan's thoughts to lodge in them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Philippians 4:8 says, "What things are true, what things are dignified, what things are righteous, what things are pure, what things are lovely, what things are well spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can take account of spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to exercise our mind concerning spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a person always sets his mind on sinful things, Satan can easily inject his thoughts into him, because his thoughts and Satan's thoughts are not much different.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if we always set our mind on spiritual things, Satan will not be able to inject his thoughts into us easily.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Satan is able to inject his thoughts into many people because they are passive, because they have too much spare time, or because their thoughts are unclean in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is another point that deserves attention: Our mind must not be attracted to satanic thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are many people whose minds are attracted to satanic thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They have no interest in the wonderful, spiritual experiences of other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yet they become very interested when it comes to gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since they love Satan's work, they cannot reject satanic thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to hate Satan's work in order to reject his thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All filthy thoughts that damage one's fellowship with the Lord and love for the Lord are from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These thoughts will not come to us if we are not attracted to them in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But if we incline our heart toward these things, they will come to us easily.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, we must learn to reject everything that comes from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must pay special attention to rejecting all filthy thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Satan always places filthy thoughts in man to induce man to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The starting point is one filthy thought.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we allow it to continue, it will bear the fruit of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, we must refuse any thought that comes from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, there is a great problem: What should we do if the thought refuses to leave after we have rejected it?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to realize that we only need to withstand unwanted thoughts once.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Withstanding is a one-time act; we should never withstand twice.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>James 4:7 says, "Withstand the devil, and he will flee from you."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This verse says to withstand the devil and the devil will flee.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must believe that when we withstand the devil, he will flee.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is wrong to continue withstanding for fear that the devil is still around.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whose words do we believe?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Bible says, "Withstand...he will flee."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If there is a voice within that suggests that he has not fled, whose voice is it?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is Satan's voice!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many people choose to believe Satan's words.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, they lose.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must declare after we have withstood him, "I have already withstood the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He is gone from me."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The feeling that he is still lurking around is a lie; it is not real, and it is not from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He must run.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He has no ground to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must be clear that it is right to withstand once, but wrong to withstand a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The first withstanding glorifies God's name.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The second withstanding questions God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Many people make the mistake of checking with their feelings after they have withstood the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They ask, "Is the devil gone?"</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Their feeling tells them that he is not gone, and they try to withstand him again.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Once there is a second withstanding, be sure there will be a third, a fourth, even a hundredth, and a thousandth.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In the end we will feel as if we are completely helpless in rejecting it.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But if we ignore him completely after we have withstood his temptation once, we will experience victory.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We must care for the fact of God's Word and ignore our own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The fact is that as soon as we withstand the devil, he flees.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we think that he has not fled after we have withstood him, we are being deceived by our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we believe this feeling, the devil will come back.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We must learn to believe God's glorious words.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Once we have withstood him once, there is no need to withstand him a second time because the matter has been settled already.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>These are the issues relating to Satan's work in man's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We must realize that Satan attacks man's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We should reject any thought from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>At the same time, we should realize that once we reject his thoughts, the matter is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Furthermore, we must not be overly concerned with his attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Otherwise, our mind will be thrown into confusion, and we will be ensnared by the devil.</S>
