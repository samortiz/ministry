   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Cleansing Her by the Washing of the Water in the Word</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ's work of sanctifying the church is accomplished by cleansing her with the washing of the water in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the divine concept, the water in Ephesians 5:26 refers to the flowing life of God typified by flowing water Exo 17:6; 1 Cor 10:4; John 7:38-39; Rev 21:6; 22:1, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The washing of such water is different from the washing of the redeeming blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The redeeming blood washes away our sins 1 John 1:7; Rev 7:14 , whereas the water of life washes away the blemishes of the natural life of our old man, such as "spot or wrinkle or any such things" Eph 5:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In sanctifying the church, the Lord first washes away our sins with His blood and then washes away our natural blemishes with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Spots are something of the natural life, and wrinkles are signs of oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only the water of life can metabolically wash away such defects.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the spots and wrinkles in the church will be washed away through the inner cleansing of the water in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all need such an organic, metabolic washing to take away our defects and the marks of our oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the church is washed organically and metabolically in this way, the church is renewed and is without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are now in such a washing process in order that the church may be holy and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With Eve in Genesis 2 there was no need of cleansing because in that chapter she had not fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, she was pure and without mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But because we are fallen, contaminated, and defiled, we need to be cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many things in us need to be purged away: the flesh, the self, the old man, the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, we have many spots and wrinkles from which we need to be cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the process of sanctification, something of Christ is added to us, but in cleansing something of us, especially our natural disposition, is subtracted.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we are cleansed by the washing of water in the Word, our natural disposition is washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Disposition is the most inward aspect of our constitution; it is the root of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We were born with a certain disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Disposition, therefore, is altogether inward.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As Christ is adding His element into us, He is also cleansing us and subtracting our natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His cleansing washes away the natural element from the depths of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The washing away of our natural disposition cannot be accomplished by teaching but only by the impartation of the element of Christ into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While the element of Christ is being added to us, something of ourselves is being carried away.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, on the one hand, we have the addition of Christ; on the other hand, we have the subtraction of the natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Gradually, Christ is being added into our being, and our natural disposition is being subtracted.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The result of this process is transformation, a metabolic change in which the new element is constituted into us and the old element is carried away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more we open to Christ as the life-giving Spirit within us and tell Him that we are willing to take Him as our life and our person, the more He will work within us as the life-giving Spirit to add Himself to us to carry away our oldness and our natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the work of the living Christ in sanctification and cleansing.</S>
