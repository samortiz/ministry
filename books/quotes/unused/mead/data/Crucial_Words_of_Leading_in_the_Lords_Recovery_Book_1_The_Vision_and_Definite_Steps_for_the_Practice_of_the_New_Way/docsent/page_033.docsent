   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Importance of the Small Group Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Apart from the big Lord s Day morning meetings, there are a few meetings that allow the saints to function organically; one of them is the small group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In a small group the saints have many opportunities to carry out their function organically.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Functions such as preaching the gospel, expounding the truth, teaching the Bible, loving others, helping others, taking care of others, and sympathizing with others can be manifested and are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But because we are still accustomed to the old religion, once we see the loose situation in the small groups, we become disheartened.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, we also become loose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, we do not consider the small groups to be important because we feel that they are not proper meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, the life pulse of the church is maintained by the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Please give me the grace to speak a frank word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have been practicing the small group meetings for eighteen months.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How do the co-workers and elders feel about this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Perhaps we would say that we do not have time to pay attention to these groups because we are very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Speaking of being busy, I do not believe any of you could be busier than I am.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have put out so many books, and I also review almost every one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now in Taipei, I have been going here and there to observe the situation of various meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For the sake of the Lord s work and the changing of the system, I have visited many places.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To say that we are so busy that we do not have time to go to the small group meeting proves that we have not seen the importance of changing the system.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The small group meeting is the life pulse of the Lord s recovery and the key to the survival of our family.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are willing to sacrifice our future and consecrate everything to the Lord, and if we see that this is the way the Lord s recovery should take, we would give ourselves even to the point of neglecting our sleep and meals and put all our effort into taking this way and making it a success.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this year and a half, I have said at least four to five times that we should have the spirit of devoting ourselves to the task until our death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am translating the Recovery Version of the New Testament into Chinese with such a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I work at least eight to nine hours a day, revising the drafts to the extent that my eyes become blurry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I know that it is risky for me to labor in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a man more than eighty years old, I am risking my life by doing this, but I have the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers, we owe not only the Lord and the brothers and sisters, we even have an obligation to our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do not have such a spirit, we are wasting our time here.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must make our consecration worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have consecrated our future and spent our everything for the Lord in order to do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now the matter of having small groups has been set before us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we would not take them seriously and endeavor to work them out, we are being unfaithful to the Lord s commission and to our own consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My most intimate brothers and sisters, the saints serving in the bookroom, can testify concerning the way I lead them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the past when I was not here, they were muddling along.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At this time I have not pushed them, but I have taken the lead to work with them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now they are almost neglecting their sleep and meals, and as a result their translation work has greatly improved and has undergone a big change.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In our translation of the Recovery Version of the New Testament into Chinese, beginning with the first word of the first verse of the first chapter of Matthew, we have considered every word carefully according to the Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we first began our work, the progress was very slow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But now, to a certain degree, the serving ones have all learned how to carefully consider the words.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the past they had the ability, but they were not willing to learn or make the effort.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Christianity today there are at least four versions of the Bible in Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If our version were the same as the others, it would be unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since we want to put out a new translation, we must produce a work of the highest standard.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even if it is not exactly according to the Greek, in comparison with the other versions, it should at least be commended and appraised as the best.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today we have all rejected the earthly bribes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The world is a busy place; especially in Taiwan, everyone is under stress, and many hold more than one job.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yet all of us are here not for money or entertainment but for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all know that as human beings, we must believe in the Lord; as believers in the Lord, we must love the Lord; and as lovers of the Lord, we must take the way of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Matthew 24 and 25 tell us that one day we will stand before the Lord and give Him an account.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am not speaking this word merely to all the saints; I am speaking to myself as well.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Day by day I hold this kind of attitude: O Lord, I hope that one day when You come back, I will be able to give You an acceptable account.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord will come back, and we will need to give an account before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since this is the case, we should not have a slothful attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we believe that one day we will stand before the judgment seat of the Lord, we should be very serious today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, if the brothers and sisters serving in the bookroom are serious, they will do at least eighty percent of the work, and I will not need to labor over every single word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The co-workers and elders have a great responsibility for the improvement of the situation of the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must try our best to promote the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I still remember the meeting in which I first mentioned the matter of the small groups; it was as if we were in heaven, and the atmosphere was very positive.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But what has happened since?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It seems as if we have all gone back to where we began, without taking any action.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I do not mean to make things difficult, but I hope that we all will be awakened.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am not threatening anyone with the matter of reward and punishment, but I am speaking the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I hope that everyone will be serious to carry out the small groups and see that this is our life pulse; we must work it out.</S>
