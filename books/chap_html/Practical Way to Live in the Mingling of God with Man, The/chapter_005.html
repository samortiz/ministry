<h1 class="title">OUR NEED TO BE FILLED WITH CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 2:9-10; Eph. 3:19</h1>
<p>Colossians 2:9-10 says, &ldquo;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and you have been made full in Him, who is the Head of all rule and authority.&rdquo; These two verses say first that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ. Then they say that we are made full in this Christ. We are made full through the fullness of the Godhead which dwells in Christ. Because the fullness is in Christ, we can be made full in Him.</p>
<p>Ephesians 3:19 says, &ldquo;And to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; For us to be filled unto all the fullness of God means that we are filled to overflowing with all the riches of Christ (cf. Eph. 3:8). To be filled unto all the fullness of God is to be filled with the riches of Christ to the point that we express His riches. The expression of the riches is the fullness. This verse and the aforementioned verses in Colossians speak concerning the same matter.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we come to a matter for which I have been heavily burdened for some time. As Christians, we must realize that we are not perfect&mdash;full and complete&mdash;by creation. For this reason we need to be regenerated. The Scriptures tell us that we are vessels made to contain God (Rom. 9:23; cf. Gen. 1:26). A vessel of any kind can never be perfect or complete by itself. Until a vessel is filled with the content for which it was made, it will not be perfect. Although a cup may seem perfect by itself, as long as it is empty, it is not perfect. We are vessels, and as such, we are not perfect by ourselves.</p>
<p>Many of us pay too much attention to the negative side of the Christian life and neglect the positive side. We talk too much about how to overcome sins and the world while neglecting the positive matters. One of the main positive matters of the Christian life is that of being filled unto all the fullness of God. The normal Christian life is one of being filled with Christ and His riches. We must be saturated and permeated by Christ so that we can have the image of Christ (Rom. 8:29). Even if we are victorious over sin and the world yet are not filled with Christ and do not have His image, we as vessels are empty and thus not perfect. If we pay attention to the positive side of the Christian life, the negative matters will naturally, automatically, and spontaneously be taken care of. If we are filled with Christ, we will overcome sin and the world. Let us therefore stress the positive side and pay less attention to the negative side.</p>
<p>We need to be perfected; that is, we need to be filled unto all the fullness of God. Our main problem today is not sin and the world but the fact that we are short of Christ. If we are short of Christ, we will experience many troubles. We can liken this to being malnourished. If we are short of vitamins, germs will be able to trouble us. If, on the other hand, we are full of vitamins, we can be assured that the germs&rsquo; effect will be nullified. When it comes to health, we would do well to not be overly anxious about germs and simply increase our intake of vitamins. In the same way, when it comes to our Christian life, let us not stress sins, the world, and our weaknesses. Let us instead set our eyes on the heavenly Christ and be filled with His unsearchable riches.</p>
<p>We need Christ. However I am afraid that we have the wrong concept of what it means to need Christ. We may think that we need Christ primarily to comfort and help us. While that may be true, in a deeper and more important sense, we need Christ to fill us until we are full of Him. Until we are full of Him, we are short of something and therefore empty and not perfect. For this reason, we need to be filled with Christ. We have to have a revelation concerning Christ. The concept we have of Christ is too narrow and limited. If the Lord would open our eyes and give us the heavenly vision in full, we would realize that Christ is our perfection and completeness. We have to realize that we are empty vessels&mdash;containers without content. In this state, we can never be complete, full, and perfect. Our need is not victory over sin, deliverance from the world, hope, or peace; our need is Christ. We need nothing but Christ. Even if we as vessels are clean, pure, and entirely victorious over sins and the world, if we are devoid of Christ, we are still empty. We need to experience Christ so that we are made perfect, complete, and full in Him.</p>
<p>We all need to be deeply impressed with the fact that we need Christ. Some may say that we need sanctification, holiness, and other spiritual matters. However, the sanctification and holiness we need are actually just Christ Himself (1 Cor. 1:30). Others may tell us that we need strength, energy, and power. In actuality, however, the strength, energy, and power we need are Christ (Isa. 12:2; 1 Cor. 1:24). In reality, our need is not for various things, regardless of how spiritual they may be; our need is simply Christ. I was a Christian for over fifteen years before I realized this. One day God opened my eyes and gave me the revelation that I need nothing but Christ. We may think that we are short of many things, but we are short only of Christ. Even if we have no sin, as long as we are empty, we are not perfect. By creation itself, we are not perfect and are still short of something. We were made as vessels to be filled with Christ. Until Christ fills us, we are lacking and are not perfected. We need to realize deeply, clearly, and definitely that we are but empty vessels. No matter how good, pure, clean, and beautiful we are, we are still empty if Christ does not fill us. I repeat this again and again: we need Christ. Without Him, we are empty vessels.</p>
<p>Not only do we need to see that we are empty vessels; we also need to see what kind of vessel we are in the first place. A teacup is a vessel, albeit a very simple one, for it has only one part. Once a cup is filled with tea, it is full and complete. We, too, are vessels. Our glorious and mysterious God needs a vessel. However the vessel He needs is not as simple as a teacup. The most complicated matter in God&rsquo;s creation is the human being. In Psalm 51 David said, &ldquo;Behold, You delight in truth in the inward parts; / And in the hidden part You would make known wisdom to me&rdquo; (v. 6). According to this verse, we have both the inward parts and the hidden part. The inward parts must be the parts of the soul&mdash;the mind, the emotion, and the will (Heb. 8:10; Jer. 31:33; cf. 1 Thes. 5:23). Likewise, the hidden part must be the spirit&mdash;composed of the conscience, fellowship, and intuition (Rom. 9:1; 8:16; Eph. 6:18; 1 Cor. 2:11; Mark 2:8)&mdash;for it is the most hidden part within us (1 Pet. 3:4). The heart, being a composition of the inward parts and the hidden part, is composed of the three parts of the soul plus the conscience in the spirit. As human beings, therefore, we are very complicated vessels.</p>
<p>As we vessels consider our complicated being, we must ask ourselves how much of Christ we have in our inward parts. In the Bible, we are told that we should have the mind of Christ and that Christ should make His home in our hearts (1 Cor. 2:16; Eph. 3:17). But how much is Christ in our mind and in our heart? How much is Christ in the parts of our soul? Any part that is not full of Christ is not perfect. If we do not have enough of Christ in our mind, our mind has yet to be perfected. If we do not have enough of Christ in our emotion, our emotion is not perfect. It is the same with our will&mdash;if Christ does not permeate our will, then our will is not perfect. The converse is also true. The perfect mind is a mind that is full of Christ, the perfect emotion is an emotion that is full of Christ, and the perfect will is a will that is full of Christ. Hence, the parts of our vessel can be made perfect only by Christ. Christ Himself is the perfection of our mind, emotion, and will. The heart that is full of Christ is a perfect heart. If it is without Christ, our heart&mdash;though it may be pure, clean, right, and good&mdash;is short of Christ and is thus empty and not perfect.</p>
<p>My burden is not to give you much doctrine. My burden is to help you realize that Christ is our completeness and perfection and that we are made full in Him. If you are short of Christ in any part, you are not complete. Your entire inner being&mdash;the inward parts and the hidden part&mdash;have to be filled with Christ in order for you to be made complete. You need only Christ. You must forget about all other things.</p>
