   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE SECOND GREAT PILLAR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE LORD S RECOVERY LIFE Scripture Reading: John 10:10b; 11:25a; 1 John 1:2; 3:9; 5:12; Col 3:4a; Gal 2:20; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:2; Col 1:19; Eph 4:15, 13; 2 Pet 1:3-4 THE LORD JESUS BEING THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord s recovery is mainly founded upon four pillars: the truth, life, the church, and the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The reason Christianity is degraded is that it has lost the truth and is short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible tells us that the Lord Himself is the truth and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus said, I am the way and the reality and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this verse the reality is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, the Lord said that He Himself is the life and the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both the truth and the life are the Lord Himself, but they are two different aspects of what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The difference is that the truth is an outward definition and explanation, and life is the inward and intrinsic content.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord is in us as our life, but the experience of life needs an explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This explanation is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we receive the Lord according to this explanation, we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, in order to experience and enjoy the Lord as life, we must know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The experience of the Lord as life is contained in the Lord as the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are not clear about the truth and do not understand or know the truth, we will have no way to enjoy the Lord as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For this reason we must spend an adequate amount of time to learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>EXPERIENCING LIFE BY KNOWING THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord has not left us in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today all of His truths are contained in the Bible, which He has given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must realize that the Bible is a book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The reason the Bible is a book of life is that its entire content is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All experienced Christians confess that no one can enjoy Christ as life if he does not know the Bible or understand the truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to go to the supermarkets to buy food for our physical body to be fed and sustained.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In like manner, we must come to the Bible to receive the truth that is in it if we want to receive and enjoy the Lord as life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the truths in the Bible are food for our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible is not merely a book of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the knowledge contained in the Bible is in fact truth, and in this truth, life is concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we read the Bible, if we study only the letter but not the intrinsic truth within, we will not receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, every Bible reader has to see the truth that is conveyed through the letter of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once we see the truth, we will spontaneously touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The life-studies have been published to help us enter into the depths of the letter of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, all those who carefully study the life-studies will surely gain a certain amount of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The life-studies bring us into the biblical truths, from which we may receive the genuine life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today the Lord s recovery is a recovery of the truth and of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all know that the decline of Christianity is due to the fact that it has lost both the truth and life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This loss of the truth and life eventually produced many human methods and worldly organizations, which are not what the Lord wants.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord does not want any organization or human method.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, He wants His church to know Him as the truth and to receive and enjoy Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The entire content of the church must be the growth of Christ in us as truth and life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This may be likened to an orchard, the entire content of which is the fruits of life produced from the fruit trees.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In an orchard we cannot find any organization or behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can only see the fruit trees growing and bearing fruit as the issue of their growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This should be the situation of the churches in the Lord s recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the churches we do not want to have any organization or human methods.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, we want to minister to God s people for their growth by planting and watering as the apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3:6 and 9.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>PARTAKING OF THE DIVINE LIFE AND NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must realize that the church is different from human society and distinct from all the different Christian organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The difference or distinction is that human society and Christian groups rely on organization and human work, but the church relies solely on the light of the truth for the enjoyment of the Lord s life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Truth and life are nothing less than the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord told the disciples, I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly John 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He even said, I am the resurrection and the life 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is not only the life but also the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that the life, which He is, is resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The fact that this life is resurrection life means that this life is able to swallow up death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If this life is put into death, death will not be able to overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead, because this life is resurrection, it will swallow up death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This resurrection is the Lord Jesus, the One we believe in and receive.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today the Lord Jesus is the Spirit of life who is living and who enlivens and strengthens us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, He is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is in us to give us life and to supply us day by day that we may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the six thousand years of human history, there have been many famous philosophers such as Confucius of China and Socrates of Greece who were exceedingly wise and who had many deep and profound thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>None of them, however, had the boldness to say that he was life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The statement I am the life is very simple yet exceedingly great in its significance.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Who can say such a word?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If today someone were to tell us, I am the life, we would surely think that this person was either a fool or insane.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What kind of a person can make such a statement?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We cannot find a statement like this in all the books and classics throughout human history.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Who said such a word?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Jesus Christ did.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He would not have been able to speak such a word unless He possessed exceptional wisdom and extraordinary reality.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord not only said, I am the life, but He also said, I am the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Moreover, He said, I have come that they may have life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If He were not God and the ever-living Spirit, and if He did not possess supreme and extraordinary wisdom, how could He have said such a word?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This word is simple but mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Just by this word we ought to believe that the Lord Jesus is extraordinary and far superior to Confucius and Socrates.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>No one has ever had the boldness to say that he is life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Only the Lord Jesus said it, and He even said it repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He could say this because only He is really the life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He is so great and so transcendent.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After the Lord said this word, He fulfilled it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After He said, I am the life, Peter, one of His disciples, heard this word and received it.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>From that time on Peter had the transcending life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He was a fisherman from Galilee, an uneducated man and a layman Acts 4:13 , but after he received this transcendent life, he became a transcendent person.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Later, in 2 Peter he wrote, His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness...through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature 1:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If Peter had not experienced all these things, he would not have been able to write such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He was a Galilean fisherman, yet he was able to say that he was one who received God s life and partook of God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Today many families like to have dogs and to play with them.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>However, I do not like dogs because no matter how good they are, they do not have the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I like my grandchildren.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Some of them are seven or eight years old, and others are just two or three years old.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They scream and crawl on the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I enjoy seeing them, playing with them, and letting them lean on me.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>However, if I saw a puppy in the house, I would immediately drive it out because we are not of the same species.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I am a man, and it is a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It does not have my human nature, and I do not have its dog nature.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The two of us cannot communicate.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>However, my grandchildren and I are of the same nature.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When they call me, Grandpa! my heart leaps with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When I embrace them, they are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>As Christians we have the divine nature and are able to fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is truly a marvelous matter.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The reason we have God s life and nature is because Jesus Christ came into us and dispensed God s life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>From that time on, we have had the sense that we are very close to God and may spontaneously call Him, Abba, Father!</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>When we call on Him in such a way, we sense sweetness, joy, and comfort within.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The more we call on Him, the more we sense that He is living in us and that we belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is because we have His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We can live by His life and enjoy His divine life.</S>
