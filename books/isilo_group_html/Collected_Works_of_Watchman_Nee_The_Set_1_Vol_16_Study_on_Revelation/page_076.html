Revelation 20:13</H2><P>"And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, each of them, according to their works." </P><P>"Death and Hades gave up the dead" means that the spirits of men are delivered up. Some say that the words "the sea gave up the dead" also refer to the spirits of men. Yet we have never heard that one's spirit goes to the sea after he dies. "The sea gave up the dead" means that the sea gives up the spirits of those who died in the previous world. Because the abyss is connected with the sea, it is actually the place where dead spirits are imprisoned.</P><P>"They were judged, each of them, according to their works." The future judgment is based solely on works. Hence, this is mentioned twice (20:12-13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Revelation 20:14</H2><P>"And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire."</P><P>Death is the last enemy (1 Cor. 15:25-26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Revelation 20:15</H2><P>"And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire."</P><P>The opposite of this verse means that if anyone's name is recorded in the book of life, he must be saved. The judgment at the great white throne is according to certain principles. Those who perish, perish because of their evil deeds (not because of their good deeds), and those who are saved, are saved because their names are written in the book of life (not because of their good deeds either).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. A NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH<br>(REVELATION 21:1-8)</H2><P>(Please pay close attention to the following sub-headings.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A General Outline<br>of the New Heaven and New Earth<br>(Revelation 21:1)</H2><P>"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more."</P><P>The old heaven, the old earth, and the old sea have all passed away. Now there is only the new heaven and the new earth; there is no mention of a new sea. Isaiah 65:17 says that God will create a new heaven and a new earth, but that which follows verse 17 concerns the millennial kingdom. The main purpose of Isaiah 65 is to compare the people who are blessed by God with other people. Verse 17 says that God will create a new heaven and a new earth; this is a proclamation. Verses 18 through 25 describe the conditions in Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom. Also, the new heaven and new earth mentioned in 2 Peter 3:13 are the same as those mentioned in Revelation 21:1.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Relationship between the New Jerusalem<br>and the People on the Earth<br>(Revelation 21:2-4)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Revelation 21:2</H2><P>"And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband." </P><P>This city is holy. Formerly, God had only a temple, but not a holy city. He lived in that temple; but now, the holy city replaces the temple, and all of its people are priests. The old Jerusalem was made by men and has become old; the New Jerusalem comes down out of heaven and is new. In the millennium the New Jerusalem will be in the air; it will not come down to the earth, because at that time there will still be the old Jerusalem on earth. But when the New Jerusalem does come down out of heaven, she will still be wearing her new adornment. At the wedding dinner of the Lamb, she is the bride. Now it seems that by adorning herself a little bit, she becomes the wife of the Lamb for eternity.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_075.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_077.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 16: Study on Revelation &nbsp; pg 76</div><br></body></html>
