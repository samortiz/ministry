<P>Our justification by resurrection is the positive side of the matter. He resurrected to impart a new life to us. This life is as righteous as the Lord. This life does not sin. When God sees this life, He reckons us as righteous. Christ's resurrection not only imparts a new life to us; it also hides our life with Christ in God (Col. 3:3). On the subjective side, Christ as our life is dwelling within us. We received this at the time of our regeneration. This life is the resurrection life. On the objective side, we appear before God in Christ and have a new position so that God sees us just as He sees Christ. The way God sees Christ is the same way He sees us. Therefore, when we come before God's presence, we do not have to tremble. We can say, "Hallelujah!" We may draw near to God with boldness and fullness of faith. We may say to God, "You are our Father, and we are Your children." It is God who justifies us; who is he who condemns? When we appear before God in Christ, nothing is more beautiful than we are. Hymn #299, stanzas 3 and 4 say,</P><P CLASS=HBODY>So nigh, so very nigh to God,<br>I cannot nearer be;<br>For in the person of His Son<br>I am as near as He.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>So dear, so very dear to God,<br>More dear I cannot be;<br>The love wherewith He loves the Son,<br>Such is His love to me.</P><P>The life within us is given to us by Christ. Our position before God is also given to us by Christ. So many Christians do not grow because they are under the accusation of their conscience, and they have no freedom before God. Once there is a hole in the conscience, faith leaks out. When we pray and our conscience is under accusation, our faith is weakened.</P><P>Our justification by the blood resolves our problem with sins. God looks upon us as though we have no sins. Our justification by resurrection means that Christ has become our life within. We occupy a new position in Christ before God, the position which Christ occupies before God.</P>
