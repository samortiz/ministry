   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE YOUNG SERVING ONES NEEDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE FEARFUL OF BEING PROUD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The future of the young serving ones is limitless.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord will give a considerable number of them important services in the carrying out of His commission.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, when they are given some responsibility, their pride will become a source of temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, they should be fearful of their pride.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1950 Brother Nee went to Hong Kong and brought a revival to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He sent me a telegram asking me to come to Hong Kong and help lead the service of the church, including that of the elders, co-workers, and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I was absent from one of the revival meetings, but during this meeting Brother Nee said, Although Brother Lee has been used by the Lord, he is not proud.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Please forgive me for speaking about myself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Nee spoke this word as a warning so that those who had handed themselves over to the Lord would have no expectation of a future for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord will have mercy on those who truly give themselves to Him, and He will perfect them to be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, once a person becomes useful, it is easy for him to become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Pride is a worm that destroys us by devouring us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The brothers who became a problem were not fearful of the element of their pride.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When they were with us, they listened to me but despised the other co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is pride.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the future you may be supplied with a great measure of grace by the Lord, and He may perfect you in order to use you to a great extent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After accomplishing such a work, you should still go before the Lord and say, I am an unprofitable slave; I have done what I ought to have done cf.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Luke 17:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even if you have seen the vision of Christ, you should not think that others have not seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is wrong to say that others have no vision.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you have seen a vision and know the Lord s way, you will not intimidate others or promote yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, you should walk quietly according to the Spirit and minister Christ in the meetings of the church in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a brother is raised up in a local church, other churches will learn about him, even if he has a quiet manner.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The churches will surely hear about him and welcome him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this way he will be blessed, and the churches will also be blessed, supplied, and established through him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, he should be fearful of becoming proud or of seeking a way to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The doors that the Lord wants to open will be automatically opened.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May the Lord cover me with His precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have the position to speak such a word, because I am leading the churches, and I have never sought to advance myself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was not my intention to work in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1938 I received two checks: one check was for my traveling expenses to America, and the other was to cover one year s expenses for my family.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that time I did not have the Lord s leading to go to America.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But twenty years later, in 1958, by the Lord s sovereign arrangement I was invited to London and Denmark, and I passed through America.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you have Christ and can minister Christ, you do not need to look for openings; doors will open for you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Joseph had an abundance of grain, so all the earth came to him to buy grain.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All five continents are open to the testimony of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My only concern is that we are not perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we are perfected, we can be sent out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are too many places in need of ones who can be sent.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It would not be too much to send three or four hundred to South America.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many places in Europe are also waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must always be afraid of arrogance and pride, especially if we have some spiritual constitution and gift.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must always remain in humility.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>NOT FORMING PARTIES</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>WITHIN THE UNIQUE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have often considered the incident with the brothers who stirred up the trouble in Taiwan, because it left a great wound.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Not only did the brothers make the mistake of being proud, they also formed themselves into a party.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They had no secrets among themselves, but they were tightlipped with the other co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Body of Christ the members should not form parties.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There cannot be a small Body within the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If there is a small Body within the Body, it will become a cancer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Eventually, the situation among those brothers became cancerous, and it devastated the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether we are in Taichung, London, or Hong Kong, we should not try to gain some who would follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is to form a small circle within the Body, and it is extremely dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is like two sisters who are willing to tell each other their secrets but who are unwilling to speak to their mother.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Relationships like this need to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are in one universal Body, and there should be no small circles within the one large circle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the Body there is no such thing as one member being dearer or nearer to another member.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I began serving the Lord in Chefoo more than fifty years ago, but I do not have any co-workers with whom I have an intimate, personal relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Brother Chang has served with me for over fifty years, and Brother Liu has coordinated with me in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many saints probably think that these brothers are very dear to me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you were to ask them, they would say that I have given them hot and sour soup, not sweet soymilk.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is the same in the United States; I do not have any co-workers with whom I am intimate on a personal level.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There are several co-workers who have left us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some of them accused me of being wrong, while saying that they were right.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is strange that those who say that they are right often have the most difficulty working with others.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But even though I am wrong, I have many co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Nevertheless, I am not intimate with any of them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I do not give them sweet soymilk to drink; rather, I give everyone hot and sour soup.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those who are new full-timers should realize that I do not serve sweet soymilk.</S>
