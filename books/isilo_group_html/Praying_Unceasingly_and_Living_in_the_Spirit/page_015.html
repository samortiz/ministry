IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Our human spirit has been mingled with the Spirit of God. Now the two are one spirit. Our human spirit is the vessel, and the Spirit of God is the content. Our spirit is to contain the Spirit. In order for our spirit to contain the Spirit, we must have prayer. Therefore, before the ushers serve, they must pray to be filled with the Spirit as oil. The same applies to cleaning. Without prayer, everyone who cleans will do his own thing, and no one will supply the Spirit. Such a service is empty. Before we serve in the church, we must pray until we are saturated and filled with the Spirit. Then our spirit will come out when we serve, and we will be able to supply life to one another. This is the secret to serving.</p>
<p>In Romans 1:9 and 10 Paul says, &ldquo;God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers, beseeching.&rdquo; This indicates that our service to God in our spirit cannot be separated from prayer and petitions. If we do not pray, our service will not be in the spirit. Therefore, we must pray.</p>
<p>Some brothers are concerned that although the younger saints are easily stirred up during conferences, their spirit cools down after a few days. The brothers are also concerned that the elderly saints are not easily moved and that their spirit is not always fresh. Prayer is the solution to these two problems. In order for our spirit to be burning and always fresh, we must pray and contact the Lord. Hence, the Bible says, &ldquo;Unceasingly pray&rdquo; (1 Thes. 5:17).</p>
<p>In the past we did not understand how to pray while we were doing other things, such as working or teaching. Now we know that to unceasingly pray means that we need to have a spirit of prayer so that we constantly contact the Lord. In order to achieve this, we first must have set times for prayer. If we do not have some set times during the day for prayer, it will be hard to maintain constant contact with the Lord. In the morning we need to spend some time to pray ourselves into the spirit of prayer. In the afternoon we again need to take some time to pray. In the evening we should again pray ourselves into the spirit of prayer. When we live in the spirit of prayer, we will spontaneously pray in the classroom and in the office. This is the meaning of unceasingly praying. Our experience shows that we need set times during the day for prayer. No matter how busy we may be, we must find time to pray in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening. Without praying, our spirit will not be fresh.</p>
<p>Every morning we should spend time to pray before the Lord, whether it is for ten minutes, fifteen minutes, or twenty minutes. We should not pray for any person, matter, or thing. We should simply contact the Lord and fellowship with Him. If we sense a sin, we should deal with it by confessing it and asking the Lord to cleanse us with His precious blood. We can also spend some time to read the Bible in order to receive the supply. No matter how busy we may be, we should try our best to keep this time for prayer. It is possible that a few mornings we may not have enough time to pray. However, if we consistently do not have enough time to pray in the morning, yet we continue coming punctually to the meetings, we will be in religion. The normal condition of a Christian is to pray for a few minutes every morning. Then later during the day we should always have other times of prayer. We should also find time to pray in the evening. We must pray daily. There is no other way to serve.</p>
<p>If we are persons of prayer, living in the spirit of prayer, we will spontaneously bring those under our care into a living of prayer. If the younger saints are not brought into the spirit of prayer to have a living of prayer, they will not be kept under God&rsquo;s blessing. The only way to remain under the blessing is to be brought into the spirit of prayer and into a living of prayer. It is worthwhile to touch the spirit of prayer and have a living of prayer.</p>
<p>In the past we had the concept that the way to release our spirit was to praise the Lord and call on His name with a loud voice in the meetings. Although we cannot say that this is not the way to release our spirit, the emphasis of releasing and exercising our spirit is on contacting the Lord. Therefore, we need to exercise our spirit twenty-four hours a day. We should even exercise our spirit while we are resting. I can testify that I receive much light from my fellowship with the Lord in prayer while I am resting. This is how to exercise our spirit in our daily life. We should not have the mistaken concept that we can lose our temper and curse people when we are at home and still shout &ldquo;Praise the Lord!&rdquo; in the meeting. Such spiritual conduct is a show and a pretense. We need to exercise our spirit every day by speaking to people with our spirit and doing things from our spirit. We need to exercise until we can do everything from our spirit. This is the way for us to carry out our service. Hence, the Bible speaks of serving &ldquo;in my spirit&rdquo; (Rom. 1:9), serving &ldquo;in newness of spirit&rdquo; (7:6), and serving &ldquo;by the Spirit of God&rdquo; (Phil. 3:3). We must practice to exercise our spirit every day. Whether we are serving children or young people, praying, singing hymns, cleaning, or ushering, we must exercise our spirit, and in order to exercise our spirit, we must pray. Before we do anything, we first need to pray in order to be filled with the Spirit as oil.</p>
<p>The many problems that we encounter in the service of the church are insignificant. The real problem is our lack in exercising our spirit. When we exercise our spirit, our flesh is dealt with, and our temper dissipates. Suppose some sisters are easily offended. The best way for them to overcome their temper is to pray. Prayer is the way to stop our temper. We just need to be diligent to exercise our spirit and pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am about to lose my temper. Lord, fill me. I praise You.&rdquo; Then we will be filled in spirit, our anger will dissipate, and our problem will be resolved. Besides prayer, there is no other way to deal with the flesh, lusts, and temper. The work of the Spirit within us requires our cooperation by prayer. Prayer is the way to use, exercise, and strengthen our spirit. The more we pray, the stronger and fresher our spirit will be. Although it is hard to explain this mystery, we can understand and experience it by praying. We must pray and exercise our spirit so that we can serve God in spirit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Praying Unceasingly and Living in the Spirit &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
