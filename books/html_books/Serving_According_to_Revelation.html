<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of nine messages given by Brother Witness Lee concerning church service. The dates of the messages contained in chapters 1, 2, and 9 are unknown. The messages contained in chapters 3 through 8 were given during a conference held in February 1952 in Taipei for all the churches in Taiwan. These messages were originally published in issues of <em>The Ministry of the Word,</em> printed in 1951 through 1952.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">SERVICE ACCORDING TO REVELATION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF SERVICE</h2>
<p>Our service to God can be divided into service that is according to revelation or service that is natural. Service according to revelation involves meeting God, being shined upon by God, receiving revelation from God, and being burdened in spirit by God. This kind of service is not initiated by us but by God; it is not out of ourselves but out of God. We must meet God and contact God in order to have service that comes from God as the source.</p>
<p>Natural service is different. Natural service is according to our own ideas, views, traditions, or regulations. It also comes from copying or imitating others, and it is often initiated to simply meet the need of a certain situation. Such service comes out of ourselves or out of others but not out of God. This kind of service does not require us to meet God or contact God; it is service that we can do apart from God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SERVICE OF SAUL</h2>
<p>Before Saul received revelation, he thought that he was serving God (Acts 7:58; 8:1). Before he was saved, he was trained at the feet of Gamaliel according to the strictness of the Judaic law, and he was zealous for God (22:3). In his zealousness he persecuted Christians and thought that he was serving God (vv. 4-5). The Lord Jesus spoke of this kind of service when He said to His disciples, &ldquo;An hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God&rdquo; (John 16:2). Saul killed Christians and thought that he was serving God. He did not know that he was resisting the Lord, opposing the Lord, and kicking against the goads (Acts 26:14). Instead, he thought that he was being zealous in his service to God. He had zeal but no light. His service was not according to revelation but according to the law, a service according to the Old Testament and Judaic traditions. He was zealous in his service, but he had no revelation. Until light from heaven flashed around him on his way to Damascus (9:3), he was unaware of his condition, but after the flashing of the light, he knew that he had been zealously but blindly serving God (vv. 8-9, 17-18).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SERVICE OF PAUL</h2>
<p>After the flashing of the light, his service as Paul was wholly according to revelation. In Galatians 1:11-12 Paul says that the gospel he announced was &ldquo;not according to man&rdquo; but that he had &ldquo;received it through a revelation by Jesus Christ.&rdquo; In 2:1-2 Paul also says that he went up to Jerusalem &ldquo;according to revelation.&rdquo; After the shining from heaven on the way to Damascus, Paul&rsquo;s service was different. Previously, his service had been according to tradition; it was copied and learned. Hence, it was natural. After his experience, his service was the result of meeting God and receiving God&rsquo;s shining. His service was according to revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE ACCORDING TO REVELATION</h2>
<p>Everyone who serves the Lord must be clear that the only service that counts before God is service according to revelation. All our service should be according to revelation. Certainly service involving big matters must be according to revelation, but even the seemingly small service of visiting brothers and sisters should be according to revelation. Furthermore, what we say to the brothers and sisters should be according to revelation; it should not be routine or natural. We need revelation concerning what to say, and we need revelation concerning how we should speak. We should not copy or imitate the way others speak, but instead we should speak according to revelation. The only service that is of value is service that is done according to revelation.</p>
<p>The most important matter in a person&rsquo;s serving of the Lord is revelation. Every act of our service should come out of revelation. We should not have outward acts of service to the Lord without inward revelation from the Lord. Our inward revelation must govern our outward acts. If we act according to an outward situation without any inward revelation, our service will only be natural.</p>
<p>Service according to revelation requires light. For example, visiting the brothers and sisters must be the result of fellowship with the Lord, in which the Lord burdens us and gives us a sense that a certain brother or sister needs to be visited. When we spend time with the Lord, and He burdens us in regard to a brother or sister, this sense will govern our actions.</p>
<p>Not only should our visitation be according to revelation, but all our service should be according to revelation. Preaching the gospel should be according to revelation. We should not join the gospel work of the church simply because we hear an announcement from the brothers. We should join the gospel work because we have contacted the Lord and received an inward burden. When we draw near to the Lord and fellowship with Him, we may be touched that just as the Lord has revived us and treasures us, He has this same regard for others. If we have such an inward sense, this revelation will govern our preaching of the gospel. Such service is according to revelation.</p>
<p>Service according to revelation results from drawing near to the Lord and having fellowship with Him. It comes from being touched by Him in our inward feelings and sensing His desire related to a certain matter. When we carry out this desire, our service comes out of the Lord&rsquo;s shining and revelation.</p><h2 class="head1">NATURAL SERVICE</h2>
<p>Natural service does not depend upon fellowship with the Lord, and it can be carried out without any inward sense or burden. For example, some responsible brothers may make arrangements to visit the brothers and sisters, and we may visit them because we do not want to feel bad. This, however, is an indication that we do not have a burden from the Lord. Our visitation, thus, will be related only to outward arrangements and outward needs, not to an inward burden. In other words, our service does not come out of contacting God but from the influence of an outward situation. This kind of service is natural.</p>
<p>Sometimes when we hear that a brother or sister has grown cold and is no longer meeting with the church, we consider visiting them out of a sense of duty. Even though this sense of duty is better than merely accepting the arrangement of others, such a service is still natural. It is not according to revelation; rather, it is based on outward situations, not inner revelation. Similarly, we may hear that a certain brother is sick, and we visit him only because we have some sympathy for him. Such a seemingly good intention is still natural; it is not based on revelation. Whatever has not passed through God or does not come from our contacting of God is merely natural service, no matter how good or necessary it may seem to be; it is not service according to revelation.</p>
<p>When we act without contacting God or letting God touch us, that is, when we act according to outward needs, a sense of duty, or good intentions, the result may seemingly be good, but it will, in fact, be quite different in nature from what comes out of contacting God. One result involves inward shining, whereas the other does not. One result is according to revelation, whereas the other is natural. One result comes out of contacting God, whereas the other comes out of environmental influences.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXAMPLE OF ABRAHAM AND LOT</h2>
<p>Abraham&rsquo;s service to God was according to revelation. He left Ur of the Chaldeans and journeyed from Haran to Canaan. There he pitched his tent and built an altar to serve God. His actions were the result of the God of glory appearing to him. He met God and received revelation from God (Gen. 12:1-8; 13:1-4, 14-18; Acts 7:2-3). All his actions came out of God&rsquo;s appearing and revelation. All his actions were governed by God&rsquo;s appearing and revelation.</p>
<p>Lot, however, did not have God&rsquo;s appearing or God&rsquo;s revelation. All his actions were governed by Abraham&rsquo;s moves, not God&rsquo;s revelation. When Abraham went out of Ur, Lot went with him (Gen. 11:31). When Abraham went out of Haran, Lot again went with him (12:4). When Abraham went to Canaan, Lot went with him to Canaan as well (v. 5). Lot never met God; he only followed a man.</p>
<p>Many brothers and sisters serve God as Lot did. They have not contacted God or received revelation from Him; they have been influenced merely by men, and they are following men and imitating men. When others serve, they serve. When others preach the gospel, they preach the gospel. Such service has little spiritual value, and it will not last long or stand when tested.</p>
<p>Abraham&rsquo;s service came out of meeting God and receiving revelation from God; hence, his service was able to stand. Even though he went down to Egypt in a moment of weakness, his service was still recovered before God (v. 9&mdash;13:4). Lot, however, did not meet God or receive revelation from God; his service was based on his being influenced by another and his following after another. Therefore, it could not stand the test and did not endure. Once Lot entered Sodom, he could not recover his service to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVING ACCORDING TO REVELATION</h2>
<p>Our service must come from meeting the Lord, seeing light, and receiving revelation. We should not do something simply because others are doing it. If we meet the Lord and receive revelation, we will be unable to not do as the Lord desires. Consider the matter of visitation. We should not regard the arrangement of the church merely as a routine and visit the saints accordingly. We still need revelation in order to know how to carry out the matter of visitation and to know what to say when we see the brothers and sisters. In this way our visitation will not only be according to the arrangement of the church but also according to an inward burden and revelation. Apparently, it is the arrangement of the church, but actually, it is related to the burden that comes from revelation. Sometimes, the church may not even have an arrangement, but we still have a burden that comes from revelation. Only this kind of service has spiritual value, and only it will be able to stand the test and endure. We must pay attention to this very important matter; otherwise, our service will be empty and short-lived.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING REVELATION</h2>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;How can we receive revelation?&rdquo; On the one hand, we need God&rsquo;s mercy, but on the other hand, we also must bear the responsibility to seek the Lord&rsquo;s shining and revelation. We must remove everything in us that covers the light and hinders us from receiving revelation. We must condemn our natural zeal, reject our natural service, and turn our heart to the Lord. Then we will receive light and revelation.</p>
<p>In order for a person to have revelation, he must meet God, contact God, and touch God. God is light (1 John 1:5), and in the universe, only God is the source of light. All light and revelation come from Him. When we meet God, we will see light and receive revelation. Revelation is man meeting God; it is God shining His light into man and causing man to see.</p>
<p>In order for us to meet God, we must turn our whole heart to the Lord, wanting nothing more and nothing less than His will. Second Corinthians 3:16 says that whenever our heart turns to the Lord, the veil that covers us is taken away. Matthew 5:8 says that the pure in heart will see God. Hence, absolute consecration and thorough dealings are necessary. Whatever is not purely for God, is not out of God, does not come from meeting God, or is not done through contacting God must be dealt with and rejected. We must desire nothing apart from God, have no veil covering us before God, and have no barrier between us and God. Then we can see God face to face, be shined upon, and receive revelation from Him. When we turn to Him, draw near to Him, and fellowship with Him, it will be easy for Him to anoint His heart&rsquo;s desire into us and give us a sense and a burden. This sense and burden become our revelation.</p>
<p>Natural service can be done according to prior knowledge and past experiences without contacting the Lord. Service according to revelation comes from the immediacy of our fellowship with the Lord in His presence. Once we lose our fellowship with the Lord in His presence, the shining of light and the receiving of revelation are lost as well. Service according to revelation requires that we abide in the Lord, fellowship with the Lord, and seek, look at, and depend on the Lord. Everyone who desires to serve according to revelation must live in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, abide in the Lord, and contact the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH&mdash;<br />
THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the service of the church. We have been greatly blessed, and we have made progress in our service. However, the responsible saints do not have a fundamental and thorough knowledge concerning the way and the content of the service of the church. Furthermore, they do not have much feeling concerning the service of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL MEMBERS SERVING</h2>
<p>The way for the church to serve is for all members to serve. The Bible speaks of the church as the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23; 1 Cor. 12:27), and regarding the service of the church, the Bible reveals that the church is also a Body, the mystical Body of Christ (Rom. 12:4-8; 1 Cor. 12:4-27; Eph. 4:11-12). The Body denotes not only matters related to life but also matters related to function. The function of the church is the function of the Body. The verses in Romans, 1 Corinthians, and Ephesians concerning the church as the Body of Christ emphasize the function of the church in relation to Christ. Function denotes service. Hence, the service of the church is the service of the Body, and the service of the Body is the service of all the members. Therefore, the way for the church to serve is for all members to serve. Every saint is a member of the Body of Christ with a function; therefore, every saint should fulfill his function.</p>
<p>However, many saints do not serve or do not seem capable of serving. Some saints are not clear concerning their salvation, or they have not had a thorough experience of salvation. Others might be cold or backslidden. Still others may not have the heart to serve the Lord even though they have been saved for many years. Although such saints seem incapable of serving or do not want to serve, all saints have the capability of serving and should serve, because they are members of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The responsible brothers need to be clear that the way to serve is for all to serve. In leading the saints to serve in the church, the brothers should apportion the service to all the saints so that all may participate and serve. If the service is not being apportioned to all the saints, the responsible brothers should have a sense that something is wrong. We must see and know the need for all members to serve, and we must even feel compelled to bring all the saints into serving. This will please the Lord. Without a thorough and clear understanding of service, our leading in the service of the church will not be strong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE ENCOMPASSING<br />
EVERY ASPECT OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Since the service of the church involves all the members, the service of the church should encompass every aspect of the church. The content of the church is Christ as life, that is, Christ Himself, and the service of the church encompasses all the functions of the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is more than one member. It has many members, and each member has a function. The service of the church involves the corporate functioning of all the members of the Body.</p>
<p>In our physical body we do not have one member functioning while the other members remain inactive. In a healthy body all the members move when the eyes move; the members do not remain still. It is not possible for only one member to function at a time, nor is it normal for a few members to function while other members remain still, unless some members of our physical body are paralyzed. If only one or a few saints function in service, a church is &ldquo;paralyzed&rdquo; and &ldquo;sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not all the members of our human body look the same, nor do they have the same function. If all the members were the same, it would not be normal, because this is not how a body functions. Likewise, it is not normal if the saints only read the Bible, memorize the Bible, or speak about the Bible to the point that they do not know how to do anything else, because this is not how the Body functions. This does not mean that it is wrong for the saints to read the Bible, memorize the Bible, or speak about the Bible; it means that the service of the church is not normal if the saints only know how to do one thing. All the saints should read the Bible and have a proper understanding of the Bible, but not every saint can expound and teach the Bible. Only a few members are such gifts with this function (Eph. 4:11).</p>
<p>The situation in a church also is not normal if the saints do not care about anything other than praying from morning to evening. This is not how the Body moves. All the saints should pray and inquire of the Lord in all things, but not all the saints can bear the burden of prayer as a service. Such a service can be borne only through the power of the Holy Spirit. The Bible does not speak explicitly of prayer being a gift, but church history and our experience show that some of God&rsquo;s children are needed to serve through prayer. For such ones, prayer is a service. There is a great need in every local church for saints who would rise up and serve through prayer.</p>
<p>In the churches very few saints are given to the service of prayer. Every church should have between ten to twenty saints who are devoted uniquely to the service of prayer, praying not for themselves but for the church, for the brothers and sisters, for sinners, for God&rsquo;s kingdom, for God&rsquo;s work, and for God&rsquo;s gospel. There should be specific prayer even for the literature work. In <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> we mentioned this matter, saying that we hope some would set aside time to pray particularly for this publication (Jan. 1952, no. 7). There is a need for saints to pray for the work in the church, the move of the church, and every detail related to the church. The condition of God&rsquo;s house and of the brothers and sisters is borne upon the shoulders of praying saints. They uphold the Lord&rsquo;s work and His spread, and they bring in His kingdom with prayer. Their prayers should be strong to touch God&rsquo;s throne, shake the authority of darkness, bind what God has bound, and loose what God has loosed (Matt. 16:18-19). There are many aspects of service, but the service of prayer is urgently needed in all the churches.</p>
<p>The Moravian revival that occurred over two hundred years ago is an example. The Moravian Brethren set up a prayer watch around the clock every day. When one group of people finished praying, another group continued. Every day from morning to evening, groups were praying unceasingly. It is no wonder that the Moravian Brethren sent more missionaries abroad in three decades than all the missions combined in the prior two centuries. I believe that this was the issue of long-term, watchful prayer. According to their statistics, one person was sent abroad to preach for every fifty-eight believers who remained at home, and for every person who believed in the Lord at home, two people believed into the Lord abroad. Based on this ratio, the church in Taipei should have more than sixty saints preaching the gospel abroad, and we should gain close to seven thousand believers abroad. However, this is not our situation. If a group of saints would devotedly pray for the preaching and the spread of the gospel, God would manifest His power and glory among us. It would be very good if a group of saints in every district meeting would be involved in the particular service of prayer.</p>
<p>Our service in the church is not normal. The saints pray when we speak of prayer, clean the meeting hall when we speak of cleaning, and preach the gospel when we speak of preaching the gospel. It is not normal for the saints to pay attention only to what is spoken of by the brothers in the meetings to the exclusion of other things. Normal service involves the need to focus on many things at the same time. Some saints need to be led to study the Bible, others need to be led to pray, and still others need to be led to preach the gospel. Some need to be led to clean or to take care of other services. Some saints should go out to preach the gospel, others should gather for prayer, and still others should take care of different services. The saints should not preach the gospel only when we speak of the need to preach the gospel. Nor should the saints focus exclusively on cleaning the meeting hall when this matter is brought to our attention. It is not normal to have a &ldquo;gospel month,&rdquo; during which everyone preaches the gospel, or a &ldquo;visiting month,&rdquo; during which everyone visits the saints. Nevertheless, this seems to be our practice. When we speak of having a love feast for the sake of fellowship, everyone busies himself with the details of a love feast, while at the same time praying less and neglecting the gospel. When we speak of exercising the spirit, all the saints pay attention to this matter, but they drop other practical service. Some saints even begin to view practical service as being in the principle of Martha (Luke 10:38-42). Such a situation is abnormal.</p>
<p>The service of the church involves all the members. The service of all the members is needed for the members to carry out their various functions. Some members should lead the believers to pursue deeper spiritual growth, and others should teach new believers to read the Bible, pray, deal with the Lord, and follow the leading of the Spirit. Some members should lead people to salvation, and others should lead people to serve. Some members should speak the word, and others should offer particular prayers as a supply. If the service of the church is normal, there will be saints praying to support a brother when he is speaking. It is said that several believers were always praying for Spurgeon when he spoke. This is a proper situation.</p>
<p>In the service of the church, every service should have certain ones who bear responsibility to study the service and to lead others in the service. The brothers who rise up in the work of the gospel should study how to contact people, how to speak the gospel, and how to lead the saints to zealously preach the gospel. These brothers should also consider the use of the gospel van, the preparation of gospel tracts, and the posting of gospel banners to advertise the gospel. Some brothers should teach the saints to pray and lead the saints to pray for the various services of the church. Every service of the church needs some saints who are devoted to it and will carry it out with others.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEING THE ISSUE OF<br />
ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH SERVING</h2>
<p>If we see that the service of the church is the service of all the members, there will be a desire in us to see the saints functioning in service in many different ways. This is the way for service to encompass every aspect of the church. If we realize that the service of the church is the service of all the members, we also will encourage the various functions of the saints.</p>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 12:12-27, every member of the Body of Christ has a function. The hand has a function, and the foot has a function. The ear cannot replace the eye, nor can the eye replace the ear. For example, a brother may have a burden from the Lord to visit and help the saints who are sick, but he does not necessarily have the function of expounding the Bible. Another brother may be very good at reading the Bible publicly. When he reads the Bible aloud, his cadence and tone help the listeners understand the meaning of the text. However, it may not be easy for this brother to visit people. Some saints know how to visit people. Such saints are concerned when they hear that a saint is in the midst of difficulties or problems, but they do not have the capacity to clean the meeting hall or to move chairs. It is easier for them to travel three miles to visit a brother than to climb a ladder to clean a window. Other saints may feel that it is easier to clean all the windows in the meeting hall than it is to visit people. These differences indicate that not all members have the same function. If we see that the service of the church depends on the function of all the members, our service will be to bring out their different functions.</p>
<p>We must understand that in the service of the church certain saints can do things that we cannot do, and we can do things that they cannot do. Certain brothers must take care of certain matters. Those who see the revelation of the service of all the members know that others cannot replace their function, nor can they replace the function of others, because every saint is different. The brothers and sisters must be clear concerning this. Those who have not seen this revelation have not seen the service of all the members. The clearer we are concerning the service of all the members, the stronger our feeling will be concerning the service of all the members. This will enhance our function and cause us to encourage the function of the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO PRACTICE</h2>
<p>In practice it is best for the responsible brothers and sisters to come together and pray. Then they should fellowship and consider the spiritual and practical matters in every district. Preaching the gospel and the edification of the saints should also be thoroughly considered. We may also ask the responsible ones in the group meetings to consider these matters and make a detailed list of necessary services.</p>
<p>All the responsible saints should study together in order to find a detailed way to carry out every service. They should consider how to preach the gospel, how to hold a gospel meeting, how to apportion visitations, how to lead the saints to fellowship and to pursue spiritual growth, how to arrange the meeting hall, how to usher and maintain order during the meetings, how to contact and fellowship with the attendees after a meeting, and how to clean the meeting hall. The responsible saints should find a way to carry out every service.</p>
<p>The responsible saints should also supply the necessary tools for each service. We need to consider this matter; we should not be stingy or extravagant. We should not overlook the things that are needed or prepare things that are not needed. There should be adequate preparation of the necessary tools.</p>
<p>The responsible saints should also find saints who will be suitable to carry out each service. This is a difficult and strenuous task that takes considerable time and energy.</p>
<p>The service of all the members can never be carried out solely by a few responsible saints; it can only be carried out by all the saints. We must hold on to this principle. Then according to the needs of the various services, we can bring the saints into their function. We should also consider the desire and condition of the saints before the Lord so that everyone functions. Then the service of all the members of the church will be manifested. The responsible saints must pray much for this matter. We must spend our time and energy to bring in enough suitable persons for every service in each district and thus bring every saint into a service. We must be patient and active to bring the saints in one by one, but we must not be anxious.</p>
<p>We must make a list of the services, find ways to do them, and prepare the necessary tools. Then according to the need of each service, we must identify suitable saints. We should not be the ones taking care of the services; instead, we must bring the saints into the service and let them function. For example, we must identify one or two suitable brothers who can manage the gospel van, give them a few principles, and let them manage it. In the arrangement and management of the church there should be detailed consideration. Then our service will be thorough, and all the saints will be brought into serving together.</p>
<p>Until a person has served, he may not be interested in a service and cannot be responsible for it. After a saint begins to serve, he will become interested and will eventually feel that the service is his responsibility. He will not feel that it is something the responsible brothers asked him to do. Then he will have a heart for the service of the church, and he will feel that the church&rsquo;s affairs are his affairs.</p>
<p>Some saints may not yet be interested in the service of the church. The responsible ones should pray for these saints, fellowship with them, and lead them to know the Lord&rsquo;s constraining love so that they would be willing to participate in the service of the church and to serve the Lord with the other saints. Some saints may not know how to serve even though they have the heart to serve the church. The responsible ones must lead these saints by teaching them to serve. Some saints have a heart to serve and know how to serve, but they still need to be led to serve in coordination with other saints.</p>
<p>If the responsible saints were willing to spend their time and energy to find the way to bring all the saints into serving, we would have the service of all the members. If we do not bring all the saints into serving, we will be short. If we have seen this revelation, we will be compelled to seek the Lord to find a way to bring the saints into service so that they would serve together with us. Whether we bring in one saint per week or a few saints per week, all the saints need to be brought into the service.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEEPER SPIRITUAL GROWTH</h2>
<p>We must also pay attention to deeper spiritual growth. The responsible saints must pursue deeper spiritual growth and stir up the saints to pursue deeper spiritual growth. We must lead the saints to pursue knowing Christ and expressing Christ so that the stature of Christ may increase in the church.</p>
<p>The gospel work is spreading, and more saved ones are being added daily. If we do not have more experiences of Christ, we will not have the spiritual life necessary to maintain a strong testimony. Our service must not consist of many outward activities without a rich inner life, nor should we have zealous excitement without spiritual reality. Our experience of life should be more than outward activities, and our spiritual reality should be higher than our zealous excitement.</p>
<p>Hence, we must not only bring the saints into the basic experiences of life, such as dealing with sins, consecration, obeying the inner sense of life, and being led by the Lord; we must also bring them to know Christ as our life. We must know the indwelling Spirit so that we may experience Christ, and we must know how to fellowship with the Lord and be in His presence. We must bring the saints into deeper spiritual knowledge and experiences. We should lead the saints to know the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and to have deeper experiences of His death. We should lead them to know the breaking of the outer man, dealing with the flesh, being delivered from the self, and being filled with the Spirit. Hence, the responsible saints in the districts and groups should have such a pursuit, such knowledge, and such experiences. The responsible saints in the districts and groups must pay adequate attention to spiritual growth. If a few saints would gather together to fellowship and pray concerning this kind of pursuit, the Lord would produce a hunger in their hearts and cause them to enter into deeper spiritual experiences.</p>
<p>I have a heavy burden concerning bringing the saints into a deeper spiritual pursuit. It is not too difficult to encourage the saints to zealously preach the gospel or to join gospel teams, but it is not easy to lead the saints in spiritual pursuit or into deeper spiritual experiences. Nevertheless, a church that lacks deeper spiritual experiences will not have weight and will not be able to satisfy the Lord. Therefore, we must pursue and enter into deeper spiritual growth. May we all pay attention to this point, and may the Lord prepare our hearts!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<p>There are two main branches in Christianity: old Christianity and new Christianity. Old Christianity includes Roman Catholicism and the Eastern Orthodox Church, and new Christianity refers to Protestantism. There are people in Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism who have been forgiven of their sins and who have been regenerated by the Lord&rsquo;s grace. Thus, they are saved, and they belong to the Lord.</p>
<p>Roman Catholicism has departed from the truth of the Bible, but some who are saved are still there. However, there are more saved ones in Protestantism than in Roman Catholicism. Some may ask whether we are old or new Christianity. We are neither Roman Catholicism nor Protestantism. We are simply saved Christians meeting together to serve God.</p>
<p>We do not want to imitate the practices of Roman Catholicism or of Protestantism. We worship and serve the God in whom we believe according to the Bible. We do not belong to a denomination, nor do we want to become a denomination. We are not a denomination; we are lowly, simple Christians who worship and serve our grace-bestowing God on the ground of the church according to the Bible, the Word of God. We do not care for Roman Catholicism or Protestantism. The living God has put the Bible into our hands, and we believe in Him according to the Bible.</p>
<p>God saved us because we believed into Him, and His Spirit and life entered into us and regenerated us. With such a blessing, we happily serve Him according to His Word, the Bible. We have no stand apart from the Bible. We do not want to be under the influence of any denomination or sect. We want only to serve God according to the Bible. We do not need to oppose the denominations, nor do we want to interfere with their matters. Although we believe that Roman Catholicism and Protestantism have deviated from the Bible in many matters, and we cannot approve of them, there is no need for us to oppose them. This is not our work.</p>
<p>God has not called us to do a negative work but to serve Him positively and in simplicity according to His Word. Even if a person is in a denomination, we will acknowledge him as our brother in the Lord as long as he is saved in the Lord. Even if the denominations misunderstand our ground, we are not a denomination. A person&rsquo;s understanding us is not our basis for acknowledging him as being our brother in the Lord. All that matters is whether he belongs to the Lord, not whether he is Chinese, Caucasian, Protestant, or Catholic. Whether the denominations are willing to serve God with us is not important. We will not interfere with them, and we do not want them to interfere with us. We just want to serve God, to maintain His testimony, and to spread the gospel by His grace. This is our stand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR BASIS FOR MEETING AND SERVING</h2>
<p>We are not a human organization. This, however, does not mean that we are disorderly or loose. We will now consider the basis for our meeting and serving God together.</p>
<p>Any person can meet and serve with us; we will not turn anyone away. However, before we acknowledge that a person is our brother in the Lord, we must be clear that he has been saved, regenerated. Before acknowledging him as our brother in the Lord, we must be clear that he has repented, received the Lord Jesus, and has God&rsquo;s life. Only those who are saved are our fellow believers. The status of a person&rsquo;s salvation is the first item related to meeting and serving together.</p>
<p>The second item related to meeting and serving together is a person&rsquo;s heart for the Lord. A believer&rsquo;s heart for the Lord may differ from our heart, but we will not criticize him. However, if his heart for the Lord matches ours, that is, if he is willing to be a simple Christian, one who does not belong to a denomination and who serves God according to the Bible, we will recognize him as a fellow serving one.</p>
<p>The third item related to meeting and serving together is the teaching of the Bible. Every denomination in Europe and America has a so-called creed. We do not have a creed; we only have the Bible. We base everything on the Bible and settle all questions with the Bible. Even though we may not have a thorough understanding of the Bible, we aspire to practice all that we understand. In the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we understood only a little, but we served God according to what we understood. However, the more we have seen in the Bible, the more our service has progressed. There is no fixed practice among us, because we base everything on the Bible. We will not practice a teaching that we do not see in the Bible, but we endeavor to practice all that we have seen.</p>
<p>The fourth item related to meeting and serving together is the leading and manifestation of the Holy Spirit in the saints. We do not &ldquo;elect&rdquo; the responsible saints among us. The saints fulfill their service and manifest their function by letting the Spirit reign in them and by growing in life. The brothers who have grown in life under the leading of the Spirit are spontaneously manifested as responsible ones. The brothers or sisters who diligently serve God, the church, and the saints by the gracious leading of the Spirit are spontaneously manifested as well. There is no human organization or arrangement among us. We have only the manifestation of the Spirit in the brothers and sisters. A brother who lets the Spirit work in him unhindered, who loves the Lord fervently, who is willing to pay the price to be broken, who lives for the Lord, and who knows the Lord and His ways will spontaneously be manifested as a responsible one. Similarly, those who follow the Spirit&rsquo;s leading and are constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love to labor and serve the church and the saints will spontaneously serve in the church.</p>
<p>The saints who participate in the service are manifested through the leading of the Spirit and the growth in life. All our service arrangements are based on the manifestation of the Spirit in the saints. We do not want human will or human organization. We let the Spirit make things manifest in the saints.</p>
<p>Our experience in the localities proves that there is no organization among us; we have only the leading and the manifestation of the Spirit. The Spirit has absolute freedom among us, and the saints in whom the Spirit is manifested bear responsibility among us. If a brother in a local church lets the Spirit reign in him so that his spiritual growth and progress are evident, he will be manifested as a leading one among the saints in his locality. No one will object to this; instead, all will praise and thank the Lord for raising up such a brother to care for the church and shepherd the sheep. When a brother is manifested by the Spirit as an elder, the Spirit will immediately confirm in the saints that he is one who possesses Aaron&rsquo;s budding rod with the authority of life (Num. 17:8). The saints who let the Spirit work in them are the leading ones among us. Every saint among us has the opportunity to develop the grace that has been given in an unrestricted and unhindered way.</p>
<p>We do not have organizational limitations, because we are not an organization. In the churches we are not waiting for responsible ones to finish a &ldquo;term&rdquo; before other responsible ones can be added. If a brother stops loving the Lord, becomes cold or backslidden, no longer pursues the Lord desperately, or does not progress spiritually, he will not be a responsible one even if his &ldquo;term of office&rdquo; has not come to an end. No one who bears responsibility among us has a &ldquo;term of office&rdquo; or a &ldquo;term limit.&rdquo; We do not have the dead regulations of human organizations. There are only the leading and manifestation of the Spirit.</p>
<p>If some brothers in a local church love the Lord, and they are willing to accept the Lord&rsquo;s dealings and run in the spiritual course, they will spontaneously become responsible ones in their locality. If the elders and deacons do not similarly pursue, they will fall behind. It is possible for those bearing responsibility to fall behind, even if they are currently running well. We are not bound by the restrictions of dead, organizational regulations. The responsible brothers and sisters in the various localities cannot hinder the leading and manifestation of the Spirit in the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Consequently, the responsible brothers in the churches should not think that they have been &ldquo;appointed for life&rdquo; to be an elder or deacon. Such an attitude is wrong. An elder should bow his head and praise the Lord for His work of grace if the Spirit manifests other brothers who love the Lord more and are more spiritual. An elder should be willing to let such ones take the lead. We must let the Spirit have the full ground and absolute freedom among the saints.</p>
<p>The authority of the church is in the hand of Christ, the Head of the church. It may be that He has not yet gained those who are closer to His heart; hence, He can only put the administrative oversight of the church into our hands temporarily. Then, when He gains those who are more according to His heart and who give the Spirit more ground in their being, He can establish them as authorities in the church. Our human hands cannot limit the work of the Head. In every locality the responsible saints must firmly follow this point. We must never use our position of authority to limit the Lord&rsquo;s leading in the saints or their spiritual development. We must give the saints the opportunity to develop the grace that they have received.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT CONSIDERING POSITION AND HONOR</h2>
<p>There should be no consideration for position and honor among us. Anyone who bears responsibility in human society is granted position and honor. However, position and honor in the church are not a glory but a shame. It is shameful for a brother or sister to seek position, honor, and fame; this is something that we condemn. Among us there are only labor and loss, not position and gain. Serving ones must not covet; they should only sacrifice. Our loss is our gain, and our lowliness is our position. We should only love, serve, and labor for the saints. We should sacrifice for them. We should not expect the saints to love, praise, exalt, honor, or repay us. This is the proper intention and attitude of the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones.</p>
<p>Every responsible one should reject thoughts of position and honor. We must be free from feelings for position and honor. I feel uneasy when the saints address a brother as Elder So-and-so. Such a title shows that the saints have a concept of position. Although the saints do not speak of a brother as Pastor So-and-so, they feel uneasy about addressing an elder merely as a brother. Consequently, they use <em>Elder</em> as if it were a title. This is a human concept related to position. According to the Bible, the eldership is a service related to maturity. The Bible does not indicate that the word <em>elder</em> is a title. Addressing a brother as Elder So-and-so proves that some saints still have a human concept of position. Such a concept should not be among us. It must be completely removed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PURSUING TRUTH AND LIFE</h2>
<p>The truth of the Bible is the foundation of the believers and the church, and the divine life is the content of the believers and the church. In order for a church to have a firm foundation and rich content, the saints must have an adequate knowledge of the truth and a sufficient experience of life. Only the truth of the Bible can make us firm and accurate, rather than excessive, and only life can make us rich and living, rather than dead or dull. When we have both truth and life, our service will be firm, rich, accurate, living, and full of light and spiritual reality.</p>
<p>Therefore, all the responsible saints should pursue to know the truth of the Bible and to grow in life. In order for our service to render spiritual help to the saints, we must know the truth and have experiences related to dealing with sin, being led by the Spirit, living by the Spirit, experiencing Christ, and praying to fellowship with God. We must also know the truth and have experiences related to taking the way of the cross, being broken, and dealing with the flesh and the self so that the Lord may reign in us and fill us. We must have specific and thorough experiences in these matters of life.</p>
<p>The elders and deacons should have such experiences, and they should pursue to know the truth of the Bible. They should have an overall understanding of the Bible and know the principles of the Bible and the mysteries of the truth. Without this, our leading of the saints will not be proper, and our decisions concerning church affairs will deviate from the truth. This means that we must be well-read in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH SERVICE SUPPLYING LIFE</h2>
<p>The purpose of the service of the church is to supply Christ as life to others. This cannot be achieved merely by taking care of the details of outward matters. Often, the matters that we take care of are without spiritual value, because we do not supply the life of Christ to others through them. If our service is normal, we will supply the divine life to others in all the affairs of the church that we touch. This point is very serious. Merely accomplishing a church service does not make the service successful. The services are not our goal; rather, the services are the means to supply the life of Christ to others. The elders and deacons must pay attention to this point and practice it.</p>
<p>For example, the saints who sell books in the bookroom should not have the air of department-store salesmen. They should supply something spiritual. The saints who serve in book sales should be polite and loving, and they should seize the opportunity to fellowship with those who buy books and to supply something spiritual to them. In this way they will not only sell books of letters but also supply the living Christ. A person who comes to buy a Bible can be supplied with the living Word, Christ.</p>
<p>Our business office should not be like a bureaucratic government office. The saints serving in the business office should not take care of things like common government officials. This is not valuable. Instead, those who serve should seize the opportunity to supply Christ to the brothers and sisters and to the unbelievers. Then our service will have spiritual value.</p>
<p>Sometimes the elders handle church affairs like bureaucratic officials, not like serving ones who supply life. The elders should seize every opportunity in their contact with the saints to supply life to them. Even when giving hospitality, the elders should have fellowship with the saints who are being received and should supply life to them. The responsibility of the church is not focused on matters or work but on supplying life. Every aspect of our service should be a means for people to gain the spiritual supply of Christ&rsquo;s life. Our service should be different from handling business matters in the world.</p>
<p>Every service in the church is for us to contact people, to give us an opportunity to transmit the life of Christ into others. Regrettably, we often miss these opportunities. For example, the baptismal service often does not render a spiritual atmosphere to the persons being baptized. Rather, the saints in this service exhibit an attitude that they are merely doing things. In addition, the ushering saints are often harsh and strong; they do not express the meekness of Christ so that people can smell the savor of Christ. The services in the church are not monumental, but they are opportunities for us to supply and minister Christ to others. If we want to supply and minister Christ to others, we must be filled with Christ and allow our outer man to be broken. Only in this way can we express Christ so that those whom we contact can touch the life of Christ and can receive the spiritual supply.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">IMPORTANT POINTS<br />
RELATED TO OUR SERVICE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TOUCHING LIFE</h2>
<p>Serving according to right and wrong is a common problem in the church service. As believers and serving ones, we have the Lord as our life. We love the Lord, fear Him, and are being shined upon and taught by Him, but we still have the flesh and our natural disposition. As serving ones, we still have conflicts and disputes because we live in the flesh according to what is right and what is wrong. Living in the realm of right and wrong is not an easy problem to solve. We must know how to deal with this matter before the Lord.</p>
<p>The matter of right and wrong is not related to life; it is related to death, which is the opposite of life. According to the Bible, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was next to the tree of life, and the issue of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was death (Gen. 2:9, 16-17). Hence, neither good nor evil is related to the tree of life. We often regard evil as being equivalent to death and regard good as being equivalent to life. God&rsquo;s Word, however, reveals that both good and evil are related to death, not life. Both good and evil are death. Thus, touching good or touching evil is the same as touching death.</p>
<p>Man fell because he did not contact the tree of life according to God&rsquo;s desire. Instead, man followed Satan&rsquo;s enticement and contacted the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and this brought in death (vv. 16-17; 3:1-19). Good and evil are the same as right and wrong. Good is the same as right, and evil is the same as wrong. Hence, right and wrong belong to good and evil and bring in death; right and wrong are the opposite of life. If we pay attention to right and wrong, we will touch death and be in death; we will not touch life.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s will is for us to touch life. Satan&rsquo;s scheme is for us to touch right and wrong. The issue of touching life is life, but the issue of touching right and wrong is death. Therefore, when we encounter matters that are related to right and wrong among the saints, we should not try to solve these matters by being in the realm of right and wrong. Instead of paying attention to matters according to right and wrong, we should bring the saints into the light of life in order that they would accept the dealing of life. Right and wrong always cause us to touch death. Even if problems related to right and wrong are seemingly resolved, the issue will always be death. We can touch life only by being in the light of life and by accepting the dealing of life. Life always swallows up death. If we touch life, life will swallow up any death related to right and wrong. This is a clear principle. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, disputes among brothers arise because one brother thinks that he is right and that the other brother is wrong. The brother who thinks that he is right will argue boldly, but the second brother often is not convinced and is not willing to admit that he is wrong. As a consequence, such brothers often bring their argument to the elders. Brother A then accuses Brother B, and Brother B accuses Brother A. How should the elders solve such a problem? If they do not understand spiritual matters or know that right and wrong are the opposite of life, they will touch the realm of right and wrong in hope of solving the problem, but the issue will be death.</p>
<p>If we understand that both right and wrong are the opposite of life, we will not attempt to solve problems that are related to the realm of right and wrong. Instead, we will bring people to the Lord so that they may see whether the Lord within them approves of their dispute. Then it will be easy to lead them to accept the dealings of life in the light of life. When the light of life shines on the saints and when they are dealt with in life, they drop their arguments, their problems are solved, they gain life, and they grow in life.</p>
<p>Here is another example. One day a sister spoke to me about a dispute with her husband. Although both the sister and the brother were good saints, I sympathized with the injustice that she was suffering. According to my natural man, I could have said that her husband was wrong. However, saying this would have been to fall into the realm of right and wrong, without rendering her any spiritual help in life. It is useless to deal with right and wrong, because it does not lead to life. When we touch right and wrong, we fall into the realm of right and wrong, and as a result, everyone involved is brought into death.</p>
<p>In order to help this sister, I said, &ldquo;Sister, from what you have spoken, I could say that you are right. But the Lord does not want me to say that you are right and that your husband is wrong. Rather, He wants me to ask if your dispute with your husband is of the Holy Spirit and spiritual or if it is of the flesh and fleshly? Did the Lord want you to quarrel with your husband, or was that your decision? Have you brought this situation to the Lord in prayer? Have you asked the Lord whether He is pleased with your quarreling and whether He supports you? You have told me the details of your quarrel, but have you told the Lord, and have you asked Him what He would say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then her countenance changed, and she said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I have not prayed since the day that I quarreled with my husband, and I have even been unable to pray. I know that this is wrong and not pleasing to the Lord, but I am a human being. How can I admit defeat? He is wrong. Even though I do not feel peaceful when I quarrel, how can I not quarrel? What should I do?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I cannot judge matters according to right and wrong, and I cannot offer you words based on right and wrong. You have an inward sense from the Lord, and He is operating in you to make known what pleases Him. You should submit to Him because of His love for you.&rdquo; Then her whole being relaxed, and I prayed with her to bring her to the Lord.</p>
<p>She prayed with tears, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I do not feel that I am wrong before my husband, but I feel that I am wrong before You. I sensed from You that I should not quarrel with my husband, but I acted contrary to Your sense. Please forgive me.&rdquo; In her prayer she touched the Lord, and life swallowed up death. The problem was over. She realized that even if her husband was wrong, she should not quarrel with him. She also realized that this situation was for her to learn lessons before the Lord.</p>
<p>Through our fellowship this sister was brought to the Lord in the light of life, and she touched life. We should not touch matters in the realm of right and wrong. The evil one deceived this sister so that she touched the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and she was damaged by death. Under the Lord&rsquo;s blood she was led to touch the tree of life. The Lord&rsquo;s life supplied her, reigned in her, and operated in her to swallow up death. Thus, she was able not only to stop quarreling but also to be filled with Christ, filled with life. Even her husband was moved to go to the Lord in prayer, to confess his sins, to meet Him, to touch life, and to admit his wrongdoing to his wife. Their problem was solved, and they were filled with the Lord&rsquo;s presence. This is the issue of touching life instead of touching right and wrong.</p>
<p>We often think that we can solve the problems among the saints if we can determine who is right and who is wrong. This may solve a dispute, but it will not help the saints to know their flesh, nor will it lead them to accept the Lord&rsquo;s dealing and touch His life so that they may grow spiritually. Both our rationalizations and our flesh are involved with right and wrong. Right and wrong are always related to our fallen nature. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He brought people to God. He did not answer questions based on right and wrong. When a person meets God, he can recognize right and wrong, transcend right and wrong, conquer right and wrong, and experience life swallowing up right and wrong. The Lord does not want to solve problems in the realm of right and wrong. He wants to swallow up right and wrong with His transcending life.</p>
<p>We must avoid touching right and wrong with the saints. Instead, we should bring them to the Lord so that they may receive help in life. Our natural man loves to judge matters according to right and wrong. This is a problem especially with sisters. Instead of listening to a message, sisters often prefer to listen to those who are talking in the back row. This is a preference of the human flesh. Hence, the responsible ones in the churches should condemn and reject matters that are related to right and wrong. When we know matters related to right and wrong, it is easy to fall into this realm, and the result will be death. We must remember that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is Satan&rsquo;s goal, but the tree of life is God&rsquo;s goal. We should never touch good and evil or right and wrong. We should touch life.</p><h2 class="head1">RESTRICTING OUR TEMPER AND WORDS</h2>
<p>Those who take part in the service and bear responsibilities in the church must restrict their temper and their words. A person without a temper is not very useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. Having a temper, however, does not necessarily make one useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. Useful ones are not without a temper, but their temper has been dealt with by the Lord. In order to be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, our temper must be dealt with. A person who does not have a temper is useless, but a person whose temper has not been dealt with is also useless. A person who is never angry or anxious will not be that useful in the service, nor will a person who is quick to become angry or anxious be useful. In order to be useful in the service of the church, a serving one must be capable of getting angry or of being anxious; however, his anger and anxiety must be dealt with. I hope that we will not be those who have a temper but those whose temper has been dealt with.</p>
<p>The temper of all the serving ones, especially of the elders, must be dealt with. The elders bear the responsibility in the church. They must deal with many chaotic things, which can easily provoke them to anger. Every situation is an opportunity for the elders to lose their temper. No one has as many opportunities to lose his temper as the elders. But the elders must not lose their temper. Once an elder loses his temper, his position, weightiness, function, and value are finished. The elders must have a temper, but their temper must be dealt with and restricted. We should not think that the elders do not have a temper. The elders who have a restricted temper can be good elders. The temper of a good elder can be compared to a punctured rubber ball. Although many problems and situations may push him to lose his temper, there should be a &ldquo;hole&rdquo; in him that enables his temper to leak out.</p>
<p>Although such an elder may be provoked by the saints, his anger will quickly dissipate because he has been worked on by the Lord and broken by the cross. As soon as his anger &ldquo;inflates,&rdquo; it &ldquo;deflates.&rdquo; Only such brothers can be elders, and only such brothers are worthy of being elders. This should be the experience not only of the elders but also of the deacons and the serving ones. Our temper must be broken and restricted; otherwise, we cannot serve the church or the Lord.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our words must be restricted. James 3:8 says, &ldquo;The tongue no one among men is able to tame; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison,&rdquo; and verse 2 says, &ldquo;If anyone does not stumble in word, this one is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.&rdquo; Our words are a test to us. They manifest the kind of person we are and often prove how much we have been dealt with and the lessons we have learned before the Lord. If we fear the Lord and live in His presence, we will not be loose with our words. If we have been dealt with and are learning the lessons, we will be restricted in our words. We can speak for the Lord only when we learn to not speak for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. If we cannot learn how to not speak for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, we are not qualified to speak for Him. If our tongue cannot be disciplined by the Spirit, we will not have the utterance of the Spirit, nor will we be used by the Spirit. If our mouth is not restricted by God, we cannot serve Him, and we are not qualified to serve Him.</p>
<p>Solomon says, &ldquo;When there are many words transgression does not cease&rdquo; (Prov. 10:19). In the church there are many people with many matters. If we speak &ldquo;many words,&rdquo; it is inevitable that we will get into trouble. We may unconsciously spread right and wrong, initiate strife, cause the work of the church to suffer loss, and hurt the life of the saints by being inaccurate or false in our speaking. We must be cautious and restricted in our speaking. We should examine whether our words are correct, accurate, and spiritual, and we should examine whether the place and the time of our speaking are fitting and whether the audience is fitting. When we speak, we must be restricted and led by the Lord with regard to the content, the place, the time, and the audience. Otherwise, we will utter &ldquo;many words.&rdquo; This may seem trivial, but it is quite important and worthy of our attention. We must be watchful.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">IMPORTANT POINTS<br />
RELATED TO OUR SERVICE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HAVING OPINIONS</h2>
<p>Those who serve the Lord must learn to not have opinions. In serving the Lord, we should work and not talk, laboring without opinions. Human opinions are God&rsquo;s enemy. It is dreadful when those who are involved in the service of the church only have opinions and words but cannot labor, sacrifice, and serve.</p>
<p>Serving ones who have never sacrificed often give opinions. Similarly, serving ones who have never labored often suggest methods for doing things. This is not right. In a normal situation there should be labor and service rather than opinions and suggestions. The fewer empty words in our service, the better. Service is not a theoretical matter; it is practical, and we must know how to practically carry out every aspect of the service in order to serve. Only methods that have been tried will be practical.</p>
<p>According to the book of Acts, the service of the apostles was not based on opinions but on labor and sacrifice. As the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones, we need to imitate this. The service of a church is beautiful when many saints labor and sacrifice without expressing opinions. It is disturbing to see a church that is full of opinions and loose talk. Opinions and loose talk issue in death, but labor and sacrifice cause people to touch life.</p>
<p>I often ask saints who offer their opinions or suggestions to practice them. This reduces the problems in the church and helps the saints to learn to labor instead of expressing opinions. For example, when a brother suggested that we dust the lamps in the meeting hall, I responded that it would be good if he could come to the meeting hall once a week to dust. When a sister told me that the saints were sitting too far back in the meeting hall, I said that she should come and sit on the front row. I say such things to help the saints realize that they need to set an example instead of giving opinions. If we see that the lamps in the meeting hall need to be dusted once a week, we should dust them, and if we see that the saints are sitting in the back of the meeting hall, we should take the lead to sit in the front. We should practice, not talk. We should do more and offer fewer opinions. This may seem to be a small point, but it deeply affects the service of the church. We must look to the Lord for His mercy and seek His deliverance from our opinions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVING ACCORDING TO A COMMON WAY</h2>
<p>Our service in the church involves coordination with the saints according to a common way. Our personal way of doing things is useless. We must serve according to a common way that is the result of fellowship. In some churches there are hundreds of saints who serve together. If everyone serves according to his own way, our service will be chaotic, nothing will be accomplished, and many saints will stop serving. The services in the church must be carried out according to a common way. This will result in the harmonious coordination of the saints, and the saints will be preserved in the service.</p>
<p>In every church the responsible brothers should spend time to determine the needs related to service. Then the brothers should meet with the saints who are responsible for each service to find a way to carry out that service. The way must be according to the teachings and principles in the Bible. We should never adopt a way that is not according to the Bible. Furthermore, the way to carry out a service must be according to the actual need. It should not involve something idealistic or impractical. After determining a way to carry out different services, we should inform the saints so that their service can be according to the common way that has been fellowshipped by the church, not according to any personal way.</p>
<p>For example, when the methods to handle the affairs related to the church business office have been carefully considered, the deacons must not bring in their own way. There should be a common way to process incoming mail and telephone calls. There should be a common way to respond to reports concerning problems and to requests for prayer. There should be a common way to respond to requests to borrow books and to inquiries concerning the saints. All the affairs of the business office must be handled according to a common, detailed way, not according to anyone&rsquo;s personal way. If every saint has a different way, how can the business office be taken care of properly? We must have a common way when many saints serve together. The brothers bearing responsibility in the churches should learn to serve according to a common way and lead the saints to serve in the same way.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT DOING THINGS BY OURSELVES</h2>
<p>Most people prefer to do things by themselves; they do not like to work with others or to teach others how to do something. They feel that they can do things better and that others will do a less than perfect job. This is the natural disposition of most saints. They prefer to do things by themselves and do not want to be burdened with serving together with others. This natural disposition must be broken when we serve the Lord. When we serve the Lord, we must serve with others, bring others into the service, and teach others how to serve. Bringing others into the service is the way for us to serve in coordination with the saints.</p>
<p>For example, it is not good for a brother to visit the saints by himself. He should fellowship with one or two saints, share his feelings with them, pray with them, and visit the saints with them. When the saints with whom he is fellowshipping have a similar desire to serve by visiting the saints, he should bring more saints into this service through fellowship. After a period of time, a considerable number of brothers and sisters will be willing to serve in visitation through his leading. This principle applies not only to visitation but also to preaching the gospel and to other church services.</p>
<p>In our service to the Lord we must bear personal responsibility, but we must also bring others into serving in coordination with us. We can lead others, or we can be led by others, but we should never do anything by ourselves. When we lead others or are led by others, we can learn spiritual lessons and receive the necessary breaking. A sister may be loose and unrestrained when she serves by herself, doing whatever she wants without restrictions. However, she cannot be loose when she serves with other saints; she must be restricted. We must pay attention to this point in our service.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO POINTS RELATED TO ELDERS</h2>
<p>I would like to consider two points related to elders.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Shying Away<br />
from Bothersome Saints</h2>
<p>The elders must have a disposition that is open to being bothered. Elders must not grow weary when saints bring their problems to them, nor should they be bothered by incessant questions. If the saints feel free to bother an elder, he is qualified to be an elder. If the saints in a local church do not visit an elder very often, he must not be a good elder. If he is good, the saints will bring their difficulties and problems to him for guidance, advice, and intercession. This is needed in every local church.</p>
<p>The elders must be concerned about the saints and should not fear being bothered by the saints. An elder should encourage the saints to fellowship about their difficulties and problems. Some elders, however, do not like to be bothered. They do not like to work or to bear heavy burdens. They ignore, avoid, or politely decline the saints who come to them. As a result, the saints stop coming to them, and the elders are at ease and relaxed, bearing no burden and having nothing to do. In a sense, they have lost their qualification to be an elder. An elder must love the saints from the heart and be concerned about their affairs. He must learn to open to the saints, to care for their problems, to bear their heavy burdens, to comfort them at any time, and to care for them as a father and an older brother. Such elders are needed in all the churches.</p>
<p>In every church there are saints who need help in spiritual matters, including pursuing the Lord, consecration, dealing with sin, praying, fellowshipping with the Lord, being led by the Lord, being broken, experiencing the cross, living in the spirit, and following the Spirit. No speaking from the podium can meet all the needs related to these spiritual matters. For this there is a need for daily leading.</p>
<p>There are also many saints who need help to solve practical problems. Some saints have family problems, some have work problems, some do not have a place to live, some are sick, and some are needy. The saints need the help of the elders. Many young brothers and sisters are in desperate need of care and guidance concerning marriage. The elders must consider the proper way to lead the young saints in this matter. The elders should find a way that pleases the Lord and does not take the way of the world. Hence, the elders in the churches must be open to the problems of the saints. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace, the elders must give the saints suitable leading, guidance, and help. An elder should never be afraid of trouble or burden.</p>
<p>One of the qualifications of an elder is to be hospitable (1 Tim. 3:2). To be hospitable is to be willing to receive guests. The principle for receiving guests is to be loving and to be willing to be bothered. It is very troublesome to receive guests. Those who are not willing to be bothered cannot give hospitality. The Lord uses hospitality as a test to show who is qualified to be an elder, because elders must be willing to be bothered, to bear burdens, and to have a broad heart with empathizing compassions like elderly fathers.</p>
<p>An elder should not be a young man or a &ldquo;child.&rdquo; It is easy for a child to be happy one moment and angry the next. Two children may be unwilling to speak to each other one moment but be happily speaking to each other after a short period of time. This is the disposition of &ldquo;childish&rdquo; elders. They readily blame others but cannot bear burdens. They are not on good terms with Brother A today and have problems with Brother B tomorrow. They are like children. An elder should have a broad heart. He should be a father or elderly brother to the saints. He should be forbearing, and his mood and attitude should not depend on the condition of the saints. Instead, he should love and care for the saints wholeheartedly. Every elder should have these qualifications.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Keen Sense</h2>
<p>Elders also need to have a keen sense concerning the saints. They should be able to sense the heart and spiritual desire of the saints. For example, if the elders sense a desire in the saints to preach the gospel, they can lead the church to move in the preaching of the gospel. It is a regrettable situation if the elders do not have a spiritual sense related to the saints. If the elders are dull, it will not be easy for them to lead the church. Decisions related to the service of the church and the leading of the saints should come from the elders&rsquo; sense concerning the saints. If the sense of the elders is not keen, it will be difficult for the Lord to lead them. If the elders of a local church are not led, the church will suffer immeasurable loss.</p>
<p>A successful businessman knows how to generate business, to work, and to make profit. In the service of the church, the elders administrating the church must know how to generate spiritual &ldquo;business&rdquo; in order to expand the service of the church so that the saints can serve the Lord effectively. When a brother contacts the elders, they should sense his heart and consider how to guide him to serve the Lord. If this brother tells the elders that he has been wasting his time and would like to rise up to serve the Lord, the elders must have a sense concerning his heart and be led in making arrangements for him to serve. The elders must know how to help zealous saints serve the Lord, and they must know how to help cold and backslidden saints rise up to serve the Lord. The elders need to encourage those who do not love the Lord to love Him. The elders should also encourage those who do not preach the gospel to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>Good elders know how to lead the saints, profit the church, and cause the church to grow. If the elders have a dull sense and do not know how to generate spiritual &ldquo;business,&rdquo; they will delay the Lord and damage the church. Hence, elders must learn to love the Lord more, fellowship with the Lord more, and deal with the Lord more so that they may be fresh and living, have a keen sense, and be capable of generating spiritual &ldquo;business.&rdquo;</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIMITING GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 6:9-10; 28:18-20</h1>
<p>We have greatly limited and hindered God in the leading and future growth of the churches and in the work in Taiwan. We are greatly indebted to God. When I consider the future of the churches and the work in Taiwan, I bear a heavy burden. We have been saved by grace, but we are limiting and hindering the Lord in this age, and yet we consider our situation to be normal. We do not sense that this is a serious matter. If we would be enlightened, we would see that it is a serious matter to limit and hinder God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S LEADING</h2>
<p>After the Sino-Japanese War, the Lord opened a great and efficacious door across mainland China for us. The churches were revived and gradually brought onto the right track. We were anticipating that the Lord would accomplish something great in China, but because of the change in the political environment, we came to Taiwan. When I arrived in Taiwan, my heart was full of sorrow because I felt that there was not much to do. After a while I visited the saints who had come from different parts of mainland China and who were then in central and southern Taiwan. After visiting the saints, I realized that the Lord had a work to do here. The Lord had a wonderful purpose in bringing us to Taiwan.</p>
<p>The Lord showed me that many people from different provinces on the mainland had gathered in Taiwan. Hence, if we would preach the gospel, we could gain not only local people but also people from all over mainland China. In terms of geographical location and language, Taiwan is in close proximity to Northeast and Southeast Asia. Therefore, our gospel work would also give us access to Southeast Asia as well as to Japan. I feel strongly that this is the Lord&rsquo;s intention in bringing us to Taiwan.</p>
<p>I shared this feeling with the responsible brothers in the church in Taipei. After the meeting hall on Ren-ai Road had been completed in the summer of 1949, we began the work from Taipei as the center. In August we held a special edification conference. This was the formal beginning of the work in Taiwan. In the last two and a half years the Lord has used the environment to confirm our feeling.</p>
<p>Among us there were brothers and sisters from more than thirty provinces in China. These saints had been under our leading and edification, and they could function for the Lord wherever they went. Among us there were also local saints who had a heart for the Lord and who were willing to live for the Lord. They had a burden to preach the gospel to local people.</p>
<p>The Lord arranged for me to visit Southeast Asia three times. During those visits I fellowshipped with the saints there, and we were mutually supplied. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace, the fellowship and coordination between Taiwan and Southeast Asia will be strengthened in the future.</p>
<p>Among us there are also a few saints who love the Lord and who can understand the Japanese language. In the future they might be led by the Lord to preach the gospel and bear His testimony in Japan. Through these situations the Lord has confirmed our feeling and made us joyful.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S PREPARATIONS</h2>
<p>The Lord also prepared Taiwan. Although this is a small island, it has a concentrated population, a stable environment, and religious freedom. These conditions make it very convenient for us to preach the gospel and establish churches.</p>
<p>The Lord also has prepared convenient transportation in Taiwan. In six days I had three meetings in Kaohsiung and visited five churches. I have even visited three places in one day. The transportation is extremely convenient for the gospel.</p>
<p>The Lord led many saints from mainland China to Taiwan, and He has used the environment to scatter these saints throughout the major cities. Our brothers and sisters can be found in most of the major cities in Taiwan. The Lord has prepared the manpower. Now He can use these saints to spread the gospel for the establishment of His churches.</p>
<p>Many people have had a turn in their heart and are now open to the gospel because of the changes in the world situation. Twenty years ago ten people may have received the Lord when we preached the gospel. Now when we preach the gospel, thousands of people want to receive the Lord. These people know in their heart that they cannot depend on anything in the world, so they are seeking the Lord. The Lord has used the environment to prepare people&rsquo;s hearts.</p>
<p>The Lord has even prepared the necessary funds for us to spread the gospel and establish churches. Most of the saints in Taiwan are government workers or school teachers, and the saints who are businessmen are not so prosperous. Therefore, our financial capacity is very weak. However, the Lord has used the saints in Southeast Asia to make up our lack in this aspect.</p><h2 class="head1">LIMITING THE LORD</h2>
<p>The Lord has prepared Taiwan with its transportation system, and He has prepared the manpower, the funds, and people in general. Hence, we should have accomplished many things for the Lord. However, even after three years the result in the work is not satisfactory because we have limited the Lord. The Lord provided for us, but we have not given Him a way to move. I know that this is our condition, because I have visited all the churches. On the one hand, I am thankful to the Lord because saints are maintaining His testimony in every place by His grace. On the other hand, I feel that we have limited the Lord. The Lord has prepared the environment, the manpower, and the people, but we have limited Him. We need to consider the condition of all the churches and the Lord&rsquo;s desire in the light of His provision.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE</h2>
<p>In Matthew 6 the Lord charged the disciples to pray, &ldquo;Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth&rdquo; (vv. 9-10). After the Lord was raised from the dead, He said to the disciples, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (28:18-19). In chapter 6 the Lord prayed for God&rsquo;s will to be done on earth, because this is God&rsquo;s desire, and in chapter 24 the Lord spoke of His desire for the gospel to be preached in the whole inhabited earth (v. 14). This is the reason that all authority in heaven and on earth was given to the Lord Jesus. Possessing this authority, the Lord charged the disciples to preach the gospel to all the nations until the consummation of this age (28:18-20). This is also His charge to the church.</p>
<p>The Lord has been with the church since the time of His resurrection. He is exercising His authority so that the church can preach His gospel to all the nations. When we spread the gospel, God&rsquo;s will is being done on earth. Only by spreading the gospel can God&rsquo;s will be done on earth as it is being done in heaven. Therefore, God desires that we would spread the gospel in Taiwan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR LIMITATION</h2>
<p>God wants us to spread His gospel, but very few saints have such a deep feeling. Therefore, we are spreading the gospel in a limited manner, both corporately and individually. Although we serve together, meet frequently, and pray that God&rsquo;s will would be done on earth, do we have a strong desire to preach the gospel? How much do we fulfill our function by preaching the gospel? God has commissioned us with the gospel, but we have hindered Him, held Him back, and limited Him.</p>
<p>The Lord has prepared the geographical location, transportation, manpower, people&rsquo;s hearts, and financial support for us. These items are in wonderful coordination together. In the past twenty years of my service to the Lord, I have not seen a situation in which the Lord provided so much. The place where we are is stable and free, transportation is accessible and convenient, the manpower is adequate, people&rsquo;s hearts are hungry, and the financial support is sufficient. However, our function in the gospel is minimal, even though there is no lack.</p>
<p>We have failed the Lord and limited Him; hence, we are indebted to Him. We should not think that we have done so much for the Lord. A brother recently said to me, &ldquo;The number of baptisms in one of our meetings exceeds the number baptized in fifty years in a certain denomination.&rdquo; We do not need to compare ourselves with others, nor do we need to boast. We need to humble ourselves and examine ourselves before God. We did not accomplish anything, and we have nothing for which to boast. On the contrary, we have limited and hindered the Lord. I believe that all the saints would admit that we have limited and hindered the Lord, because we have not allowed Him to flow through us adequately.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR LOOSENESS LIMITING THE LORD</h2>
<p>On the one hand, we need to acknowledge that we have limited the Lord, but on the other hand, we must know how we limit Him. The responsible brothers in the churches often tell me that they are incapable; therefore, they ask me to send brothers from Taipei to help them. They say that the churches are not doing well because no one is sent to help. The responsible brothers say that they are incapable and weak. It is good to admit that we are incapable and weak, but still we must know the source of our problem.</p>
<p>The problem is in us. We need to consider the specific aspects of this problem so that we can go to the Lord and be enlightened through His judgment. Some brothers say that the Lord is limited by our unfaithfulness and by our unwillingness to give Him our heart. Others say that we love the world, are selfish, and are unwilling to abandon and give up the self. Although these factors are present, they are not the source. If we consider the saints among us, we cannot say that they do not have a heart or have not given up the self. Nevertheless, they are not that active in the gospel.</p>
<p>If we sense before the Lord that the above points apply to us, we should judge and condemn these things. Although we often sense that we have these problems, we let them go instead of judging and condemning them. This shows that we are loose. Therefore, the Lord is limited by our looseness. This is our problem. Here is an example of looseness. The meeting is scheduled to begin at nine o&rsquo;clock, but a brother arrives at ten minutes after nine. Perhaps the brother would say that it does not matter that he is ten minutes late to the meeting. However, if we are loose in relation to the time of a meeting, we will be loose in everything. If we are ten minutes late to a meeting, then as a rule, we should have a deep feeling concerning this and come early for the next meeting. Such a response shows that we are strict with ourselves, not loose. How many among us are strict in this way?</p>
<p>If we are under the Lord&rsquo;s light, we will see that even though we love the Lord and have surrendered ourselves to Him, the meetings are not blessed and the work lacks fruit because of our looseness. Many blessings have slipped away in our service because of our looseness. We cannot say that the saints who serve do not love the Lord or have not surrendered themselves to Him. To say this would be an injustice to them. However, their service does not bring in much blessing, and their work does not produce much fruit, nor does it meet the expected goal, because of looseness.</p>
<p>Many things among us have been delayed because of our looseness. When we sense that we still love the world, we do not deal with it because of looseness. If we were stricter, we would deal with our love of the world, and the world would fall away from us. For example, when we anticipate that five hundred people will attend a gospel meeting, but only three hundred attend, we are still satisfied and peaceful. This response shows that we are loose. A strict person would not respond in this way. He would not be peaceful. This is strictness. If we do not have such a response to the low attendance, there is looseness in our being. We have never been pressed or constricted. Because we are loose, we can be satisfied when the attendance is low. If we were strict, we would find the cause instead of letting the matter go.</p>
<p>I have often seen brothers preaching the gospel as if they had a fishing rod and were waiting for the fish to bite the hook. Some brothers do not even use a hook; they wait for the fish to jump into the net. How loose this is! Because of such looseness, they are unable to bring people to salvation, and they miss the opportunities to save many souls. Some saints always use their own dialect when speaking with people. They do not care that others may not understand. This shows that these saints are loose. If they were strict, they would realize that people do not understand their dialect and would speak so that others could understand and receive help.</p>
<p>Those who serve the Lord have indeed paid a price and love the Lord. However, our looseness is a serious problem that has caused us to lose many blessings that we should have received. Our looseness can ruin everything. We should not look for a great problem. As long as there is a hole in a one-gallon bucket, a gallon of gasoline will leak out, even if the hole is as small as the eye of a needle. Our little hole of looseness has caused many blessings to leak out.</p>
<p>When we are strict, our service becomes three-dimensional. When we are loose, our service becomes two-dimensional, and all the blessings leak out. If we would be a little stricter with ourselves, our service would become three-dimensional, and the blessings would be kept.</p>
<p>Many saints are unable to solve their spiritual problems because they are loose; they cannot cross over a spiritual threshold because they are loose. Because we are loose, our meetings often are not up to the standard. Sometimes the wrong hymn is called, or sometimes the correct hymn is called a few minutes late. Sometimes no prayer is offered when there should be prayer, or prayer is offered at the wrong time. This is an indication of looseness. Looseness causes the spiritual &ldquo;air&rdquo; to leak out of our spiritual service.</p>
<p>May the Lord lead us into His light so that we may see the extent of our looseness. We fulfill only twenty percent of our spiritual function, but we are not concerned. Instead of condemning our looseness, we excuse ourselves by saying that we are incapable and that we are weak. We should not be proud, but to continually say that we are incapable is looseness, not humility. If we are incapable, we should weep desperately before God and pray together with others with fasting so that we would deal with our incapability in a serious and thorough way. We say that we are incapable, but we are not desperate before the Lord, and we do not fast and pray. We are incapable because we are loose.</p>
<p>We say that our meetings are not up to standard, but we are satisfied instead of being desperate. As a result, the attendance in the meetings continues to drop. Some brothers say that they cannot preach the gospel because of their love for the world, but they do not deal with the world. Some brothers are fleshly, some have a narrow heart, and some cannot coordinate. The brothers may have some feeling concerning their problems, but they do not deal with the problems. This is the result of looseness. Because we are loose, we do not deal with our problems. As a result, in the church and in the work many blessings are lost.</p>
<p>I believe that the Lord will bless Taiwan. Many local people will hear the gospel and taste His salvation, and churches will be established in various localities. However, our looseness prevents Him from moving freely and quickly. Our looseness limits Him. If a few saints in every locality would be strict with themselves, there would be a drastic change in the local churches. May the Lord enlighten us to see how much our looseness limits Him. Because of our looseness, the Lord has no way to move, His work cannot propagate, and many saints in the church do not receive shepherding or nurturing. The saints attend the meetings, but they do not have the heart to serve God. If the responsible saints were stricter, we would be dissatisfied with our situation. We would pray with fasting and seek the Lord concerning the source of our problems. Then we would see our mistakes and our lack.</p>
<p>Often, because we are so loose, I cannot say Amen to prayers that ask the Lord to work. The Lord wants to work, but our looseness frustrates Him. Our prayers need to change. We do not need to ask the Lord to work; we need to ask Him to shine on our looseness. This is the root of the problem. How can the Lord work if we do not deal with our looseness?</p>
<p>A saint once prayed that we have no way if the Lord does not work. Such a prayer is spiritual, but the person who uttered this prayer does not get up until eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning. This is looseness. If we are loose, the Lord has no way to move. We have been praying for the Lord to work for ten years, but the Lord still does not have a way. Instead of dealing strictly with ourselves, we are relaxed. If we would be a little stricter, the Lord would have a way, our meetings would improve, the work would be blessed, more souls would be saved, and many saints would be edified.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s work in us is hindered by our looseness. We love the Lord, but we are loose. According to what we have offered to the Lord, we should have very good results, but our looseness has canceled everything. Our looseness is a great problem in our service and work.</p><h2 class="head1">CONDEMNING OUR LOOSENESS</h2>
<p>We need to come forward to God and seek His shining so that we would see that all our problems are the result of our looseness. I hope that the responsible saints in every local church would be willing to be enlightened and judged by God and to condemn their looseness. If we would be willing to be enlightened and to condemn our looseness, we would see that our problems are unresolved because of our looseness. We know that we should read the Bible diligently, but we do not do so because of our looseness. We know that we should pray frequently, but we do not do so because of our looseness. We know that we need to be dealt with, but we do not go to the Lord because of our looseness. We know that we need to be broken, but we are not because of our looseness.</p>
<p>Because of our looseness, we cannot see the light, we miss opportunities to learn, we do not make progress, and we miss God and His grace. D. L. Moody once said that he never saw a lazy person be saved. I have never seen a loose person receive light or enjoy grace in a rich way. Many saints lack light and grace primarily because they are loose. They are satisfied with every situation. Everything is the same to them. If we are satisfied with any situation, we will lose God&rsquo;s light and grace. Then we have no way to go on.</p>
<p>Some people are habitually loose. They are loose in their daily living. They are loose when they read the Bible and pray. They are loose when following the inner sense and when bearing responsibilities. They are loose in everything that they do; looseness has become their habit. Such people cannot be strong Christians. They can only be casual Christians. If we want to be strong Christians and have a strong service, we must deal with our looseness. The Lord may want us to deal with the discord that exists between us and a brother, but we are so loose that we put off dealing with it for many days. If we would be a little stricter and condemn our looseness, the Lord would not let us go. He would shine on many things that need to be dealt with and on the problems that we need to address. We would be enlightened to see that our temper, flesh, disposition, boastfulness, and desire to be praised frustrate the gospel and hinder us from fulfilling our proper function in the church and from coordinating with other saints in the service. If we would be willing to condemn our looseness, we would be enlightened and delivered.</p>
<p>If we are willing to obey the light and condemn our looseness, we will receive more light. If we are willing to condemn our looseness, the Lord will expose our problems and remove the limitations. If we desire to meet God&rsquo;s need, we should go to Him and deal with our looseness. We should not be loose in dealing with our wrongdoings or shortcomings. While we are dealing with our wrongdoings and shortcomings, God&rsquo;s commission and our function will be manifested.</p>
<p>Our way to go on depends on our willingness to condemn our looseness. All our problems are the result of looseness. Dealing with our looseness is the only way out of our problems. We do not need spiritual prayers. We should simply ask the Lord to deal with our looseness. Instead of being loose with ourselves, we should, under the light of God&rsquo;s judgment, condemn all the looseness in our being. If we are willing to be strict and to deal with our looseness, God will shine in us and lead us in a strong way. Otherwise, we will have no way to advance.</p>
<p>If we do not judge, condemn, and deal with our looseness, how can the Spirit move or work among us, and how can His power and authority be manifested? If the responsible brothers do not condemn and deal with their looseness, how can the churches have a future? We need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy so that we would be willing to condemn and deal with our looseness.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">OUR DESIRE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 6:8; Judg. 5:15-16; 1 Cor. 12:31; 14:1, 12, 39; 1 Tim. 3:1</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the desire we should have in serving God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S NEED</h2>
<p>Those who know the principles in God&rsquo;s work know that He needs people to work with Him. In order for God to give grace to man or work in man, there must be someone who works and cooperates with God. This is a principle revealed in the Bible. If no one works or cooperates with God, He will not have a way to give grace to man or to work in man. God&rsquo;s desire for man can be carried out only if He finds someone on earth to cooperate with Him. God&rsquo;s intention concerning His work in man can be carried out only if He finds someone on earth who will work with Him.</p>
<p>When God wanted to speak to the children of Israel and to work among them, He first asked Isaiah, &ldquo;Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us?&rdquo; (Isa. 6:8). Although God had already decided to speak to the children of Israel and to work in their midst, He had to find someone on earth who would work with Him according to His mind. God is still calling and looking for people. He wants to preach the gospel unto the uttermost part of the earth so that all the nations could receive His salvation (Matt. 28:19; Acts 1:8; 13:47). However, He must first find and gain people on the earth who will cooperate with Him and work with Him according to His mind. As long as there are those who are of the same mind as God and who are willing work with Him, God&rsquo;s work will be carried out on the earth by them. If God cannot find such ones on the earth, His desire and plan will remain in heaven, but it will not be carried out or fulfilled on the earth. God can carry out on earth what He has planned in heaven only when He finds people who will cooperate with Him.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s principle is not that man would wait for God to work but that He would wait for man to work. God has done everything that is necessary to carry out His work. The problem is that man is not ready. It seems as if we are waiting for God to work, but God is waiting for us to cooperate. God wants to save people on the earth, but He needs to find those who will cooperate and work with Him. God is always ready. As soon as He finds someone to cooperate and work with Him, He immediately begins to carry out His work on the earth. This is proved by our experience and by the past centuries of church history.</p>
<p>We often hope that God would come and work on earth. We have the mistaken concept that we need to petition Him to work. God has a desire to work on the earth, but He has been waiting for us to work with Him on the earth. God wants to spread His gospel all over Taiwan. He wants to have a church in every city in Taiwan. There is no need for us to petition Him to be willing to do this. God is willing to spread the gospel unto the uttermost part of the earth and to disciple all the nations (Acts 1:8; Matt. 28:19). &ldquo;The uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; and &ldquo;all the nations&rdquo; surely include the residents of Taiwan. God has been waiting for a long time to spread His gospel across Taiwan. But whom can He send? Who is willing to go for Him? God still has this question, and He is still eagerly inquiring, &ldquo;Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us?&rdquo; May we hear His voice and respond to His desperate need.</p>
<p>The problem related to God&rsquo;s work on the earth is entirely with us, not with Him. God has prepared everything. He is waiting for us to cooperate with Him. The amount of work that He can carry out depends on how much cooperation we render Him. The strength with which He will carry out His work depends on the degree of our cooperation with Him. Whether He will be expressed through us depends on how much we will cooperate with Him. If our cooperation is weak, His expression will be weak, but if our cooperation is strong, His expression will be strong. His work depends on us and is limited by us. The extent to which His desire can be fulfilled on earth depends on how much we cooperate with Him. His desire is limited by whether we are of one mind with Him. How we need to be of one mind with Him and have His desire in order to meet His need and render Him adequate cooperation! May many among us be one with Him in His inward parts to care for His desire. May many among us have great resolutions in heart and great searchings of heart for His work in Taiwan so that He would have a free way among us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR HOPE</h2>
<p>I hope that we would be aggressive in several items. First, we need to be aggressive to establish bread-breaking meetings in ten localities this year.</p>
<p>Second, we need to be aggressive to preach the gospel. We should begin with the big cities and continue until we reach the small villages. We hope to spread the gospel throughout Taiwan so that every person can hear the gospel of the Lord.</p>
<p>Third, churches need to be established. I hope that in five years every city and town will have a church established with believers serving God, preaching the gospel of the Lord, and maintaining the Lord&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<p>Fourth, the local saints need to be ushered into the responsibilities of the church. The local saints who have a heart for the Lord should be given ample opportunity to learn how to serve in the church so that they can bear the responsibility of the various services of the church. The responsibilities that are currently being borne by saints from other localities should gradually be transferred to the local saints. By so doing, the local saints will become the base of the churches and will continue to maintain the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in a strong way when the nonlocal saints leave. This will free the nonlocal saints to follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading and go to other places when they are discharged of their responsibilities in a church. I hope that in five years the primary responsibilities in the churches in Taiwan will be borne by the local saints. In order to achieve this, the local saints must endeavor to pursue spiritual growth, and they must be aggressive to learn how to bear the various responsibilities in the church.</p>
<p>Fifth, we need to intensify the training of the saints in the church services. We need to lead many people to salvation, to love the Lord, and to pursue spirituality, and we also need to train them to be useful in the church services. I hope that within five years many saints will have been trained and will have learned the lessons in church service. Then in the future these saints will be able to raise up churches, administrate churches, and serve the churches; they will be able to manifest their spiritual function.</p>
<p>The points mentioned above are our hope, not our plan. May this hope match the Lord&rsquo;s desire, and may the Lord fulfill our hope on the earth according to His will in heaven.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PERSONS NEEDED IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In order for us to meet God&rsquo;s present need, to strengthen the church service, and to fulfill our hope, three kinds of persons should be raised up in the churches.</p>
<p>The first kind of persons are the gifts mentioned in Ephesians 4:11, which speaks of the Lord giving some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers to the church as gifts. First Corinthians 12:9-10 speaks of persons with miraculous gifts, such as healing, works of power, and the discerning of spirits. Romans 12:6-8 speaks of persons with ordinary gifts, such as serving, teaching, exhorting, and leading. All of these persons are needed in the church. There is presently a desperate need in the church for those who can speak for God in order to edify and supply the church.</p>
<p>There is a shortage in the local churches of those who can minister the word of God in order to supply the churches. As a result, the church life is not rich, our service is not strong, the light is not shining brightly, and our testimony is not sanctified. In order for the churches to be built solidly and to grow unto maturity, that is, in order for the churches to grow unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13), many people must be raised up to speak for God.</p>
<p>There is also an urgent need in the churches for those who can shepherd and teach. In many localities the new believers are like sheep without a shepherd; they lack care and leading. As a result, they do not function, and instead, they cause the testimony of the churches to suffer loss. In order to remedy this situation, many need to be raised up so that the childish saints can receive shepherding and teaching.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a desperate need for those who can be outlets for the gospel. Although the churches are actively spreading the gospel, very few brothers can give a gospel message. The gospel work needs all the saints to strive together, but these activities cannot be complete without gospel messages. In order for the churches to be strong and effective in preaching the gospel, many people must be raised up as strong and powerful outlets for the gospel.</p>
<p>In order for the gospel to spread in Taiwan, the church needs those who have the gift of healing so that the local Taiwanese people can turn from the many idols that they blindly worship to the true God. It is not hard to receive the gift of healing. It can be received through much prayer in faith. We hope that some local saints will receive this gift so that they can go to the countryside to preach the gospel and heal the sick. This will prove that the Savior whom we preach is the Creator of all things and is full of love and power.</p>
<p>The second kind of persons that the church needs is elders. The church is short of gifts and also short of elders. Elders need to function in many aspects and to strive and carry things out. The elders should be rich in life, mature, grave, broad-minded, and farsighted. They should have self-control, patience, love, and wisdom. They should also be full of ideas and able to manage, teach, and take the lead.</p>
<p>The service in a local church depends on the elders. The responsibilities of the elders include the leading and oversight of services, the management and arrangement of persons, the design and preparation of furniture, and the use and allocation of funds. Hence, those who serve in the eldership are precious and difficult to find. It is not easy to be an elder. Whether a local church is strong or weak, rises or falls, depends on the elders. A local church can advance for a few years without the help of co-workers, but it cannot advance without the leading of the elders. Therefore, strong and useful elders are needed in the church.</p>
<p>The third kind of persons that the church needs is deacons. Deacons serve the church and the saints. The deacons need to love the Lord, and they should also be spiritual, humble, and diligent. It is also important that they be cautious, dignified, calm, and willing to listen. Whether the service is carried out in a spiritual and strong way depends on the person of the deacons and on how many deacons function. Whether the business affairs are handled in a flexible and thorough way also depends on the person of the deacons and on how many deacons function. The qualifications of the deacons are not as strict as the qualifications of the elders, but the number of deacons should exceed the number of elders. In terms of numbers, the church has a greater need of deacons.</p>
<p>The church urgently needs these three kinds of persons. The services in the local churches are not strong because we lack these three kinds of persons. If the churches have gifts, elders, and deacons, the church service would be strong. We need to ask, &ldquo;How many gifts, elders, and deacons are in the churches? How many saints can function as gifts to speak for God? How many saints can function as elders? How many saints can function as deacons?&rdquo; It is hard to find these three kinds of persons in the local churches. When we visit the churches, we carefully observe the brothers to see if any can function as a gift to speak for God, as an elder, or as a deacon. The churches are nearly void of gifts, and the churches are short of elders and deacons. Hence, the churches are not strong. The saints in other localities might consider the church in Taipei to be excellent, but this is not our condition, because there are not enough gifts, elders, or deacons.</p>
<p>The churches cannot be strong if we depend on zeal but do not have enough people in these three categories. The gospel will not go out if we simply sing Hallelujah. In order for the church to be strong and for the gospel to go out, there must be an increase in gifts, elders, and deacons. We need many gifts, elders, and deacons. The churches are not strong because the responsibilities of the church are not borne in a strong way, and the responsibilities of the church are not borne in a strong way because we are lacking in these three kinds of persons. This is a serious problem among us. I hope that the saints in every locality will pray for this matter so that the Lord would give us those who are gifts, those who can function as elders, and those who are willing to serve as deacons.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DESIRE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE</h2>
<p>The raising up of gifts, elders, and deacons should not merely be an item of our prayer; it should be our desire. In every church there should be many people rising up with the desire to become useful gifts and to become elders and deacons. This will meet God&rsquo;s present need for the salvation of many souls and for the fulfilling of our hope.</p>
<p>There is an unprecedented need for the gospel. The harvest is truly ripe and ready to be reaped. Furthermore, there are many believers in Taiwan, but they do not have a proper place where they can receive spiritual care, edification in life, and genuine help. When we see these situations, our heart is grieved. We should have met the needs of sinners by bringing them to salvation. We also should have met the needs of the saints by edifying them so that they would be useful in God&rsquo;s hand. However, we have failed to meet these needs. We cannot blame others for this lack, nor should we justify ourselves. We should humble ourselves to acknowledge our incapability and to condemn our shortcomings.</p>
<p>If we would make an effort, we would be able to meet God&rsquo;s need. However, we have failed to meet God&rsquo;s need, and as a result, many people are aimless. This shortage is not because we do not have enough truth, because our way is wrong, or because we are not standing on the proper ground. There is a shortage because we do not have enough useful persons&mdash;gifts, elders, and deacons. We need many brothers to rise up with a desire to become gifts, to be elders, or to be deacons.</p>
<p>Some saints will say that gifts are from God and that He gives gifts according to His will; hence, if God does not give us a gift, we cannot become one, even if this is our desire. They also say that when God gives gifts, we will receive a gift even if we do not want it. These statements sound spiritual, but in contrast to them the Bible says, &ldquo;Desire earnestly spiritual gifts&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:1). This proves that spiritual gifts can be desired. The Bible also says that we should &ldquo;earnestly desire the greater gifts&rdquo; (12:31). Even the overseership, that is, the eldership, can be desired. First Timothy 3:1 says, &ldquo;Faithful is the word: If anyone aspires to the overseership, he desires a good work.&rdquo; If we can desire to be an elder, we can surely desire to be a deacon. Therefore, we must be clear that we can desire to become gifts and to become elders or deacons.</p>
<p>We should not be so spiritual that we wait passively for God to give us grace. Gifts are obtained through desire. We can also desire to be elders and deacons. Whoever desires these things will receive them. D. L. Moody was a great gift from God to the church in the nineteenth century. D. L. Moody was a country boy who stuttered and was not very sharp. He was neither educated nor eloquent. After he was saved, however, he had a heart to preach the gospel and desired to bring people to salvation. As a result, he was equipped by God and became an eloquent and powerful evangelist. His story proves that we can receive the gifts that we desire.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:1 uses the phrase <em>desire earnestly</em>. The meaning of this phrase is deeper and stronger than just to desire. The meaning of the Greek word is even deeper and stronger than its translation as &ldquo;desire earnestly.&rdquo; This same Greek word is translated as <em>jealous</em> in 1 Corinthians 13:4. The apostle&rsquo;s charge for us to earnestly desire gifts is very strong; it means that we should be jealous of gifts. Therefore, we should not only earnestly desire gifts; our desire should be so strong that we are jealous and that we hate not receiving a gift. If some among us would earnestly desire the gifts to the extent that they hate not being able to receive them, God would surely grant them gifts.</p>
<p>Many saints do not desire the gifts, because they do not love the Lord. A person who does not love the Lord or pursue spiritual things will not have such a desire. Other saints love the Lord and pursue spiritual things, but they do not have a desire for gifts because they are afraid of suffering and hardship. Should a lover of the Lord live for himself or for the Lord? Should a lover of the Lord live for his own enjoyment or for others to receive grace? Should he live for his desire or for the Lord&rsquo;s heart? Should he care for present comfort or for glory in that day? Does that glory attract us? The Lord&rsquo;s love caused Him to become a man, lay down His life, and shed His blood, but does this love encourage us?</p>
<p>If we realize that grace cannot flow to the earth without our being channels and that souls cannot be saved without our function, our only desire would be to have spiritual gifts and ministries. How joyful it is when a person receives a gift to help people know God. How honorable and glorious it is for a person to become an elder who administrates the house of God and leads the children of God to serve and worship Him. How sweet it is for a person to become a deacon in the church and to serve the children of God. If this is our realization, we will eagerly desire gifts and ministries.</p><h2 class="head1">WAYS TO RECEIVE GIFTS AND MINISTRIES</h2>
<p>If we want to receive spiritual gifts and ministries, we need to earnestly desire them, and we also need to know how to receive gifts and ministries.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeking</h2>
<p>We need to seek. First Corinthians 14:12 says, &ldquo;Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>seek</em> is also used in Matthew 7:7, which says, &ldquo;Seek and you shall find.&rdquo; Seeking includes petitioning, or asking, God, but seeking is not merely petitioning. Seeking requires that we take action in order to acquire. Seeking is an outward action that comes from an inward aspiration and desire. If we have an inward aspiration, the desire to have spiritual gifts, then we will take outward actions. We will make an effort to seek until we receive.</p>
<p>Many saints desire to receive spiritual gifts or ministries, but they do not want to make an effort to seek. They are either lazy and loose, or they are unwilling to pay the price. They desire in their heart, but they do not receive anything because they are unwilling to make an effort to seek. If we truly desire to receive spiritual gifts or ministries, we must spend time, make an effort, and pay the price. We must also take heed to certain matters and have the necessary dealings. After Moody had the desire to preach the gospel, he spent a great deal of time and effort seeking to receive the power and utterance needed for preaching the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Consecration</h2>
<p>We need consecration. Romans 12 speaks of different gifts after it speaks of presenting our bodies, that is, of having a practical and specific consecration (vv. 1, 6). God gives gifts and ministries, but we must consecrate ourselves thoroughly, unreservedly, and specifically to the Lord in order to receive them. This is logical and necessary. A person who does not present himself for the Lord&rsquo;s use cannot receive gifts or ministries from the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Leaving All</h2>
<p>We need to leave all. Receiving heavenly gifts and ministries depends on leaving all earthly things. Peter and John left everything before they received their gifts and ministries (Matt. 4:18-22). If we would genuinely seek spiritual gifts and ministries, we will discover that we need to leave material things because they are a hindrance to us. Many more saints would receive spiritual gifts and ministries if we would leave all the things that hinder us. If we truly want the Lord to have a free way among us, we must follow our inner sense and forsake the earthly things. There is no other way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Broken</h2>
<p>We need to be broken. Leaving all deals with things outside of us, but being broken deals with the self inside of us. Both the things outside of us and the self inside of us are hindrances that keep us from receiving spiritual gifts or ministries. The self is a greater hindrance than the things outside of us. Our temper, disposition, habits, flesh, and self need to be broken by God in order for us to receive spiritual gifts and ministries. Then there will be a clear manifestation of our spiritual function.</p>
<p>Many saints love the Lord, desire to receive spiritual gifts or ministries, and are willing to manifest their function in the church, but they are unwilling to be broken. Their temper, disposition, habits, flesh, and self remain untouched. The problems in their being annul their heart and desire for the Lord. As a result, they cannot receive what they desire to receive. If the saints in every locality would allow the Lord to break their temper, disposition, habits, flesh, and self, many more would receive useful gifts and ministries that are full of reality. Then the service in the churches would be strong and spiritual, meeting God&rsquo;s need in this age.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Studying and Learning</h2>
<p>We need to study and learn. If we desire to receive a certain gift or ministry, we must take heed to learn the things related to that gift or ministry. If we desire to receive the gift of healing, we must take heed to the gift of healing. We need to study what is revealed in the Bible concerning healing, such as praying for the sick, the laying on of hands, and the anointing with oil (James 5:14-16). In addition to studying, we also need to exercise our faith and practice what we know.</p>
<p>If we desire to be a prophet who speaks for God, we must spend the time and make an effort to learn. To be a prophet is more difficult than receiving the gift of healing. Those who want to speak for God must spend time to study the Bible. We cannot speak for God if we do not have knowledge of the Bible. We must study the Bible carefully and thoroughly until we are familiar with it. We also need to read Bible commentaries and spiritual books written by those who have been used by the Lord. There are numerous Bible commentaries and spiritual books. We may not be able to read every publication that has been written over the past two thousand years, but we should definitely read the important publications. We should also read newspapers and magazines in order to gain general knowledge and common expressions.</p>
<p>Those who speak for God also need to practice public speaking. They need skills. They need to know how to use their throat and voice, and they need to know their intonation. If we want to speak for God, people must be able to hear and understand what we say. Therefore, we must learn to enunciate our words with the proper use of our throat and abdomen so that we speak clearly and concisely. We need to learn these things so that our words are not too loud or too soft. Our words must not lose their spiritual weight. We also need to learn other languages. Otherwise, it will be hard to manifest the gift of speaking. If we can learn several languages, our function will be greatly manifested.</p>
<p>If we desire to be an elder, we must ask God for wisdom and understanding. It is not easy to administrate the house of God or to manage the church. Leading the saints, arranging the services, handling the business affairs, and resolving problems all require wisdom and understanding. When God set Solomon as king over His people, Solomon asked for a heart of wisdom so that he might know how to go out and come in among God&rsquo;s people and how to judge them. Therefore, God gave him a heart of wisdom and understanding to rule over His people (1 Kings 3:7-12).</p>
<p>Understanding is of the mind, but wisdom is of the spirit. Understanding is ordinary, but wisdom is extraordinary. To be an elder in the church requires not only the ordinary understanding of the mind but also the extraordinary wisdom of the spirit. An elder must be able to see things that others are unable to see and to perceive things that others cannot perceive. He must be able to understand what others cannot understand and to discern what others are unable to discern. Hence, we need to ask God for wisdom and understanding.</p>
<p>When I began to serve the Lord, He put me in a situation that involved the administration of the church. I was young and inexperienced, so I followed Solomon&rsquo;s example and asked God to give me wisdom and understanding in order to know how to administrate His church and lead His children. The Lord had mercy on me; He became my wisdom and understanding in many crucial matters. I can testify that the Lord delights in such a petition and answers such a petition.</p>
<p>A person who wants to be an elder also needs to exercise to be open-minded and to have a large heart. Our heart must be large if we would administrate the house of God. God gave Solomon not only wisdom and understanding but also &ldquo;largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the seashore&rdquo; (4:29). There is a Chinese proverb: &ldquo;The heart needs to be as inclusive as the sea.&rdquo; However, the heart that God gave Solomon was as large as the sand on the seashore. The sand on the seashore encompasses the sea. A heart that is as large as the sand on the seashore is larger than a heart that is as inclusive as the sea. Those who are set over God&rsquo;s people need a heart that is as large as the sand on the seashore so that they can forgive anyone and endure anything. Such a heart can love the unlovable and bear the unbearable.</p>
<p>Wisdom of heart is related to largeness of heart. Solomon asked God for wisdom, and God gave him a heart of wisdom and largeness of heart. Wisdom makes the heart large, whereas foolishness makes the heart narrow. A wise person has a large heart, but a foolish person has a narrow heart. Hence, a heart that is large is wise, and a heart that is narrow is foolish. A person with a narrow heart cannot be an elder. An elder needs to be tolerant and to have a large heart because there are all kinds of people in the church. Some saints care only for themselves; they have no regard for justice or love. The elders need to have a large heart in order to tolerate and love such ones.</p>
<p>A person who wants to be an elder needs to exercise to not lose his temper. Those who lose their temper cannot administrate the house of God. Some brothers desire to be elders, but they are unwilling to deal with their temper. They love the Lord and are willing to pay the price, but it is hard for them to be elders because they freely lose their temper.</p>
<p>Our temper is related to the narrowness of our heart. Temper causes a person to have a narrow heart, and a narrow heart causes a person to be full of temper. Therefore, to deal with one&rsquo;s temper is to deal with a narrow heart. An elder will lose his status and weight among the saints if he loses his temper even once in the church. The status and weight of an elder must not be lost, because the elders uphold the spiritual atmosphere in the church. Once an elder loses his status and weight, the church will suffer an exceedingly great loss. Hence, an elder must deal with his temper until it is no longer expressed. Then he will be strong or gentle according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading. An elder must have a strong yet gentle character.</p>
<p>The most precious thing in the church is the one accord among the saints, but one accord among the saints depends on one accord among the elders. If there is one accord among the elders, there will be one accord among the saints. Only those who know their temper and have dealt with their temper can be in one accord with others. One accord is not a matter of having the same opinion concerning the truth or practical matters. One accord depends on knowing one&rsquo;s temper and dealing with one&rsquo;s temper. Those who have dealt with their temper are not quick to give their opinions and do not cause trouble. Hence, those who desire to be elders must learn to deal with their temper.</p>
<p>A person who desires to be a deacon must learn to be loving, humble, and diligent. He must learn how to manage things before he can serve the church and the saints. He must also learn to listen and obey and to follow instructions instead of voicing his opinions. A saint who has many opinions and ideas cannot be a good deacon. If we want the saints to receive spiritual help and the life supply from our service, we must learn to deal with our opinions and ideas.</p>
<p>A deacon must also learn to deal with his tongue so that he is a person of few words. A deacon who talks incessantly will propagate death. If we want our service to minister life instead of propagating death, we must learn to deal with our tongue. There are many other matters that we need to learn, but I cannot cover them all in detail. May the Lord lead us to take heed to these matters and learn them properly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Pursuing the Infilling and<br />
Outpouring of the Spirit</h2>
<p>We need to pursue the infilling and outpouring of the Spirit. Every spiritual gift comes from the Spirit. The ordinary gifts mentioned in Romans 12:6-8 are manifested through being filled with the Spirit inwardly. These gifts are of life. The miraculous gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12:9-10 are received through the outpouring of the Spirit. The miraculous gifts are related to the inspiration of the Spirit. We must be filled with the Spirit inwardly to manifest the gifts of life. We must also experience the outpouring of the Spirit to receive the miraculous gifts. Therefore, if we desire to receive spiritual gifts, we must pursue the inward filling and the outpouring of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FINAL WORD</h2>
<p>May many among us desire and pursue spiritual gifts and pursue being an elder or a deacon. These matters are not for profit, fame, or reward, but they are for glory in the future and reward in that day. However, we do not need to wait until that day. We can sense the glory and joy of serving human souls for the Lord&rsquo;s sake today. Should there not be more among us who desire and pursue these matters for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s work?</p>
<p>If more saints desire and pursue spiritual gifts and ministries, many will be edified and useful. They will eventually be able to help other saints to preach the gospel and to raise up strong churches everywhere. This is the only way for the propagation of the gospel and for the establishment of churches to spread quickly in a solid and steady way. May the Lord remember His work and fulfill our desire.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">MIGRATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 8:1, 4; 9:31; 11:19-23</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the matter of migration. The Bible does not mention the word <em>migration,</em> but it does contain the fact of migration. The gospel of God has often been spread through the migration of the believers. In this sense, migration is scriptural.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COMING AND GOING</h2>
<p>The words <em>come</em> and <em>go</em> are frequently used in the New Testament. Receiving grace and serving the Lord depend on coming and going. The Lord first calls us to come, and then He commands us to go. We were once far off from God because our sins and the world kept us at a distance from Him. However, God in Christ has now called us to come near to Him. He is calling us to come to Him for rest, life, the living water, and salvation (Matt. 11:28; John 5:40; 10:10; 7:37). Receiving grace depends on coming to Him. The more we come to Him, the more grace we will receive.</p>
<p>After we have received grace by coming to the Lord, He commands us to go and preach the gospel to all the nations, to go and disciple all the nations, and to go and be His witnesses unto the uttermost part of the earth (Matt. 24:14; 28:19; Acts 1:8). We come to the Lord to draw near to Him and receive His grace, and we go to serve the Lord and be His witnesses. We should not come to receive His grace without going to be His witnesses. We cannot be Christians who come without being Christians who go. We cannot be half Christians.</p>
<p>In order to be complete Christians, we must be Christians who come and go. We first come to the Lord, and then we go and testify of Him. We first come to receive salvation, and we then go to preach salvation. We come by being forgiven of our sins, and we take grace with us when we go. We come by forsaking the earth, and we take heaven with us when we go. We come by forsaking people, and we take the Lord with us when we go. We are supplied when we come, but we supply others when we go. As coming-and-going Christians, we allow the Lord&rsquo;s grace to flow freely in and through us. This flow should not be hindered or stopped in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S WILL</h2>
<p>Instead of remaining in one place, Christians should move all over the earth. The Lord&rsquo;s will is that we continually move so that we can take His gospel to every place. Unless it is the Lord&rsquo;s special arrangement, we should not remain in a place for a long time. When we remain in a place for a long time, we hold back the gospel, and it does not spread to other places. If we would live before the Lord according to His will, we would not be able stay in one place for a long time. The Lord might want a brother to reside in Tainan for two years, and then He might lead the brother to reside in Taichung for a while. Perhaps the Lord wants a sister to reside in the western part of Taiwan for a period of time, and then He may want her to reside in the eastern part for a few years. The Lord may want another brother to continually move from place to place. If we love the Lord and live to Him, we will take the gospel with us wherever we go. This is the meaning of migration, and this way is scriptural. The Lord wants His gospel to reach every place on earth through our migration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MIGRATION IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>At the time of Pentecost many people were saved in Jerusalem (Acts 2:41). Although these new believers received multiplied grace while they met and served the Lord together, the Lord charged the disciples before His ascension to be His witnesses &ldquo;both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; (1:8). The disciples were the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses when they remained in Jerusalem, but the gospel was not being preached in all Judea or Samaria, much less in the uttermost part of the earth. Therefore, the Lord allowed persecution to arise in Jerusalem so that the disciples would be forced to leave Jerusalem and would be scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria in order to preach the gospel and testify for Him (8:1, 4). As soon as there was persecution, the disciples could no longer stay in Jerusalem peacefully; they were forced to move.</p>
<p>Jerusalem can be compared to the center of a large pond, and persecution can be compared to a huge stone. The Lord allowed persecution to be thrown into Jerusalem, just like a huge stone is thrown into the center of a pond; as a result, waves spread outward from the center of the pond. The disciples, who were pushed out like the waves, were able to take the gospel to many places. Eventually, churches were established in numerous places, such as Judea, Galilee, Samaria, and even Antioch, a Gentile city (9:31; 11:19-23). These churches were not established by apostles, who were sent by the Lord; rather, they were raised up by the disciples, who were scattered from Jerusalem. The scattered disciples took the gospel wherever they went. A church was raised up when some in a locality received the gospel and were saved. Before Acts 13 all the churches apart from Jerusalem were formed in this way. The church in Rome was not an exception.</p>
<p>We cannot find a verse in the Bible that says an apostle established the church in Rome. However, we can infer from the clues in the Bible that the sojourners from Rome, who received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation at the time of Pentecost, took the gospel with them back to Rome and raised up the church (2:10). Hence, we can say that the church in Rome was raised up through the migration of the believers. These examples show that it is very easy to spread the gospel and raise up churches through the migration of the believers.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PREPARATIONS IN THE ENVIRONMENT<br />

<h2 class="head2">Convenient Means of Transportation</h2>
<p>God desires the gospel to spread and churches to be raised up through the migration of His believers. Therefore, He has prepared the environment. God has prepared many things to facilitate the move of the believers, because there is a great need for the spreading of the gospel in this final age. The Gospel of Matthew says that the gospel should be preached in the whole inhabited earth and then the end will come (24:14). The book of Daniel also says that many will go here and there at the time of the end (12:4). There are presently more communication and traffic in human society than ever before, and the means of transportation, such as cars, trains, ships, and airplanes, is unprecedented in quantity and convenience. However, communication and the means of transportation are not merely for our convenience. God wants believers to use various means of transportation in their moving so that His gospel may spread to every place. This is not a small matter.</p>
<p>God uses every mode of transportation&mdash;by land, water, and air&mdash;for the move of the believers in the spreading of the gospel. For example, the many flights between Taiwan and the Philippines make it convenient to travel to Manila to testify for the Lord and to help the church there. I believe that God has prepared every means of transportation between Taiwan and the Philippines so that we can conveniently go forth to spread the gospel and establish churches. Hence, we should enjoy and use this aspect of God&rsquo;s preparation to increase our move for the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Current Trend</h2>
<p>The numerous and convenient means of transportation makes it easy for people to move. There is also a trend for people to be busy and move to many places. Whoever can travel farther and reach more places will have an advantage. Those who are away from home are better off than those who stay at home, and those who go abroad are better off than those who remain in their homeland. People who do not go abroad tend to be unrefined, and those who do not move tend to be simple. This applies to every class in society and to every country in the world. Those who want to have the upper hand must move. God allows this trend so that believers can follow it and take the gospel to every place. This trend to move is part of God&rsquo;s preparation in the environment for the believers to migrate. This trend is often a powerful current that forces the believers to move.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Troublesome Incidents</h2>
<p>Even though there is a trend that causes people to move, and the means of transportation makes it convenient for people to move, many people still will not move. Our lack of willingness to move forces God to change our circumstances. For example, He may allow us to be transferred, to lose our job, or to experience an economic recession. He may allow our business to suffer a financial loss. We may even suffer opposition and attacks or various changes in our personal situation or in our family. These items may force us to move. God even uses wars to force us to move. Even a brother who has no desire to move will flee for his life and move when war comes. Wars change environments, and when the environment changes, many people are forced to move.</p>
<p>If the war had not changed many people&rsquo;s situations, who would have been willing to move from mainland China to Taiwan? However, when the environment changed, people had to move. Even though people suffered loss during the move, this was according to God&rsquo;s good pleasure. Many people would not listen to the gospel or receive the Lord when they were in mainland China, but they were willing to open their hearts, listen to the gospel, believe, and receive the Lord after they moved to Taiwan. Many saints did not love the Lord and were indifferent to spiritual things when they were in mainland China, but since they have moved to Taiwan, their spirit is burning, and they are willing to pursue and serve the Lord.</p>
<p>We must realize that the things that happen to us are allowed by God&rsquo;s sovereign hand; they are not coincidental. God wants us to move, but because we are unwilling, He stretches forth His hand to allow certain things to force us to move and to compel us to go. After God gives a command, His hand will act. He first prepares the environment so that it is easy for us to move and also allows a trend that inclines us to move; He even allows troublesome incidents that force us to move. God desires that His children would move frequently in this age. Therefore, He prepares all kinds of environments to make it convenient for us to move, and He allows all kinds of troublesome things to force us to move.</p>
<p>We need to understand God&rsquo;s intention and know His acts. Jeremiah 8:7 says, &ldquo;Even the stork in the sky / Knows its appointed times, / And the turtledove and the swallow and the crane / Keep the time of their coming; / But My people do not know / The ordinance of Jehovah.&rdquo; We have received God&rsquo;s salvation, and we have His life; as such, how can we be inferior to the birds? We should be those who know the times, know events, and know God so that we can match what God is doing in this age. Otherwise, we will fall behind in our service to God, and we will be unable to catch up with this age.</p><h2 class="head1">PROBLEMS IN PRACTICING MIGRATION</h2>
<p>Although God has made many preparations in the environment in order for us to migrate, we still have problems practicing migration. Such problems include our nature, habits, family relationships, relatives and friends, work factors, geographic factors, and property. There is also the inability to adapt to different languages, different customs, and new environments. In addition, there are hardships, costs, and losses suffered when we migrate. These matters cause us to hesitate. Furthermore, according to our natural disposition, Chinese people do not like to move. It is difficult to leave our native land. In general, migration is relatively easy for Caucasians but difficult for the Chinese. Unless we are forced to move, we are unwilling to go even to a nearby region, let alone to a faraway land. Our natural disposition, habits, environment, and human relationships make us inclined to stay in one place. Hence, we need the Lord&rsquo;s deliverance in relation to migration.</p>
<p>We do not have to move for our sake or for the sake of our family, but we do need to move for the Lord&rsquo;s sake and for His gospel. If we do not move, the gospel cannot go forth; if we stay in one place, the gospel will be held back. In order for the gospel to go forth, we have to move. In order to move, however, we must overcome the problems that hinder us. We need to be delivered from these problems by allowing the Lord to break our natural disposition and our lack of desire to move. We must also ask the Lord to enable us to overcome every factor that restrains us from migrating.</p>
<p>We need the Lord to break our natural disposition and habits in relation to migration. We ask the Lord to enable us to overcome sin and the world, but we must also ask Him to enable us to overcome all the things that restrain us from migrating. Most people would rather stay in one place than suffer moving to different places. We need the Lord to deliver us from this preference. We need the Lord&rsquo;s grace to make us willing to move so that we would not be half Christians, ones who come but do not go. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace, we need to be sojourners on earth who follow the footsteps of Abraham.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING STRANGERS AND SOJOURNERS</h2>
<p>When Abraham was called, he obeyed and went from his land to Canaan, the land that God promised to give him. Abraham dwelt in Canaan as a foreigner; he was a sojourner who moved from place to place in a tent, thus confessing that he was a stranger and a sojourner on the earth (Heb. 11:8, 13). Wherever Abraham went, he pitched a tent and built an altar to Jehovah; he also called on the name of Jehovah and maintained God&rsquo;s testimony on the earth (Gen. 12:6-8; 13:3-4, 18). The tent and the altar were inseparable in the life of Abraham. The tent was a symbol of his life of sojourning on earth, and the altar was a testimony of his calling on the name of Jehovah. Abraham built an altar only after he pitched a tent. He had the testimony of calling on Jehovah only when he lived a sojourning life. Likewise, if we want to serve God, declare His gospel, and maintain His testimony, we must live as sojourners; that is, we must move. If we stay in any place for a long period of time, we will lose the characteristic of a sojourner and the life of the tent. When we lose the life of the tent, we also lose the testimony of the altar. Hence, we cannot maintain God&rsquo;s testimony when we lose the characteristic of being sojourners.</p>
<p>Whenever we stay in a place for a long time, we will be in danger of being rooted on earth. When we received salvation, the Lord uprooted us out of the world. However, some saints have not allowed the Lord to pull their roots out of the earth. Abraham obeyed God&rsquo;s command immediately after he was called by going from the land of his birth, that is, from Ur of the Chaldeans (11:31). Some brothers and sisters have been called to be God&rsquo;s children, but they have not obeyed God&rsquo;s command to go out from their &ldquo;Ur,&rdquo; the place where their roots are in the earth. If they would be willing to migrate, the Lord would pull their roots out of the earth.</p>
<p>Migration pulls our roots out of the earth and preserves us from being rooted again into the earth. The first time that we migrate, our roots are pulled out of the earth. Afterward, our further migration will keep us from being rooted in any place. Our first migration is our going out of Ur, and our further migrations are our sojourning in the land of Canaan. If we merely have a first migration but no further migrations, we will eventually be rooted in Sodom, just as Lot was rooted in Sodom. Lot followed Abraham out of Ur until he got to Canaan, but he did not follow Abraham to live a sojourning life. Lot stayed permanently in Sodom and became rooted there; hence, he no longer needed a tent, and he lost the testimony of the altar.</p>
<p>As soon as a believer is rooted in the earth, he will spontaneously lose the life of the tent. When the life of the tent is lost, the testimony of God is also lost. This is the difference between Abraham and Lot. Many believers today are like Lot, and many have not even gone out from Ur. Many of those who have left Ur were later rooted in Sodom. I hope that we would not remain in Sodom until the judgment day of the Lord comes. May we follow the example of Abraham, the father of faith, by always moving, living the life of a sojourner who pitches a tent and builds an altar as a testimony of God.</p><h2 class="head1">HAVING THE DESIRE FOR MIGRATION</h2>
<p>We should have the desire to migrate. God has ordained that we would live our life as sojourners. Migration is a necessary outlet of the gospel of God and the best outlet of His gospel. If we settle down in a place, the gospel will not have an outlet, and it will be held back. Hence, we have to migrate in order for the gospel to have an outlet. If we want the gospel to spread throughout Taiwan, the saints must migrate to every city. It is not sufficient to merely have a few preachers who go out to spread the gospel. We must have many saints who migrate to every place. May more saints be willing to seek the Lord&rsquo;s grace in this matter so that they would have the inclination and the desire to migrate for the gospel and to be sojourners, people who are always moving.</p>
<p>If we love the Lord and desire to live for Him and please Him, we will choose to migrate. This is the type of life that the Lord wants us to live, and this is also the way to please Him. We must be determined to travel throughout Taiwan and to live in every town. Although migration is difficult, it is the way to spread the gospel and to raise up the churches. Hence, such difficulty is worthwhile. May we be those who look to the Lord for His grace to have such a determination.</p>
<p>Judges 5:15-16 says, &ldquo;By the watercourses of Reuben / There were great resolves of heart. / Why sattest thou among the sheepfolds, / To hear the pipings for the flocks? / At the watercourses of Reuben / There were great searchings of heart&rdquo; (ASV). As Jacob&rsquo;s firstborn, Reuben should have been preeminent in dignity and power. However, he committed a gross sin when he defiled his father&rsquo;s concubine (Gen. 49:3-4). His descendants were children of a sinner, but there were watercourses among them. According to Psalm 23:2 and Jeremiah 17:7-8, watercourses signify God and His grace. This means that God&rsquo;s grace came upon the descendants of Reuben. Some of his descendants were sitting beside the watercourses, beside God, and by the grace of God, they had great resolutions of heart and great searchings of heart for the kingdom of God. Some of Reuben&rsquo;s descendants, however, enjoyed sitting among the sheepfolds to hear the pipings for the flocks. This means that they rested and did not move, because they desired a life of ease, comfort, and amusement. Likewise, many saints are not willing to receive the grace of God in order to have great resolutions of heart and great searchings of heart, because they desire a life of ease and comfort.</p>
<p>Human life is wicked and corrupt, but we have watercourses of God&rsquo;s grace by which we can have great resolutions of heart and great searchings of heart. Many saints do not make resolutions, because they yearn for a life of ease and comfort. To settle down is to live a life of ease, comfort, and pleasure, but to migrate is laborious and difficult. However, settling down will not enable us to enjoy God&rsquo;s grace. Migration is the way for us to enjoy the grace of God. Do we want to ignore God&rsquo;s grace by settling down to enjoy ease and comfort? Or do we want to be supplied by His grace to go out and enjoy more grace? Do we want to sit restfully among the sheepfolds and listen to pleasant music? Or do we want to be at the watercourses of God&rsquo;s grace to have great resolutions of heart and great searchings of heart for the Lord? May we be willing to flee the enjoyment of our own ease and comfort in order to draw near to the grace of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO PRACTICE</h2>
<p>We will now consider the steps to take in order to practice migration.</p>
<p>The saints in the churches should go before God and seek whether they should migrate.</p>
<p>Those who are touched and willing to migrate should fellowship with the responsible brothers in their locality and decide on what action to take.</p>
<p>The saints should migrate to places based on their desire and on the condition of their living and employment.</p>
<p>In the first stage of migration we should go to places where there are saints but not established churches. Places such as Hualien, Taitung, Changhua, and Taoyuan need to be strengthened so that churches may be established.</p>
<p>If this is the work of the Lord&rsquo;s grace, some brothers should migrate to Tainan, Taichung, and Chiayi in order to strengthen the brothers who bear responsibility in these localities.</p>
<p>Some brothers should migrate to places where there is a prayer meeting and strengthen the saints to have the bread-breaking meeting. There are places where there is a bread-breaking meeting, but the testimony is not strong enough. Some brothers should migrate to strengthen such places. Other brothers should go to nearby places in order to raise up churches. I hope that churches would be raised up in every place by migrating saints, not by preachers.</p>
<p>The churches should offer material gifts in order to take care of the needs of the saints who migrate from their locality. For example, a brother in Pingtung may have the desire to migrate to Taitung. When he is in Pingtung, he has no worries concerning his livelihood, but when he migrates to Taitung, he may have a problem related to his livelihood. The church in Pingtung should take care of his need and help him solve such a problem. All the churches should do their best to supply the saints who desire to migrate. This will enable the migrating saints to go out, family by family, for the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FINAL WORD</h2>
<p>Migration is an important matter because it is the way for the gospel to go forth and for churches to be raised up. Migration enables us to supply others with the grace that we have received and to fellowship with others concerning what we have experienced. We will bring our spiritual experiences to the places where we migrate, and we will also bring what we have learned in administrating and serving the church. After we migrate, we will spread out further. In this way churches will be raised up quickly in every place. Migration will enable us to proceed step by step and thereby avoid wasting our time and manpower. Furthermore, those who migrate out will receive fresh experiences of grace to become fresh, living, and useful.</p>
<p>As those who love the Lord, we should care for His desire and migrate to every place. We have been commissioned with the Lord&rsquo;s gospel because we have received His grace; hence, those whom we contact will also be commissioned with the gospel by receiving His grace. The more we migrate, the more we will be commissioned with the gospel and receive grace. May the responsible brothers in every locality stir up the saints with the desire to migrate so that many more saints will practice migration.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">OUR ATTITUDE</h1>
<p>The brothers often do not know what kind of attitude we should have toward other Christian groups. This is a practical problem that all the saints have encountered; therefore, we will spend some time to consider this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION OF CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>We must have a clear understanding concerning the condition of Christianity. The church has been in existence for two thousand years, and it has spread to nearly every continent and every race of people on the earth. It is difficult for anything that exists for a long period of time, covers a vast area, and reaches so many people to remain in its original form. Hence, after two thousand years the church has become deformed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Deformed Christianity</h2>
<p>Christianity has been in existence for a long period of time, has spread across a vast area of the earth, and has reached many races. As a result of these complicating elements, it was unavoidable that Christianity would become deformed. No rational person would believe that Christianity has kept the original form of the church from the first century. People have deformed and changed the church. Therefore, we must be willing to question every aspect of what is found in the church and practiced by the church. We must ask whether the current condition of the church matches the original condition of the church. We cannot indiscriminately accept or hastily acknowledge anything. Instead, we should investigate everything. Anything that is right and according to God will not suffer from such an investigation.</p>
<p>We should serve the Lord strictly in accordance with the form of the initial church. Regardless of how good or important something may be in the eyes of man, we should avoid and drop whatever does not correspond to the original form of the church. We should drop anything that has become deformed through the alteration of man. We need to come back to the original form of the church.</p>
<p>There are several matters in which the church has become deformed. First, there are many different denominations in Christianity. We should ask whether the church had so many denominations in the beginning. If we look into this matter, we will realize that the initial church did not have denominations. The initial church was not divided into denominations and sects. The church first appeared on the earth in many localities, but the church in each locality was not divided into denominations or sects. There was only the church in Ephesus (Rev. 2:1); there were no denominations in Ephesus. There was only the church in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2; 2 Cor. 1:1); there were no denominations in Corinth. However, today there are many different Christian denominations. These denominations did not exist at the time of the initial church; they were founded by people. In the beginning there were elders in the church, but there was no Presbyterian Church. In the beginning the church practiced baptism, but there was no Baptist Church. In the beginning the church taught holiness, but there was no Holiness Church. In the beginning there was justification by faith, but there was no Lutheran Church. In the beginning the church had spiritual gifts, but there was no Pentecostal Church. These and other denominations speak of the deformed situation of Christianity, which we must drop.</p>
<p>Second, Protestant churches have pastors, and the Catholic Church has priests. After careful study, it is clear that there were no pastors or priests in the initial church; these positions were invented by men at a later time. There were gifts, such as shepherds and teachers, in the initial church (Eph. 4:11), but there was no pastoral system, priestly system, or clerical system. In the beginning all the believers in the church served God as priests (1 Pet. 2:5). There was not a group of people who served as intermediaries between the believers and God. There also was not a special group of clerical men who served God. The believers in the initial church did not serve God according to the present pastoral, priestly, or clerical systems. These systems came into existence through changes made by man; hence, these systems are deformed and should be denied and repudiated.</p>
<p>Third, Christianity has professional preachers, who receive a salary. This is a deformity. In the beginning there were workers who were sent by the Lord but not professional preachers who were hired by man. There were believers who served the Lord and lived by faith but not believers who preached the word as a profession and means of income. Any system involving professional preaching is deformed, and it is the result of the degradation of Christianity.</p>
<p>Fourth, the buildings used by the Catholic Church and by Protestant churches are also deformities. The believers in the initial church gathered together in many different places (Acts 4:31; 20:8) but not in church buildings. Our meeting places should not be so-called sanctuaries. If we regarded our meeting place as a sanctuary or a chapel, this would mean that believers should worship only in a sanctuary or in a designated place of worship. However, we can worship anywhere. Worship is not a matter of place but of being in spirit. In John 4 the Lord said, &ldquo;An hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father...God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit&rdquo; (vv. 21, 24). Our spirit is the location of our worship to God; hence, we can worship Him at any time and at any place. Every place can be a place of worship. So-called church buildings did not exist in the initial church; they were produced by degraded Christianity. The finest buildings in many places in the world are church buildings. This is not according to the original appearance of the church; rather, it is the result of man-made changes.</p>
<p>Fifth, in many cases the practice of baptism has become deformed. In the early church the practice of baptism involved the immersion of people into water (Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:5, 8; Acts 8:38). The present practice of baptism in Christianity mainly involves sprinkling a few drops of water on a person&rsquo;s head. Although the Baptist Church practices baptism by immersion, only pastors can baptize people. This is also a deformed situation. The New Testament shows that those who preached the gospel and brought others to salvation also baptized those who received the gospel (Acts 8:26-38; 9:10-18). This was done in a serious and proper way; it was not a light or casual matter. There was no practice in the church of believers preaching the gospel and then pastors baptizing those who received the Lord. There was not the situation of gospel preaching by the laity but baptizing by the clergy. The present system of only pastors baptizing by either immersion or sprinkling did not exist in the initial church. Such a deformed practice was brought in by man.</p>
<p>Sixth, the practice of the so-called holy communion is also deformed. The Catholic mass is far removed from the original condition of the breaking of bread referred to in the Bible, and holy communion practiced in Protestantism is also far removed. Even the term <em>holy communion</em> is a deformity. The Bible uses the term <em>the Lord&rsquo;s supper</em> (1 Cor. 11:20) but never the term <em>holy communion.</em> Some denominations use small pieces of bread in their practice, but this is not like the practice in the initial church, in which all believers partook of one bread and of wine from one cup as a testimony of the one Body of Christ (10:16-17). Using many pieces of bread and separate cups is a deformed situation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is a common thought that all believers can receive holy communion but that only pastors and priests can administer holy communion. As a result, two different positions have been formed, the administrators and the recipients. According to the Bible, however, the saints who come before the Lord to break bread all have the same position, and all are recipients. There is a not designated administrator (Matt. 26:26-28; 1 Cor. 10:16-17). Everyone receives from the Lord&rsquo;s hand directly; no one represents the Lord to administer the bread to others. Any person who is a representative has stepped beyond his limit and is usurping the Lord&rsquo;s authority. Even if Paul were in our midst today, he would only be a brother partaking of the Lord&rsquo;s supper with us. Paul would not be able to represent the Lord in order to administer the Lord&rsquo;s supper, because we all have the same position. When the initial church broke bread, all the believers were recipients; no one represented the Lord as an administrator.</p>
<p>Seventh, in some Christian groups the elders are elected by the believers. This is a deformed situation. According to the Bible, the elders in the initial church were not elected by the believers. The elders were produced when certain brothers were manifested as being more mature and more experienced among the believers (Acts 15:2; 1 Tim. 5:17). When such ones were manifested, they were appointed to the eldership by apostles or someone designated by them according to the leading of the Spirit (Titus 1:5). The present practice of electing elders, that is, of believers voting for who should be an elder, was not present in the initial church.</p>
<p>Eighth, the celebration of different feasts, such as Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter, is a product of deformed Christianity. Other than participating in the Lord&rsquo;s supper in remembrance of the Lord, the church did not have any other memorials or feasts. The Bible records the Lord&rsquo;s birth, death, and resurrection, but it does not command us to celebrate Christmas, Good Friday, or Easter. According to church history, such feasts were not in the initial church; they were brought in at a later time. Some of these feasts are even mixed with pagan practices; hence, these celebrations are deformed.</p>
<p>Christianity has numerous other deformed practices, which we cannot enumerate here. These things did not exist in the initial church; they were added later by man. Hence, these practices are deformed. Whatever practice is not according to the Bible must be rejected.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Letting the Spirit Have Authority</h2>
<p>By paying attention to the matters that were in the original church, we are not seeking to be different from others. Rather, we want to stress the authority of the Spirit. Furthermore, we are not fighting for different forms or rituals. Rather, we are for the authority of the Spirit. Every deformed situation in Christianity has annulled the authority of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Although the practice of believers electing elders does not correspond with the practice in the initial church, it is unacceptable primarily because it annuls the authority of the Spirit. The practice of electing elders only gives ground to opinions in the church; it does not allow the Spirit to have the authority in the church. The Bible says that &ldquo;the Holy Spirit has placed&rdquo; the elders in the church as overseers (Acts 20:17, 28). The Spirit manifests certain brothers who are more mature and experienced among God&rsquo;s children in the church, and then He leads the apostles to appoint these ones as elders. Some brothers in the church allow the Spirit to lead them to grow in the divine life; hence, they are spiritual and know the Lord. The Spirit manifests brothers who love the Lord, pay the price, care for God&rsquo;s children, and labor in the church as being mature and experienced. Then the Spirit exercises His authority and appoints them to the eldership through the apostles who submit to the Spirit&rsquo;s authority. As a result, the manifestation and appointment of the elders are under the authority of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The practice of electing elders results in a completely different situation. Voting allows people and their opinions to have the lordship, and it also annuls the authority of the Spirit. Some may say that it is possible for Christians to vote for elders by following the leading of the Spirit or by giving the Spirit the ground, but elections involve human insight and are affected by a person&rsquo;s worldly position, wealth, and influence. Such a practice prevents the Spirit from manifesting those who should be elders, and it annuls the authority of the Spirit. With such a practice, only the human will is enthroned. Elections involve the human will, and they involve man&rsquo;s assumption of authority. The Bible does not have such a method, and we cannot adopt it.</p>
<p>Although the practice of pastors administering holy communion is inconsistent with the Scriptures, it also is unacceptable primarily because it annuls the authority of the Spirit. Such a practice does not allow the Spirit to operate as He wills. The saints who gather at the Lord&rsquo;s table to break bread are on the same level. No person should act as a chairman; instead, we should allow the Spirit to take the lead and operate in the meeting. All the brothers and sisters, whether they have been saved for many years or are new believers, should allow the Spirit to operate in the meeting. Everyone should pray according to the leading of the Spirit and praise according to the inspiration of the Spirit. When the Spirit operates and has complete freedom in the meeting, any brother may be led by the Spirit to select a hymn or to bless the bread and the cup. However, a person acting as the chairman to administer the holy communion annuls the lordship of the Spirit among the believers and quenches the operation of the Spirit. Therefore, the Bible does not record such a practice, and we do not want it.</p>
<p>The priestly system, the pastoral system, and the clerical system are human ways that usurp the authority of the Spirit. The Spirit should have authority over all the believers in their service to God. But the priestly system, the pastoral system, and the clerical system have annulled the authority of the Spirit over the believers, causing the believers to neglect the duties of their service to God.</p>
<p>The existence of sects and denominations is the result of human opinion prevailing over the Lord&rsquo;s Word, human methods prevailing over the Lord&rsquo;s ordination, and human authority prevailing over the authority of the Spirit. If people would let the Lord be the Lord, let the Spirit lead, let the Lord&rsquo;s Word prevail over human opinion, and let the Lord&rsquo;s decision prevail over human methods, there would be no ground for sects and denominations to be established. Therefore, we should ask whether sects and denominations are scriptural, whether human opinion should take precedence over the Lord&rsquo;s Word, and whether the Lord truly is the Lord.</p>
<p>Without exception, Christmas, Good Friday, Easter, and numerous other practices and rituals in the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant churches are the issue of human opinions prevailing over the Lord&rsquo;s Word, human methods prevailing over the Lord&rsquo;s ordination, and man prevailing over the Lord. If believers would let the Lord exercise His lordship, let His Word annul their opinions, and let His ordination swallow up their methods, Christianity would be pure, strong, holy, and rich. Christianity is mixed, weak, full of compromise, and poor because it has given room to human opinions, human methods, and human lordship. We must rid ourselves of all mixture and compromise in order to serve the Lord in purity and holiness. Whatever did not exist in the initial church and whatever is inconsistent with the teachings, principles, and examples in the Bible are a mixture of human will and the world. We must reject such things.</p>
<p>I have cited these practical examples so that the saints can understand why we differ from other believers and why we disagree with many Christian practices today. Some may say that there is no need for differences or disagreements, but we have received mercy from God to realize that these differences are crucial. Does man have the lordship in the church, or does the Lord have the lordship? We are not fighting for right or wrong but for who has the lordship and the ground in the church.</p>
<p>Should man and his opinions have the ground in the church, or should the Spirit have the authority in the church? This is the important question. It is pitiful if we can argue only about right and wrong and pay attention only to outward appearance and practices. Our focus is not on outward appearance but on the lordship of the Lord. We are not arguing about whether holy communion is right or wrong but whether the Lord has the lordship when we break bread. We are not arguing about whether electing elders is right or wrong but about whether the Spirit has the authority in the manifestation and appointment of elders. This is the central issue. If we are clear concerning the central issue, that is, concerning the authority of the Spirit in the church, it will not be possible to remain in deformed Christianity, and we will be grieved when we see a situation in which the Spirit does not have the authority.</p>
<p>We desire to put aside every matter that is inconsistent with the condition of the initial church, regardless of its source or of how good or valuable it may seem to be. Such a desire is not the result of following others, and neither does it come out of a deliberate intention to be different from others. We desire to let the Spirit recover His authority and position in the church. We do not want to be dissenting for the sake of dissension; we want to take care of the Spirit&rsquo;s authority and the Lord&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>We have put aside the deformed practices of Christianity because they have annulled the authority of the Spirit. Our desire is to let the Lord recover His position and authority in the church and thus return to the original appearance of the initial church.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR ATTITUDE BEFORE MEN</h2>
<p>If we are clear concerning the condition of Christianity, we will know the attitude that we should have before men when we touch the matter of the church. Our service is focused on positive things, not on negative things. We disapprove of the deformed matters in Christianity, but our service is not focused on opposing these matters. Our ministry is not to criticize and attack others&rsquo; mistakes. This is not the Lord&rsquo;s purpose in raising us up. We were raised up by the Lord to give people proper things. The Lord did not send us to do a negative work but to do a positive work. The negative conditions that we have mentioned serve as a background that provides a contrast for the positive things. The examples that we have given are not meant to attack or oppose others. We do not want to argue with others but to firmly hold on to the light that we have received. It is useless to argue.</p>
<p>Instead of arguing with others concerning negative things, we should supply them with the positive things. When people see the proper condition, they will recognize the negative things. If such ones stubbornly remain in an erroneous condition, they will be accountable to the Lord. The condition in Christianity is one of confusion; thus, we cannot take care of too many things. We can only present the truth with the hope that all erroneous and disorderly things will be corrected and restored. Our ministry is not to criticize, attack, or oppose.</p>
<p>In our service we should stand in a proper position and do things with a proper attitude. All the matters related to our service should have a scriptural expression without and a spiritual reality within. We should serve the Lord according to the truth in the Scriptures and in the reality of the Spirit. We should not have or do anything that is not according to the Scriptures or the initial church. We do not need to criticize or oppose those who want to keep other practices, because our ministry is not for criticizing and opposing others.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should have an attitude that does not fear criticism or opposition. Our attitude should be to care only for the burden that God has given us. As long as our practices are of the Lord, we should not be concerned about whether we are approved or opposed by others. Our practice should not be influenced by others; rather, it should be directed by God. Our heart must be turned only to God, and our eyes must look only at Him. We should please only God and not be concerned with whether others like us or hate us.</p>
<p>We should not criticize others, and we should not fear their criticism. With a pure conscience, according to the light of the Bible and by the leading of the Spirit, we should practice what God has commissioned us to do. What others do and how they treat us are not our concern. This is the proper attitude that we should have.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR ATTITUDE BEFORE GOD</h2>
<p>We need to have a proper attitude before men and also before God. We should be clear concerning the condition in Christianity, and we should be clear concerning God&rsquo;s purpose in raising us up. Moreover, we should have a balanced, proper attitude before men and a proper attitude toward God.</p>
<p>We need to be right not only in our attitude before men but also in our attitude before God. We must not be quick to detest and condemn the various conditions in Christianity. Rather, we should ask God to enlarge our capacity so that our heart matches His heart. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, we want to serve by You, not by ourselves. You raised us up to serve You. If our service is profitable for the gospel or for the testimony of Your Son, we pray that You would bless it. If our service causes the gospel to suffer loss or annuls the testimony of Your Son, stretch out Your hand to stop our service and take away Your blessing. Our service is not for our sake but for Your sake.&rdquo; Such a strong declaration should not only be the basis of our attitude toward God; it should also be the basis of our negotiating with Him. If our standing, intention, and attitude are right, He will accept our declaration.</p>
<p>We need to declare our attitude before God in strong and serious prayer. This is not an ordinary kind of prayer; it is a pleading, a negotiating. Negotiation requires a proper position. We must be for God before we can utter such a prayer. We must be those who are raised up and sent by God, and we must not do things according to our desire. Unless we are such ones, we cannot utter such a prayer, and if we cannot utter such a prayer, our service is questionable.</p>
<p>We must be able to say that it is not our desire to do things in a particular way, to dispute with Christians, or to set up our own group. Rather, the Spirit of God in His grace has visited and burdened us; hence, we must rise up to serve Him. This is not for our own preference or pleasure; this is the issue of God&rsquo;s revelation, and it is His commission. Therefore, we can boldly say, &ldquo;O God, You know that doing these things, walking this way, and serving You do not come from us. This is Your business, not ours; it is Your responsibility, not ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We should also declare that we agree with any work that is profitable for the church and God&rsquo;s testimony, and we should ask God to bless this work. If our declaration is on the right ground, God will stretch forth His hand, and many problems will be solved. It is useless to debate. We must stand on the right ground and declare our attitude toward God. Then God will vindicate those who are standing with Him and serving as His oracle on the earth.</p>
<p>We should declare our attitude before God without any ambiguity. God delights in having people on earth who stand with Him. We should tell Him that we want what He wants and that we reject what He rejects. We should declare to Him that this is our attitude.</p></body></html>
