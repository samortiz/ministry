   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s Vine</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Israel was not only God s elect but also God s vine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s vine is for the accomplishing of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 15 reveals that Christ is the true vine and that we are the branches.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To the vine God grants His rich visitation with the supply of sunshine, air, rain, soil, and many other things that are necessary for the vine to grow and produce something.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This vine consists not only of human beings but of human beings joined to the divine person.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, with the vine we have four crucial points: God s care in His grace, the union of God and man, the flowing forth of the divine life, and the producing of wine for the joy of God and man.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God does not want to be alone but wants to have a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Genesis 2:18 says that it is not good for man to be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In typology, this signifies that it is not good for Christ, for God, to be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ desires to have a bride.</S>
