<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Concerning Taking a Pledge from the Borrower</H2><P>Deuteronomy 24:10-13 speaks concerning taking a pledge from the borrower.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Lender Not Entering<br>the Borrower's House but Standing Outside</H2><P>When the children of Israel lent anything to their neighbor, they were not to enter his house in order to take his pledge (v. 10). Rather, they were to stand outside, and the borrower was to bring the pledge out to them (v. 11). These small points indicate that our God is detailed in His care for His people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Lender Returning<br>the Pledge before the Sun Went Down</H2><P>Verses 12 and 13 go on to say, "If he is a poor man, you shall not sleep with his pledge; you must return his pledge to him when the sun goes down, so that he may sleep in his mantle and bless you; and it will be righteousness to you before Jehovah your God." If the lender did not return the pledge by sundown, the borrower could accuse him before God, saying, "Lord, my lender will not let me have my mantle, and I have nothing to sleep in." Not returning the mantle could cause the lender to have suffering instead of blessing. But if he returned the mantle before the sun went down, the borrower would bless him, and God would count the lender's returning the mantle as righteousness before Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Concerning the Wages Given<br>to the Poor Hired Servant</H2><P>In 24:14 and 15 we have a word concerning the wages given to the poor hired servant. The children of Israel were not to oppress a poor and needy hired servant among their brothers or among the sojourners with them (v. 14). On the day that the hired servant earned his wages, the children of Israel were to give him his wages before the sun went down (v. 15a). They were not to owe anything to the one who worked for them. Otherwise, he could cry against them to Jehovah, and it would become sin in them (v. 15b).</P>
