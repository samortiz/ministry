   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DOING A NORMAL WORK BY A NORMAL LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some campuses have special circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, the school administration may exercise strict oversight, and the students may have a very regimented schedule with little free time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With such campuses, we must keep the principle of not disrupting the order.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even making noise on such a campus can disrupt the order on the campus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should follow the regulations of a school that has very strict oversight and do what we can in the time permitted and within the boundaries set forth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a school allows us to use a limited area, we should use only that area.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a school allows us to use only a certain period of time, we should use only that time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to receive the Lord s leading and do only as much as we are allowed to do.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>An attempt to gain more in a short time may cause us to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not count on luck; neither should we attempt to take the way of miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church has two thousand years of history on the earth, which show that the way of miracles does not last.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are many miracles in the four Gospels, but this is not the case in the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Initially, Paul s handkerchief healed the sick Acts 19:11-12 , but in his old age, instead of healing Timothy, his co-worker, Paul advised Timothy to take a little wine 1 Tim 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The way of life ultimately takes the direction of normalcy and regularity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not depend on luck.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should depend on living and working in a normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Students in schools that have strict oversight can still be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After some students are saved, we will gradually receive the Lord s leading and usher them into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not expect to achieve much in a short time; neither should we create any conflict with the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the boundaries given to us, we should do the best we can.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Over the long run, we will see the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>USING THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS HOUSES</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In mainland China and even during the early years in Taiwan, we did not have the practice of brothers and sisters houses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was not until 1963, when we were laboring on the university campuses in America that we discovered the need of establishing brothers and sisters houses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Taiwan followed this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even though the practice of having brothers and sisters houses has been blessed by the Lord, it also has its drawback, which is mainly related to management.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the management is loose, there will be chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the management is too strict, it will damage and frustrate the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The problem is that everyone is willing to set up laws, but no one is willing to obey the laws.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not Making Pray-reading the Lord s Word and Calling On the Lord s Name into Laws</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must not make pray-reading the Lord s word and calling on the Lord s name into laws for the brothers and sisters who live in corporate housing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Calling on the Lord s name should not be a law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We heard that after some newly saved believers moved into corporate housing, they were forced to pray-read the Lord s Word, to call on the Lord s name, and to praise loudly, even though they did not like it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible does tell us to call on the Lord s name loudly Acts 7:59-60 , but our being loud can either be pleasant to the ears or unpleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is a great difference.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Acts 3 after a lame man was healed, he was walking, leaping, and praising God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Based on this story, a brother once requested that everyone leap about in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Bible there is a practice of calling on the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We also call on the Lord s name, but we do not call in a disorderly manner, nor are we wild.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Two hundred years ago, John Wesley broke the tradition of worshipping only in a chapel, that is, a so-called sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He preached the gospel on the streets.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He cried out and was loud, and those who passed by stopped and listened to him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many were touched to repent and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At that time, the tide of the French revolution had swept through Europe, and it would have crossed the English Channel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, apart from that revolution the English society was already going through a change brought about by the effectiveness of Wesley s preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason, the royal household of Great Britain appreciated John Wesley.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>During the past two thousand years of church history, different people have been raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do everything according to the Bible, and we are not willing to be bound by an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Calling on the Lord s name is in the Bible; therefore, we call on the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Praising out loud is in the Bible; therefore, we also praise out loud, but we do not praise wildly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We pray-read the Lord s Word, call on the Lord s name, and praise the Lord, but we do not set these practices as laws for others to obey in the brothers and sisters houses.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Bible encourages us to compel others only in one matter.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should compel others to believe in the Lord Jesus, but we still need to study how to compel others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sometimes people would be willing to believe without our compelling, but when we compel, they run away.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There was a brother in Southern California who was very aggressive.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He even compelled a gospel friend to kneel down and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The friend was Chinese and reluctantly complied, but he later told others that he would never come to another meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not become aggressive in the brothers and sisters houses.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not require the brothers and sisters who live together to uniformly pray-read the Lord s Word and call on the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should always remember that the church is a home.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We cannot conduct ourselves as soldiers in a home.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not require everyone to be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should give the newly saved ones more freedom and encourage them to join us to pray-read the Lord s Word and call on the Lord s name, saying, You may not be used to what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Please bear with us and do not feel troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You are welcome to join us in prayer, or you can stay in your room.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this way they will feel comfortable.</S>
