   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Since Christ is in the spirit, when our mind submits to the spirit, it is submitting to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thus, He is given the opportunity to expand from our spirit into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Formerly, nothing of Christ was within our mind, but when our mind submits to the spirit, the Lord has the opportunity to permeate, fill, and renew our mind with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this way our soul is transformed by the renewing of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our mind, thus, will be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why Paul is able to say in 1 Corinthians 2:16, "We have the mind of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we are regenerated in our spirit, we have the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When our mind submits to the spirit and lets Christ as the Spirit occupy it, we have even the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many times we meet some good Christians, but when we talk with them, we realize that in their mind is nothing of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Undoubtedly they love the Lord; but in their mind, as revealed by their way of talking, there is nothing of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They may talk about spiritual things and use spiritual terms, but there is nothing of the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is still their mind and their way of thinking about the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They do not have the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are other Christians in whom we discover a mind full of Christ, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When they express their thoughts and ideas, we sense the presence of the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because their minds are under the control and direction of the spirit, the Lord Spirit has the opportunity to saturate and occupy their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The transformation of the entire soul depends on the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is extremely important.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After we are renewed in the mind, we will automatically be renewed in the emotion and in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The mind always adjusts the emotion, and the will is always influenced by the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our thinking balances and limits our emotional feelings, and we make decisions according to what we consider, think, and understand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If our mind is opened to the Lord, the emotion and the will surely will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If our mind is closed to the Lord, then, of course, the emotion and the will also will be closed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the mind is saturated and occupied by the Lord, the Lord will certainly take over our emotion and possess our will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is for this reason we are told in Romans 12 that the transformation of the soul is by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the Lord can possess our mind, He will automatically control our emotion and our will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many Christians love the Lord, but they will not submit their mind to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many times a Christian will say, "Yes, I do love the Lord, but I think such and such.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I love the Lord, but what about this or that?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They close their mind and imprison the Lord in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have a hymn which says that the Lord Spirit has come into our spirit with the intention of flowing out from us, but once He has entered, He is enclosed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our spirit should be a residence for the Lord, but it has become a prison.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How many Christians have Christ within them, yet He is locked within!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no way for the Lord to come out, because their mind is not submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They have their way of thinking with their old and natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As long as we retain the old mind, we remain old in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to submit our mind to the Lord and let Him come into it to possess and renew it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The life of Christ is always waiting for an opportunity to transform us, but we will not grant it because in our mind we are unwilling to submit to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The problem is our stubborn mind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We will not submit our thinking, our concepts, our ideas, our thoughts, our reasonings, our knowledge, and our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As long as we keep our mind, Christ is shut within our spirit with no way out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must pray: "Lord, now I understand that I must surrender my mind to Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If I love Thee, I must give up my thoughts and my concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I must submit my thoughts to Thy thoughts and my concepts to Thy concepts."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then the door will be opened and the way paved for the Lord to come out from our spirit and enter our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is already in our spirit, but He is waiting and seeking an opportunity to spread from our spirit into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we submit our mind to Him, He will have a free way to saturate, fill, and renew it with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our natural mind must be transformed into the mind of Christ.</S>
