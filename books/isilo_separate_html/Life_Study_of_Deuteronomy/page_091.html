Sparing the Producing Animals</H2><P>Deuteronomy 22:6 and 7 and 25:4 deal with sparing the producing animals.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. An Israelite Coming Upon a Bird's Nest<br>and Not Taking the Mother with the Young</H2><P>If an Israelite came upon a bird's nest in the way, in any tree or on the ground, and the mother was sitting upon the young birds or eggs, he was not to take the mother with the young (22:6). He had to let the mother go, but the young he could take for himself, that it might go well with him and that he might extend his days (v. 7). This indicates that he was to spare the producing animal. Even a matter such as this is related to blessing, indicated by the words "it may go well with you," and longevity, indicated by the words "that you may extend your days." If an Israelite wanted a blessed, healthy, and long life, he had to fulfill the requirement concerning the sparing of a producing animal. Some brothers and sisters are like mother birds, and we need to take care of them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. An Ox Not Being Muzzled<br>While It Treads Out Grain</H2><P>"You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out grain" (25:4). It would not have been fair for an ox to be muzzled and thus unable to eat while it was working. Certain brothers are like producing oxen (1 Cor. 9:9; 1 Tim. 5:18). If a brother produces something for us, we must not "muzzle" him. In relation to the brothers and sisters today, we should keep the statute concerning sparing the producing animals.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_090.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_092.html">Next</a> </body></html>
