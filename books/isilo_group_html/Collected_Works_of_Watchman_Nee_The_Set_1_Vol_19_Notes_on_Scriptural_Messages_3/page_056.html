In the first century, the gospel was spread by a few Galilean fishermen. As far as their own condition was concerned, they were uneducated men of no renown, and they did not have any courage of their own. Although Peter was the strongest among the twelve disciples, on the night of the Lord's betrayal, he would only follow the Lord from a distance. In the courtyard of the High Priest, he could not pass the test of a maid's questioning, and he denied the Lord three times. This proves that he was just the same as all the other disciples, weak and fearful. But on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit descended on them, Peter stood up with the other eleven to speak and no longer acted like a fearful and illiterate fisherman. He performed many miracles (Acts 2:43). They were persecuted, arrested, and threatened by the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees. When they were forbidden to preach about the resurrection of the Lord, they answered, "For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard" (4:20). They were so bold to speak the Lord's word that even when the ones who examined them "perceived that they were uneducated men and laymen, they marveled" (vv. 1-21). Their weakness was changed to strength because they knew the power of Christ's resurrection. They were no longer living by their natural life but were living by the power of resurrection.</P><P>While Stephen was being stoned by the crowd for the sake of the Lord's word, he had no hatred in him but cried, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them" (Acts 7:60). This kind of power can only come from the resurrection life.</P><P>When Paul and Silas were imprisoned in the jail, they were not disappointed and did not lose heart. They did not grieve or weep, but while they were "praying, [they] sang hymns of praise to God" (Acts 16:25). The result was that even the jailor and his household believed in God. This power was also a manifestation of the resurrection power of Christ through them.</P><P>In order to know the power of resurrection, there is the need of revelation. Therefore, we need the prayer of Ephesians 1: "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him...that you may know what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead" (vv. 17, 19). According to the original language, "might" belongs to "strength." Therefore, it is "the might of His strength"; might issues from strength. This verse tells us about the might that God operates in those who believe. This might is the might which operated in Christ in resurrecting Him from the dead. In other words, the same might which God operated in raising Christ from the dead to become free from the bondage of death and all other barriers is manifested in us who believe.</P><P>We thank God that the church has experienced this resurrection power in reality. We are regenerated through His resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). When we preach the gospel to others and they receive it, the result is a fruit of resurrection. The Lord said, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth" (Matt. 28:18). He also said, "For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst" (18:20). If two and three are harmonious concerning any matter, the power of resurrection is manifested. Therefore, any time a man experiences regeneration, spiritual edification, or the exercise of holiness, the power of resurrection is manifested (Rom. 8). In 1 Corinthians 15 Paul "labored more abundantly" (v. 10) and was able to "die daily" (v. 31) because of the presence of resurrection. In 2 Corinthians 11, Paul could say of himself: "In labors more abundantly, in imprisonments more abundantly, in stripes excessively, in deaths often. Under the hands of the Jews five times I received forty stripes less one; three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the deep; in journeys often, in dangers of rivers,...in labor and hardship; in watchings often; in hunger and thirst; in fastings often; in cold and nakedness-apart from the things which have not been mentioned, there is this: the crowd of cares pressing upon me daily, the anxious concern for all the churches" (vv. 23-28). What was the power that upheld him and caused him to suffer so willingly? It was the power of resurrection. Philippians 3 shows us that Paul was able to know "the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death" because he knew Christ "and the power of His resurrection" (v. 10).</P><P>Among God's children, we can find many who have such experience. Some were in a prolonged illness, but through knowing the power of resurrection, they were able to lift up their head and praise God. Some encounter great pain, tribulations, and shame. According to their natural constitution, these things are beyond their power (2 Cor. 1:8), but they are able to endure all these because of the power of resurrection. As the Scripture says, "We are pressed on every side but not constricted; unable to find a way out but not utterly without a way out; persecuted but not abandoned; cast down but not destroyed" (4:8-9). All these prove one fact, "that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us" (v. 7).</P><P>We have to remember that the nature of the Body is the same as the nature of the Head. We have to go before God and ask Him to grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that we will realize that resurrection power is something for us to experience and that the church should enjoy God's resurrection power. The resurrection power of Christ is already in us. We should ask God to open our eyes so that we would know the might of the strength that is within us and would be strengthened by this resurrection power. If we do this, we will not be as weak, impotent, self-loving, and self-pitying as we are today; we will be empowered in the face of sin, the devil, and the flesh and will be able to transcend over all these things. These things will not be able to entangle, affect, or restrict us any longer.</P><P>Oh, resurrection is too great a matter; it is not something that can be described with words or understood with the mind. May the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of an eternal covenant, richly grant the church a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that the church would truly know Christ and the power of His resurrection. Amen!</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 19: Notes on Scriptural Messages (3) &nbsp; pg 56</div><br></body></html>
