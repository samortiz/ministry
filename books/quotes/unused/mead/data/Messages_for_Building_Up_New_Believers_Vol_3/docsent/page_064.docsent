   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Satan s Work on Man s Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible shows us clearly that many physical diseases are the result of Satan s attack.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The fever of Peter s mother-in-law was an attack from Satan, and the Lord Jesus rebuked the fever Luke 4:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Something must have a personality before the Lord can rebuke it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We cannot rebuke a cup or a chair; we can only rebuke something that has a personality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Fever is a symptom; the Lord could not rebuke the symptom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But Satan was behind the symptom with a personality of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, as soon as the Lord rebuked the fever, it was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Mark 9 we see a dumb and deaf child.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In man s eyes dumbness and deafness are sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the Lord Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, saying, Dumb and deaf spirit, I order you, come out of him and enter into him no more v. 25 . The dumbness and deafness of the child were outward symptoms of his demon possession; they were not ordinary illnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must realize that many sicknesses are medically defined diseases.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But there are many sicknesses that are actually attacks from the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible does not say that the Lord healed the sickness but that He rebuked it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The boils on Job s body could not be healed by medicine; they were not medical illnesses; they were attacks from the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Unless one first deals with the devil, he has no way to deal with such sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We admit that illnesses often occur through man s negligence of natural laws.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, it can quite often be the result of Satan s attack.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In such a case one only has to ask the Lord to rebuke the sickness, and it will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This type of sickness often comes and goes away suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is an attack from Satan rather than an ordinary illness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The complication lies in the fact that Satan does not want us to uncover and expose the illnesses he has inflicted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He always hides behind natural symptoms and makes us think that every sickness is the result of natural causes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we allow him to hide behind these natural symptoms, our illness will not go away.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once we expose his work and rebuke him, the sickness will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One Christian had a very high fever and suffered greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He could not sleep and did not understand what was happening to him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Later, he was convinced that it was Satan s work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He prayed to the Lord about it, and the next day the fever went away.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When a Christian becomes sick, he should first find the cause for his illness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He should ask: Is there any proper reason for this sickness?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Is this out of natural causes or is it an attack from Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If there is not a proper reason for the illness and you discover that it is indeed an attack from Satan, you should withstand him and reject him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The work of Satan on man s body results not only in illness but also in death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Satan was a murderer from the beginning, in the same way that he was a liar from the beginning John 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should withstand not only Satan s sickness but also his murdering.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All thought of death is from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every notion of death as a means to escape from anything is from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Satan made Job think of death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He did this not only to Job but also to every child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All notions of suicide, death wishes, and premature death are temptations from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He tempts man to sin, and he also tempts man to die.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even thoughts of danger during one s travels are Satan s attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must reject these thoughts whenever they come and not allow them to remain in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>C. Satan s Work on Man s Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Revelation 12:10 says, The accuser of our brothers...who accuses them before our God day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This shows us that part of Satan s work is to accuse us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This work is carried out in man s conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As soon as a person is saved, his conscience is quickened, and he begins to know sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Satan knows this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He knows that the Holy Spirit touches the conscience of God s children concerning sin.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He knows that He guides them into confession and prayer for forgiveness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Consequently, Satan steps in to counterfeit the Holy Spirit s work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He accuses man in his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Such an attack is found frequently among God s children, and it causes much havoc.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many children of God cannot differentiate between the Holy Spirit s reproach and Satan s accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As a result, they are hesitant to withstand anything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This gives Satan further ground to exercise his accusations.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many children of God could have been very useful in the hands of God, but their conscience has been weakened to the uttermost by Satan s attack.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They are bombarded constantly with the accusation and feeling that they have sinned in this and that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are unable to stand up before God or before men.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As a result, they become spiritually handicapped for the rest of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is true that we should pay attention to the reproach of the Holy Spirit once we become Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, we also need to withstand Satan s accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to pay attention to the difference between the Holy Spirit s reproach and Satan s accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many so-called reproaches are counterfeits; they are, in fact, Satan s accusations.</S>
