   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Next, the believers should live and walk by the Spirit Gal 5:16, 25 and walk according to the mingled spirit Rom 8:4 , setting their mind on the mingled spirit, which is indwelt by the pneumatic Christ, the indwelling Spirit, to impart life within them and for them to put to death the practices of the body Rom 8:4, 6, 9-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>9.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At this juncture we need to go on to consider the builders of the divine building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some may think that Christ alone builds the church.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Unless we have enjoyed the impartation of the divine life and have received the Spirit without measure, we can have no part in the divine building, for the Lord Jesus cannot build us into the divine building.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yes, the Lord is building the church, but we must be those who are listening to His word, partaking of His divine life, and sharing His immeasurable Spirit, that is, sharing His Spirit immeasurably.</S>
