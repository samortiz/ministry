   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE KINGDOMS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since Satan has come into us and since the Lord Jesus has also come into us, it is possible for us to be in three kingdoms.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we live in our soul, we are certainly in the human kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we live according to the flesh, we become a part of the satanic kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we walk in the spirit and live according to the spirit, we are in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, it is very difficult for anyone to be in the human kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The human kingdom in our soul has become very weak and fragile.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With even a little smiting, it is broken and subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, whenever we try to be human, we merely succeed in being devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever we attempt to be good, we discover that we are bad.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever we try to be patient or kind and not to lose our temper, we inevitably lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The evil one will not allow us to be a proper human being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Satan will always try to subdue us and have us under his control.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is difficult for the human kingdom to be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At best the human kingdom is a small colony in the satanic kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The human kingdom is always under the control of the satanic kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Practically speaking, there are actually only two kingdoms on the earth today: the kingdom of Satan, including the subdued human kingdom, and the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE STRONGHOLDS IN THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The battlefield of these two kingdoms is our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The kingdom of Satan fights against the kingdom of God in the battlefield of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The spiritual warfare between God and Satan is altogether in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although the Lord Jesus is now in our spirit, He has a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He cannot easily penetrate our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our mind is a stronghold, and it is hard for the Lord Jesus to come into it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second Corinthians 10:4-5 reveals that there are strongholds within us, which are our rebellious thoughts belonging to our reprobate mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul says that the spiritual warfare is simply to overthrow the thoughts, the reasonings in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To overthrow the reasonings means to subdue the mind, to take over the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many Christians today are under the control of Satan in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The strongholds consist of the concepts, ideas, opinions, judgments, even the very way of thinking all of which are elements in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many times people say, "I don't agree with that!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This simply means that they are clinging to something in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>SEDUCED FROM THE SIMPLICITY</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I like the word Paul used in 2 Corinthians 11:3.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul said that he was very concerned for the Corinthians lest their thoughts be seduced from the simplicity that is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although I have been in the Lord's work for many years, I have yet to meet a person who is truly simple.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet I would say that the most blessed persons are simple people very simple and single.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word "simplicity" may also be translated into "singleness."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Most Christians today are not simple; they are very complicated because they have collected all kinds of doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They think that more doctrines they have, the better, but actually the more doctrines they have, the more complicated they become.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word "seduced" here is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is better to translate it this way: "that your minds would be corrupted by being seduced from the simplicity."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not only a matter of seduction; it is also a matter of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever our thoughts are seduced from the simplicity and singleness that is in Christ, our mind will be corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is easy to fill people with teaching, but it is a difficult task to empty them of their teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is easy to load people with teaching, but once the teaching has entered into them, it is exceedingly hard for anyone to unload it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, as long as we keep the seducing teachings in our mind, our mind will be corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For us to experience the riches of Christ and to enjoy Him, we all need to be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are not simple, we will be in our seduced and corrupted mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is a dreadful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The spiritual warfare today is mainly to capture the mind, to cast down the strongholds in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Spiritual warfare is primarily a matter of fighting the enemy in our minds.</S>
