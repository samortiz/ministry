The wife should obey the husband. If the husband allows her to sin, it is as if he had sinned himself. Children should obey their parents and not control them. The children cannot be held accountable for the parents' sin in worshipping idols. The two stand in different positions (Eph. 5:22; 6:1). However, the believer should stay far away from matters of idolatry (demonic feasts).</p><p>Mr. Nee, please read through the answers to these questions about idols and publish them in Collection of Newsletters. The local government here has recently set up a militia. Can the believers refuse to join it? It is a matter of law. I hope you will study this and give us some advice. Greetings to Mr. Chang Kuang Hsiung.</p><p>Additional Note from Wang Yu T'ing</p><p>Note from Watchman: Brother Wang's answers concerning the matter of idols are very correct. We believers should keep ourselves from doing these things which bring on the Lord's wrath. I deeply believe that even if we lose something of a worldly inheritance, God will bless us. Read Hebrews 13:5-6.</p><p>With regard to the matter of the militia, we must remember: (1) We should obey those with authority over us (Rom. 13:1); (2) we cannot kill, even in war (Matt. 26:52). Therefore, when our country organizes a militia, we cannot disobey. However, we cannot go to war for any reason. Therefore, I think:</p><p>(1) If they require us to be trained, we can go; but when there is a war, we cannot fight.</p><p>(2) Our training invariably leads to conscription so that when there is a war, we will be forced to go against our will. It would be better for us to not attend the training at all.</p><p>(3) If we believers cannot obey the authority by fulfilling the law, then we should obey our country by accepting the punishment. They may have a severe penalty of a jail sentence or a fine for those who do not enter the militia, but we should obey them in this matter.</p><p>Brothers, we must be faithful unto death. We should not procrastinate in regard to our testimony for the truth.</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM BROTHER LUKE HSUAN</h2><p>Brother Tu:</p><p>I have enclosed the draft of a letter I wrote recently for the purpose of leaving the denominations. Please look it over and notify the responsible brothers or all the brothers so that they will know that I am definitely walking in the same way with you. May the Almighty Lord lead me, as a weak and useless little lamb, to go on, and may He cover and protect me until He comes. May the Lord bless you!</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Luke Hsuan<br />July 23</p><p>Mr. Pastor and the saints called in grace together by the Lord:</p><p>After being called in grace by the Lord, He enlightened me to know that a Christian is already in His name and cannot take on another name (i.e., Anglican). For example, a wife cannot add another man's name on to her husband's name. If she does this, what kind of woman is she? In addition, the Lord has shown us how much the denominations have deviated from the clear teachings of the Bible. He hates: (1) divisions (1 Cor. 1:10-13); (2) the flesh, which is according to the fashion of the world (3:3-5); and (3) factions, works of the flesh (Gal. 5:19-20). In order to obey the Lord, I have especially written this letter to ask you to strike my name from your record. From now on I have no relationship with the Anglican Church. Perhaps you will not agree with this action, but I still hope that you will be noble Bereans and search the Scripture to see whether or not this doctrine is right. May the Almighty Lord bless you personally. Amen.</p><p>A Christian,<br />Hsuan Hsiang Pao</p><p>I believed and was baptized in 1927 under the name of Hsiang Pao or Ling Sheng.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 26: Collection of Newsletters (2) & Watchman Nee's Testimony &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
