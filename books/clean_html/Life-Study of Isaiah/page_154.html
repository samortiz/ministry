<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Anointed of Jehovah<br>Coming to Tread the Winepress<br>to Save Israel from the Nations</H2><P>The Anointed of Jehovah will come to tread the winepress to save Israel from the nations (63:1-6; Rev. 14:17-20; 19:11-16, 19-21). The word winepress in Isaiah 63:2 and in Revelation 14:19-20 and 19:15 refers to the war at Armageddon. Isaiah 61 and 62 show us that Christ will come back to be so much to Israel on the positive side. Isaiah 63 reveals that in His coming back Christ will save Israel from destruction.</P><P>During the last three and a half years of this age, Antichrist will persecute the Jews to the uttermost, with the intention of completely destroying Israel. Prior to that time, nearly all of Israel will be brought back to the Holy Land. Then, before the tribulation, Antichrist will make a seven-year covenant of peace with Israel so that they may have their freedom. But after three and a half years, Antichrist will change his mind and will oppose every kind of religion, including Judaism and Roman Catholicism. After destroying Catholicism, Antichrist will attempt to destroy the Jewish religion. At the end of the last three and a half years, Antichrist will cause the armies of the nations to surround Jerusalem. With Jerusalem as the center, the entire region from Bozrah to the Mount of Megiddo (Armageddon, Rev. 16:16) will be occupied by armies. In His coming back, Christ will descend to Bozrah, and beginning there He will tread the winepress, destroying all the armies. In this way He will rescue Israel from destruction.</P><P>We have emphasized the fact that Christ's coming is of two aspects or sections. The first section of His coming results in the producing and building up of the church. At the end of the church age, during the last three and a half years of this age, Christ will continue His coming.</P><P>This continuation of His coming will be of three parts. First, according to Revelation 12 and 14, Christ will be in the heavens to receive the raptured overcomers into His presence. Second, Christ will descend with His overcomers from the third heaven to the air. While He is in the air, the rapture of the majority of His believers will take place. Then He will judge all the believers to determine who will receive the reward of the kingdom and who will suffer chastisement and discipline during the kingdom age that they may mature. In the air, Christ will also have a wedding day, with Himself as the Bridegroom and the overcoming saints as the bride (Rev. 19:7-9). Third, Christ and His newly-married bride as His army will descend to Bozrah to destroy the armies of the earth. Moving from Bozrah through Jerusalem to Armageddon, He will tread the winepress. Those who "destroy the earth" (Rev. 11:18) and those who oppose God will be slain, Israel will be rescued, and Christ will set up His throne at Jerusalem and will judge the nations. Then He will establish His kingdom to rule over Israel with the twelve apostles as His helpers and also to rule all the nations with the overcoming saints as His helpers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Jehovah's Lovingkindness<br>to the House of Israel</H2><P>Isaiah 63:7-9 speaks of Jehovah's lovingkindness to the house of Israel, given according to His compassions and the multitude of His lovingkindnesses, in saving them by the Angel of His presence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Jehovah to Return to His Rebellious People</H2><P>Finally, according to verses 10 through 19, Jehovah will return to His rebellious people, who grieved His Spirit of holiness, as their Father and Redeemer.</P>
