   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Our Lord is "the faithful Witness."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Isaiah 55:4 says that God has "given him as a witness to the peoples."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When our Lord was judged, He Himself also said, "I have come into the world, that I would testify to the truth" John 18:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Later, Paul spoke to Timothy concerning this matter: "I charge you before...Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate, that you keep the commandment spotless" 1 Tim 6:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since the Lord witnessed a good confession, we should follow His example.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people who witness for God have failed in varying degrees, but our Lord is faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Who was faithful to Him who constituted Him" Heb 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Holy Spirit mentions specifically the word "faithful" here to alarm the unfaithful and the disloyal churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God does not speak of His success but of His faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Oh, how the church differs from the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nowadays, most people pay attention to the outward success and despise or even forget the inward faithfulness!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God says that the Lord Jesus is the witness because He witnesses faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If our hearts are not faithful to the things of the Lord, though we may have many successes, the Lord is not concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should search our hearts lest we vainly toil and labor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This will be a great help to those who think they are a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because they have failed, many people have been tempted to give up the Lord's pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, we should remember that we are not the master but the slaves, and we are not free to do whatever we want.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the other hand, the Lord we serve is faithful, and all He asks is that our hearts be pure, single, and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is not concerned about our success.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our Lord faithfully witnessed unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From the world's view, Calvary was His failure.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually it was not Him who failed, but the prince of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Indeed, the outward death is easy, but the inward death is very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without the inward death, what we witness will not be from the heart; it will not be true.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should die witnessing and witness dying.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord was very willing to be defeated outwardly in order to gain the victory in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If this is the way of the cross, the victory of victories, then what about our works?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our Lord is the victorious One after all.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He never failed, and He will never fail.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although He died, He was "the Firstborn of the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was the first One who, though dead, did not allow corruption to touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no one like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, He is not only "the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep" 1 Cor 15:20 , but also the One who has "the first place in all things" Col 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because He had faithfully witnessed, He became the Firstborn of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because He is the Firstborn of the dead, He obtains all things as His inheritance and is the Lord of both the dead and the living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the time comes, He will come again and be "the Ruler of the kings of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This resembles the word in Philippians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus as a man humbled Himself unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, God has highly exalted Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These are all related to the person of the Lord Jesus as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because He was so perfect as a man, He obtained all the promises and gifts that God gives to man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only is our Lord like this; He desires that we also be like Him in these three things: we are to be His witnesses, our hope is to attain unto the out-resurrection Phil 3:11 , and we are to desire after the reigning together with Him as kings in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The future things have not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What will be in the future all depends on what is now.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do not witness faithfully, though we will not lose our salvation, we will lose the glory of reigning with the Lord in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May the joy in the future attract us now, so that wherever we are, we will witness faithfully for the Lord in words and deeds faithful in purpose and also in means.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"Grace to you and peace," from the faithful Witness, the One who has overcome death, the future Ruler of the kings, unto us!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May we all not look down on this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is one passage in the Old Testament that speaks of these three names of our King: "His throne...as a faithful witness in heaven...Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth" Psa 89:36, 37, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We see that this prophecy of the Son of David is fulfilled in our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Glory be to Him!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"Grace and peace!"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not forget what these are.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Grace is first, then peace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Peace is according to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is ignorance to try to have peace with God without first obtaining the grace of God!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>While the world was in enmity with God and had lost its peace, God graced it in sending His Son to die on the cross in its stead, shedding His precious blood, thus making peace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now, whoever is willing to accept God's grace will obtain it and have peace with God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Grace and peace are not given to us once for all when we first believe.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, they are an unceasing supply.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Triune God's grace and peace are always unto us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The grace here is in opposition to the coming law, and the peace is in opposition to the future battle.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When God actually forsakes the church, which up until now is only planned but not realized, grace and peace will cease.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He will again execute His law and will declare war with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the word of the apostle John's greeting and blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How kind and loving it is!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In man's eyes, though He is the loftiest One, He still does not forget the tender and kind word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is no place for coarseness in godliness.</S>
