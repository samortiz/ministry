   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In response to their handing themselves over to the work for the Lord's recovery, Brother Nee and I wrote the following reply to them:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>March 18, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"While it remained, was it not your own?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And when it was sold, was it not under your authority?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Acts 5:4</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Dear Brother Jin-chin:</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have read the paper you have handed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After fellowshipping over the matter twice, we feel that according to your present spiritual condition, the time has not yet come for you to work together as "stewards."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, concerning your future, we feel that you should proceed according to the following methods:</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1 As much as possible, everything in your possession that you have no use of should be sold.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Try to gather up everything together.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Half of these proceeds should be given to the elders of the church for the building of the meeting hall in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The other half should be sent away through the elders for use of the work in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2 Your business is returned to you for your own management.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The profit you gain should be handed over to the elders for the use of the work in the Hong Kong region.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We hope that you can be faithful in this matter and that you can give a good account before the Lord as a faithful steward on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moreover, we hope that you will advance more in your stewardship in financial matters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Peace be to you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Your brothers,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
