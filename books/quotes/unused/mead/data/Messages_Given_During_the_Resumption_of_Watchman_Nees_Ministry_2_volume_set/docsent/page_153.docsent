   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONSECRATION OF OUR BODIES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE CONSECRATION OF OUR TIME</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can a person consecrate his body?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Suen answered that we have to not love our life unto the death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, I am afraid that rarely do we encounter death experiences in our lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Others answered that we have to serve, to consider all things as dung, or to not love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brothers and sisters, the consecration of the bodies is the consecration of time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The body is limited to time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we present our time, we present our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do not present our time, we will not be able to present our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to serve the Lord, we have to set aside definite times for the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some people say that they read the Bible and pray from morning until evening.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, we are not counting merely on these things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is really precious is for a person to set aside two hours a week to devote himself fully to the service of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With many people, their service today is a kind of capricious service.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They do not set aside time consciously.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, they do it whenever they like to and give it up whenever they do not like it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The consecration that we are speaking of is definite.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not a matter of joining the crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today, the church needs more brothers and sisters to consecrate their time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If some brothers and sisters will exercise themselves to give a third or even half of their time to the Lord, not for serving as a preacher, but in the way of presenting their bodies, God will be able to take great strides among us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suppose the responsible brothers would take up a job in the morning and would devote themselves to serving the Lord in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They may be holding a job, but at the same time they set aside definite times to work for the Lord in the church, and they allocate definite periods of time for the Lord's use.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This would be a most beautiful thing to have.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I hope that the brothers and sisters among us would start practicing this even from their youth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the services spoken of in Romans 12 require time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To manage, to teach, or to exhort, all require time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a person does not present his time, the services of the Body will never be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a brother spends a lot of time on his business, how can he participate in all these services?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Concerning money, a person should also set aside one-tenth of what he has to the Lord in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if you are without food and without clothing, you nevertheless have to set aside this one-tenth to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Later, the Lord may lead you to offer up two-tenths, or three-tenths.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The young brothers and sisters should be legal about this and should be as strict as possible about it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If our time is presented, our bodies will be presented also.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When our bodies are presented, the work will come, and the blessings will come.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more we serve, the more there will be things in which to serve, and we will never find a day of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Brethren were raised up in England in the nineteenth century, everyone put in their hearts and their time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As a result, the Lord blessed them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today, in London alone there are two hundred eighty of their meeting places.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all love the Lord today, and we have all consecrated our hearts to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What we need to do now is to present our time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a word for practice.</S>
