   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Romans 7:13 says, "Sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One day the Lord may show you how evil and sinful sin is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The very word sinful is enough to scare you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But when you preach about it after a few days, it is possible that you still remember the word sinful, but the picture, the image, is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When you see the sinfulness of sin, both the word and its picture are present.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when you stand up to speak about the evil of sin, the word is present but the picture is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We call this picture the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In serving as a minister of the word, we need the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such a memory reminds us not only of the words but also of the picture in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without such a memory, we may remember the words, but the thing, the picture, is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever we stand up to speak, we have to ask the Lord to grant us the memory of the Holy Spirit so that we will convey not only the words but impart the very thing behind the words as well.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Unless we have this memory, we can speak on the evil and sinfulness of sin ten or twenty times without knowing what sin really is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can only impress others with the sinfulness of sin when the memory of the Spirit reminds us of its sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>While we speak about it, we should not only have the words but the picture as well.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is God's word?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is word plus picture.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brothers, do we see this?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's word must be supplemented by the picture.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In fact, God's word is word plus picture.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Word without the picture is not God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we have the wrong picture behind the words, the words alone are not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Take another example.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose we are preaching the gospel and the subject is the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While we are speaking on love, we may have the picture in front of us; our speaking is based on the picture.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is good.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But many times the one who is speaking on God's love does not believe in God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How can he expect others to believe in it?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Spirit reminds us of the picture; He causes us to remember the very thing called "love."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we speak on that thing, we hit the right spot.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more we speak about it, the more we strike life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Life is struck; it is released.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without the memory of the Spirit, we may have all the right words, but we miss the very thing itself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The phrasing is right, but the thing is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In preaching God's word, we have to look to the memory of the Holy Spirit to remind us of the revelation in addition to having the inner word that the Spirit gives to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we speak according to this inner word, whether it is once or twice, life will be released, and others will see what we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is useless for us merely to pass on letters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Spirit must first remind us of the word before we can speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some of us were saved through John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But what if we memorize John 3:16 to see whether it will work again for others?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It will not work even if we recite it ten times to others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Holy Spirit opened our eyes at one time to this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>John 3:16 is only useful inasmuch as this seeing, which brought about our salvation, is retained in our memory and as we are reminded of this thing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The only thing that works is the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many people found the Lord to be very loving and precious when they received forgiveness of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They saw a revelation within, and they found the Lord to be very clear to them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The forgiveness which they experienced was great; therefore, the love was great Luke 7:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They saw something, and they had the word in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They had both the thoughts and the word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One day they spoke on the platform for an hour or two.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The word within was released, and everyone felt happy and received help.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After some time, they repeated the same speaking again.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The words were still there; they remembered them all.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The outer words were not missing, but the more they spoke, the more they realized that they did not have the real thing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It seemed they had forgotten that very thing they once talked about.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They could not recall what it was.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The words were still there, but the love was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They were short of the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every revelation has to be preserved in the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A minister of the word must be a person with a good memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The stronger this memory is, the better it is for him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His ministry of the word will be so much richer because he will have so many more living deposits within him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But if his memory of the Spirit is poor, he will have to repeatedly study all the revelations God has given him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is a pity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A man must not only know the revelation of the Holy Spirit, but this revelation must be enriched continually.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Perhaps we were saved thirty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At that time the Lord gave us a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Later He gave us another revelation and yet another one.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The revelation became greater and greater.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At the time of our salvation, we saw the basic revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Later the revelation became deeper and greater.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>A minister of the word must have the memory of the Holy Spirit; that is, he must nurture the revelation he receives in the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When he receives a fresh revelation, he has to keep it and nurture it in the memory of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then everything he receives will be kept alive.</S>
