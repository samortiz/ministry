<P>Verse 11:"But when the king came in to look at those reclining at table, he saw there a man who was not clothed with a wedding garment." "He saw there a man." This is to stand before the judgment seat. Within the realm of the kingdom of the heavens, the gospel has been preached everywhere. However, not all will be saved. "A man who was not clothed with a wedding garment." In Oriental countries the wedding garment is not prepared by the guest. The wedding garment signifies Christ as our robe of righteousness. We are clothed with Christ (Rom. 13:14; Gal. 3:27). God has clothed us with the robe of righteousness (Isa. 61:10). This wedding garment was prepared for us by God; "all things are ready" (v. 4). Unfortunately, this man thought that his clothing was good enough (self-righteousness); he was unwilling to take it off and was unwilling to change. He did not rely on the righteousness of Jesus.</P><P>Verse 12:"And he said to him, Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment? And he was speechless." The Lord did not ask why he had beaten others, lied, or transgressed against the law prior to this. He only asked why he had no wedding garment. The Lord does not ask for our past history; He only asks whether or not we have the righteousness of Christ. The word "speechless" proves that this man knew that this was wrong, and yet he transgressed intentionally. Although the man was poor, the king had already made the provision. The man might have considered himself unworthy, but the king had the garment. The only problem was that he would not remove his own garment and put on the king's.</P><P>Verse 13:"Then the king said to the servants, Bind his feet and hands, and cast him out into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth." The fruit of not depending on Christ is perdition. The darkness here is different from that in chapter twenty-five.</P><P>Verse 14:"For many are called but few are chosen." There are many people in the realm of the kingdom of the heavens, but the number of saved ones is small. Do not think that because there was only one person, that must be the Jews. Within the church today there are more tares than wheat.</P><P>Verse 15:"Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might ensnare Him in His words." The following verses are the record of how the Jews tempted Jesus. They could not find anything that they could hold against Him concerning His conduct. Hence they tried to find it in His words. Today men do the same thing.</P><P>Verse 16:"And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that You are true and that You teach the way of God in truth and do not fear anyone, for You do not regard the person of men." The Pharisees and the Herodians (those who pleased the foreigners, the traitors of the Jews) formerly opposed one another, but now they joined together to tempt the Lord. "Their disciples." Only the blind students would come under the tutelage of blind instructors. "You are true." First they flattered the Lord because they were afraid that He would lie and that they would not be able to entangle Him. "And do not fear anyone." This means, "You, Jesus, will speak the truth to us, the Pharisees and Herodians, regardless of Caesar." "Do not fear anyone" means the same thing as "do not regard the person of men." Even before Pilate He would speak the truth.</P><P>Verse 17:"Tell us therefore, What do You think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?" "What do You think?" They did not say that this ought to be done or that this was according to the law. By asking, "What do you think?" they thought that they could trap Him. "Is it lawful...or not?" Both ways posed a trap. One way would make the Lord a traitor to Israel, while the other way would make Him a rebel to Rome.</P><P>Verses 18-19:"But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, Why do you tempt Me, hypocrites? Show Me the coin for the tribute. And they brought to Him a denarius." He exposed their hypocrisy and their evil plot right then and there. He did not have silver or gold. "Show Me the coin for the tribute." Only those who give tribute will have Caesar's money; the Lord did not have it.</P><P>Verses 20-21:"And He said to them, Whose is this image and inscription? They said, Caesar's. Then He said to them, Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar and the things that are God's to God." The question and the conclusion of the Lord are not only full of wisdom, but they are also full of instructions. (1) The believers should not become involved with politics, because the things that are Caesar's should be rendered to Caesar. (2) The believers ought to pay taxes, because the things that are Caesar's should be rendered to Caesar. (The saved ones themselves are the possessions of God; hence, they should not be used for the government.) (3) The reason that the Jewish nation was in captivity was that they had not rendered the things of God to God. On the contrary, they had worshipped idols; therefore, God had to punish them. "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar" is the instruction of the entire book of Jeremiah. At first the Jews thought that they would not render the things of God to God or the things of Caesar to Caesar.</P><P>Verse 22:"And when they heard this, they marveled. And they left Him and went away." One cannot help but marvel at such wisdom. If any reader does not feel that this is marvelous, he must be worse than the Jews.</P>
