<h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE CHURCHES</h2><h2 class="head2">Kuei-yang, Kweichow Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>The incident on February 4 is frightening even to recall. The large busy streets in the city were burned to ashes, and the whole city was bombed. There were over one thousand casualties, and over ten thousand people became homeless. Thank the Lord that those who are His were all preserved and did not even suffer any material damage. What do we have that makes us stronger or more noble than others? We can only boast of one thing, that we have God and that He gladly bestows grace! Hallelujah! Thank and praise Him! There is some moving around among the brothers and sisters that we know of.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Liu Yi-chuan, February 21</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>According to Sister Chen Shu-kwang of the China Inland Mission, none of the believers that she knew were hurt. Thank the Lord! There is as yet no need for any relief work.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Liu Yi-chuan, March 9</p><h2 class="head2">Yi-Lin, Northern Kiangsu</h2><p>Brothers in Shanghai:</p><p>There are over thirty meeting places scattered over all the counties north of Fu-Cheng. The saints close to our church are all under the Lord's grace. We are not too clear concerning all the details because of the inaccessibility to traffic. We will inform you after we have made further investigation. Thank God for His grace in protecting us during our move out of Yi-Lin and our temporary stay in Gu-Jia-Juang in Yien-Shu. This place is only twenty-five miles from Yi-Lin. The area is flat, and all the fields are flooded for hundreds of miles around. It is difficult to find food, and we find it hard to settle down. The spring harvest is in ruins, and we do not know what to do with the days ahead. We can only pray for God to open a way for us and to bring all those who belong to Him out of this crisis. Please pray for us so that God will open a way for the saints in northern Kiangsu. I will inform you of details later when I have them. Peace to you.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Wu Wei, March 27</p><h2 class="head2">Li-Wang-Jen, Ho-Jin,<br />Shansi Province</h2><p>Praise the Lord. My family and I are safe. Please do not worry. Since the interruption of postal service, how we have desired to know the footsteps of our brothers and sisters! Although our hearts are thinking about you, there is nothing we can do. We can only ask the Lord to protect, comfort, supply, and lead every child of His, amen. Recently, we received a letter from Sister Chang Pei-ling, together with Issue Nos. 4&mdash;13 of The Open Door. I was overjoyed and did not know what to say except, "Hallelujah" and "Praise the Lord!"</p><p>Praise the Lord that He has raised up a small number of people who are of one mind. I was very encouraged by some brothers and sisters who voluntarily went out after the conference to visit people and to preach the Lord's word to them. There are many seekers of the Lord in this area. There is the need for Him to send men to come and preach His glad tidings. Praise the Lord! In this small district a few villages already have local churches. In one place even the Lord's table has been established, and two other places are beginning to have the Lord's table as well. All these ones have taken up the responsibility by themselves. Some are saved but are not yet baptized. They intend to have baptisms in one or two places when the warm weather comes in spring. However, we do no know how many will be baptized. They are also willing to pioneer to the frontier lands for the gospel's sake. They intend to push towards the "mini-northwest" beginning in January. This is different from the "great-northwest" of China. Many brothers and sisters have migrated to the frontier provinces in the northwest and southwest of China. The saints here cannot go that far, but they want to at least move out to nearby areas. May the Lord create a good opportunity to promote the gospel in the "mini-northwest" and to attract a great number of people to Himself, amen. The truth in Rethinking Our Work meets my need. Although I am not a worker, I need it very much. We wonder whether Gospel Truth has been published yet? (Not yet&mdash;Editor.) These two are my most urgent needs. If possible, please mail them to me. Greetings to all the brothers and sisters with you.</p><p>Brother Chai En-shang, February 13</p>
