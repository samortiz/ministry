Gold, Pearl, and Precious Stones</h2>
<p>Our work should bring the brothers and sisters into the divine fellowship. Only this kind of work can produce gold, pearl, and precious stones. This kind of work will remain at the Lord&rsquo;s return. No matter how good a work may seem outwardly, it will not have any value if it is not gold, pearl, and precious stones. The Lord wants gold, pearl, and precious stones. When we bear the nature of gold, pearl, and precious stones, we will have the authority of the kingdom of the heavens. Otherwise, we are merely wood, grass, and stubble. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we remain in the divine fellowship and are filled with His rich and precious nature (1 Cor. 3:10-17; Rev. 21:18-21).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Spirit and Life</h2>
<p>God is not only the Spirit; He is also life (John 1:4). The Bible speaks of fellowship as the fellowship of life (1 John 1:1-3) as well as the fellowship of the Holy Spirit (2 Cor. 13:14; Phil. 2:1). Hence, the fellowship of life is the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Life and the Spirit cannot be separated. Life depends on the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit contains life. As we learn to live in fellowship, we must know the Holy Spirit and life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit of Fellowship</h2>
<p>Romans 8 clearly portrays the Spirit and the divine life in our spirit. The Spirit of God with the life of God both dwell in our spirit and are joined to our spirit. It is difficult to discern whether the word <em>spirit</em> in Romans 8 and in other places in the New Testament denotes the Holy Spirit or our regenerated human spirit. In some verses, such as Romans 8:9 and 16, the word <em>spirit</em> is clearly designated. Verse 4, however, speaks of walking according to the spirit. In this verse <em>spirit</em> denotes the mingled spirit, that is, the Spirit mingled with our human spirit. Fellowship is of life and of the Spirit. Both the divine life and the Spirit dwell in our spirit. Hence, fellowship is altogether a matter in our spirit. In other words, the flow of our spiritual life occurs in our spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit and our spirit are mingled as one spirit, and the Spirit contains the life of God. Hence, our mingled spirit involves the Spirit, our spirit, and the divine life. To illustrate, our spirit can be likened to a glass of water, the Spirit to a fruit-juice concentrate, and the divine life to sugar. When the three are mixed together, they become a fruit-water-sugar drink. The Spirit contains the divine life, and the Spirit is in our spirit. Hence, setting our mind on our mingled spirit is life (v. 6). The flow of life is in our mingled spirit. The divine life is always flowing in the Spirit, and this flow is in our spirit. Hence, in order to fellowship, we must turn to our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE SPIRIT AND THE MIND</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Minding the Spirit and the Mind of the Spirit</h2>
<p>The deepest part of our being is our spirit, our body is the outermost part, and our soul is between our spirit and our body. Our soul is composed of three parts: mind, emotion, and will. In fallen man the mind is the strongest part of the soul, followed by the emotion and the will. Therefore, the mind represents the soul. Romans 12:2 says that we should &ldquo;be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; This verse does not say that transformation is by the renewing of our emotion or by the renewing of our will. This shows that our mind is the leading part of our soul. Romans 8:6 speaks of &ldquo;the mind set on the spirit,&rdquo; which in the original language is literally &ldquo;the mind of the spirit.&rdquo; Ephesians 2:3 says that formerly we fulfilled &ldquo;the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts.&rdquo; Here the thoughts represent the soul, and the flesh relates to the lusts of the physical body. This means that prior to our salvation, when we were dead in offenses and sins, we conducted ourselves according to our flesh and our mind. Hebrews says that God will impart His law of life into our mind (8:10) and that He will inscribe it upon our mind (10:16). At our salvation God put His law of life into our spirit. Now this law is spreading from our spirit into our soul, represented by our mind. In these verses the mind represents the soul. After the fall man&rsquo;s mind became the leading part of his person. The mind is the dominant and leading part of fallen man.</p>
<p>The divine life is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in our regenerated spirit. Therefore, the fellowship of the divine life is in our spirit. As human beings, our mind is our strongest part. Hence, if we desire to learn to fellowship with God, we must turn our mind to our spirit. Romans 8:5 speaks of minding the things of the Spirit. This means that we should use our mind to touch the things of the Spirit, which is also to turn our mind to our spirit in order to contact the Spirit. In other words, to mind the things of the Spirit is for the mind to contact the Spirit. In verse 6 <em>the mind set on the spirit</em> means that the mind is controlled by the spirit and has become the mind of the spirit.</p>
<p>According to verses 5 and 6, when we turn our mind to our spirit, our entire being enters into the divine fellowship. In order for our mind to be mingled with our spirit, it must be set on our spirit. When our mind is set on our spirit, it is under the control of our spirit and becomes the mind of our spirit. For this reason, when we have time alone to fellowship with the Lord, it is best to close our eyes so that our mind can turn to our spirit. When we close our eyes and contemplate quietly, we can muse on the Lord Jesus, on heavenly and spiritual things, and on the Word. Such contemplating will turn our mind to our spirit and issue in spiritual feelings, which in turn will help set our mind further on the sense in our spirit. This is the way that our mind becomes the mind of our spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
