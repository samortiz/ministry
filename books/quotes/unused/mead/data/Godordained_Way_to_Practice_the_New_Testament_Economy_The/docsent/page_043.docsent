   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DANGER OF DIFFERENT MINISTRIES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The danger of different ministries can be seen in the inner life movement.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The inner life movement began in the seventeenth century with the mystics in the Catholic Church such as Madame Guyon and Father Fenelon.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>William Law was raised up to express the teachings of the mystics in a more practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His teachings were a great help to Andrew Murray, who played a prominent role in recovering the truth concerning Christ as the believers inward life and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jesse Penn-Lewis received help from Andrew Murray and went on to see much concerning the subjective death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Her teachings were published in a paper called The Overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Her teaching on the subjective death of Christ was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From the subjective death of Christ she went on to talk about spiritual warfare in a book entitled War on the Saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, however, Mrs. Penn-Lewis went to an extreme on the matter of spiritual warfare, and at the end of her life, she became preoccupied with demons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Late in Mrs. Penn-Lewis s ministry, T. Austin-Sparks was raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During a visit to Taiwan in 1955, Brother Sparks told me that when he was young, he was working with Mrs. Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But at a certain point, he realized that he could not work with her anymore because as a sister she exercised too much headship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She took too much of a leadership role as the head.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother Sparks left her to begin another work which became his own ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some said that Mrs. Penn-Lewis had a very good ministry on the subjective death of Christ and that Brother Sparks had a very good ministry on the principles of Christ s resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, Mrs. Penn-Lewis went to be with the Lord, but her paper, The Overcomer, continued to be published.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brother Sparks also published a paper entitled The Witness and the Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These two papers were in competition with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sister Penn-Lewis and Brother Sparks had two ministries to produce two results of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our early days in the recovery, we read their writings and received much help from them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both of them knew the Bible well and had spiritual insight.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I received a great deal of help from one book written by Brother Sparks entitled The Release of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This book helped me to know the truth concerning the release of the incarnated Jesus in John 12:24, that is, that the one grain was released to be many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These dear saints, however, made a great mistake by keeping two different kinds of ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For two different ministries to be carried out by two ministers is altogether against the principle of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The ministries of Sister Penn-Lewis and Brother Sparks became two kinds of works to produce two groups of people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One group followed Sister Penn-Lewis, and another group followed Brother Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must be warned by history so we do not repeat the mistakes made in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Lord s recovery there is only one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you say that the ministry is my ministry, you must say it with the realization that what I minister is the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The New Testament ministry was commissioned by the Lord Jesus to His twelve apostles and then to Paul and his co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brother Nee had a clear realization that there was only one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The ministry of God s economy in the New Testament is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the serving ones, the ministers, should participate in the same ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>ACCORDING TO THE APOSTLES TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The deciding factor in determining the right ministry, which is the ministry of God s New Testament economy, is the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A person s work is in the New Testament ministry if he teaches the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If he does not teach you according to the teaching of the apostles, his work is not participating in the ministry of the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The unique ministry is the ministry ordained by God according to the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The New Testament ministry, the unique ministry, the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of righteousness justification , is to bear the testimony of Jesus and to minister the processed and completed Christ to His believers according to the apostles teaching Eph 3:8; Gal 1:6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To preach anything other than the apostles teaching is to preach something that is not a part of the ministry of the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why Paul charged the Galatians to discern those who pervert the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A gospel other than the gospel that Paul preached to the Galatian believers is not the gospel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In other words, a gospel different from Paul s gospel is not in the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not receive a gospel different from Paul s gospel, different from Paul s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The ministry is unique in the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The New Testament ministers 2 Cor 3:6 are the ministers of the gospel of Jesus Christ Eph 3:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whoever ministers the gospel of Jesus Christ as the Son of God becoming a man, dying on the cross for our sins, and resurrecting to impart life into us, is one of the New Testament ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These ministers are for the building up of the church Col 1:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They are many, yet they have one unique ministry for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the ministers different works should be for this unique ministry Eph 4:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Not only the gifted members but also the perfected saints are working the work of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It should not be that only a few are in the ministry, but all of us need to be in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we go out to visit others, we need to speak the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is one ministry with thousands of ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In Christianity there are a few big speakers, but in the Lord s recovery we need to have thousands of speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These thousands of speakers should be ministers in the one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The ministry is not merely the ministry of a few gifted ones, but it is the ministry of each one of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is the ministry of thousands of small ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The one ministry must be our ministry.</S>
