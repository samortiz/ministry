   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR NEED TO DISCERN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To live in ascension requires that we discern our spirit from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is according to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s Economy in Saving Us</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are of three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have a spirit, a soul the self , and a body 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s economy in saving us is first to regenerate our dead spirit by imparting Himself into it as the divine element, making our spirit new.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, our soul is still old.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, after we have been regenerated, our soul needs to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The transformation of the soul is a gradual process that takes place step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our body is also old.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the body, the outer man, needs to be consumed day by day, while the inner man is being renewed 2 Cor 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This renewing will go on and on until it reaches its peak with the transfiguration of our body, that is, the redemption of our body Rom 8:23; Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Saved Persons Having Two Men</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As saved persons we all have two men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The new man is in our spirit, and the old man is in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Regardless of whether it is good or bad, right or wrong, whatever we do, if we do it in our soul, we are living by the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For instance, you may love a certain brother and want to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if you love him and help him not in your spirit but in your soul, you are living in your self, the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is to do a good thing in the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before doing anything in this case helping a brother we must first pray to contact the Lord in our spirit, asking Him what He feels about what we intend to do.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then in our spirit we may have the sense that the Lord is happy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is an indication that the Lord wants us to do this particular thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we should proceed to do it in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is to live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Living by the New Man</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do things by the old man in the soul or in the self, we are living on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The things we do may be good, but we are nevertheless on the earth because we are living in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today there are many good people who are doing good things, but these people are all living in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As lovers of Christ, we need to realize that our old man, including our soul, has been crucified Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is no longer I who live, but another man Christ lives in me Gal 2:20b .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we live by this other man, we are the new man, for we are living in the spirit, not in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Living in Ascension by Living in Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our spirit is connected to the heavens by God as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In spirit we are therefore in the heavens, in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To live in ascension requires that we live, act, move, and do everything in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, we must learn how to discern our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do not know our spirit, if we do not know how to discern our spirit from our soul, we cannot be a spiritual person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we live in our spirit, we are in ascension as the new creation in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are a new person living in a new universe.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Need for Practice</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not think that discerning the spirit from the soul is something that is too difficult for us to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all can learn how to do this if we practice one thing: We should always inquire of the Lord: Lord, is this the old man, the soul, the old I only, or You with me?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we sense that we are alone in the old I, then we are in the soul, in the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we sense that we are one with the Lord and that He is with us, then we are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we have proper fellowship with the Lord, inquiring of Him before doing things, then in our spirit we will have a deep sense of the Lord s feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We will know whether He is happy or not.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is to discern the soul from the spirit to live in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May we all learn to have this most important practice in our daily living.</S>
