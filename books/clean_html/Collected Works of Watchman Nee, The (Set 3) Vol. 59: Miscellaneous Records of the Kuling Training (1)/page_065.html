<h2 class="head1">DAVID HONORING THE DEPUTY AUTHORITY</h2><p>After Saul disobeyed God, he was put aside. Although Saul was still on the throne, in God's eyes he was over. God's intention was for David to be the king. Out of jealousy, Saul tried very hard to kill David, but David was unwilling to kill Saul in return. Both were anointed by the divine ointment. However, Saul was acting under God's past will, while David was acting under God's present plan and will. Both were kings. David was under God's anointing as well as God's plan. God intended for David to be king, and He also anointed David as king. It was wrong for Saul to oppose David. How could anyone oppose David as king? In man's eyes there was nothing wrong with David moving his hand a little to put himself on the throne. This was in line with God's will, and God had set Saul aside already. In God's eyes Saul's kingship was over. Was it not justifiable for David to help God to remove Saul? Was it not justifiable for him to assume the kingship sooner and to accomplish God's plan? God's will was for David to be the king. Was it not right for him to assume the kingship according to God's will? According to man there is nothing wrong with this, but this was not the way David reasoned. In 1 Samuel 24, while Saul was chasing David in the wilderness of Engedi, Saul entered a cave to relieve himself. David and his men were hiding in the inner part of the cave. The two enemies crossed paths. It would have been easy for David to kill Saul then. He could have thought, "God committed Goliath to my hand at one time. Now He has put Saul in my hand. What is wrong for me to kill him like I killed Goliath?" Had David killed Saul, he would have hastened God's plan in a sense, but by so doing, he would have rebelled against God's authority. Although Saul had failed, he still was the king and God's anointed authority. Although he had failed, David was still under his authority at one time. David's killing of Saul would have gained him his kingship at the expense of rebellion. This would have put him under a standing of rebellion. The proper way was for David to submit to God's authority rather than to His plan. Rebellion had disqualified Saul, and it could have disqualified David as well. Killing Saul would have put him in a wrong position. He was willing to take the right position and risk the danger of being killed by Saul rather than to rebel against God's deputy authority.</p><p>David's relationship with Saul was the same as Michael's relationship with Satan. David dealt with Saul in the same principle that Michael dealt with Satan. David only said, "May Jehovah judge between me and you" (1 Sam. 24:12). He was truly a person who knew divine authority. He was unlike many men today who behave lawlessly and recklessly in the church, in their family, and in society. If these men were in David's place, ninety-nine and a half out of a hundred would have killed Saul. We must uphold God's principle of authority more than our own existence. May the Lord grant us a little light to see the seriousness of God's authority. His authority is a tremendous thing. God will forever honor His own authority. We have to realize how sensitive and delicate the matter of authority is. It should not be lightly touched. This is the very principle governing the entire universe. A person cannot say that he only needs to submit to God's direct authority. He must first submit to God's appointed deputy authority. I wish that heaven would open and light would come to you to show you what God's authority means. If God has the intention for you to be the king, let Him move His hand and let Him put you on the throne! You must realize how sensitive God's authority is. You must realize this before you can be a man of light before Him. Once authority is overturned, everything is finished. You may think that there is nothing wrong in your enthusiasm for soul-winning and your zeal for work, but have you touched God's authority? Saul could have had many reasons for acting as he did. He could have reasoned, "Agag is not bad. Many of the people of Israel are short of meat, and the sheep and oxen of the Amalekites are so excellent. What a waste it would be to kill them all!" He was insensitive to the seriousness of the act of rebellion against authority. This is where he differed from David. David was very sensitive to authority; he upheld authority to the point of almost losing his own life. Saul, however, had his own thoughts. His heart was on the sheep and oxen, and he wanted to offer them as sacrifices to God. Instead, he sacrificed God's command.</p><p>The next incident is recorded in 1 Samuel 26. Saul and his captains with their choice men sought David in the wilderness of Ziph. There they camped and slept. Another temptation was presented before David here. He easily could have killed Saul, for "a deep sleep from Jehovah had fallen upon them" (v. 12). An ignorant Christian would sing "hallelujah" at such a juncture. He would think that the opportunity to remove Saul had come his way again. But David only took away Saul's spear and water jug; he let Saul go. Unless a man has received a great light from the Lord, he can easily reason within himself, "I let him go the first time; that should have justified my innocence. I was more than fair in letting him go the first time. Now this time I can surely kill him. Saul is still coming after me. Now I can kill him." David, however, was under a strong light. He dared not rebel against God's deputy authority. He always upheld God's authority. An authority is always an authority. Our submission to authority must not be affected by our environment. This is the only way that we can assume deputy authority ourselves.</p>
