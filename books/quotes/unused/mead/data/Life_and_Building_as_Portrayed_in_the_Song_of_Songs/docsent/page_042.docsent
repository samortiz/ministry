   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SICK OF LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The seeking one who reached such high attainment in her spiritual life still has some discrepancy between her and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She is much with the Lord, yet there is still some unwillingness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He calls her, and she hesitates.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She gives the Lord a very good excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>She says, "I have put off my old way of being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can I put it on again?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I have washed my feet from the dirt of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How can I defile them again?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These are good excuses, but when the Lord calls, He does not care how good the excuses are.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At this point, she realizes that the Lord is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love" 5:6, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She seeks the Lord, but she cannot find Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She calls, but the Lord does not answer her.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Others try to help her, and she tells them that she is sick of love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She is asked by all the others, "Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee" 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While she is telling them about the Lord, she realizes that the Lord has not left; He is still in His garden.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies" 6:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all have had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes we feel that the Lord is gone, and we begin to talk to others about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But while we are talking, we realize that the Lord is still with us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We thought He was far away, but He is still in His garden, feeding among the lilies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is still in us, and we are His, and He is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A DEEPER TURN</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At this time a further and deeper transforming work is done in the seeking one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now the Lord says to her, "Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners" 6:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After the turn in chapter four, the Lord likens her to a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But after this deeper turn, the Lord likens her to a city.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do not believe that any other teachings or instructions could help us in our spiritual growth as much as all these points.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not need to learn this book in a way of knowledge, but we must see all the turning points for our spiritual growth which this book opens up.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to fellowship and pray over these points many times.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All these lessons will be repeated again and again in a kind of cycle as we go on with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By all the cycles we will grow from the crown to the garden, and then from the garden to the city and the army.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the way for us to fulfill God's eternal purpose and to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
