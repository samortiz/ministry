   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Romans 14 shows us how to deal with those whose views differ from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What would we do if in our church there were vegetarians and Sabbatarians?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why, we should consider it almost intolerable if in the same church some of the believers kept the Lord's Day and others the Sabbath, and some ate meat freely, while others were strict vegetarians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That was exactly the situation Paul was facing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Let us note his conclusions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"Now him who is weak in faith receive, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his considerations" v. 1 . "Who are you who judge another's household servant? To his own master he stands or falls; and he will be made to stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand" v. 4 . "Therefore let us judge one another no longer, but rather judge this: not to put a stumbling block or cause of falling before your brother" v. 13 . Oh, for Christian tolerance! Oh, for largeness of heart! Alas! that many of God's children are so zealous for their pet doctrines that they immediately label as heretics, and treat accordingly, all whose interpretation of Scripture differs from theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God would have us walk in love toward all who hold views contrary to those views that are dear to us v. 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This does not mean that all the members of a church can hold whatever views they please, but it does mean that the solution to the problem of doctrinal differences does not lie in forming separate parties according to the different views held, but in walking in love toward those whose outlook differs from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By patient teaching we may yet be able to help all to "the oneness of the faith" Eph 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we wait patiently on the Lord, He may grant grace to the others to change their views, or He may grant us grace to see that we are not such good teachers as we thought we were.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nothing so tests the spirituality of a teacher as opposition to his teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The teachers must learn humility, but so must all the other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When they recognize their position in the Body, they will know that it is not given to everyone to determine matters of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They must learn to submit to those who have been equipped of God for the specific ministry of teaching His people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Spiritual gifts and spiritual experience are necessary for spiritual teaching; consequently not everyone can teach.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Make my joy full, that you think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing, doing nothing by way of selfish ambition nor by way of vainglory, but in lowliness of mind considering one another more excellent than yourselves; not regarding each his own virtues, but each the virtues of others also" Phil 2:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the churches have laid to heart what Paul wrote to the church in Philippi, then it will be perfectly possible to have only one church in one locality with no friction whatever among its many members.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>5 RACIAL DIFFERENCES.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit" 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jews have always had the strongest racial prejudice of all peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They regarded other nations as unclean, and were forbidden even to eat with them; but Paul made it very clear, in writing to the Corinthians, that in the Church both Jew and Gentile are one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All distinctions in Adam have been done away with in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A racial "church" has no recognition in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Church membership is determined by place of residence, not by race.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today in the large cosmopolitan cities of the world there are churches for the whites and churches for the blacks, churches for the Europeans and churches for the Asiatics.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These have originated through failure to understand that the boundary of a church is a city.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God does not permit any division of His children on the ground of difference of color, custom, or manner of living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No matter to what race they belong, if they belong to the same locality, they belong to the same church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God has placed believers of different races in one locality, so that, by transcending all external differences, they might in one church show forth the one life and the one Spirit of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All that comes to us by nature is overcome by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All that was ours in Adam has been ruled out in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The whole matter hinges here are all carnal differences done away with in Christ, or is there still a place for the flesh in the Church?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Are our resources in Christ sufficient to overcome all natural barriers?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let us remember that the church in any locality includes all the believers living there and excludes all who live elsewhere.</S>
