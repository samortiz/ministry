<h1 class="title">LEADING IN SPIRITUAL LIFE&mdash;<br />
MAN&rsquo;S FALL AND MAN&rsquo;S REGENERATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: March 23, 1961</h1>
<p>In chapter 3 we spoke of spiritual life as it relates to God&rsquo;s creation and to God being life. Now we will consider man&rsquo;s fall and man&rsquo;s regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S FALL</h2>
<p>There is a great deal of speaking in Christianity concerning God but very little speaking concerning God being life. There is also much speaking about God&rsquo;s creation of man but very little speaking about God creating a spirit in man so that man could receive God&rsquo;s life. Similarly, Christianity speaks concerning man&rsquo;s fall, but it rarely refers to the fact that the human spirit was damaged by man&rsquo;s fall. Most Christian teachers stress that man&rsquo;s fall resulted in his judicial condemnation by God. Those with a deeper understanding teach that man not only commits sins worthy of condemnation but also has a sinful nature as a result of the fall. Nevertheless, it is rarely pointed out that the fall damaged man&rsquo;s God-created human spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man&rsquo;s Spirit Being Damaged and<br />
Losing Its Function</h2>
<p>When we speak to the young people about man&rsquo;s fall, we must present three points. First, man sinned, and this sinful act condemned him before God as if he were in a court of law. Second, man&rsquo;s fall caused man to have a corrupt nature, to have sin within him. Hence, man not only commits sinful acts outwardly but also has a sinful nature inwardly. Because man has a sinful nature, his human nature is contaminated by sin. Third, from the viewpoint of life, man&rsquo;s fall resulted in his spirit being damaged. When Satan tempted man and caused man to fall, Satan damaged man&rsquo;s spirit, which was originally created as a vessel for man to contact and receive God. Although a light bulb can receive electricity and shine forth light if its outward surface is dirty, it will be unable to shine forth light if its inner fuse is damaged. Satan damaged the part within man that enabled man to contact God and receive God&mdash;the human spirit. Once man&rsquo;s spirit was damaged, man was truly fallen.</p>
<p>The proof that man&rsquo;s spirit was damaged in the fall can be seen in God&rsquo;s word to Adam in Genesis 2:17. God said, &ldquo;Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.&rdquo; Physically speaking, however, Adam did not die on the day that he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Although he did not die physically, his spirit died. Consider the example of the light bulb. From the outward appearance, it is often not possible to know if a light bulb is good or bad, especially if the light switch is turned off. Outwardly, a light bulb can appear to be intact, but if its fuse is broken, it will not conduct electricity. When Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, his spirit was deadened even though he was outwardly alive. His spirit was deadened because it lost its function.</p>
<p>The function of the spirit is to contact God. Since the function of our eyes is to see and the function of our ears is to hear, we can say that those who are blind or deaf have lost the function of their eyes and ears. Hence, their eyes and ears have been deadened. After Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, his spirit was deadened. Although his body was still alive, his spirit was deadened within because he lost the ability to contact God. To God, it was as if Adam were dead, because the function of his spirit was damaged.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:1 says, &ldquo;You, though dead in your offenses and sins.&rdquo; <em>Dead</em> refers to the deadness of the human spirit, because Paul was addressing believers who were living. When he said that they were dead in offenses and sins, he meant that their spirit had been deadened by their sins. When a person drowns, we say that he died in water. To say that people are dead in offenses and sins is equivalent to saying that people are damaged in their spirit because of their sins. We were dead in our sins because our spirit was damaged by our sins. Colossians 2:13 says, &ldquo;You, though dead in your offenses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh.&rdquo; This means that our offenses and our flesh caused our spirit to lose its function; that is, our spirit was deadened because of our offenses and our flesh.</p>
<p>Matthew 8:22 says, &ldquo;Let the dead bury their own dead.&rdquo; The first reference to <em>dead</em> speaks of those who are alive physically but dead in spirit, and the second reference to <em>dead</em> speaks of those who are physically dead. Thus, for the dead to bury their own dead means that those who are physically alive but dead in the spirit should bury those who are physically dead.</p>
<p>All these verses speak of people who are spiritually dead, not physically dead. When Satan tempted man to sin, his purpose was to damage the spirit that God had created in man. God created the human spirit so that man could contact Him and receive Him. When Satan damaged man&rsquo;s spirit, man could no longer contact God. Once man&rsquo;s spirit was damaged, man was in complete darkness. If someone wants to prevent us from seeing, the easiest way is to damage our eyes. Once our eyes are damaged, we will be in darkness and see nothing. The primary goal in Satan&rsquo;s corruption of man was to damage man&rsquo;s spirit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Leading the Young People with the Word and the Spirit &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
