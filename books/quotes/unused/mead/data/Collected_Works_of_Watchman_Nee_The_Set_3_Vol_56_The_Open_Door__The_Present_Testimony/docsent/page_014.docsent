   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Past Nine Months Hsugou</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord has especially led us to leave the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Over the past nine months we have seen something of the Lord's goal and plan as well as His requirements for us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We really cannot keep up; we can only prostrate ourselves in worship to Him and rely on Him to walk in the way set before us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We ask the brothers to pray much for us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The brothers and sisters here desperately need the edification for new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because we have not had sufficient learning and spiritual pursuit, we really have no way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We hope you will lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Du Chung-sheng, Kuo Ling-run, Dong Chun-mao,</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Beginning to Learn to Take the Lord's Way Chingyuan</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After hearing the truth concerning the church and the sin of denominations in 1948, we went to Taiyuan to fellowship with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After a period of study, we began to meet in the Lord's name at Brother Kuo's house in 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although we are immature, the Lord has had mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In His good time He led our dear brothers, Kuo Jun-bao and Chiu Ai-lu, to come into our midst this spring.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After a three-day conference, our standing was strengthened and some brothers turned from the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since then, our meetings have been stronger, and we have begun to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In September the Lord led these two brothers here for another three-day conference.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even more brothers and sisters turned from the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the morning of October 1 the Lord's Day , we baptized thirteen brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That afternoon we began to meet to break bread in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There were seven brothers and twenty-nine sisters for a total of thirty-six.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There were also six other brothers from other localities who had come to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Oh, we can only prostrate ourselves in worship!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are beginning to learn to take the Lord's way, and we need your supply and prayers very much so that the Lord would have more of a way among us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Kuo Ying-nan, Cao Ling</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>October 2, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Produced by the Skylight in the Ark Penglai</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We recently received The Open Door, and after reading it our hearts began to leap, and our spirits were greatly stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We really thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The situation in Penglai has been smothered by two denominations for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1931 three brothers and I saw that the denominations were not according to God's desire, and we boldly withdrew from them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that time we met and worshipped every day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although we were taunted very much, the Lord was victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thank Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Over the past ten years or more, we have preached the gospel and edified others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have increased from three or four to eighty-nine people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some have turned this way from the denominations, but most are young brothers and sisters who were raised up by the Lord through sufferings in the last few years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are more sisters than brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thank the Lord, this was all produced by the skylight in the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We earnestly desire to have the table meeting to remember the Lord in Penglai.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We also hope that the churches in other localities would fellowship with us, but we do not know how to carry this out.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Please remember us much in your prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Your weak brother,</S>
