   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO MAKE GOD'S WISDOM KNOWN TO THE ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The second item of the purpose of God for the church is to deal with His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter one of Ephesians there is the positive side of God's purpose for the sonship; and in chapter three there is the negative side against the enemy, that the enemy may be subdued and come to know God's manifold wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God is not sorry that there is such an evil one as Satan, because without such a one, God's manifold wisdom could not be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is through all the troubles originating from Satan that God has a chance to show forth His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose you have a car, and this car never gives you any trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If this is the case, no one could know how wise you are.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A car without problems would not demonstrate your wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if you have a car which needs wisdom to handle, your wisdom will be brought to light, and all of your passengers will marvel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is a problem car, but what a wonderful driver!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The whole universe has been damaged by Satan, but God needs such a one in order that His wisdom might be shown.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Ephesians 3 verse 10 Paul declared that God's multifarious wisdom is made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church is the Body of Christ, the joint-heirs, and the joint-partakers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is composed of those who once were ruined, corrupted, and damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before we were saved, we were vipers, poisonous serpents.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, we were dead in trespasses and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moreover, we were scattered and divided, utterly unable to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, all the members of the church were in a hopeless situation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nevertheless, God in His wisdom is able to make us the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we are not only redeemed, saved, cleansed, freed, liberated, and regenerated we are also united.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are one with God and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church is God's greatest boast.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although you may not care that much for the church, God cares very much for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes God may say, "Look, Satan, I have taken the very people whom you have ruined and I have made them into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do you have the wisdom to do such a thing?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You do not have this wisdom, but I have it.''</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God created man in His own image and gave him authority to have dominion over all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The image is related to the sonship, to the expression of God; and the dominion is related to dealing with God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The sonship is the fulfillment of God's image, for it is by the sonship that we will eventually be in the full image of God to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But God not only created man in His image to express Himself, He also committed His full authority to man for the purpose of subduing His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So the second item of the purpose of God for the church is related to the second aspect of God's creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church was predestinated to the sonship of God, and it was also purposed to subdue the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is built up by the sonship, and through the building up of the church, the enemy is subdued and God's wisdom is displayed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is a real order here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more life we have, the more built up we will become as a display to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a real challenge to the enemy, a shame to him and a glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Satan is so subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He causes many children of God to think that it is impossible to have the church built up on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He persuades them to believe that it is not to be built up on this earth, but far away in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But is Ephesians 3:9 only for the future?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I believe it must include this present age.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this present age and everywhere on this earth, the Lord must work out something as a challenge to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then God will say: "Satan, look!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even in the territory which you are utilizing, I have built up many lampstands which shine with the light of my life and bring things into order.''</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This display is a challenge and a shame to Satan, but a glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If our eyes are really opened, we will be ready for this at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We will pray, "Lord, I am willing at any cost for the building up of your church in my locality.''</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not a small matter, but something very strategic.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All of the struggling of the enemy is over this strategic point.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Satan will allow people to be saved, as long as they are not built up.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Satan will even allow them to seek spirituality, as long as they are not built up.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Satan will allow them to be anything, as long as they are not built up.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is because God's ultimate consummation is a building.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the eyes of the Lord, Satan has already been defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we have this insight, day by day we will sing, "Hallelujah for the victory!''</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We can tell Satan that even his small victory is just a preparation for our greater victory.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Eventually, he will be the one that is completely defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not care how much he attacks and damages.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord Jesus said if people destroyed His body, He would build it up in three days John 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The more Satan destroys, the more Christ will build up.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His destroying is just a preparation for the Lord's building up.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need the vision of how the Lord will use the church to defeat His enemy and to recover the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In this way, God is using His church to display His multifarious wisdom to His enemy.</S>
