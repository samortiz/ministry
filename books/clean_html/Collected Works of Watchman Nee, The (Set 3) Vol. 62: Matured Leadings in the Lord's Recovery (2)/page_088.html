<h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAW AND GRACE</h2><p>Let me ask again: What is the difference between law and grace? First, let us consider what the law is. The law is something from God and yet apart from God. It tells us what is good and what is evil. For a man to touch the law is like touching the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. No one can have life through touching the law (Gal. 3:11, 21). On the contrary, condemnation follows the law. As soon as we touch the law, we touch condemnation. What then is grace? John 1:17 says that the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. Grace is God received, and truth is God seen. The highest and ultimate definition of grace is God Himself (1 Cor. 15:10; Gal. 2:20). What is the law in the Bible? Everything that is outside of God is the law. This is the meaning of the word outwardly in the following verses: "For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh. But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, in spirit, not in letter" (Rom. 2:28-29). The Jews mortify their own flesh. They circumcise themselves and keep the law and the Sabbath, but these things are of the law and are letters. God is not in them. Grace is God alone and nothing else besides Him. Therefore, receiving grace means that man receives God Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF GOD'S SALVATION</h2><p>God's salvation saves us to the point where we can stand before God and say, "I do not know what is evil, and I do not know what is good. I will not do evil, but neither will I do good. Both good and evil are foreign things to me. I only know to receive God as my life. I want to live by God's nature." Outwardly in Romans 2 refers to all the good outside of God, and inwardly in this passage describes everything that issues from God; it actually refers to God Himself. A man must first be delivered from the self before he can be fully delivered from sin. We may not have a temper, but as long as we are not delivered from the self, we are not delivered from sin. Within us, there is no goodness, only sin (Rom. 7:14, 18; 3:12). Let us use the kerosene lamp as an illustration. When the kerosene lamp burns, it gives out smoke. The only way it will not give out smoke is when it does not burn. A Christian is someone who has an "electric light" installed within. God is not concerned about burning or smoking anymore. He only wants to know if we are using the "electric light" or if we are still using our "kerosene lamp." If we refuse to use the "electric light" and insist on the "kerosene lamp," we can only choose between burning with smoke or not having any light at all.</p><p>The entire Bible shows us that it is God's pleasure to enter into man, pass through man, and then come out of man. God likes to be touched by man. This is the reason life is in Christ. God is in life, and life is in Christ for us to receive (1 John 5:12). As soon as we touch the Spirit, we receive the life of Christ, which means we receive God Himself. Christ is the coming out of God (Heb. 1:3). When God enters into us, Christ enters into us, which is life entering into us. God has ordained this from the first day. He desires to join Himself to man so that His life, nature, mind, light, likes, dislikes, and preferences can become ours. The ultimate goal of God's salvation is to come into us to be our life. This means His mind, preferences, likes, and dislikes become our mind, preferences, likes, and dislikes. The goal of God's salvation is to bring us to the point where we can praise Him for delivering us not only from evil, but from good as well. We can proudly say that we do not know evil and we do not know good. We do not know hatred, and we do not know love. We only know God, and we only have God. In other words, we do not live in ourselves any longer; instead, we live in God. This is God's salvation.</p><p>God's salvation saves us from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil to the tree of life. Even if Adam had not sinned, God would still have wanted him to take Him as life. He wants man to take His life as his life, His feeling as his feeling, His mind as his mind, and His preference as his preference. He wants to mingle Himself with man. When God's salvation has reached its goal and the work of salvation is complete in eternity, we will see a wonderful picture: God will be in man and man will be in God. In the New Jerusalem in eternity, there will be no other fruit except the fruit of the tree of life. All of us will eat the fruit of the tree of life; we will only be enjoying God's life.</p><p>God's salvation does more than save us from sinfulness to sinlessness or from evil to good. His salvation wroughts Himself into us to be our life and everything. In learning to serve and to know our spirit, we have to touch this point. Otherwise, everything will be outward, not inward. I hope that we all will see clearly the central goal of God's salvation so that our service and spiritual ministry will be calibrated according to this central goal.</p>
