   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All of these are divided according to people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Emphasis on Different Truths</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some divisions are based on a different emphasis of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who emphasize justification by faith are called the "Justification by Faith" Church i.e., the Lutheran Church .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who emphasize holiness have become the Holiness Church.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who believe in the succession of apostolic authority through the bishops are called the Bishop's Church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have one bishop for one church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who emphasize water immersion have become the Baptist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who came from Bath are called the Bath Congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are such congregations in Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even among those who believe in justification by faith, those who came from Germany are called the Lutherans, while those who came from Holland are called the Dutch Reformed Church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can see that all kinds of differences exist among the churches throughout the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every church has its own history and doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the midst of such confusion, which way should you take?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is difficult to find a church in a your locality to join.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CHURCHES BEING DIFFERENT IN LOCALITY ONLY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Is there a way out for us?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yes!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible is very simple and clear concerning the truth of the church; it is not confusing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can see this in a few verses.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The opening words of many Epistles, such as the beginning of the Acts of the Apostles and Revelation, show us such expressions as the church in Rome, the church in Jerusalem, the church in Corinth, the church in Philippi, the church in Ephesus, the church in Colossae, and so on.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There were many different churches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Acts there is the church in Antioch, and in Revelation there are seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no doubt that there are distinctions between churches in the Bible, but there is one, and only one, kind of distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What is this distinction?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You can answer this question yourselves because it is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some doctrines in the Bible have two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It may not be easy deciding which side should be taken.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if there is only one side to a truth and you make a mistake about it, it means that you are very foolish and blind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some passages in the Bible say that justification is by faith, while other passages say that justification is by works.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have the book of Romans, and we also have the Epistle of James.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One can excuse himself for confusion over such a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But concerning the church, there is only one way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is inexcusable for anyone to be unclear about it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Corinth is a locality; so are Ephesus, Colossae, Rome, and Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All of these are localities.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In other words, the church can be divided only according to locality, nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Is this clear to you?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Corinth, Ephesus, and Colossae are cities.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, the boundary of the church is the boundary of the city or the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A. Anything Smaller than a Locality</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Not Being the Church</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No matter how big a church is, it cannot extend beyond the boundary of its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At the same time, no matter how small a church is, it cannot have anything less than the locality as its unit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If a church is smaller than a locality, it is not a church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If a church is bigger than a locality, it is not a church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What is smaller than a locality?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For example, in the church in Corinth some said, "I am...of Cephas."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Others said, "I am of Paul," or "I am...of Apollos," or "I am...of Christ" 1 Cor 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They divided the church in Corinth into four parts.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is making the church too small.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, Paul told them they were divisive and sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>First Corinthians 1 shows that it is wrong for a church to be smaller than a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Was Paul good?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Yes!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Was Apollos good?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Yes!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Was Peter good?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Yes!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But it is wrong to divide the church according to these persons.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The church is divided according to localities, not according to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Paul said that to divide the church according to the apostles is divisive, sectarian, and fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Dividing the church this way is to take the way of the denominations.</S>
