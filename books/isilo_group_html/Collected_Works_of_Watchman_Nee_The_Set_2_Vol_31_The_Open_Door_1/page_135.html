Please do not worry. We left on the thirtieth and spent three days on the road. Although we passed through danger several times, I did not feel at all afraid, because God was with me. The road we took was in the steep, high mountains. On the second day, we were winding around the highest, biggest mountain. We made twenty-four turns. We traveled for two hours before we got around this mountain. There were small villages along the way where we could eat and sleep. The first night we slept in the County Girls' School in Chi-Jiang County. The principal welcomed us. The hospitality was good. However, the second night was very different. There were no houses to take lodging in, and the bus got stuck in a hole, so we were in danger. Fortunately, there were small rocks in the mud that held the wheels, or many people on the bus would have been killed or injured. Thank and praise God. How great is the length, breadth, height, and depth of God's love! We are weak and very immature children in the Lord. There is not much spiritual growth in me. I desire and pursue all wisdom and knowledge in the spirit. I deeply hope that the sisters in the Lord will help me that I may be perfected. When I think of the testimonies that I heard in Chungking and the two times I dined together with you at the Lord's table, my heart is extremely happy. When will Sister Lee and Sister Chang come to Kweichow? May God lead you. If you can come soon, we will be happier. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your weak sister in the Lord,<br />Chang Chiung-sien<br />April 2, in Kuei-yang</p><h2 class="head2">K'un-ming, Yunnan Province</h2><p>Brother Lin Yau-huei has been transferred to Wu-Chow. He left K'un-ming on the tenth of this month. We had hoped that Brother Lin would not be transferred, because there are not many responsible brothers in K'un-ming. However, God's will is higher than man's will. We deeply believe that God wants to raise up His testimony in Wu-Chow through Brother Lin and Brother Muo Hue-chen. Therefore, we happily said, "Amen!" Brother Hu Shuan-ming (from Lung-Si, Fukien, who works in Parliament) arrived in Chungking on the sixteenth of this month. He is a good brother. We hope that he can be edified much with the brothers and sisters in Chungking. Brother Lee Shiang-chen and Sister Hsiao Ai-kuang arrived in K'un-ming recently from Ch'ang-sha. They are both students at National Southwest University. Brother Chen Ho-seng in Ho-Kou married Miss Liang in March. They are serving the believers who travel through Ho-Kou. They are exceptionally diligent. May God Himself repay the love they have shown for His name's sake. I heard that Brother Yin Tzu-lan and his family and Brother Chou Hung-bao left Hong Kong on the nineteenth for K'un-ming. I have already rented a very spacious house for Brother Yin. (The rent is a little high.) I deeply believe that God prepared this house for our brother. Thank the Father for manifesting evidence that He graces His children. The S. W. University's Engineering College was originally going to be in Mong-Tze but has suddenly been changed to K'un-ming. Therefore, Brother Yin was able to come. I believe that God has His good will in causing Brother Yin to come to K'un-ming.</p><p>The assembly here has been blessed by God very much. Seventeen brothers and sisters were baptized into the Lord's name in March. Not long afterwards, more brothers and sisters wanted to be baptized. The meetings have been preserved by God since Brother Wei and Brother Chen went to Ku-Jiu. They are progressing day by day. I hope that God will give a great revival to the church in K'un-ming so that more saved ones will be added to His church. The fourth prayer request published in the fifth issue of The Open Door concerning Sister Wang Juh-ching has been answered. God has opened a way for her to be the head nurse in the K'un-ming Tung-Ren Hospital. Sister Chang Jing-shia can also work permanently at the Hwei-Dian Hospital. Brother Chang Jing-yuen follows the Lord's leading and sometimes goes into the neighboring villages to preach the gospel.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Huang Tsung<br />April 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Surabaya, Southeast Asia</h2><p>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>May the grace and peace of God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. The Lord's coming is near. The churches in all the localities are being revived. The Lord has also begun a good work in all the localities of Southeast Asia. The church in Surabaya was very desolate, but thank the Lord for His marvelous grace; He is not a respecter of persons. He gathered His children here like a mother hen gathers her chicks under her wings. The Lord has given us a place to remember Him here. However, most of the brothers and sisters are very immature. They really need to be fed with spiritual milk. We are newborn children and, of course, we love and desire milk. May the Lord give us the pure spiritual milk that our spiritual life may grow. We have four brothers and three sisters here. There is a prayer meeting every Saturday evening. Every Lord's Day morning we have a meeting to remember the Lord. We have not started to break the bread. We meet freely with the brothers and sisters together because our number is so small. If there were more people, we could not meet like this because we do not have a name or an organization. We would be unable to continue. (Please read chapters five and ten of The Normal Christian Church Life carefully. You will not have any problems&mdash;Editor.) Brothers and sisters, we would like you to pray much for the work which has been newly raised up. Please pray also for the immature believers here. We bless you with peace.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Chen En-shen, Tai Hsi-shung,<br />Wang Fen-hsing, Wang Kuang-ze<br />March 17<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_134.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_136.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 135</div><br></body></html>
