<h2 class="head1">PRODUCING OLIVE OIL</h2><p>How do we produce olive oil? In other words, how can we grow Christ as an olive tree? We grow Him as an olive tree and produce olive oil by always exercising our mingled spirit, our regenerated spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit, and by using this mingled spirit. We should not say or do anything apart from this spirit. Everything we do should be in spirit. This is to grow Christ as the olive tree, and this is the way to produce oil.</p><p>If we put all these matters into practice, we shall have more understanding of them. We shall realize that the lamb, the wheat, and the olive tree are all growing within us. On the one hand, we are a ranch; on the other hand, we are a farm. On the ranch bulls are being raised and lambs are eating tender grass. On the farm wheat and olive trees are growing. The result is that we have an abundance of oil. Anyone who lives in this way will be filled with oil in his words, attitudes, and activities.</p><p>From experience we know that if we do not live in this way, we shall be dry, very much lacking in oil. For example, when a brother is arguing with his wife, both of them are dry. They do not experience anything of the anointing. But if a brother and his wife both offer Christ as their sin offering, their words and activities together will be full of oil. Between them there will be a flow of olive oil.</p><p>In order for a machine to run, it must have oil. The motor in your car needs oil. Often, a machine that is lacking in oil will make an unpleasant sound. The same is true in principle with the arguing between husband and wife. The exchanging of words between a brother and his wife gives forth a sound of dryness. But if a brother has sufficient oil, even the exchanging of words with his wife will be replaced with something that is sweet and pleasant. The oil makes everything smooth. You may say, &ldquo;But if we are full of the Spirit, we would not argue.&rdquo; That would be very good. Then instead of arguing, there would be praise and fellowship.</p><p>We all need olive oil. The way to gain the oil is to deal with the mingled spirit, to use our spirit, and to live, walk, speak, and do everything by the spirit. Then we shall have the oil to be mingled with the flour for a meal offering.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DRINK OFFERING</h2><p>Let us now say a word concerning the wine of the drink offering. When we experience Christ as the One who produces life and supplies life, we have Him as wheat. When we walk in spirit and do things in spirit, dealing with the Spirit, we are growing olives. Then if we are willing to sacrifice and pour out what we have experienced of Christ, we shall have Him as wine. This is the way to produce wine.</p><p>The quantity of wine is the same as that of the oil. Both are a quarter of a hin. This indicates that we cannot pour our life out for God more than we have enjoyed Christ. What we pour out cannot exceed the extent of our enjoyment of Christ. The oil is for enjoyment, and the wine is to be poured out as a drink offering to God. What we experience of the Spirit in our spirit should be poured out. We should not retain it for ourselves.</p><p>To produce oil is to live by Christ, and to produce wine is to die for Him. To live Christ is to grow wheat and olive trees; to die for Him is to produce wine. This is to turn the oil into wine. Therefore, we need to live Christ and also die for Him. We live by Him, and we live for Him. This is to experience Him as wheat and olive oil. But we also must die for Him. This is to experience Him as wine. In 1 Corinthians 15:31 Paul says, &ldquo;Daily I die.&rdquo; In 2 Corinthians 4:10 he says that day by day he experiences the putting to death of Jesus. We also need to be put to death day by day, even in our married life and family life. This is to pour out as wine what we have experienced and enjoyed of Christ. This wine is a heavenly spiritual wine poured out to God for His pleasure.</p><h2 class="head1">FOOD FOR GOD&rsquo;S SATISFACTION</h2><p>When we have the lambs, the wheat, the oil, and the wine, we have all the courses for a feast. We have these courses by daily offering Christ as our sin offering. If we practice offering Him in this way, we shall have a clear conscience and a free spirit. Then Christ will live in us as the lamb, the wheat, the olive tree, and the grape vine. Therefore, we shall raise Christ as a lamb and grow Him as wheat, olive trees, and vines. The result will be that we shall have the produce of the good land as our spiritual groceries. When we come to the meetings of the church, we should bring these groceries with us. This does not mean that we should bring all that we have produced. Rather, we should bring two lambs, a tenth of an ephah of flour, a quarter of a hin of oil, and the same amount of wine. We should then offer all this to God as food for His satisfaction.</p>
