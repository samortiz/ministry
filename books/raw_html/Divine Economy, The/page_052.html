<P>Among the Christians today there is much fighting and division. There is always fighting in a marriage. After a husband and a wife get married, they eventually fight with one another. If we Christians do not come together, there will be no fighting. But once we do come together, eventually we begin to fight. Perhaps in the first three days of our being together, we will be full of praises to the Lord. But by the third day, disagreements may begin to surface. The only way we can avoid this situation is by growing in life, by being transformed. Do not pay much attention to the miraculous manifestation of the Spirit, but pay your full attention to the growth in life for the transformation in life.</P><P>We need to go on from 1 Corinthians 12 and 14 to 2 Corinthians. In 2 Corinthians 3:3 Paul indicates that the believers are a letter of Christ, "inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart." This is the inward inscribing in our being by the Spirit of life not by the Spirit of power. This inward inscribing is not for the miraculous manifestation of the Spirit but for the growth in life, for the transformation in life, and for the building up of the church. The New Testament does not stress the power of the Spirit; rather it stresses the life of the Spirit. The New Testament does not stress the miraculous manifestation of the Spirit; rather it stresses the inscribing of the Spirit, the constitution of the Spirit. The Spirit of life within us essentially is inscribing Himself into us, constituting us with all the riches of Christ to make us a copy, a reproduction, of Christ. This is transformation for the building up of the church.</P><P>In the Lord's recovery we do not stress the miraculous manifestation of the Spirit, but we stress the life of the Spirit, the growth in life, and the transformation in life. We need to grow and be transformed day by day. In order to realize the growth in life and the transformation in life, we must contact the Lord. We must open our entire being to Him by calling upon His name in a real way (2 Tim. 2:22), in a way to touch the Spirit in our spirit. If we would practice this every day and all day long, the Spirit of life who is the all-inclusive Spirit will move in us and work in us to touch us and enlighten us. He will expose us to the uttermost in all our failures, wrongdoings, mistakes, natural intentions, and lustful and selfish desires. Everything within us that is not of the divine life, the Spirit of life will expose.</P><P>In the shining of the divine light, which is the light of life (John 8:12), we will spontaneously confess. We may pray, "Lord, forgive me. I am still so selfish, so natural. I still live in the old creation and in the flesh. Lord, I repent for not living You. Occasionally I live You, but not all the time. Most of the time, I still live according to myself. Even though I may not commit any gross sins or do any bad things, I still do not live You. It is still I that live, not Christ. I realize that I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me. But this is too much of a doctrine in me. In my daily life, it is not Christ but still I." We need to make such confessions day after day.</P>
