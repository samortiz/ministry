   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>U. Not Being Ashamed of Suffering as a Christian</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>but Glorifying God in This Name</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to Acts 11:26, the believers were first called Christians in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Greek word rendered Christian is Christianos, a word of Latin formation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The ending -ianos, denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This name denoted that Christians were adherents of Christ and was used by the outsiders as a nickname, a term of reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason, Peter says that if a believer suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name 1 Pet 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that if we suffer from persecutors who contemptuously call us a Christian, we should not feel ashamed, but rather, we should glorify God in this name.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today the term Christian bears a positive significance, that is, a man of Christ, a person who is one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We not only belong to Him but also have His life and nature in an organic union with Him and live by Him, even living Him, in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we suffer for being such a person, we should not feel ashamed, because when we suffer in the name of Christ and as Christians, the Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of glory, rests upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, we should magnify Christ in our confession by our holy and excellent manner of life to glorify, express, God in this name.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>V. Suffering according to the Will of God</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So That They Might Not</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suffer the End of the Ungodly</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Peter shows the government of God especially in His dealings with His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The sufferings that the believers undergo in fiery persecutions are used by Him as a means to judge them so that they may be disciplined, purified, and separated from unbelievers so as not to have the same destiny as unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, 4:17 says, It is time for the judgment to begin from the house of God; and if first from us, what will be the end of those who disobey the gospel of God?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this verse the house refers to the church, composed of the believers 2:5; Heb 3:6; 1 Tim 3:15; Eph 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For the establishment of His kingdom, God begins His governmental administration from His own house by His disciplinary judgment over His own children so that He may have a strong ground to judge, in His universal kingdom, those who are disobedient to His gospel and rebellious to His government.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, in this sense, persecutions and sufferings are a kind of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This judgment, however, is not for condemnation to eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is a dispensational discipline to purify our life by removing any dross.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reason believers suffer is that God does not want His own children, His own house, His family, to suffer the end of the ungodly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The unbelievers, who disobey the gospel of God, will undergo a more severe judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Temporarily God may let them go, but eventually He will deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, Peter says, Let those also who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator 1 Pet 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has appointed us according to His will to suffer for Christ s sake 3:17; 2:15; 1 Thes 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must see that persecution is a suffering in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God as our Creator can preserve our soul, which He created for us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has even numbered our hairs Matt 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is loving and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His loving and faithful care accompanies His justice in His governmental administration 1 Pet 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While He is judging us as His household in His government, in His love He cares for us faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In suffering His just disciplinary judgment in our body, we should commit our souls to Him and to His faithful care.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>W. Suffering with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>So That They May Be Glorified with Him</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Romans 8 reveals that suffering with Christ is the condition for being heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may not like to suffer, but it is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we suffer with the Lord, we shall be glorified with Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suffering is also related to the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The genuine growth of any kind of life depends on hardship and suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without hardship or suffering it is difficult for any life to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not expect our life to be free of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The more we suffer, the more we grow and the faster we mature.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, if we expect to grow in life, we should not reject suffering, because suffering helps our growth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The degree of our suffering determines the degree of our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more suffering we pass through, the more our glory will be intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We want to be glorified, but we do not want to experience suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, suffering increases glory.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15:41 that star differs from star in glory, indicating that some stars shine more brightly than others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all will shine, and we all will be glorified, but the intensity of our glory will depend on the amount of suffering that we are willing to take.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is certain that the apostle Paul will shine more brightly than all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We will be glorified, but the intensity of our glory will differ according to our suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, Paul says that the present suffering means nothing compared with the coming glory.</S>
