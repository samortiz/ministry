   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST BEING THE OVERFLOW OF GRACE AND REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Based on John 1:16 we can say that the fullness of Christ is the overflow of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God became man and dwelt among us, full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our receiving is not a once-for-all matter; rather, it is a continual receiving, a receiving of grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The phrase grace upon grace in Greek implies that grace is like the rolling waves of the sea that come in wave after wave without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Beginning from the time we are saved, we receive grace and reality from His fullness, and it is a receiving without end until we grow up to be a full-grown man with the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has given Himself to us to be our grace and reality with a goal in view, that is, to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 12:24 says, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This "much fruit" is blended together to become one loaf the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God became flesh and brought grace and reality for the purpose of producing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church does not only have the riches of Christ, but it is also the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church is the overflow of His riches, and this overflow is His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Genesis 1:27 tells us that God created male and female according to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in practicality when God used dust to create man, He created only a male, Adam; He did not create the female, Eve Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God did not create two people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Later God saw that it was not good for Adam to be alone, so He created a female to be his counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How did God create the woman?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep and took out one of his ribs, and He built that rib into a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then God placed this woman before Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As soon as Adam saw her, he said, "This is bone of my bones / And flesh of my flesh" v. 23 . The two were a perfect match, so they were joined together to become one flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This proves that Eve flowed out of Adam, that she was an overflow of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the New Testament, in Ephesians 5, Paul says that the story of Adam and Eve refers to Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This also tells us how the church was produced: It was by Christ's "sleeping" on the cross and His side being pierced to flow out blood and water.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The blood was for washing away our sins, and the water was for giving us life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then in resurrection He entered into us as the Spirit and thereby regenerated us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, all of us are built up together to become the church as the counterpart of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the church is the overflow of the riches of Christ, and it is the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church is the result produced from the riches of Christ, and it is the overflow and expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST BEING THE FULLNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The fullness of Christ is the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Colossians 2:9 says, "In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This verse speaks not of riches but of fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we say riches instead of fullness, it is not correct, because all the riches of God have become the fullness of God as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All of this fullness dwells in Christ bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, this fullness becomes the fullness of Christ, and the fullness of Christ is the fullness of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These three fullnesses the fullness of God, the fullness of Christ, and the fullness of grace and reality all refer to the same fullness.</S>
