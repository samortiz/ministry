<h1 class="title">Denying the Self, Taking Up the Cross,<br />
and Losing the Soul-life <br />
for the Building of the Church</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:16-28</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In Matthew 16 the way to build up the church and the enemy of the building are revealed:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ, the Son of the living God, builds the church on Himself as the rock, with stones such as Peter, a transformed person&mdash;vv. 16-18.</li>
	<li>The gates of Hades, Satan&rsquo;s authority or power of darkness, attacks the church to frustrate the Lord from building up the church&mdash;v. 18.</li>
	<li>In order to build the church, the Lord had to pass through death and enter into resurrection&mdash;v. 21:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church was produced through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection&mdash;John 12:24.</li>
		<li>The way to build the church is to be crucified and resurrected&mdash;cf. 2 Cor. 4:10-12; Gal. 2:20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Peter, with a good heart, rebuked the Lord and tried to prevent the Lord from going to Jerusalem to be crucified&mdash;Matt. 16:22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It was not Peter but Satan who came out through one of the gates of Hades, the gate of Peter&rsquo;s self, to try to frustrate the Lord from building up the church&mdash;v. 23.</li>
		<li>The self, the mind, and the soul-life are the main gates through which Satan comes forth to attack and damage the church&mdash;vv. 23-26.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The building up of the church depends on the shutting up of the gates of Hades through the exercise of three keys&mdash;Matt. 16:24-26:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to learn to exercise the key of denying the self&mdash;v. 24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The self is the embodiment of Satan; the self is the soul plus the satanic mind, the mind of Satan&mdash; Gen. 3:1-6; Matt. 16:22-23:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The self is the embodiment of the soul-life, which is expressed through the mind; thus, the self, the soul-life, and the mind are three-in-one.</li>
			<li>Behind these three is Satan, who manipulates the self in order to damage the church&mdash;v. 23.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The self is the soul declaring independence from God:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Lord does not have regard for what we do; rather, He has regard for our dependence on Him&mdash;7:21-23.</li>
			<li>The enemy of the Body is the self; because the self is something independent, the self is the greatest problem, the greatest frustration and opposition, to the building up of the Body:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) We should depend not only on God but also on the Body, on the brothers and sisters&mdash; Exo. 17:11-13; Acts 9:25; 2 Cor. 11:33.</li>
				<li>2) The Lord and the Body are one; hence, if we are dependent on the Body, we are also dependent on the Lord, and if we are independent of the Body, we are spontaneously independent of the Lord.</li>
				<li>3) When we are dependent, the self is gone, and instead of the self, we have the Lord&rsquo;s presence and are full of peace.</li>
				<li>4) If we exercise the key of denying the self to lock up the self, it would be impossible for us to be offended&mdash;cf. Luke 23:34; Acts 7:60.</li>
				<li>5) Only when the self has been utterly dealt with by the cross are we able to touch the reality of the Body of Christ and come to know the Body.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
	<li>We need to learn to exercise the key of taking up the cross&mdash;Matt. 16:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To take up the cross simply means to take up the will of God; the cross is God&rsquo;s will&mdash;cf. 26:39:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Lord Jesus was willing to be crucified so that through His death, His life might be released to produce and build up the church&mdash; John 12:24; 2 Cor. 4:12.</li>
			<li>The cross was a great suffering to the Lord, but He cared not for the suffering but for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;Heb. 12:2; Col. 1:24.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li><em>Let him...take up his cross</em> (Matt. 16:24) means that we are not forced to bear the cross but that we willingly take it up.</li>
		<li>The one church is God&rsquo;s will, and every brother and sister in the church is God&rsquo;s will; thus, to bear the cross is to bear the church and to bear all of the saints that we would have the genuine oneness&mdash;John 17:21-23; Eph. 4:3, 13; 1 Cor. 1:10; Phil. 2:2.</li>
		<li>We need to remain on the cross, keeping our old man under the termination of the cross day by day&mdash;Luke 14:27; Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; Phil. 3:10; 1 Cor. 15:31.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to learn to exercise the key of losing the soul-life&mdash;Matt. 16:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To save the soul-life is to please the self by allowing the soul to have its enjoyment; to lose the soul-life is to lose the enjoyment of the soul:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Receiving God into man&rsquo;s spirit and expressing God through the soul should be man&rsquo;s joy and amusement&mdash;cf. Neh. 8:10; Rom. 14:17.</li>
			<li>The Lord Jesus lost the enjoyment of His soul in this age so that He might find His soul-life in the coming age (John 10:11; Isa. 53:12); we must do the same.</li>
			<li>If we save our soul-life in this age, we will lose it in the coming age, but if we lose our soul-life in this age, we will find it in the coming age&mdash; Matt. 16:25.</li>
			<li>We need to love the Lord Jesus and to hate and deny our soul-life, not loving our soul-life even unto death&mdash;1 Cor. 16:22; 2:9; Luke 14:26; 9:23; Rev. 12:11.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>If we are willing to lose all our present soulish enjoyment for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, for the sake of the church, and for the sake of all the saints, others will be nourished by us and will be built up through us; this is not a suffering but a joy&mdash;Heb. 12:2.</li>
		<li>The kingdom reward of sharing the King&rsquo;s joy in ruling over the earth in the manifestation of the kingdom depends upon whether or not we save our soul-life in this age or lose it&mdash;Matt. 16:25-28; 25:21, 23.</li>
