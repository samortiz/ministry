   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRANSFORMATION BEING A METABOLIC PROCESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Transformation is a metabolic process that changes us by adding some new element into our being and discharging the old element.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is illustrated by one's having a healthy complexion through the proper, daily eating, digesting, and assimilating of food.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This healthy appearance is the result not of cosmetics but of nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This nourishment causes a metabolic process in which a new element is brought in and the old element is discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In like manner, we need to receive spiritual nourishment day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This nourishment will supply a new element and then cause the old things to be carried away.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Gradually, we will grow, change, and mature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's economy is just to work Himself into us that we may experience such a metabolic process of spiritual digestion and assimilation that produces a gradual, intrinsic change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>GOD'S BUILDING HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>IN CHRIST INTO US BEING AN ORGANIC MATTER</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's building Himself into our being is altogether an organic matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order for such a building to take place, we need to receive, digest, and assimilate an organic element.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our spiritual food and drink is the organic, pneumatic Christ John 6:51, 57; 7:37-39 , the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This Christ is not merely the Christ of history in an objective sense.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A Christ who is only an objective, historical Savior, the One whose story is recorded in the Bible, would not be related to us organically.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is a tragedy that many Christians know Christ only in an objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible reveals that Christ came and stayed with His disciples for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then He passed through death and entered into resurrection, and through this process He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today as the Spirit He is real, genuine, living, and present.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, we may say that He is the "now" Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>CHRIST'S BUILDING THE CHURCH WITH HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>AS THE SPIRITUAL FOOD AND SPIRITUAL DRINK</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we enjoy the "now" Christ by eating, drinking, and breathing Him, a metabolic process, a spiritual digestion and metabolism, takes place within us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through this metabolic process Christ is constituted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This constitution is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ, therefore, is building Himself into us as our inner constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The issue of such a building is that we become a very particular class of people the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever we gather together we are the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus said, "I will build My church."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now we can see by what way Christ builds the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is building His church by supplying us with spiritual drink and by feeding us with spiritual food, which are uniquely Himself as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more we enjoy Him by eating, drinking, and breathing Him, the more He builds His church.</S>
