   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Her Duty of Marriage Not Being Diminished</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Exodus 21:9-11 specifies that if a master betroths a maid to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the son properly marries another later, the maid will become a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s ordination is clear: Her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If he does not do these three things to her, she shall go out free and be a slave no more.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, if anyone thinks that he cannot have intercourse with his concubine, he is not keeping the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I hope that you can be clear about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>C. Such a One Not to Be an Elder</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is only one portion of the Word that addresses the matter of concubines in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In reading the Bible, we love to see a certain matter that is mentioned only once.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a certain matter is mentioned twice, we have to make a comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If it is mentioned three or more times, we need to integrate the different portions before we can arrive at a conclusion about God s teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why every Bible student loves single-incident injunctions, because one needs to refer to only one case in order to know God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is only one portion in the New Testament 1 Timothy that only indirectly refers to the matter of concubines.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There it says that an overseer must be the husband of one wife.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that all who have concubines cannot be elders in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the New Testament does not say that such a one should send his concubine away or abstain from fulfilling her duty of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>D. The Best Arrangement</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>the Concubine Being Saved</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>and Deciding to Separate Voluntarily</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a concubine is saved and has no compulsion for continued sexual relationships, it is good if she is willing to separate from the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But this is something voluntary; it is not a commandment of the Lord nor a commandment of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church should not demand anything concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God has put only two together, and this principle should be maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is quite obvious that a person who takes a concubine will suffer more affliction in the body than one who upholds monogamy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This one will naturally experience more discipline from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>DIVORCE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible speaks of divorce, but divorce is sanctioned by the Scripture under only one condition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are many ordinances regarding divorce among the nations of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some countries have more than twenty ordinances on the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Chinese also have many ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, if either party is mentally unsound or if there is incompatibility of any kind, the couple can divorce each other.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the Bible gives only one condition for divorce adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Factors such as mental instability or prolonged separation do not constitute legitimate reasons for divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The only reason for a divorce is extramarital sexual conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Matthew 19 and Luke 16 the Lord Jesus shows us clearly that divorce is permitted only if adultery is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A. What God Has Joined Together,</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man Should Not Separate</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Divorce is allowed in the case of adultery because man should not separate what God has joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In other words, the husband and wife are one in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All divorces violate this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What is adultery?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is the destruction of that oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you commit sexual acts with someone other than your wife or your husband, you have committed adultery and have violated that oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A wife or a husband may be missing for years or may be mentally sick.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There may be psychological harassment or other factors involved, but if one party turns away and marries someone else, he is breaking the oneness and has committed adultery in reality.</S>
