   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR THE GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, there is still the need for the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After speaking of so many things in chapter twelve, the Apostle Paul tells us to desire the greater gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then he says that he will show us the most excellent way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The most excellent way to practice the gifts is the way of love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The way of love is the way of life, for love is the expression of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we have seen, speaking in tongues, miracles, and healings may become childish things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It all depends upon the measure of the growth in life found in the practice of these gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As my grandson was reading John chapter one, he was being very playful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But I did not condemn him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the contrary, I was happy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if one of the elders would read John 1 in such a playful manner, I would be exceedingly displeased.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Body life we need the growth in life, and we need to function in the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although I like to see the young ones functioning in a playful way in the meetings, I would be displeased to see the older ones functioning in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you do not have the growth in life, it will be impossible for you not to play.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because your age is the age of playing with toys, there will be no other way for you to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some mothers exercise strict control over their children.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first year I came to Los Angeles I observed some mothers who had their little ones with them in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever the little ones acted up, the mothers disciplined them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In a sense, I agree with this type of chastening.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in another sense, I do not agree with it, because you cannot change the age of a little "monkey" by discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No matter what you do to him, he will still be a "monkey."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The little "monkey" needs time to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you do not allow the little children to play, you will kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But those who are my age, over seventy, are not naughty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, we like to have more time to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Function is related to age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are not at the proper age, we cannot have the best practice, even if we have the best gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without being at the right age, it is difficult to have the proper practice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, we all need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I thank the Lord that in His recovery He has gained many, especially many young people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But I am burdened to tell you that you need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You cannot have an adequate practice unless you grow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you are still childish, your practice will be abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The most excellent way to function is the way of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the way of love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not think that love is a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No, in order to love, we must have a mature, normal, properly balanced life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You cannot expect a child five years old to love properly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Children fight with each other one minute and love each other the next.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Their love fluctuates.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not the love required in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible requires a permanent love, a remaining love, a balanced, adjusted, proper love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we would have such a balanced love, we need the proper growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to be impressed with the need for the growth in life for the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose you visit my home and find there only my wife and several children under the age of five.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What kind of family would that be?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, if you visit my family, you will find at least three generations there: the grandparents, who are the older ones; the parents, who are middle-aged; and the children.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is what we want to see in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever we come together, we should see some elderly ones, some middle-aged ones, some young people, and some children.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By using this illustration I want to emphasize the need for us to seek the proper growth in life, the life that is expressed in love.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Proper love is maintained through the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that real love is expressed and maintained in maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If, among the saints in the Body, there are a good number who are mature, there will be a balanced love among us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we do not love properly, this means that we are not balanced or that we have not reached the standard of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if we are of the proper age, there will definitely be a balanced love among us.</S>
