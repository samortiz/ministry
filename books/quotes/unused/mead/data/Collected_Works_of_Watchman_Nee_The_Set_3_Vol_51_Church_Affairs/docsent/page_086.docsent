   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE MATTER OF FINANCES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we want to talk about what kind of arrangements we should have in our midst in the matter of finances.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, how should we distribute the income of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the other hand, what should the relationship be among the co-workers?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE DISTRIBUTION OF MONEY IN A LOCAL CHURCH Normal Expenses</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Regarding the question of money, I think it will be clearer if I speak in this way: The income of the local church is first, of course, for local expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A locality should not be in debt.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the local church there are many expenditures.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, there are the normal expenses of the church, such as the wine, the bread, electricity, water, and in some places, rent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Taking Care of the Poor</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, there are certain matters that the local churches need to devote more effort to.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the church God especially stresses that His children should take care of the needy, especially the needy brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, in the local church there is a major need of taking care of the needy brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when we take care of the needy brothers, we should do it very carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We cannot say that because they are needy brothers, we can be discourteous to them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When brothers send money to them, we should not cause them to feel ashamed just because they are needy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we have an elderly mother and father at home, the way we send money to them is the way I hope that we would take care of the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It should be just as if we were sending money to our elderly parents.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We certainly cannot let our parents feel that their son is having pity on them or that their son is giving them charity to relieve them of their difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot do it this way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the church when we are managing money to care for the needy, we should be very skillful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In every church the brothers and sisters who pass on money must be people with keen feelings; we cannot send insensitive persons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Needy ones cannot help but receive our money, but they also could not help but be hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, there is a need for people with keen feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should never allow anyone to hurt them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, suppose a brother fell and was injured and we needed to carry him to his bed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We would never send clumsy, insensitive persons to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Maybe a bone was not broken, but because they are clumsy, they can break a bone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I feel in many places that the brothers who manage money are too insensitive in their feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am not happy about this situation at all.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sooner or later those people may fall into a condition of great poverty before God; definitely God will place some discipline on them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How could they be without any feeling at all?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a brother or sister is in difficulty, we need to be very tender in helping this one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In every locality, regarding the question of money, one part is for the expenses of the church, and one part is for taking care of the needs of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to select a brother who is especially gentle, whose feeling is especially keen, one who can sense the situation from just one word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a one should be asked to handle these affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If it is not so, problems will arise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to be very tender, very fine, very careful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not allow these brothers to feel that they are giving charity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let me relate one incident to you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here in Kuling there are a few terms which are quite peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, when they want to say "intend'' or "plan,'' they use the term continue.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Similarly, to help someone is "to favor them.''</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No matter what they use to help people with, they say that it is "to favor them.''</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>More than a month ago, when I was going down the mountain, a few of the sedan-chair bearers told me, "Mr. Nee, I really favor you; I really favor you.'' I said, "What do you mean?'' They said, "Every time that you call us to bear the sedan-chair, we always respond very quickly because we really favor you.'' I hope that in helping the needy ones, we do not do it in the way of favoring them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When you go to help them, never give the appearance that you are doing them a favor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When a believer is in a time of difficulty, you need to preserve his self-respect and his dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You do not know when you will be in the same situation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Never do anything to hurt him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This needs to be handled very delicately.</S>
