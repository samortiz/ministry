<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(10)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 24, December 1927<br>(Current Events in the Light of the Scriptures)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FASCIST CALENDAR</H2><P>There is one chain of Christian belief that binds the whole of Europe together; it is the calendar of our Savior. Not only has Europe remembered the birth of Christ by its calendar, but it has called it the Year of Our Lord. One new law of the Fascist Party (according to the newspaper on December 24, 1926) is that all government documents must bear two dates: one for the convenience of international communication, and the other to commemorate the revival of the Roman Empire. For example, this year is described as 1927, as well as the fifth year. The cry is near..."Let us break apart their [the Lord Jehovah's and His Christ's] bonds" (Psa. 2:3). _________ said, "Imperialism has come to a frenzied and self-deluding state in Italy. This condition has not been experienced in this peninsula since the time of Caesar. The world will surely laugh at its boasts. But it also tells of evil and terrible consequences. For this reason, uneasy feelings have become widespread."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A FEW SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AMONG THE JEWS</H2><P>Dr. Welzmann said,</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Without occupying any more land from the Arabs, Palestine is large enough for three million Jews to live in.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>According to the census of 1926, by 1926 the Jews have increased their number one hundred percent since 1922. This includes those who are in the cities and on the farms.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>The Palestinian government has taken measures to protect the Jews praying at the "wailing wall" in Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SIXTH ESCAPE OF MUSSOLINI</H2><P>Mussolini's life was endangered for the sixth time. Yet he escaped again. He said that an unseen power is protecting him and his life is "enchanted." Most Italians believe that this is true. They consider him as god. His extraordinary charisma and his ambition to revive the Roman Empire have gained many hearts.</P><P>Recently, he was invited to give a speech at a certain place on "The Ancient Rome." The ancient emperor worship was miraculously revived when thousands of listeners cried, "Glory to him." One Italian reporter said:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Glory to him! From the fertile plains, from all the villages, from the fascists, and from everywhere under his influence, they come! They come by car or on foot. Come with your Roman banners. Come to see him. You must impress the majestic face and his willful and capable spirit once more upon your mind. You will be filled once more with power and spirit. Glory to him! If we should praise our mother, we should also praise him. Glory be to him! There will be a day in history when Mussolini will come again. By that time, it will be like Jesus of Nazareth coming to Galilee again and like Napoleon coming back from Elba again.</P><P>We believe that these are only the beginning years. In Europe many shocking developments will unfold. Mussolini will be a great leader, but we do not know if he will become the little horn in the vision of Daniel 7. At any rate, there are many areas in which this man bears the sign of that horn.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MOHAMMEDANISM</H2><P>Last July 15, the first mosque in Paris was completed. The French president, the British ambassador, and the king of Morocco attended the ceremony. On October 2, the first mosque in London was completed. At the top of the tower, five times a day someone would pray according to the Muslim regulation. The consecration ceremony was attended by Muslims who are followers of Mirza Ehulan. The newspaper reported, "He is known as the so-called promised Messiah. His coming matches some of the prophecies in the Bible and other books. He is also the promised coming prophet, that is, the one prophesied by all the prophets as the one coming at the end of the age." In Berlin, through government aid, two similar mosques have been completed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ASTROLOGERS</H2><P>A certain newspaper reported, "There is an unusual revival of astrology in London. Some have said that in the western part of London, there are at least fifteen famous ASTROLOGERS to whom people go for counsel." On October 19, 1926, the Temple of Light appeared in southern London. This was chosen by Johannez, the ex-high priest of Jerusalem, for the worship of the goddess Madam Valcees, and it was founded by the Rev. G. ValeOwen. It has an auditorium that can hold five hundred people and a few rooms for spiritual and psychological therapy. This is only one of five hundred institutions of the same kind in England.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BITTER ROOT OF EUROPEAN FINANCES</H2><P>According to three leading British economists, the one area that all European national budgets are wasting money on is national armament, the training of its armies, and the building of weapons. This is largely responsible for the malady in finances.</P><P>They pointed out that Czechoslovakia has only thirteen million people, but it has 150,000 regular soldiers, 500 planes, 160 armored vehicles, and 33 bunkers. Yugoslavia has twelve million people, but has 115,000 soldiers, 270 planes, and 128 bunkers. Romania has nineteen million people, but has 143,000 soldiers, 250 planes, 90 armored vehicles, and 33 bunkers. Poland has twenty-seven million people, half of which are non-Poles, but it has 306,000 soldiers, 510 planes, 220 armored vehicles, and 441 bunkers. The defense budgets of these countries add up to one-fifth of their national budgets. How long can these military build-ups and weaponry continue without the outbreak of another war?</P>
