<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="title">JEHOVAH&rsquo;S CONTENDING WITH THE HOUSE OF JACOB</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Amos 3&mdash;5</h1>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider Jehovah&rsquo;s contending with the house of Jacob.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S THREE REPROOFS TO ISRAEL</h2>
<p>The content of 3:1&mdash;5:27 is Jehovah&rsquo;s three reproofs to Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The First Reproof</h2>
<p>The first reproof is recorded in chapter three.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Jehovah&rsquo;s Word<br />
against the Whole Family of Israel</h2>
<p>Amos 3:1 indicates that the word in this chapter is Jehovah&rsquo;s word against the whole family of Israel, which He brought up from Egypt.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Israel Being the Only Family<br />
of the Earth Whom Jehovah Has Known</h2>
<p>Verse 2 says that since Israel was the only family of the earth whom Jehovah has known, He would visit upon them (judge them for) all their iniquities.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Cause of Jehovah&rsquo;s Visitation</h2>
<p>Verses 3 through 8 indicate that the cause of Jehovah&rsquo;s visitation (punishment) was that Israel was not one with God. They had their own intention, goal, and purpose, and God had His. But God revealed all His secrets to His prophets. Israel, therefore, should have listened to the prophets.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Oppressions, Violence, and Devastation<br />
in Samaria and Jehovah&rsquo;s Visitation</h2>
<p>Verses 9 through 12 go on to speak of the oppressions, violence, and devastation in Samaria and Jehovah&rsquo;s visitation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Transgressions of Israel<br />
at the Altars of Bethel<br />
and Jehovah&rsquo;s Visitation</h2>
<p>In verses 13 through 15 we have the transgressions of Israel at the altars of Bethel and Jehovah&rsquo;s visitation. Bethel had become a place for the worship of idols. The winter house and the summer house in verse 15 were luxurious retreat houses. Here, such houses and the worship of idols are regarded as one thing. Those who went to the retreat houses for enjoyment were also those who worshipped idols at the altars of Bethel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Second Reproof</h2>
<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s second reproof to Israel is in chapter four.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Oppression on the Poor<br />
and the Crushing of the Needy in Samaria<br />
and Jehovah&rsquo;s Visitation</h2>
<p>Jehovah reproved Israel for oppressing the poor and crushing the needy and for saying to their lords, &ldquo;Bring, and let us drink&rdquo; (v. 1). On the one hand, they oppressed the poor, crushed the needy, and indulged themselves in pleasures. On the other hand, they were under God&rsquo;s judgment (vv. 2-3).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Israel&rsquo;s Idol Worship in Bethel and Gilgal</h2>
<p>Verses 4 and 5 are concerned with Israel&rsquo;s idol worship in Bethel and Gilgal.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Jehovah&rsquo;s Visitation with the Expectation<br />
of Israel&rsquo;s Return to Him</h2>
<p>In verses 6 through 13 the prophet speaks regarding Jehovah&rsquo;s visitation with the expectation of Israel&rsquo;s return to Him and their preparation to meet Him who is the Creator and Ruler of all things.</p>
