[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in the full-time training in Anaheim, California in the fall of 1989.
[3]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE ONE A THOROUGH VIEW OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY THE BASIC PRINCIPLES
[4]  Prayer: Lord, we praise You and thank You that You are so merciful and gracious and full of blessing.
[5]  First, we are the priests of the New Testament gospel.
[6]  Therefore, we must act, behave, live, and move as priests of the gospel.
[7]  If you would have this kind of patience, this kind of spirit, surely within three years you would gain one.
[8]  If you would have D. L. Moody's spirit, even within three months you would gain one.
[9]  Please do not say that you are only a sister, that you are old, that you are weak, that you are sick, or that you are not a professional preacher.
[10]  The second step is the feeding, the nourishing, of the new ones.
[11]  Now we will fellowship some of the principles of the spiritual service which we should render to God.
[12]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE TWO THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOSPEL PREACHING IN THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY Scripture Reading: Luke 10:1-6; Matt 28:18-19; Luke 14:21-23; 2 Tim 4:2a; Acts 8:4, 29; 16:6-7
[13]  We praise the Lord that since the Lord's ordained way was brought into the recovery, most of the saints and the churches have received it and are continuing in it.
[14]  FRUIT-BEARING BEING THE REAL ENJOYMENT OF THE RICHES OF CHRIST
[15]  Paul said, "For woe to me if I do not preach the gospel" 1 Cor 9:16 .
[16]  The Lord Jesus said that if we, His branches, do not bear fruit, we will be cut off John 15:2, 6 .
[17]  Even though we do not bear fruit, we are still in the Lord, but we cannot have the real enjoyment of the rich supply of the life-juice of the vine tree.
[18]  Our first burden in this training is that every trainee would be burdened to go to visit people in order to preach the gospel to them.
[19]  Some debating ones may say that we force people to believe and to be baptized, but the Lord charges us in Luke 14 to "compel" people to receive His salvation v. 23 . Before we were saved, we were not willing to seek after the Lord; we had to be compelled, forced, to receive His salvation.
[20]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE THREE DEFINITE STEPS NEEDED FOR PRACTICING THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1; 1:14; 1 Cor 9:16-17; Luke 14:21-23
[21]  In this message, I will fellowship first concerning the present situation among the churches in the Lord's recovery and then present some definite steps which are needed for practicing the New Testament priesthood of the gospel.
[22]  THE FOUR MAJOR STEPS OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY
[23]  The Lord showed me the new way, and I presented it to the saints, beginning in Taiwan.
[24]  We need to see the definite steps needed for practicing the New Testament priesthood of the gospel.
[25]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE FOUR POINTS FOR FULFILLING THE PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; John 15:16; 1 Cor 15:58; 2 Tim 4:2 COMING TO THE LORD AND GOING TO SAVE SINNERS
[26]  In our hymnal, there is a precious hymn which says:
[27]  POINTS FOR FULFILLING THE PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL Not Needing to Wait for Others
[28]  I have the burden to stir us up to go out to preach the gospel, but in order to preach the gospel effectively we need to practice certain practical points for fulfilling the priesthood of the gospel.
[29]  Some may say that they do not know how to preach the gospel.
[30]  If we have this feeling, we should still go and preach the gospel.
[31]  If we have seen the need for us to preach the gospel, and we are burdened, we should pray and fellowship with some who are close to us.
[32]  After many years of experience and study of the Bible, we have found that this is the most economical and effective way for gospel preaching.
[33]  It is very helpful to try your best to make an appointment with certain ones whom you are going to visit through others who know them.
[34]  After preaching the gospel to your colleague, you may ask him to recommend you to his relatives or neighbors.
[35]  Then you can telephone this person before going to visit him so that you may get to know him over the phone.
[36]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE FIVE HOW TO CARRY OUT A SUCCESSFUL CONTACT WITH THE SINNERS Scripture Reading: John 15:16; Rom 15:16
[37]  In the New Testament, the Lord's first call to us is, "Come" John 1:39; Matt 4:19 .
[38]  Then after we have followed the Lord, His first charge to us is, "Go" John 15:16; Matt 28:19 .
[39]  To bear fruit we first need to be clear that if we have been saved by the Lord, we have also been charged by the Lord.
[40]  The slothful slave came to his lord and said, "Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter; and I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours" vv.
[41]  As slaves we must use what the Lord has given us to do business for Him; as branches in the vine, we must bear fruit; as ministers of Christ, we must minister Christ into others; and as the New Testament priests of the gospel of God, we must handle the gospel daily.
[42]  BEING SERIOUS AND DESPERATE TO GO FORTH AND BEAR FRUIT
[43]  If we see that we have been charged by the Lord, we will have a heart to carry out a successful contact with the sinners.
[44]  LEARNING TO SPEAK CHRIST, TO SPEAK BY THE SPIRIT, AND TO SPEAK ACCORDING TO THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT
[45]  In contacting sinners, we must learn to speak Christ.
[46]  Not only must we speak Christ in a general way, but we must also learn to speak Christ in a particular way.
[47]  The Lord said, "When they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you shall speak; for it shall be given to you in that hour what you shall speak; for you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you" Matt 10:19-20 .
[48]  If we want to be successful, we must learn to answer people in a proper way.
[49]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE SIX THE GLORY AND JOY OF THE BELIEVERS IN BEARING FRUIT Scripture Reading: John 15:8-11; 1 Thes 2:7, 11, 19-20
[50]  The first crucial item in the Lord's move on the earth is gospel preaching.
[51]  In John 15:11 the Lord said, "These things I have spoken to you that My joy may be in you and that your joy may be made full" v. 11 . To be branches of the divine vine and to bear fruit to express the divine life is a matter of joy a joyful life.
[52]  Many saints have had the experience of being in ecstasy when they have baptized one into the Triune God.
[53]  We must be very definite in our going out to preach the gospel.
[54]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE SEVEN BEING FLEXIBLE IN THE WAY OF REACHING PEOPLE IN GOSPEL PREACHING Scripture Reading: Luke 14:15-23; 1 Cor 9:19-23 THE FOUR STEPS OF OUR NEW TESTAMENT SERVICE
[55]  Our service to the Lord in the New Testament includes preaching the gospel and meeting regularly for the fulfillment of God's purpose.
[56]  In this message I have no intention to stir up a so-called revival.
[57]  The second group of people we have to visit is our neighbors.
[58]  We all have neighbors, and we may have lived by our neighbors for many years.
[59]  We are seeking Christ and desire to live Christ, abide in Christ, enjoy Christ, and experience Christ; yet after so many years, our next-door neighbor may still not be saved.
[60]  We must also visit our friends, colleagues, and schoolmates.
[61]  Some of you can get the best product that can be sold door to door.
[62]  Then you go out, not to preach Christ but as a salesman.
[63]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE EIGHT THE UNIT OF GOD'S SALVATION Scripture Reading: Luke 19:5, 9; Acts 16:31; 1 Cor 1:16a
[64]  In 1936 I visited a province in the central part of China.
[65]  One day a very devoted person came to me and told me that a close relative of his had become possessed by a demon.
[66]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE NINE MUCH FRUIT AND REMAINING FRUIT Scripture Reading: John 15:5, 8, 16; 1 Thes 2:19-20
[67]  Prayer: O Lord, we come back to You again.
[68]  These figures are accurate, but I do not have the same confidence in our practice because we do not have patience.
[69]  When you go out to visit people, do not care for the number, but care for the family.
[70]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE TEN LEARN TO BE HUMAN Scripture Reading: Isa 49:15; 1 Tim 5:1-3
[71]  Many of us have been reared in America and have been influenced by the atmosphere of looseness which is so common in this country.
[72]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE ELEVEN HAVING BEEN CHOSEN FOR THE START OF FRUIT-BEARING AND BEING DISCIPLED FOR BEARING MUCH FRUIT Scripture Reading: John 15:16, 8
[73]  Prayer: Lord, how we thank You that You have gathered us again into Your name.
[74]  Lord, we need You, and we want to talk to You.
[75]  The Lord said, "You did not choose Me, but I chose you."
[76]  By this we know that we have been called, yet we must realize that we have also been appointed.
[77]  We have learned from church history, and it is confirmed by the Bible, that to preach the gospel effectively, we must go where the people are.
[78]  We have to come back to the Bible in everything.
[79]  To spread the kingdom of God on this earth, to propagate Christ in the human race, to preach His good news to save sinners, is a crucial matter.
[80]  If we will dive into it without reservation, we will be discipled.
[81]  We all must realize that we have been appointed to go forth and bear fruit, so we should all have a start.
[82]  We were appointed with a purpose and a command that we should go forth.
[83]  In this message we will fellowship more concerning the gospel of Christ.
[84]  This kind of fellowship should be of help to us in learning how to preach the gospel to others.
[85]  CONSIDERING HOW TO USE THE MYSTERY OF HUMAN LIFE
[86]  THE OPENING WORDS BEING THE MOST CRUCIAL IN GOSPEL PREACHING
[87]  We all have to pick up an attitude, spirit, and atmosphere of learning.
[88]  Suppose you come to my home, and I welcome you and invite you to come in and be seated.
[89]  You cannot simply go to all the people that you visit and tell them that you would like to speak with them about the mystery of human life.
[90]  No one can assure you that in any gospel situation there will not be problems.
[91]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE THIRTEEN NOURISHING THE NEW ONES THAT THEY MAY REMAIN Scripture Reading: John 15:16; 21:15; 1 Thes 2:7; 1 Pet 2:2; Acts 5:42 NOURISHING AND CHERISHING THE NEW ONES THAT THEY MAY REMAIN
[92]  In this message we will begin to cover the second step of the God-ordained way: the nourishing and cherishing of the new ones that they may remain.
[93]  In John 15:16 the Lord said, "I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain."
[94]  We should not merely make the new one pleasant or happy; that is not our purpose.
[95]  We must be on the alert while we are talking to him in order to know what kind of person he is.
[96]  After our talking to them about God, many people need to know that they are real sinners.
[97]  We must learn how to deal with all of the various cases or situations in preaching the gospel.
[98]  SPEAKING TO THOSE WHO USE THE WORLD SITUATION AS AN EXCUSE
[99]  Some people like to use the situations existing in the world as an excuse to reject the Lord Jesus.
[100]  Some may answer that we do not take a certain name, but we just meet according to the city.
[101]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE FIFTEEN HAVING HOME MEETINGS FOR REMAINING FRUIT Scripture Reading: John 15:16; 21:15; Acts 5:42; 20:20; 1 Thes 2:7; 1 Pet 2:2
[102]  The second step of the God-ordained way is to have meetings with the new believers in their homes.
[103]  Once you enter the home, you must be very living and spontaneous.
[104]  Instead of sitting on the sofa, you may sit down on the carpet in front of the boy to talk to him.
[105]  We must learn to take the opportunity to minister the holy Word.
[106]  Regardless of how much you would act in a spontaneous way, you must grasp some time to minister something of the holy Word.
[107]  Recently a gospel team went to visit a couple on a Saturday night.
[108]  They shared that as Christians we have two very powerful treasures: inwardly we have the Spirit of God dwelling in our spirit, and outwardly we have the Bible, the Word of God, which is the truth John 17:17 .
[109]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE SIXTEEN REACHING PEOPLE WITH THE GOSPEL
[110]  We all have to know the Bible and some of the historical facts so that when we meet a thoughtful and educated person, we will be able to present an answer to his question that convinces, persuades, and subdues him.
[111]  In preaching the gospel, you may meet a very educated and thoughtful person.
[112]  When we preach the gospel concerning the resurrection of Christ to a thoughtful person, we can use the migration of people from northern Europe to the United States three or four hundred years ago as an illustration to show how we believe that something happened long ago, even when we were not there to witness the event.
[113]  The second reason we know that Jesus Christ was resurrected is by the spiritual descendants of those who witnessed it.
[114]  TURNING PEOPLE FROM THE MIND TO THE HUMAN SPIRIT
[115]  When we go out to preach the gospel, we should know that Satan is opposing us.
[116]  In your mind you may say that there is no God and that you strongly believe the theory of evolution, but at night while you are quiet and calm, there is another sensation within you.
[117]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE SEVENTEEN FOUR CRUCIAL PRACTICES OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE Scripture Reading: 1.
[118]  Right after their baptism, we must help the new ones in the home meetings.
[119]  However, we should not do this in a legal way as if we were using a textbook: first, lesson one, then lesson two, and so forth.
[120]  Then when we come to the new ones to have a home meeting in their home, we should not have a subject that we have already decided to cover.
[121]  You may continue your talk with him by saying, "To read the Bible is good, but it should be accompanied by another thing our prayer to the Lord.
[122]  Question: A problem we have been having is that when we go to a home meeting, our new one will ask so many questions about so many things that we have trouble covering any point in a solid way.
[123]  Answer: If a person raises a number of questions, you should try to answer only one and try to make him understand that it is hard to answer so many questions in one visit.
[124]  You can tell him that this time you will cover only one question and that you will come back after a few days.
[125]  Question: How should we take care of the Christians whom we contact?
[126]  Answer: Many times you will go to visit people and find out that they are Christians.
[127]  If you realize that they are real Christians, but they are not settled in any denomination, it is worthwhile for you to work on them.
[128]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE EIGHTEEN VISITING PEOPLE WITH THE GOSPEL AND NOURISHING THE NEW BELIEVERS IN THEIR HOMES
[129]  In this message we will consider the second step of the organic building up of the Body of Christ which is to nourish and cherish the new believers in their home meetings.
[130]  In preaching the gospel, a brother recently met a Moslem who did not believe that Jesus is the Son of God.
[131]  Because two of the greatest items in the New Testament are Christ Himself being the Son of God and His believers being the sons of God, more than one visit to such a person would be necessary.
[132]  When you make such a presentation, you not only show that the Bible is trustworthy but also show that you are capable in preaching the gospel.
[133]  In visiting people with the gospel, some saints met a Buddhist who had had a lot of problems in his past, such as a lack of food, clothing, shelter, and employment.
[134]  In presenting the gospel to him, some would say that you need to point out that God's salvation is not only to save people from outward problems, but also to save man from his inward and daily problems of temper, lust, anxiety, and fear, and that regardless of how many things a person possesses, he still feels empty, not knowing what the meaning of human life is.
[135]  A group of saints visited a young, successful attorney in his home for about three hours.
[136]  CARING FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE BY STIRRING UP THEIR LOVE FOR THE LORD
[137]  A sister in the full-time training began to visit another sister who is presently in college.
[138]  While in college, the young sister has had to work full-time as well as attend class and study, so she does not have time to come to the meetings.
[139]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE NINETEEN FEEDING THE NEWBORN BABES WITH BABY FOOD Scripture Reading: John 15:16; 21:15; 1 Pet 2:2 THE HOME MEETINGS AND THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS
[140]  I am burdened that we would all have a proper understanding of what we mean by the term "the home meetings."
[141]  When we say "the home meetings," we are referring to our meetings with the newly baptized ones in their own homes.
[142]  When we baptize new believers, we should immediately begin to visit them in their homes to have meetings with them.
[143]  However, when we speak of the home meetings in the context of the new way, the God-ordained way, we are not referring to this kind of meeting in the homes of the saints.
[144]  When I was young, I was told that no human power can save a person and that we must fast and pray to receive the power from on high.
[145]  In our experience, we may know how to visit people for the preaching of the gospel, but when we go to hold a home meeting with the newly baptized ones, we may not know what to do.
[146]  There are some very difficult situations that you will eventually encounter in preaching the gospel and caring for the newly saved ones.
[147]  When you go back to his home to hold a home meeting with him, he may immediately ask you, "What are idols?"
[148]  If you say "no," you will stumble them, but you cannot tell them that this is not a problem, because this is a big problem.
[149]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE TWENTY LEARNING TO CARE FOR THE HOME MEETINGS IN A FLEXIBLE WAY FEEDING THE NEW BELIEVERS IN THE HOME MEETINGS
[150]  Recently, before a home meeting, the saints prepared to share with a new believer concerning reading the Bible.
[151]  As they were reading the lesson on reading the Bible in Life Lessons together with the new believer, they came to the portion in 2 Peter 1:21, which says, "For no prophecy was ever borne by the will of man, but men spoke from God, being borne by the Holy Spirit."
[152]  SPENDING OUR TIME IN A WISE MANNER IN CARING FOR THE NEW BELIEVERS
[153]  Sometimes the new believers may ask you to engage in their sports activities.
[154]  In principle, you should first determine whether or not you have the time.
[155]  Then you should decide whether or not your intention is to be with that new believer or to participate in the sports activity.
[156]  If you do not have the time to do this, but want to spend some time with the new believer, you may suggest another time to get together with him.
[157]  LEARNING TO USE THE WORDS OF THE NEW BELIEVERS IN A POSITIVE WAY
[158]  In a recent campus meeting, though a new brother had received some help from the practice of calling on the name of the Lord, he asked how calling on the name of the Lord is different from the feeling one receives when repeating a motto such as, "Don't quit" or "Never give up."
[159]  Perhaps the best way to help this new brother is simply to encourage him never to quit calling on the name of the Lord, to encourage him to contact the Lord all day long.
[160]  In six months of taking care of the home meetings in a weekly way, you should mainly try to help the new believers according to the lessons in Life Lessons.
[161]  Then as you prepare to go to the home meetings, you will have a deep sensation concerning which point you need to work into the new ones by feeding them.
[162]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE RAISING UP THE NEW ONES AS GOD'S GROWING CHILDREN WITH THE PURE MILK OF THE WORD Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:2 RAISING UP THE NEW BELIEVERS
[163]  In this message we will continue to fellowship concerning the second step of the God-ordained way, that is, having home meetings with the newly saved and baptized ones.
[164]  If you spend some time to consider 1 Peter 2:2, you will realize that it implies more than feeding.
[165]  By the Lord's mercy, I found out that the biggest reason we do not have a large number in our meetings is that we are lacking in the proper raising up of the new believers.
[166]  We all have to understand that our problem, our shortage, in the past was that we did not see that to keep our fruit, to insure that it remains, we need to carry out the work of raising up the new believers in the proper way.
[167]  The first item regarding raising up children is that you cannot care properly for too many.
[168]  When you baptize someone, you are very happy, but you have to realize that this person is now your babe.
[169]  In your going out to preach the gospel, it may be that you will baptize some nearly every time you go out.
[170]  Question: Recently, before we went to a home meeting, we had some fellowship and felt that we should cover the matter of calling upon the name of the Lord in a solid and thorough way.
[171]  So we got into the footnote on this matter in Acts 2:21 note 1 , and we also got into the Life-study of Romans where this matter is covered in detail Message Twenty-three .
[172]  We began by singing some songs about calling upon the name of the Lord, but we could tell by the singing that they were not entering into this matter.
[173]  We went on to share with them the importance of calling upon the name of the Lord, not only for our salvation, but also for us to participate in all of the Lord's riches after we are saved.
[174]  Then we read a chapter from the Gospel of John, exercising a little as we read, and fellowshipped a few things related to that portion of the Word, Every time we visit them, they seem to enjoy our time together, especially the singing, and sometimes we are able to impart something of the Word through our reading of the Bible and fellowship.
[175]  Question: We are taking care of a family, and the wife is very sad because her husband has an alcohol problem.
[176]  Recently, she spoke to me about this problem, and I shared with her that she is now a new person because she has Christ in her and that our problems can be overcome.
[177]  Then I tried to help her to know how to receive more of the Lord so that her problems would not bother her so much, but she did not understand very well.
[178]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO LEADING THE NEW ONES INTO THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE
[179]  As you labor in the home meetings, you will realize that the new believers under your care need to be led into the practice of the church life.
[180]  You should not forget that the goal of gaining people is to bring them into the proper church life for the increase of Christ to build up the Body of Christ.
[181]  NOT CARING FOR THE NEW BELIEVERS ACCORDING TO OUR DISPOSITION
[182]  In caring for the new believers in the home meetings, we must realize that every person has a different disposition.
[183]  When we are leading the new believers to call on the Lord, we should not care whether they call loudly or softly.
[184]  LEARNING TO BE FLEXIBLE IN CARING FOR THE NEW BELIEVERS ON DIFFERENT LEVELS
[185]  The saints visited a new believer who comes from a strong Christian background and began to teach her a very simple song in order to help her call on the name of the Lord.
[186]  They told her that they like to sing such a song in the morning, especially when they do not feel so good or when they have a lot of problems.
[187]  AVOIDING VAIN LABOR BY LEARNING TO LABOR IN A PROPER WAY
[188]  I have noticed that when some saints go out, they quickly gain people, while others may go out faithfully, having little result.
[189]  In raising up the new believers as children, it is best if you have your own children.
[190]  However, if you do not have your own children by birth, you can adopt other children.
[191]  In this full-time training we intend to cover the four main steps of the God-ordained way.
[192]  In the previous messages we have covered the first two steps: visiting people as the New Testament priests of the gospel and raising up the new believers in the home meetings.
[193]  After studying the entire New Testament, we have found that raising up a church is like raising a family.
[194]  The teaching of autonomy says that once the apostles establish a church and appoint the elders, the apostles should keep their hands off the church and not touch the saints.
[195]  Therefore, when he came to Miletus, he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church v. 17 . He reminded them, saying, "I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house" v. 20 . He also said, "I did not shrink from declaring to you all the counsel of God" v. 27 and "for three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with tears" v. 31 . Surely the apostle did not take his hands off the church; rather, he continued to perfect them by teaching them, admonishing them, etc., all the time.
[196]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR GROUP MEETINGS FOR PERFECTING THE SAINTS Scripture Reading: Heb 10:24-25; 2 Tim 2:2; Eph 4:11-12
[197]  We go to the sinners to bring the gospel to them and infuse them with Christ.
[198]  Through our preaching, through our priesthood of the gospel, they are regenerated, converted from sinners to sons of God, and these sons of God are the many brothers of Christ.
[199]  THE PRACTICE OF THE GROUP MEETING Speaking and Singing Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs
[200]  Now we need to consider the way to have a group meeting.
[201]  We believers who love the Lord Jesus, who are seeking His purpose, and who are burdened for His recovery should be persons filled in our spirit all day long.
[202]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE THE PRACTICE OF THE GROUP MEETING Scripture Reading: Heb 10:24-25; 2 Tim 2:2; Eph 4:11-12 BEGINNING THE GROUP MEETING
[203]  First we must consider how we should come to a group meeting and how we should enter into a group meeting.
[204]  TEACHING IN MUTUALITY FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS
[205]  After fellowship, intercession, mutual care, and shepherding which includes the rendering of some help, we come to the main purpose of the group meeting the perfecting of the saints.
[206]  This perfecting depends upon our teaching, but we should not teach in the way that Christianity does with one man teaching and the rest listening.
[207]  Many times when we try to answer a question, we give a lot of good teachings, but we do not answer it according to the asker's thought.
[208]  Therefore, while one is teaching, all the others must be learning.
[209]  Question: Sometimes in a meeting a new one will ask a question that is peculiar or bring up a subject that is not so proper.
[210]  How do you respond to them in a sensitive way so as not to insult or offend them?
[211]  Question: We are caring for a meeting that has three new ones who are all at different stages of growth.
[212]  Many times it seems that they all want to talk at once.
[213]  I feel that we should take the lead somewhat, but I do not know what to do.
[214]  If three of them would speak at the same time, you should say something to them, but you must say it in a happy and encouraging way.
[215]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX EXERCISING TO PRACTICE WHAT WE HAVE HEARD Scripture Reading: Heb 10:24-25; 2 Tim 2:2; Eph 4:11-12; 1 Pet 2:9, 5
[216]  In this series of messages on the exercise and practice of the God-ordained way, we have seen that we should carry out our Christian work according to four basic principles or in four main steps.
[217]  Then when we have gained some, we must raise them up properly through the nourishing and cherishing in the home meetings.
[218]  NEEDING TO EXERCISE DISCERNMENT IN ORDER TO REACH OUR GOAL
[219]  The central thought of the book of Romans is that God's salvation makes sinners His sons.
[220]  Romans begins with sinners 1:18 3:20 , but when we come to chapter eight, these sinners have become sons of God 8:14 .
[221]  Although we all must exercise to have the Spirit's discernment, we should not go out to consciously "measure" or categorize every new one, saying, "This one is good for the building up of the Body, but that one is not."
[222]  PRACTICING THE FOUR STEPS OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY
[223]  I have been speaking concerning the new way, the God-ordained way, for over five years.
[224]  The brothers in Taipei have collected all my messages on the four steps of the new way and have separated them into four groups, one for each step.
[225]  After seeing so many messages on each of these steps, they told me that their greatest need was not for me to give more messages, but for me to stir up some saints to practice all these things.
[226]  First you should go out to gain people, but at the same time, you have to exercise your discernment not to baptize more than you can care for.
[227]  Our daily business, our trade, is to tell people about Christ, baptize them, and bring them to maturity.
[228]  On this earth there is such a marvelous trade, but to work in this trade successfully, we have to mean business with the Lord.
[229]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN THE PRACTICE OF THE GROUP MEETINGS MEETING IN THE PREACHING, PRAISING, REJOICING, CHRIST-SPEAKING SPIRIT
[230]  When we come together in any kind of meeting, we must exercise to keep ourselves away from anything of religion.
[231]  Our disposition and character hinder us from practicing the proper Christian meeting; therefore, we must learn to deny our disposition and character.
[232]  THE SECTIONS OF THE GROUP MEETINGS Prayer and Fellowship
[233]  The first part of the group meeting is primarily a time of singing, praising, and praying.
[234]  PERFECTING ONE ANOTHER IN THE GROUP MEETINGS BY MUTUAL TEACHING
[235]  We may hold the religious concept that the teaching in the group meetings must be done by a brother who is able to teach and who has been appointed by the church to teach.
[236]  EVERYONE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEACH IN THE GROUP MEETINGS
[237]  In the group meetings, everyone has equal opportunity and equal time to teach.
[238]  In this message we will continue to fellowship concerning the third main step of the God-ordained way the group meeting.
[239]  If we are not revived by the Lord in the morning and are defeated by the enemy in our daily life, how can we be victorious and living when we come to the group meeting?
[240]  The most difficult aspect of the group meeting is the matter of leadership.
[241]  We all must learn to take care of the meeting yet not have the thought that we are leaders.
[242]  We all must endeavor to start a group meeting.
[243]  You have to collect all the new ones who are under your care, and if you do not have that many, you can work together with other teams.
[244]  A vital matter that is crucial to the practice of the church life in the new way is our living a life of morning revival and daily victory.
[245]  You may not have been revived for a long time, and you may feel that you are very far from the Lord.
[246]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE THE FORMATION OF GROUP MEETINGS THE ADVANCEMENT IN THE STUDY OF THE LORD'S NEW WAY
[247]  In the fall of 1984 as we began to study the Lord's new way, I began to speak about the group meetings.
[248]  At that time I did not differentiate between the home meetings and the group meetings, because we considered these two terms as synonyms.
[249]  Gradually, through our study and practice over the past few years, we have learned that we should differentiate between these two types of meetings.
[250]  At the beginning of this term of training, we encouraged you to go back to the homes of the newly baptized ones in order to meet with them in their homes to nourish and cherish them.
[251]  We also encouraged you to bring the new ones into the group meetings after a while, which we did not specify.
[252]  At the beginning of this term, however, we did not encourage you to form group meetings with the new ones.
[253]  In forming the new believers into groups, you do not need to wait until you have eight or nine.
[254]  You could form a group meeting with just one newly baptized believer and one or two other visiting ones.
[255]  A HOLY LIFE AND LIVING FOR THE PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL The Morning Revival
[256]  As New Testament priests of the gospel, we must have a holy life and living.
[257]  To have some time with the Lord each morning does not mean that we have to spend a great deal of time with the Lord.
[258]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE THIRTY THE GROWTH AND MULTIPLICATION OF THE GROUP MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Heb 10:24-25; 2 Tim 2:2; Eph 4:11-12
[259]  To give messages to a big congregation may help the saints somewhat, but for the church to be living, fresh, high, and rich, we must have group meetings according to the God-ordained way.
[260]  You should begin to bring the newborn believers together in group meetings as soon as possible.
[261]  If you do not have that many new ones, you can have a smaller group meeting, even two or three would be enough.
[262]  If you baptized one last night, yet his wife has not yet been baptized, two of you may go back to his home tonight to meet with him.
[263]  In the group meeting, we should never be contented with the same number week after week.
[264]  We may feel that fifteen is a good number for the group meeting, but we should not be content with this.
[265]  We must fellowship with the brothers and sisters in the group meeting that we all have to be burdened for our group to grow.
[266]  THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE A CONCLUDING WORD
[267]  The purpose of the messages in this series is to train us to be proper Christians and even proper human beings.
[268]  When I was young, I learned the lesson not to touch anything that was not mine without first asking.
[269]  THE NEED FOR A TRAINING IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY
[270]  In the past centuries the Lord has not fully obtained what He has desired.
[271]  We had received a revelation from the entire Bible, and we could not deny that the Lord had shown us something.
[272]  The Need for Wisdom and Discernment after We Are Trained
[273]  Once we have been trained, we should do everything with much discernment; we should not fight foolishly.
[274]  To knock on people's doors for the gospel we have to exercise our discernment, and to talk to people in their homes also requires discernment.
[275]  In order to have wisdom we must have God, and the more God we have, the more wisdom we have.
