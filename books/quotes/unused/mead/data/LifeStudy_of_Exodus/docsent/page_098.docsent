   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. A TYPE OF THE STRUGGLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF SATAN AND HIS WORLD OVER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE BELIEVERS WHO ARE TO BE BAPTIZED</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Pharaoh s last struggle was a type of the struggle of Satan and his world over the believers who are to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Satan and the world struggle over a new convert, we should not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, we should realize that this struggle will prepare the environment for the converts to have a thorough baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>PHARAOH TEMPTED BY ISRAEL S TURN</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>IN THE WILDERNESS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have pointed out that Pharaoh was tempted by Israel s wandering in the wilderness 14:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thinking that Israel was wandering aimlessly, Pharaoh was tempted to pursue them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>PHARAOH S HEART HARDENED BY JEHOVAH</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>FOR HIS GLORY, AND THE HEART OF PHARAOH</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>AND OF HIS SERVANTS TURNING AGAINST ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Pharaoh was tempted to pursue the children of Israel, and God hardened his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because his heart had been hardened by God, Pharaoh made the decision to pursue the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Exodus 14:4 says, I will harden Pharaoh s heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will glorify myself through Pharaoh, and through all his army; that the Egyptians may know that I am Jehovah Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some may think that God would never do such a thing as harden Pharaoh s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is altogether contrary to their concept.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when we are in eternity, we may be surprised to learn that God has done a great many things that are not in keeping with our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In particular this is true of the way God uses Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although we hate Satan, God continues to use him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is proved by the fact that the doors of heaven are still open to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We see from such portions of the Word as Revelation 12 and the book of Job that Satan has access to God s presence in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we were God, we would use our power to immediately cast Satan into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the very least, we would force him to stay out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s way, however, is higher than ours.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to His way, He uses Satan for the accomplishment of His own purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the same principle, God used Pharaoh for His glory, hardening his heart and the hearts of the Egyptians 14:8, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regarding Pharaoh, 9:16 says, But for this cause have I made thee stand in order to show thee my power; and in order to declare my name throughout all the earth Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul refers to this verse in Romans 9:17.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God used Pharaoh not only at the time of the plagues, but also during the exodus of His people from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As 14:5 says, The heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to 14:1 and 2, God commanded the children of Israel to turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They were to encamp there by the sea, at a place that was virtually a dead end. In the eyes of Pharaoh, the children of Israel were trapped in the wilderness, and they had no way of escape.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to Pharaoh s concept, this was an excellent opportunity to get the children of Israel back under his control.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, he pursued them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>PHARAOH AND HIS ARMY PURSUING</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>TO THE SHORE OF THE RED SEA</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Exodus 14:6-9 reveals that Pharaoh and his army pursued the children of Israel to the shore of the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the children of Israel looked backward, they saw the army of Pharaoh, and when they looked forward, they saw the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Immediately, they cried out to the Lord and said to Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In their complaint, the faithless children of Israel were very eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They expressed their feeling with excellent utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not laugh at them, though.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we had been there, we probably would have acted in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Moses did not argue with the people or fight against them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Instead, he told them, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will show to you today: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more for ever.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Jehovah shall fight for you, while ye keep silent vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>13-14, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As soon as Moses spoke these words, the Lord came in and told him not to cry unto Him, but to tell the children of Israel to go forward.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then the Lord said to Moses, But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea v. 16 . At that juncture, Pharaoh and his army must have been very close to the camp of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we had been there, we would have been terrified, just as the children of Israel were.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Egyptians had six hundred chariots; all Moses had was a staff in his hand.</S>
