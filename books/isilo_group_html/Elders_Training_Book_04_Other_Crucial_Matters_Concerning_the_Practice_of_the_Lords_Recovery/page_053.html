According to what the Lord has shown us through His holy Word, I would say that the Lord&#8217;s testimony in the New Testament age is Christ as the all-inclusive One. He is not only the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9), but also a Man as the Head of the old creation (Eph. 1:22; Col. 1:15b). As the One who accomplished redemption for our salvation, He is the Redeemer (John 1:29; 1 Pet. 1:18-19), and He is also the Savior (Luke 2:11; John 4:42). Through His death in the flesh and resurrection in the Spirit, He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). In resurrection He became the Head of God&#8217;s new creation. He was the Head of the old creation of God. As the resurrected Christ, He has produced the church and has become the Head of the church as His Body (Col. 1:18). He is now on the throne, crowned and enthroned as the Christ and the Lord of all (Acts 2:36; 10:36). He is coming back as the Bridegroom to the church (John 3:29; Rev. 19:7), as the Judge to the world (2 Tim. 4:1), and as the very Savior to God&#8217;s chosen people, Israel (Rom. 11:26). Then He will be the King of the entire universe in the millennium (Rev. 20:6; 19:16). By this we can see that Christ is all-inclusive.<p>God&#8217;s intention is to work this Christ into His chosen people (Gal. 1:16a; 2:20a; 4:19) to make them His new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15) and give them the divine sonship (Eph. 1:5; Gal. 3:26), making them regenerated (John 3:6) and transformed (2 Cor. 3:18) members of Christ&#8217;s Body (1 Cor. 12:27). This Body is the church in this age (Eph. 1:22-23a) and on this earth to be expressed in cities as local churches (Rev. 1:11) without organization and without the nature of the old creation. The resurrected Christ is its constitution (Col. 3:11; 1 Cor. 12:12). This is what the Lord has shown us throughout the past years.<h2 class=head1>A GREAT DISCREPANCY</h2><p>By His mercy, the Lord opened our eyes to see such a vision. When we compared Christendom with what we had seen of the Lord&#8217;s vision we saw a great discrepancy, a great difference. We saw three categories of things which were altogether not scriptural and not according to the vision that the Lord had shown us from His holy Word.<h2 class=head2>Division</h2><p>The first discrepancy we saw was the matter of division. What the Lord had shown us in this vision from His holy Word was one unique people chosen by the one unique God and saved, regenerated, to be the one unique Body of Christ as the unique church of God. When we looked at Christendom, however, we saw division after division in nearly every city. Sometimes we even saw divisions on the same streets. One certain street became a so-called church market. This shocked us when we compared what we had seen with the actual situation. We were young people who were purely seeking the Lord Himself according to His holy Scriptures and this shocked us.<h2 class=head2>Organization</h2><p>Based upon this, we also saw another matter in Christendom which we could not find in the Bible-organization. In the Bible there is no human organization. As the chosen people of God, we all have been reborn of God to have His divine sonship. Then we become the organic Body of Christ. The Body is organic and is altogether an organism not an organization. How could the organic Body be something organized? We were bothered when we compared this to the revelation that we had seen. The organizations of Christianity were the second category of things which we surely could not agree with according to the vision we had received.<h2 class=head2>Traditions</h2><p>A third item that did not match the vision we have seen from the Scriptures was the matter of traditions. By the Lord&#8217;s mercy the Lord caught us when we were students. We loved the Lord, and we loved the Bible. We dove into the Bible, and within a few years, the Lord gave us a clear vision. Then when we turned to look at Christianity, we saw divisions, organizations, and traditions. We heard a little concerning the name of Jesus Christ the Son of God, and we heard a little of the shallow gospel. We hardly heard any truth, but we saw many traditions. This was the reason the Lord did something to raise us up that we might stand up to begin something outside the divisions and without organization and unscriptural traditions.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 04: Other Crucial Matters Concerning the Practice of the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 53</div><br></body></html>
