   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE MYSTERY OF THE ANOINTING 1 Scripture Reading: 1 John 3:24b; 4:13; 2:18-27; Exo 30:23-31</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him" 1 John 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The anointing is the fourth mystery in 1 John that we shall consider.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The previous messages have dealt with life, fellowship, and abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We who have been born of God now have eternal life, are in the fellowship, and abide in God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our understanding of these profound matters, however, is quite general.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we say that we abide in God and He abides in us, our concept of what "God" means and what "abiding" means may be somewhat vague.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the Apostle John was writing of these matters, however, he abruptly brought up another subject, which makes the application quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A SEPARATING LINE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He wrote: "Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and ye know all things" 2:18-20, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>. Antichrists have appeared; they were with the church and have left.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They might still call themselves Christians, but they are in another category.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is it that makes the distinction between them and us?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The boundary line that separates their sphere from ours is the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The other "Christians" lack the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In spite of holding the name of Christ, they are in fact antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even today there are many, like the modernists, who call themselves Christians, yet they are against Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For more than nineteen centuries the anointing has been the line of demarcation between these two kinds of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Both kinds claim to believe in God and to worship Him, yet only one has the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A STRANGE TERM</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is the anointing?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is strange that the apostle here used a verbal noun.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He might have said ointment, a noun denoting an oil with various ingredients added.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we would have known that he was referring to a substance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why did John use the -ing form of the verb anoint?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some Christians are not familiar even with this term.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the King James Version the same Greek word is translated unction in 1 John 2:20 and anointing in verse 27.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Anointing is the better translation, since the Greek word is the noun form of anoint.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To understand the anointing, we must comprehend the process the Triune God underwent in order to establish His relationship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A SEED SOWN</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first step in that process is the incarnation, God becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even today history has not adequately defined who Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is God and man, mingled together as one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This God-man lived on the earth thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The very God who created the heavens and the earth lived in a carpenter's home in a man by the name of Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the second step, His human living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The third step is the crucifixion, a form of death used in the Roman Empire for criminals.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By this means He entered into death, but after three days He came forth in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In resurrection He was glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During His earthly life He was like a seed without "form nor comeliness," with "no beauty that we should desire him" Isa 53:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By death He was sown into the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then He sprouted and grew in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the plant produces the blossom, that blossom is the seed glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus likened Himself to a grain of wheat, waiting to fall into the ground and die so that He could grow up into many grains John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the day of resurrection the Lord came back to His disciples in a glorified form, His resurrected body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The flower seed is a natural body, but the blossom is a resurrected one cf.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>1 Cor 15:42-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord Jesus is now in resurrection in the form of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now that God has gone through all this process, He is no longer merely God the Creator with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Humanity has been added to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The essence of His incarnation and human living, the effectiveness of His death, and the resurrection itself are all now included in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Jesus Christ today is not merely God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is God plus humanity, incarnation, human living, the crucifixion, and the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I want to impress you, not with a doctrine, but with the wonderful Lord in whom we believe!</S>
