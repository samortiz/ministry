Genesis 1 says that God created man in His own image and that He gave man the authority to rule all the created things
The divine life to be received by man is for two things to express God on the positive side and to deal with Gods enemy on the negative side
For God to accomplish His purpose, He must have a realm, a sphere, as a kingdom for Him to exercise His authority
After God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, He told them that they would be to Him a kingdom, a nation
When the Lord sent the disciples to preach the gospel, He charged them to say, 'The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
Matthew 12:28 says, 'But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you'
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence, and violent men seize it'
In the second parable, however, He says, 'The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field
It was from that time, after the church had been founded, that the tares, the false believers, were sown among the true believers, the wheat
The kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God just as California, as a part of the United States, is the United States
If you are in California, you are in the United States, but if you are in the United States, you are not necessarily in California
In John 3:3 and 5, though, the Lord reveals that the only requirement for entering the kingdom of God is to be born again
By our second birth we have entered into the kingdom of God, but have we entered into the kingdom of the heavens?
To enter into the kingdom of God is simply by rebirth, but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens is another matter
The time for us to enter into the kingdom of the heavens is revealed in Matthew 24 and 25, the prophecy of the kingdom
These chapters also reveal to us that there is a difference between the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of God
Some Bible teachers claim that when the Lord Jesus came, He came with the kingdom and presented it to the Jewish people
According to these Bible teachers, the church age is not the time of the kingdom, because the kingdom has been suspended
After the Lord's resurrection and before His ascension to the heavens, He stayed with the disciples for forty days
Near the end of Paul's journey as a Christian, as a servant of the Lord, he said that the Lord would save him into His heavenly kingdom
On the other hand, as far as the kingdom of the heavens is concerned, we are still on the way to entering into it
On the day of Pentecost, the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens and the reality of the kingdom of the heavens began
Within the real church among the true believers there is a distinction between the victorious ones and the defeated ones
To be clear about the kingdom truths we must first be clear about the difference between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens
We must be clear about the three aspects of the kingdom of the heavens: the appearance, the reality, and the manifestation
Now we must see in more detail the difference between the appearance, the reality, and the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
The only other mention of the kingdom of the heavens is in 2 Timothy 4:18 where the term 'heavenly kingdom' is used
In the first parable the birds signify the evil one, Satan, who came and snatched away the word of the kingdom sown in the hardened heart
The bird is the devil, and the birds are the evil persons, spirits, and things out of the devil who lodge in this big tree
Christianity became the national religion of the Roman Empire, and Constantine encouraged all the unbelievers to come into the church
Before this time the Roman Empire had persecuted Christianity, but during Constantine's reign the Roman Empire welcomed it
Today's Christendom is a big tree with many branches, and many sinful persons and evil spirits are lodging in its branches
The Roman Catholic Church, however, always recognizes that Christ is the Son of God, the very God, born of a virgin
Some of these unregenerated ones were accustomed to having a festival on December 25 to celebrate the birthday of the sun god
Isaiah 52:14 tells us that 'His visage was marred more than that of any man, / And His form more than that of the sons of men'
They maintain that if the leaven is not put into the things concerning Christ, it will be hard for the people to take
They said that everyone who entered the cathedral first touched the hand of the statue and that through the years this had worn out the hand
The Roman Catholic Church preaches Christ with paganism, with heathenism, with idols, with images, and with sinful things and false things
The Lord likens the kingdom of the heavens to this practice; hence, this is the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens
In the Scriptures, the sea denotes the world corrupted by Satan , and the field represents the earth created by God for His kingdom
The treasure hidden in the field must consist of gold or precious stones, the materials for the building of the church and the New Jerusalem
The church is the practical kingdom today, and the New Jerusalem will be the kingdom in manifestation in the coming age
At the end of the church age, when the Lord comes back, He will send the angels to bring all the living peoples, the unbelievers, unto Him
The evil ones will perish immediately, and the good ones will be translated into the millennial kingdom to be the nations
These seven parables show us the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens with the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens includes the true believers, the false ones, and all the evil things in today's Christendom
Verse 10 says, 'Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
Of being under the rule and control of God, the earth has come under the rule and control of Satan with fallen man
In the church there is the heavenly rule and government, and there is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
During the period of the church age, however, the kingdom of the heavens, the heavenly rule, is not manifested in an open way
When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will subdue the whole world, and the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord
The kingdom of the heavens will become the ruling power and will govern in a manifested, open way, not in a mysterious and hidden way
They are willing to live and walk and do things according to the teachings of the Lord concerning the reality of the kingdom in Matthew 5-7
They are sanctified, they are victorious over sin, self, the flesh, and the world, and they are in the process of being transformed
If the rules say that the lights must be off by 10:30, you do not need someone to come by and enforce this rule
The unbelievers and the defeated Christians may even cover the light and continue to study until two o'clock in the morning
In Romans 14:17 the apostle Paul tells us that the kingdom of God is 'righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
Sometimes when we expected that not many people would come to the meetings, we announced that every bench would be for four persons
When more people were expected to come to the meetings, we announced that each bench would be for five persons
They are not righteous as to themselves, so they do not have the full peace with others, and they do not have joy before God and with God
If you are a defeated Christian, not living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, where will you be when the Lord Jesus comes back?
To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord'
Let us also read 1 Corinthians 6:6 and 7: 'But brother goes to court with brother, and this before unbelievers
Chapter 5 shows that a fornicator is still saved, but chapter 6 shows that such a person cannot inherit the kingdom of God
Today we are not enjoying or inheriting; today we are being exercised in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
In the Bible there is surely the side of enjoyment and grace, but there is also the side of exercise and responsibility
Many Christians simply enjoy the family life of the household of God, but they neglect the exercise of the kingdom life
If we exercise ourselves in a proper way after we are saved, we will enjoy the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens as a reward
He saves us by His grace, but in His wisdom He causes us to be exercised by the kingdom, and He will reward us with the kingdom
If we are defeated Christians, when the Lord Jesus comes back, we will suffer loss, and we will be punished so that we may become mature
If our exercise has been proper in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord will reward us with the manifestation of the kingdom
If we are going to realize the church life, we must know something about the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens
We need forgiveness of sins so that we can have eternal life, and we need eternal life so that we can be under the heavenly rule
These young people went to the country to preach the gospel to the farmers, and a number of the farmers were saved
Their neighbor had stolen the water from their fields by draining the water from the two farmers' fields down to his fields
When they came again the next day, they discovered that their water had been drained to their neighbor's fields again
The next day the two brothers brought the water first to their neighbor's fields, and then they brought the water to their own fields
When the neighbor arrived, he saw that his fields were already filled with water and that there was no need for him to steal
If we are going to meet the requirements of such a high standard, we must have a life that is on an equally high plane
The kingdom is the requirement of the New Testament gospel, and the eternal life, which is Christ Himself, is the supply
Also, apart from the truth concerning the kingdom, it is very difficult to solve the debate between Calvinism and Arminianism
Besides eternal salvation there is the matter of the kingdom, which requires our exercise in this age to be a reward to us in the coming age
We need to read a number of passages which indicate that in addition to salvation there is the exercise of the kingdom
These few verses show clearly that if we exercise properly we will receive a reward but if we do not exercise properly we will suffer loss
That slave who knew his master's will and did not prepare or do according to his will, will receive many lashes'
Some Christians would argue that when the Lord comes back, we all will simply be resurrected and taken up to be with Him
There are the age from Adam to Moses , the age from Moses to Christ , the age of the church, and the age of the millennium
If we are willing to be dealt with by the Lord to the fullest extent in this age, we will enjoy the reward in the next age
If we are not willing to be dealt with by the Lord to the fullest extent in this age, He will still deal with us when He comes back
If we are not mature in this age by the time the Lord comes back, He will cause us to be matured in the next age
If we want to enter into the manifestation of the kingdom in the next age, we must live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today
The kingdom is the requirement of the gospel, and the life we receive at regeneration is the supply to meet this requirement
For this you realize knowing that every fornicator or unclean person or greedy person has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God
Let us read 1 Corinthians 9:24-27: 'Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize?
Everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible
During the time Paul was living, there were the Greek Olympic Games where people ran the race in order to receive a prize
Let us therefore, as many as are full-grown, have this mind; and if in anything you are otherwise minded, this also God will reveal to you'
At the time Paul wrote Philippians, he had been a believer for many years, but he was still pursuing toward the goal for the prize
The prize is the uttermost enjoyment of Christ in the millennial kingdom as a reward to the victorious runners of the New Testament race
When Paul knew that his martyrdom was imminent, he had the assurance to tell us that he would be awarded the crown of righteousness
The crown is a symbol of glory given as a prize, in addition to the Lord's salvation, to the triumphant runner of the race
Such a reward will be awarded to the believers, not according to the grace of the Lord but according to His righteousness
Paul was assured that such a prize was reserved for him and would be awarded to him at the day of the Lord's second appearing
We must all be clear that to be saved eternally is one thing, and to be exercised to bear responsibility in the kingdom is another thing
We must realize that as Christians today we are in the kingdom of the heavens-today to be exercised and tomorrow to be rewarded
Although we can be assured of our eternal security, whether we will enjoy a reward or suffer loss in the future remains to be seen
When the Lord returns, He will set up His judgment seat in the air to judge all the resurrected and raptured believers
The eternal judgment at the great white throne will be to judge all the unbelievers for eternal punishment in the lake of fire
The church, of course, is composed of the regenerated persons, the true believers, who are separated from the world
In the age of the millennium some of the believers will not be fully transformed, but the overcomers will be fully transformed
All of these transformed, redeemed ones will be composed together in the age of eternity to be the New Jerusalem
During the age of the church the Lord has temporarily given up the people of Israel and treats them like the Gentiles
At the end of this age, according to Zechariah 12 and 13 and Romans 11, the Jewish nation will be revived and will turn to the Lord
Revelation 14:6-7 tells us that during the great tribulation God will send an angel to preach an eternal gospel to the people on earth
During the great tribulation the Christians who are not ripe or ready to be raptured will be left on the earth to ripen and they will suffer
According to Matthew 25:32-46 the Lord's judgment of the nations depends upon how they treat His brothers during the great tribulation
In this parable the kingdom of the heavens is likened to a net cast into the sea and gathering from every species
Many of the Lord's little brothers during the great tribulation will be hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and in prison
The nations in the millennial kingdom are not regenerated, as shown by the parable of the net in Matthew 13:47-50
At the end of the thousand years of the millennium all the overcoming saints will be translated into the New Jerusalem
The rest of the nations will be translated into the new heaven and the new earth to be the peoples on the new earth
They will live by the fruit of the tree of life, while the nations will exist by the leaves of the tree of life
The kingdom is the requirement of the gospel, and this requirement can be met only by the life of Christ within us
