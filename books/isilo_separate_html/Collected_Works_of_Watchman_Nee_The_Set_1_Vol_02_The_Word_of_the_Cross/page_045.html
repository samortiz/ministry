We know that if He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is&#8221; (1 John 3:2). Oh how great is this revelation! Although the future has not yet been manifested, nevertheless, do not the two words &#8220;like Him&#8221; include everything? Should this not cause our hearts to rejoice? Although there is a great deal of opposition in the world today, yet all will be well when the Lord comes back. Although we were very lowly and mean, the Lord wants us to be like Him. What a glory! This is the original intention of the Lord Jesus. He came down to the world to die so that He could lead &#8220;many sons into glory&#8221; (Heb. 2:10).</p><p>&#8220;For the anxious watching of the creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the sons of God....into the freedom of the glory of the children of God&#8221; (Rom. 8:19, 21). Because the creation was subjected to vanity and put under the bondage of corruption, it now groans and travails in pain. But once the children of God receive the glory and the millennium appears, the time of &#8220;the restoration of all things&#8221; (Acts 3:21) will be here.</p><p>This glory, however, is in the future. At the present time, the children of God, along with God&#8217;s only begotten Son, still suffer the rejection of man. The cross is our portion for today; the crown is for tomorrow. Although the present way is narrow, when the millennium begins, &#8220;then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father&#8221; (Matt. 13:43). Reigning with the Lord in the millennium depends on suffering with Him today. Nevertheless, when we think of the future of those who are not the children of God, we have to take warning from them. Ours is the glory; theirs is eternal perdition in the lake of fire, the everlasting fire of hell, which is &#8220;prepared for the devil and his angels&#8221; (25:41). Eternal punishment is what the &#8220;children of wrath&#8221; deserve. Because of the substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus, we have been saved fully. Hallelujah!</p><h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2><p>Now we have seen the Bible&#8217;s opinion regarding the concept that all in the world are the sons of God. The Bible altogether denies this untrue concept. Dear reader, do not be deceived. Do not think that because all men are the sons of God, there is no need for regeneration, that it is enough just to improve oneself. You need to know: if God demands man to improve, what will happen to those who have so deeply fallen into sin that they are beyond any hope of improvement? To those people, this kind of &#8220;gospel&#8221; is indeed not much of a gospel!</p><p>At the present time, God&#8217;s door of grace is open wide. Whosoever is willing to enter will be saved. God will accept all sinners because of the Lord Jesus. Whosoever believes and trusts in the Lord Jesus can become a child of God.</p>Take heed! Which side are you actually on-on God&#8217;s side or on the devil&#8217;s side? Are you God&#8217;s children or the devil&#8217;s children? Is it salvation or perdition, eternal life or eternal death for you? There is no neutral ground between them. Which side are you on?</p><p>If you have not yet accepted the Lord Jesus as your Savior and have not become a child of God through Him, you are still of Adam and of the devil. Adam sinned, begetting children in his own sinful image (Gen. 5:1-3). You are the direct descendant of Adam; apart from regeneration, there is no other way for you to become a child of God.</p><p>Do not think that because you are better than others that you are not a child of the devil. You must know that God has only one kind of children: those who have been redeemed by the Lord Jesus through believing in Him. Only they are the children of God. God does not care for anyone else. Please do not wait until it is too late to believe in Him.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
