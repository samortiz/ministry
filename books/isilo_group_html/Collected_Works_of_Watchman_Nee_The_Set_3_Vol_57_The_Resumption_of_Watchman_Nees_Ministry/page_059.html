If we are clear about the principle just mentioned, there will be no problem with the practice. If the co-workers will first drop their personal works and come together in Jerusalem, the Lord will have a way. Although Paul was in Antioch, when a problem arose, he brought it back to Jerusalem (Acts 11:25-26; 15:1-2). Antioch can be considered the center of the gospel. As far as evangelistic works are concerned, it is right to have an Antioch. But if we want others to see a model, we have to bring them to a Jerusalem.</p><p>Today there are a few dozen meetings in Fukien province with over thirty co-workers. Because the attendance in every meeting is large, the workers only know that their own place needs men. Everyone wants to work from the uttermost part of the earth to the center. When we had our meetings in Foochow, some came without mosquito nets or even toothbrushes; they thought that they were coming only for a very brief time and were going to go back right away. Their hearts were all in their own places. Presently, over a thousand people have accepted the Lord in Foochow. There are not enough workers. In Jerusalem they needed one hundred twenty workers to take care of three thousand and five thousand (Acts 1:15; 2:41; 4:4). Today we have only twenty workers. These twenty workers are only a fraction of one hundred twenty. How can we meet the need? Today we cannot drop the Lord's basic principle. If we do, the Lord's work will suffer loss.</p><p>The proper way is to first save men in Jerusalem. After these men are sent out, the apostles are sent out after them. Then Antioch is produced. Today the way of consolidation is better than the way of scattering. Jerusalem is not a matter of geography but a matter of principle. When I mentioned this matter in Foochow, the brothers there responded at the beginning by saying, "Let us wait and see.'' But by the time I left, they agreed that this is the right way.</p><p>Antioch cannot come before Jerusalem. We cannot work from outside to inside. Brothers, is not the word of God clear enough? God is waiting before us. We hope that God would give us a blueprint for the work in China. How should the way in China be in the coming days? Should we for now maintain the works in the different inland places or temporarily drop them? We have to catch up with what God is doing wherever it may be. Today we have too few co-workers. During the past years we have lost one whole generation; we do not have anyone to come after us. Presently, I think the first place we have to take care of is Shanghai. I cannot say how many places the Lord has to begin along the coastal provinces, but I do hope that there can be a little beginning along the coast. I hope that some brothers would rise up in Hong Kong. Something must first begin to move in the localities, before the workers will have works to do. We do not know what God will do, whether He will have a beginning in two or three places at the same time, or whether He will start with one place first. At any rate, we need a Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head2">Every Believer Receiving Spiritual Education</h2><p>In the past we had one great failure concerning our work in the local churches. During the years 1928, 1934, and 1936, we made some advances in our testimony. Yet we missed many opportunities to educate the brothers and sisters. We did not educate our own brothers and sisters well. These brothers and sisters were born into our midst, yet they do not know why we are meeting as we are. To them, everything is more or less the same. This is because we lacked some fundamental arrangements, and we have not provided these ones the proper education.</p><p>The co-workers should know that the edification of new believers is a work that goes on perpetually. Among us, some have been saved for over ten years. Yet they have not confessed their sins once since that time, and they have not made any recompense. Now we have to select thirty to fifty topics, and we should repeat these topics year round. These topics do not need to be improved. Every year we preach the same topics. In this way we will be able to build up a firm foundation.</p><p>Today we need to take care of the whole gospel from its very foundation on. There is a difference between preaching the gospel and teaching the gospel. In the former case, one can change the methods. In the latter case, methods do not have to change. In the matter of preaching the gospel, no two persons have the same kind of footsteps, and no two persons have the same kind of testimonies. But after a person is saved, the teachings they receive should be the same. In the future we will all have to receive the same basic teachings before we move out. All the co-workers have to receive the same kind of training before the Lord.</p><p>The kind of Christian a person is, is based on the kind of education he receives. In the Anglican Church a person is taught only to recite the Lord's Prayer. Such a one does not even know the meaning of "amen.'' I believe we have to spend half a year to a year for our work. If we do not put in this effort now, we will still have to make it up in the future. If we do not do this work now, I am afraid that the future generations will blame us for it. We need to have the same footsteps before we can have the same testimony. Today we are short of standard Christians. By doing this everyone will receive the same teachings. All the brothers and sisters among us must take care of these make-up lessons.</p><p>In putting this into practice, we must be persons who are living, and we must have an adequate measure of life. Otherwise, the topics we cover will become dead teachings. If we practice this in a dead way, what we produce will become another tradition, and it will result in another hindrance that we will have to deal with eventually. If we speak in life, others will receive our speaking in a living way, whether the subject is spoken for the first time or whether it has been spoken for over ten years.</p><p>I hope that the co-workers would be in one accord and would pray for the way of Jerusalem. This matter touches our future and our family. Perhaps we will need some kind of arrangements. There need to be some arrangements concerning who should go where and do what. Perhaps some brothers have been staying in one place for too long; they need to be reassigned. After a person lives in a place for three to five years, he becomes settled and comfortable in that place. It is like a tree having taken root in a place; it is difficult to cut it down after the roots are established.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 57: The Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry &nbsp; pg 59</div><br></body></html>
