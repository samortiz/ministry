[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOSHUA MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: Josh 1:1-2; Deut 34:8-9; John 1:17; Col 1:12; Eph 3:8; Rom 6:3-4a; Col 2:20-21; Eph 2:6; 6:12; Josh 6:22-25; Ruth 4:21; Matt 1:5
[2]  With this message we begin the life-study of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth My burden in the messages on these three books can be expressed by the following four statements:
[3]  1 Joshua led Israel to take the God-promised land that it might become the land of Immanuel Josh 1:6; Isa 8:8 .
[4]  2 Elimelech swerved from the rest of the good land due to the trial of a punishing famine in the God-given land Ruth 1:1-2 .
[5]  3 Ruth, an alienated Moabitess, turned to Bethlehem, the place of the holy birth of Christ, and entered into the realm of the divine economy Ruth 1:16, 19; Micah 5:2 .
[6]  4 Boaz married Ruth and produced the royal house of David by Jehovah that Christ might be brought in for the accomplishment of God s economy Ruth 4:13, 21-22; Matt 1:1, 5-6, 16 .
[7]  God brought such an elect of His through trials, sufferings, both in Egypt and in the wilderness that they might be trained, disciplined, and qualified to coordinate with Him in taking His promised land for Christ on this earth and in providing the proper persons to bring forth Christ into the human race.
[8]  Such a vision will help us to see that the history of God s people on earth is actually the history of the working God energizing among His chosen people in the Old Testament and even the history of the operating God energizing in His redeemed people and having them energize themselves together with Him for the accomplishment of His eternal economy concerning Christ and His increase, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.
[9]  This should be the intrinsic life-study of these three books Joshua, Judges, and Ruth The issue of this life-study should be the gaining of the God-promised land for Christ and the bringing forth of the excellent Christ to meet today s need of both God and men.
[10]  I. THE FIRST BOOK OF THE TWELVE BOOKS OF HISTORY
[11]  Joshua is the first book of the twelve books of history from Joshua to Esther The Bible begins with the five books of the law, the books of Moses, and then, starting with Joshua, the Bible continues with the twelve books of history.
[12]  When I was young, I was taught many things concerning the three books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, but I was not told that this section of the history in the Old Testament is in line with God s economy.
[13]  The Bible presents a full picture of God s economy from His creation of the universe to the consummation of the New Jerusalem.
[14]  In the last two chapters we have the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem, the corporate expression and manifestation of the Triune God mingled with His redeemed people for eternity.
[15]  Many things occur between these two ends, but all are linked to God s economy mainly concerning Christ and His counterpart, the church.
[16]  The hub of this great wheel signifies Christ as the center of God s economy, and the rim signifies Christ s counterpart, the church, which consummates in the New Jerusalem.
[17]  God s promise first was that no man would be able to stand before Joshua all the days of his life v. 5a . Second, God s promise was that He would be with Joshua and would not fail him or forsake him v. 5b . In verse 9c God said to Joshua, Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.
[18]  In verses 6 through 9 we have God s encouragement to Joshua.
[19]  Joshua was not to turn away from the law given by Moses to the right or to the left v. 7b . The book of the law was not to depart from his mouth, but he was to muse upon it day and night so that he would be certain to do according to all that was written in it v. 8a . Joshua was to be occupied with God s word and to let the word occupy him.
[20]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOSHUA MESSAGE THREE SPYING OUT THE LAND Scripture Reading: Josh 2
[21]  Chapter one of Joshua is on the taking of the good land.
[22]  The real intrinsic significance of chapter two is that God gains the right person to bring forth Christ.
[23]  The Bible begins with God s creation, and it ends with Christ as the hub of the great wheel and with the New Jerusalem as the rim to manifest the Triune God for eternity.
[24]  God s eternal economy, therefore, consists mainly of two things Christ and His counterpart for the enlargement, the increase, and the spreading of Christ.
[25]  The intrinsic significance of the book of Joshua is the taking of the land, which typifies our gaining of Christ, plus the gaining of the proper persons to bring forth Christ that Christ might be spread and increased.
[26]  Furthermore, Christ s redemption has brought us into Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God to be the realm in which and the element by which we can be made God s inheritance vv.
[27]  Joshua sent the two spies to spy out the good land, especially Jericho v. 1a . Joshua s real purpose in sending out the spies was to find Rahab.
[28]  Rahab was a condemned Canaanite qualified to be destroyed, but she became one of the main ancestors of Christ, associated with Christ in His incarnation for the fulfillment of God s eternal economy, by turning to God and His people and by being married to Salmon Matt 1:5a , the son of a leader of Judah, a leading tribe of Israel 1 Chron 2:10-11 , and probably one of the two spies.
[29]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOSHUA MESSAGE FOUR CROSSING THE RIVER JORDAN Scripture Reading: Josh 3 4
[30]  Chapters three and four are on Israel s crossing of the river Jordan.
[31]  The people of Israel were ready to enter into the good land and to take it as their possession.
[32]  The children of Israel were buried in the death of Christ and then they were resurrected in the resurrection of Christ.
[33]  God s intention is to join us to Christ to have an organic union between us and Christ, making us one with Christ, that His history might become our history.
[34]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOSHUA MESSAGE FIVE THE PREPARATION BEFORE THE ATTACK Scripture Reading: Josh 5
[35]  In this message we will consider chapter five of Joshua.
[36]  This chapter reveals that all the kings were afraid because of the miraculous crossing of the river Jordan.
[37]  Verses 2 through 9 speak of the circumcision of the new Israel.
[38]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOSHUA MESSAGE SIX TAKING POSSESSION OF THE GOOD LAND FOR CHRIST
[39]  AND BEING MADE HIS POSSESSION Scripture Reading: Josh 1:2-6; Phil 3:8, 12; Rev 2:7b; Josh 5:12; Phil 1:21; Eph 1:11, 18
[40]  According to the divine revelation in the Scriptures, we need to take possession of the good land for Christ so that Christ can make us His possession.
[41]  Our taking possession of the God-promised good land is for Christ, and Christ s making us His possession is for us.
[42]  What does it mean to say that we possess the good land for Christ and that He, for our sake, makes us His possession?
[43]  In the first message of this life-study, we pointed out that to take possession of the God-promised land for Christ and to provide the proper persons to bring forth Christ into the human race are the two major points of the section of the history in the Old Testament in the three books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth These two main points to take the land for Christ and to provide the bona fide ancestors for Christ are the spirit of the history from Joshua to Ruth Since the God-promised land is a type of Christ, to gain the land for Christ means to gain Christ for Christ.
[44]  Paul was one who struggled to pursue Christ in order to gain Christ Phil 3:8, 12 .
[45]  We may be seeking Christians, but we may pursue Christ only to a certain extent, being content with a routine church life and routine work and service for Christ.
[46]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOSHUA MESSAGE SEVEN THE DESTRUCTION OF JERICHO Scripture Reading: Josh 6
[47]  Joshua 6 is a record of the first warfare and destruction by Israel in the land of Canaan.
[48]  In order for the children of Israel to gain the good land, they had to defeat the enemy and drive out the evil forces.
[49]  They only needed to believe and trust in God, to listen to the instruction from the Captain of the army of Israel, and to exalt Christ by bearing the ark.
[50]  The victory over Jericho in Israel s first battle after crossing the Jordan was won not by Israel s fighting but by their blowing of the trumpets and shouting, by their testifying and proclaiming of God with His ark, through their faith in God s word of instruction vv.
[51]  In this message we will consider Joshua 7 and 8.
[52]  These chapters give the account of the destruction of Ai.
[53]  Do you realize that, as a believer in Christ, you are a God-man, that God is a part of your being and that you are a part of God s being?
[54]  The defeat at Ai is described in chapter seven.
[55]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOSHUA MESSAGE NINE THE SAVING OF GIBEON Scripture Reading: Josh 9
[56]  To study the Old Testament histories and prophecies we need a full scope, a full view, of the entire Scriptures concerning God s economy for Christ and the church which consummates in the New Jerusalem.
[57]  My burden in this message is to apply this principle to Joshua 9 so that we may see the intrinsic significance of this chapter.
[58]  Joshua 9 is a record of how the children of Israel were deceived by the Gibeonites.
[59]  The kings who were across the Jordan in the hill country and in the lowland and on all the shore of the Great Sea toward Lebanon were threatened and gathered together to fight with Israel vv.
[60]  We should be today s Joshua and Caleb, fighting against Satan s aerial forces so that we can gain more of Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ, setting up and spreading the kingdom of God so that Christ can come back to inherit the earth.
[61]  OF THE THIRTY-ONE NATIONS IN THE HILL COUNTRY
[62]  A. Jehovah, the God of Israel, Fighting for Israel
[63]  Joshua 10:42 says that Joshua took all these kings and their lands at one time, for Jehovah, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
[64]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOSHUA MESSAGE ELEVEN THE ALLOTMENT OF THE LAND 1 Scripture Reading: Josh 13 17
[65]  Within God s economy there is such a thing as the allotment of the land.
[66]  After Joshua took possession of the land, God commanded him to allot the land that had been possessed and even the land that had not yet been possessed, because in God s eyes all the land was for Israel.
[67]  In His wisdom, God did not allot the good land as a whole to all the children of Israel.
[68]  If we consider what this hymn says regarding Christ s being God mingled with man, His putting on human nature, His dying according to God s plan, His resurrecting with a body, His ascending as a man, His sitting in the heavens, and His being crowned with God s glory, we will realize that this hymn is full of truth and enlightenment.
[69]  Joshua 13:1-7 speaks of the land that remained to be possessed.
[70]  When Joshua was old, Jehovah said to him, You are old and advanced in age, and very much of the land remains to be possessed v. 1 .
[71]  Chapters sixteen and seventeen describe the land allotted to the tribe of Joseph.
[72]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOSHUA MESSAGE TWELVE THE ALLOTMENT OF THE LAND 2 Scripture Reading: Josh 18 22
[73]  Many spiritual items concerning Christ and the church are revealed in the New Testament in principle but not in detail.
[74]  This is especially true in the matter of gaining Christ, experiencing Christ, and enjoying Christ.
[75]  In the book of Ephesians Christ is revealed as being all-inclusive because He is the One who fills all in all Eph 1:23 .
[76]  They were given to the Levites by the children of Israel according to God s command to Moses 21:1-3 .
[77]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOSHUA MESSAGE THIRTEEN TEN ASPECTS OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Josh 21:43; 13:33; Deut 8:7-10
[78]  From the first century A.D. to the fifth century, there were many teachings and debates concerning Christology, the study of the person of Christ.
[79]  The entire Old Testament from Genesis to Malachi is a book on Christology.
[80]  In the Old Testament there are many types of Christ, and each of these types is related to the study of Christ.
[81]  Acts 13:33 indicates that resurrection was a birth to the man Jesus.
[82]  He was begotten by God in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God among many brothers Rom 8:29 .
[83]  Furthermore, Christ s resurrection was a birth not only to Him but also to all His millions of believers, who were regenerated by God in the resurrection of Christ 1 Pet 1:3 to be the many sons of God and the many brothers of Christ Heb 2:10-12 .
[84]  In His ascension Christ was appointed to be the Lord to possess the whole earth and to be the Christ to bear God s commission to complete God s economy Acts 2:36; 10:36 .
[85]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOSHUA MESSAGE FOURTEEN THREE PARTICULAR MATTERS
[86]  In this message I have the burden to give a further word on three particular matters concerning the allotment of the good land the case of the daughters of Zelophehad, the cities of refuge, and the return of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh to their land east of the Jordan.
[87]  In typology, these three matters show us certain details regarding the enjoyment of Christ.
[88]  The daughters claimed the right to inherit their father s inheritance, so that it would remain in his tribe v. 4; Num 27:1-11 . According to God s ordination, only males had the right of inheritance.
[89]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOSHUA MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE DEPARTURE OF JOSHUA Scripture Reading: Josh 23 24
[90]  In this message we will consider the departure of Joshua described in chapters twenty-three and twenty-four.
[91]  At the time of his departure, Joshua had a burden to charge the people of Israel not to forsake God but to remember Him in all His gracious and merciful deeds for them in Egypt, in the wilderness, and in the good land.
[92]  Joshua told them that if they forsook Jehovah their God, He would no longer dispossess the nations out of their sight.
[93]  Joshua reminded them that they had seen all that Jehovah their God had done to all the nations because of them v. 3 . Joshua went on to say that he had allotted to them all the nations that remained as an inheritance for their tribes, as well as all the nations that he had cut off v. 4 . Then Joshua said, Jehovah your God, He will thrust them out before you and dispossess them out of your sight; and you will possess their land, as Jehovah your God spoke to you v. 5 .
[94]  Joshua continued by warning them not to turn back and cling to the remainder of the nations, not to marry into them, and not to go among them v. 12 . Then Joshua charged them, saying, Know for certain that Jehovah your God will no longer dispossess these nations out of your sight, but they will become a snare and a trap to you, and a scourge in your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that Jehovah your God has given you v. 13 . Joshua went on to remind them that they knew in their hearts and souls that not a word had failed of all the good things that Jehovah had spoken concerning them.
[95]  Chapter twenty-four is Joshua s parting word to all the tribes of Israel with their elders, heads, judges, and officers.
[96]  As we begin the life-study of Judges, I have the burden to speak a word concerning the intrinsic significance of this book.
[97]  If we read the Old Testament according to this full scope, we will realize that at Mount Sinai God married Israel.
[98]  In His concept and desire, He wanted to be to Israel as a husband to a wife, and He expected Israel to act as a wife toward Him.
[99]  LIFE-STUDY OF JUDGES MESSAGE TWO THE BEAUTIFUL SCENE OF ISRAEL S TRUSTING IN GOD Scripture Reading: Judg.
[100]  This chapter describes the beautiful scene of Israel s trusting in God.
[101]  Behold, I have given the land into his hand v. 2 . This marvelous picture of oneness with the Lord, of the organic union of God with His people, is a continuation of the oneness in the book of Joshua when the people of Israel first entered into the good land.
[102]  OF ISRAEL S FORSAKING OF GOD CHAPTERS 2 16 1 Scripture Reading: Judg.
[103]  We have seen that at Mount Sinai God entered into a marriage union with Israel and that He wanted her to remain in the most intimate contact with Him in this marvelous marriage union.
[104]  In verses 6 through 10 we see the reason for Israel s forsaking of God.
[105]  The record of the first cycle is given in 3:7-11a.
[106]  The children of Israel did evil in forsaking Jehovah to serve the Baalim and the Asheroth v. 7 .
[107]  Chapters four and five are a record of the third cycle.
[108]  THE FOURTH CYCLE A. Israel Again Doing That Which Was Evil
[109]  Once again the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah 6:1a .
[110]  Jehovah charged Gideon to tear down the altar of Baal that belonged to his father and to cut down the Asherah that was beside it and then to build an altar to Jehovah his God upon the top of that stronghold in the ordered manner vv.
[111]  The intrinsic significance of the fifth and sixth cycles of Israel s miserable history 8:33 10:5; 10:6 12:15 consists of Israel s forsaking God and joining herself to idols.
[112]  As soon as Gideon died, Israel turned again and went as harlots after the Baalim, making Baal-berith their god.
[113]  They did not remember Jehovah their God, who had delivered them from the hand of all their enemies all around, nor did they show mercy to the house of Gideon for all the good he had done to Israel 8:33-35 .
[114]  LIFE-STUDY OF JUDGES MESSAGE SEVEN THE MISERABLE HISTORY
[115]  It is hard to imagine that the children of Israel, who had been chosen, taught, trained, and disciplined by God and who had God s law, could have become so rotten.
[116]  The book of Judges records seven cycles of Israel s miserable history of forsaking God.
[117]  In verses 3 through 23 we have an account of Samson s origin.
[118]  CHAPTERS 17 21 1 THE ABOMINABLE CHAOS IN THEIR WORSHIP Scripture Reading: Judg.
[119]  In this life-study of the books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, we are concerned not with history but with learning from the types how to gain Christ and enjoy Him.
[120]  The history contained in these books is a great type that shows how God s elect can gain and enjoy the good land, which is a complete and all-inclusive type of Christ.
[121]  Even the small details show us the secret of gaining and enjoying Christ, just as in our daily life something as small as shopping for an article of clothing can be a factor in whether or not we obtain Christ and enjoy Christ.
[122]  Judges 17:1-6 tells us that Micah, a man from the hill country of Ephraim, set up a house of gods in his house.
[123]  LIFE-STUDY OF JUDGES MESSAGE TEN THE STINKING STORY
[124]  CHAPTERS 17 21 2 THE SODOMITICAL CORRUPTION IN THEIR MORALITY
[125]  In chapters twenty and twenty-one we have an account of the terrible slaughter among their tribes.
[126]  I. On the Second Day the Children of Israel
[127]  On the second day the children of Israel went to fight with the children of Benjamin, who slew another eighteen thousand men among the children of Israel vv.
[128]  LIFE-STUDY OF RUTH MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: Ruth 1:1-5; 2:1-2; 3:1; 4:9-10, 13, 21-22; Matt 1:5-6
[129]  In this message we will consider Ruth 1, a chapter that covers Elimelech s swerving, Naomi s returning, and Ruth s choosing.
[130]  E. In the Days of the Rule of the Judges
[131]  Elimelech left in the days of the rule of the judges, under Israel s forsaking of God and under their degradation, confusion, and corruption.
[132]  F. Due to a Famine in the Good Land
[133]  Elimelech left due to a famine in the good land, a lacking of life supply for living and satisfaction as a punishment of God Lev 26:26; Ezek.
[134]  LIFE-STUDY OF RUTH MESSAGE THREE RUTH S EXERCISING OF HER RIGHT Scripture Reading: Ruth 2
[135]  After Ruth s husband died, she had two choices: remain in Moab or go with Naomi to be a foreigner in Israel.
[136]  Ruth chose to go to the land of Israel because she probably had heard a great deal concerning God, God s promise, and the good land.
[137]  He came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, Jehovah be with you, and they said to him, Jehovah bless you v. 4 . When Boaz asked the young man who was set over the reapers concerning Ruth, the young man told him that she was the young Moabite woman who had returned with Naomi from the country of Moab and who had asked to glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.
[138]  LIFE-STUDY OF RUTH MESSAGE FOUR RUTH S SEEKING FOR HER REST Scripture Reading: Ruth 3
[139]  Chapter one shows Ruth s choosing, chapter two shows Ruth s exercising of her right, and chapter three shows Ruth s seeking for her rest.
[140]  We need to enjoy Christ to such an extent that we have rest.
[141]  In 3:1-5 we see that Ruth s seeking for her rest was promoted by her mother-in-law Naomi.
[142]  LIFE-STUDY OF RUTH MESSAGE FIVE RUTH S REWARD FOR GOD S ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Ruth 4
[143]  We have seen that Ruth made a choice for her goal and that she exercised her right to enjoy the rich land.
[144]  Under the prodding of Naomi, Ruth sought for a resting place, and finally she received a reward, a gain, for God s economy.
[145]  Another aspect of Ruth s reward is that she became a crucial ancestor in the genealogy to bring in the royal house of David for the producing of Christ Ruth 4:13b-22; Matt 1:5-16 .
[146]  LIFE-STUDY OF RUTH MESSAGE SIX BOAZ AND RUTH
[147]  TYPIFYING CHRIST AND THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Ruth 2:1, 14-16; 3:15; 4:9-10, 13
[148]  In these messages on Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, my emphasis has been on our gaining Christ, experiencing Christ, and enjoying Christ so that we may be the church.
[149]  At the beginning and at the end of the portion of Israel s history from Joshua to Ruth are two prominent persons typifying Christ Josh 1:1; Ruth 4:21 .
[150]  Ruth, being a woman in Adam in God s creation and a Moabitess in man s fall, thus becoming an old man with these two aspects, typifies the church, before her salvation, as men in God s creation and sinners in man s fall being our old man Rom 6:6 .
[151]  Ruth, being the widow of the dead husband, redeemed by Boaz, who cleared the indebtedness of her dead husband for the recovery of the lost right of her dead husband s property, typifies the church with her old man as her crucified husband Rom 7:4a redeemed by Christ, who cleared away her old man s sin for the recovery of the lost right of her fallen natural man created by God.
[152]  2 Our natural man was created by God to be God s counterpart taking God as our Husband and Head, but in our fall our natural man put God aside and made himself our husband and head, thus becoming the main part of our old man.
[153]  LIFE-STUDY OF RUTH MESSAGE SEVEN RUTH S STATUSES TYPIFYING
[154]  THE STATUSES OF THE BELIEVERS IN CHRIST Scripture Reading: Ruth 1:16-17; 2:2, 11-12; 4:9-13
[155]  The book of Ruth tells us a very famous story.
[156]  In this message, therefore, I have the burden to speak a very brief word concerning Ruth s ten statuses and concerning how they are a type of the statuses of the believers in Christ today.
[157]  Sixth, she became one who joined God s elect, Israel, in partaking of God s promises Eph 2:12-13; 3:6 .
[158]  We may summarize Ruth s statuses by saying that she was a natural, God-created person; a fallen, corrupted person; an old wife to an old husband a person in the old man involved with sin, with indebtedness; a person who joined God s elect; a redeemed person; a new wife; a person who brought in the royal family of the divine government on earth; and one of the crucial ancestors of Christ who brought Christ to the human race.
[159]  Sixth, in her status as an ancestor of Christ to bring forth Christ to the human race and to minister Christ to all the people on earth, Ruth typifies the believers as ministers of Christ, who bring and present Christ to all men, supplying them with Christ universally.
[160]  LIFE-STUDY OF RUTH MESSAGE EIGHT A CONCLUDING WORD Scripture Reading: Judg.
[161]  13:24-25; 14:6, 19; 15:14; 16:28-30; Ruth 1:16-17, 20-21; 2:10-16; 3:1, 7-13; 4:9-15
[162]  In this concluding word on the book of Ruth, I have the burden to cover a very crucial point in Joshua, Judges, and Ruth
[163]  One side concerns God s move in His economical Spirit, the Spirit of power; the other side concerns God s move in His essential Spirit, the Spirit of life.
