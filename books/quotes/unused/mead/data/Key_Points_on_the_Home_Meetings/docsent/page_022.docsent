   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD S PROMISE BEING FOR ME AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MY HOUSEHOLD TO BE SAVED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John chapter one shows us that after Andrew met the Lord, immediately he found his own brother and said to him, We have found the Messiah v. 41 . He then led him to see Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Philip met the Lord, he went and found Nathanael, and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and prophets, wrote v. 45 . Nathanael had more knowledge than Philip did.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He said, Can anything good be from Nazareth? v. 46 . He was right, for the Old Testament clearly records that Christ would come out of the city of David.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After such a word, even Philip became confused.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did not know what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then he came up with a solution: Come and see.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He took Nathanael to see Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we see two pairs: Andrew bringing Peter to the Lord, and Philip bringing Nathanael to Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The two of them each brought one sheep with them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Acts chapter ten, Cornelius sent for Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before Peter arrived, Cornelius had called together his relatives and intimate friends, and they were waiting for Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a pattern for us to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When a home meeting is held in your house, the first people you should invite are your relatives and intimate friends.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fill the house with them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Acts 16:31, Paul told the jailer, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this verse we do not see any word concerning bringing a sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, as soon as one believes in the Lord, he will immediately think of his household: his parents, wife, children, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and cousins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All these are one s household.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The scope of this household is extremely broad.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Strictly speaking, this whole household is your kids.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You must take them along.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The United States immigration law provides that entrance to the United States is based upon two principles: humanitarian considerations and family reunion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is this principle of family reunion that has caused trouble for the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, perhaps I may enter the United States first.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But I have parents, brothers, and sisters with me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are my direct relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Of course, I have my wife and children as well.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When they all enter the United States, my sister-in-law has her parents and, of course, brothers and sisters too.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With such connections, the Chinese are all over the United States, and are giving the Americans a big headache.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>My point is that a big number may give the United States a big headache, but it will never give the heavenly kingdom any headache.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may extend the scope of the word household as widely as you like.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have seven families connected to me by marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And these seven families have more families connected to them by marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All these are our close relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot see them die.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must bring them to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE NEED TO BE ACCOMMODATING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>IN LEADING OTHERS TO SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now you will probably tell me, Brother Lee, I have believed in the Lord for five years, but my wife absolutely refuses to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have heard this kind of word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>My answer to that is, Go home, and do not talk to her about Jesus any more; neither pray in her presence.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She is tired of hearing about Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You must find out what your wife wants from you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If she is upset about your coming home late at night, you have to learn the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You should sacrifice the meeting a little to get home earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Perhaps you would say, Do you mean you want me to go home before the meeting is over?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That is right.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You either sacrifice the meeting, or you sacrifice your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You have to choose between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To save your wife you must sacrifice the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you do this, after two months your wife s opposition to Jesus will gradually go away.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I know that some sisters really love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, their dispositions are too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since the day they were married, their husbands have been under their control.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When they were saved, their husbands were hoping that their temper would change.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Eventually their temper did improve a little.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But their dispositions remained quite strong.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They forced their husbands to go their way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They would even force their husbands to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The husbands would think that this Jesus is too terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Before their wives were saved, they were not as forceful.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But now they are forcing them even to go to meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The more they do that, the more the husbands will just refuse to go.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Sisters, I advise you to let go.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do not pressure your husbands anymore to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You have to learn the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You must learn to accommodate them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When you are fully changed, they will easily believe.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I know that many parents learn much in leading their children to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Some parents have strong personalities.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Their children have been taught to be obedient since their youth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But in their hearts they do not necessarily like their parents personalities.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When they are forced to believe in the Lord one day, they will refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Brother Nee s salvation had much to do with his mother s change.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>His mother was a shrewd wife at home.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>She never admitted mistakes to her husband and children.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But one day she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When she went home, the first thing she did was to admit her mistakes in tears to Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Such a change in the shrewd mother s personality moved the son.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Because of that, he went to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When he heard it, he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Some parents are thoughtless and attend few meetings after they are saved, but their children are very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This shows us a general tendency: those of us who greatly love the Lord easily alienate our children by our zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Some mothers love the Lord very much.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They rank first in attending meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But they have no way to bring their children to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The reason for this is that they are too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The same principle applies to all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We must bring people in, not by our zeal but by our gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Everyone who wants to bring in others should learn to be as yielding as paste.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The main characteristic of paste is that it is very accommodating.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>You can spread paste on anything, be it a flat surface, a sharp corner, or a crooked edge.</S>
