   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SON EXPRESSES THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Perhaps we will go back a little bit to the earlier parts in the Gospel of John and see what it says there.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 1:18 says, "No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why has no one seen God?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is because God is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jesus said that He was the only Begotten of the Father; He expressed the invisible Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When you see the only Begotten, you see the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Again He spoke concerning Himself, "And no one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven" 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Have you ever heard anyone say such words?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I cannot say, "No one has been to Shanghai, but he who comes from Shanghai to Tientsin, even I, Watchman Nee, who is in Shanghai."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I say so, I would be gibbering nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But Jesus was speaking a heavenly language.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He said that He came out of heaven and is still in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What can a person be if he can be in two places simultaneously?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Either he is God or he is a lunatic or he is a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you have not yet believed in Christ, please give a verdict to this issue.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Who is this man?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>SPEAKING THINGS OUT OF HEAVEN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let us read John 3:31-32: "He who comes from above is above all; he who is from the earth is of the earth and speaks out of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He who comes from heaven is above all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What He has seen and heard, of this He testifies, and no one receives His testimony."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He said that He came out of heaven and was above all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After a while He said the same thing again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let us see what is the purpose behind these words.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He came to preach the things of heaven, but no one received His words.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He mentioned words like "heaven," "above all," "out of heaven," etc. What kind of man was He? Confucius never said this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Neither did Sakya Muni or Mohammed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Was Jesus of Nazareth a madman, a liar, or the Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 5:17 says, "But Jesus answered them, My Father is working until now, and I also am working."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He always put Himself in the same place as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 18 says, "Because of this therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath but also called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we read His words now, we may consider them to be ordinary remarks.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the Jews knew what He was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They knew that He was making Himself equal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The words in fact meant that God is His Father and He came to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The invisible One is God, and the visible One is He.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, the Jews sought to kill Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What should we do about such an unusual person?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>KNOWING THE SON IS KNOWING THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John 6:46 says, "Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is from God, He has seen the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here the word is clearer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He said that no one other than Himself has ever seen God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only He knew what the Father is like.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I can only say with soberness and reverence that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Read John 8:18.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What did He say?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"I am One who testifies concerning Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies concerning Me."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The question in verse 19 is most interesting: "They said then to Him, Where is Your Father?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Jesus answered, You know neither Me nor My Father; if you knew Me, you would know My Father also."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Have you seen what He was saying?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They had seen Him, yet did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Of course they would not know the Father either, whom they had not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If men knew Him, they knew God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Who is He then?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If knowing Him equals knowing God, is that not the same as saying that He is God and God is He?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Read John 8:23: "And He said to them, You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The preposition "from" in this verse is ek in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It means "out of."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That is how it should be translated.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He said, "You are out of this world, but I am not out of this world."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This man claimed to be from above; He did not come out of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Who can He be?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>GREATER THAN ABRAHAM</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Jews were confused.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They were totally bewildered.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Who was this man?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The ancestor of the Jews is Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They boasted of being the descendants of Abraham in the same way the Chinese boast of being the offspring of Hwang-ti.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The name Abraham was highly venerated among the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now they brought out Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Please read John 8:53: "Are You greater than our father Abraham, who died?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The prophets died too.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Who are You making Yourself?"</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>How did Jesus answer them?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Was He greater or smaller than Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In verse 56 Jesus said, "Your father Abraham exulted that he would see My day, and he saw it and rejoiced."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Even Abraham had to look forward to Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hence, verse 57: "The Jews then said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?"</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Now please pay your attention to Jesus' answer in verse 58: "Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Tell me who this man is.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If I told you that before Hwang-ti was, I, Watchman Nee am there, you would immediately write me off as a lunatic.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Some of you would say that I am a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The words Jesus spoke made Him either a madman, a liar, or God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There can be no fourth alternative.</S>
