   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ in His All-inclusiveness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second great revelation in the New Testament is Christ in His all-inclusiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The knowledge concerning Christ and the apprehension concerning Christ were released to a surpassing degree in the writings of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The apostle Paul used the dimensions of the universe the breadth, length, height, and depth in order to show the dimensions of Christ Eph 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The breadth, length, height, and depth are all Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one except Christ knows how broad is the breadth, how long is the length, how high is the height, or how deep is the depth of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ Himself is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is all-inclusive and all-extensive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such a Christ first came down from the heavens to the earth; then He descended into Hades, the lower parts of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After that, He ascended to the earth, and then He ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things 4:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The third great revelation in the New Testament is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit is the reaching of the Triune God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only so; He is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Triune God, after being processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, has become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, the Bible ends with the divine title the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Revelation 22:17 says, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come!"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God and the bride as the consummation of the chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified mankind become a universal couple.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This couple is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The revelation concerning the Spirit was shown mainly to the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John in his Gospel had some revelation concerning the Spirit, but his writing is only a record of what he saw; it is not his teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, Paul's writing in his Epistles is his teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Transformation of the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fourth great revelation in the New Testament is the transformation of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regeneration, subjective sanctification, renewing, conformation, and glorification are also included in this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a young man I searched for a proper definition of regeneration, until one day when I read a sentence in one of T. Austin-Sparks's books saying that regeneration is to receive another life in addition to our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I read this sentence, I was very excited.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a wonderful definition of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In addition to understanding regeneration, we also need to understand what sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification are.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible says that in glorification we will be exactly the same as Christ in every respect 1 John 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a great revelation concerning the transformation of the believers.</S>
