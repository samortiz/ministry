<P>Peter felt that Moses and Elijah were very important. He felt that a tent should be made for Elijah also. He thought that it was important to have the prophets, and that a place should be reserved for the prophets. God interrupted his speaking. In God's eyes, the prophets could not be allowed; there could no longer be any prophets. What is the new covenant? The new covenant is one in which the knowledge of the Lord fills the earth and the sea. In the new covenant no one needs to teach his neighbor or his brother to know the Lord. In other words, the class of neighbors and brothers is annulled. There is no need for such a class of people in the new covenant. A brother once asked me to pray for him so that I would know God's will concerning him and tell him. He thought that I was not just a teacher, but a prophet as well. "Mr. Nee, please pray for me. If God tells you anything concerning me, please come and tell me." You have to realize that this fundamentally overturns the New Testament. In the New Testament, not only must the law go, but the prophets have to go as well. Not only should there be no ordinances, but there should be no persons as well. No one should tell you what is right and what is wrong. No one should tell you that he has a message from God for you, and that God's will is for you to go to Nanking or Soochow. This is impossible. This oversteps the Lord Jesus' work. These directions should come as a result of the Lord's work within us. Today the Lord is within us; He is showing us what is right and what is wrong. The Lord is telling us if we should go to Nanking or Soochow. Now we can understand why Paul went to Jerusalem against the advice of a few saints. He went to Jerusalem because they wanted to be his prophets. Whether or not something is from God, or whether or not something is right is not what is important. It was a matter of how Paul felt within. We cannot choose our pathway based on what others feel. Today there is no longer a class of prophets. It is over; it has forever passed away. Today the Lord Jesus is exclusively in charge. It is not a question of asking others what to do. We should not go to others to ask them what we should do concerning the affairs of our lives. A Bible teacher can teach others the principles. We can teach the principles, but we have to be careful when it comes to telling others what to do; we should be careful not to get involved in these matters. There is no such thing as a special class of men. Every person must be guided inwardly by God alone. We cannot allow dead laws or living persons to replace Christ. What then is Christianity? Christianity is Christ living within us, telling us what is right and what is wrong. Christ living within us is Christianity. Nothing else counts.</P><P>This was Peter's mistake. He thought that there should be Moses, Elijah, and Christ, but God said that there is only Christ; Moses and Elijah should go. What kind of Christianity do we have today? We cannot say that we do not need Christ, because only unbelievers would say this. We say that we need Christ, but we also say that we sometimes need Moses and Elijah as well. This was Peter. He surely put Christ in the first place, but he also wanted the law and the prophets. I am afraid we have not seen this clearly. But we must see this. I am afraid that some do not just want Christ; they also want the law and the prophets. They want three tents. These people need a voice from heaven to tell them, "This is My Son, the Beloved...Hear Him!" Now is not the time to hear Christ, the law, and the prophets. Now is the time to hear Him.</P><P>Let us go on a little faster. In Matthew 17 something else happened. Peter answered the question concerning paying the temple tax. We know that the Jews had to pay the temple tax. This is not the kind of tax that we Chinese pay today. The question was not whether the Lord Jesus would pay the tax, but whether He should pay the tax. Some Bible scholars tell us that there are two meanings to the tax in this verse. The first meaning is that of a kind of poll tax, and the second meaning is that of ransom money, like that used in the Old Testament for the redemption of souls. Exodus and Numbers speak of this matter a few times. There were two issues. The tax was levied upon the strangers, and not on the sons. If the Lord Jesus paid the tax, it would mean that He was a stranger and not a Son. If He paid the tax, it would mean that He had denied that He was the Son. But what is the foundation of Christianity? Is Jesus of Nazareth just a man, or is He the Son of God? If Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God, there is Christianity. If He is not the Son of God, we can give up this meeting hall tonight and go away to take care of our own business. The question today is whether or not Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God.</P><P>Perhaps some brothers and sisters have not seen how particular our faith is. I am always reminded that every Christian in this world has a particular faith. I often feel that the community of Christians is indeed the household of faith. Within the family of believers, there is a particular faith. What is this particular faith? What is the faith? It is being able to pick out One from among the myriads of men throughout the world—in China, in other lands, and including the past and the —of whom we can say, "This man is not just a man, but God." This is Christianity. This is our faith. God is not just God alone. We do not just have a book, the Bible; we have the revelation of God. What is the revelation of God? In order for God to reveal Himself to man, He had to come to the world. We do not believe merely in a God, but in His revelation. We do not believe merely that there is a God, but that there is a revelation of God. Many people believe that there is an unapproachable God in heaven; they believe that God is unknown and mysterious. The God that many people believe in is like the god of the Athenians, whom one does not know, or whom one cannot know (Acts 17:23). If you ask those in the world today if they believe in God, and what kind of belief in God they have, they will tell you that they believe in a God that is unfathomable and untouchable. But this is absolutely not Christianity, and it is absolutely not the New Testament. We believe that there is a God and that we can know this God. We believe that God is a revealed God and not a mysterious God in heaven. God is a God who has manifested Himself among men. By what means can we know this knowable God? God became a man like us. After He became a man, it was possible for us to know Him and to know the kind of God He is. God has put on humanity and come among men to show men what He is like. The only Begotten of God, the only Begotten in the bosom of the Father, has manifested God. This is Christianity. Because God has manifested Himself on earth, it is now possible for us to identify One from among all men who is God. We can identify this man and say that He is God. We have found Jesus of Nazareth, who is the Son of God. He is the same as we are, but at the same time, He is somewhat different from us. So what is Christianity? Christianity is built upon this foundation. Matthew 17 shows us the story about the paying of the tax, while chapter sixteen shows us the declaration of Peter. The Lord Jesus did not care for so many things; He did not ask many questions. He cared for only one thing, and He paid attention to only one thing, which is: "Who do you say that I am?" He did not care if others said that He was good or bad, or if they liked or disliked Him. He did not care for these things. He paid attention to only one thing, and He asked only one question: "Who am I?" Whether or not Christianity stands depends on who we say Jesus of Nazareth is. If we do not resolve this issue, we do not have the proper foundation. If the Lord Jesus is merely an Elijah or a Jeremiah or one of the prophets, we do not have Christianity. But Peter declared in chapter sixteen that the Lord is the Son of the living God. How did the Lord respond? He said, "Peter, you are Peter. I will build My church upon this rock." Peter said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" (v. 16). Jesus said, "Upon this rock I will build My church" (v. 18). Upon what is the church built? The church is built upon the foundation of "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." The Lord said something wonderful after this: "The gates of Hades shall not prevail against it." Why? Because the church is built upon this rock; it is built upon the words "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." I have often asked myself who Jesus of Nazareth is. There are many people here today. I cannot come to you and take your hand, or anyone else's hand, and say, "You are the Son of God." But I can take the hand of Jesus of Nazareth, and say, "You are the Son of the living God." I feel that this is the greatest joy of my whole life. To discover that Jesus of Nazareth is my Savior is not a marvel. To discover that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of the living God is a marvel. If Jesus of Nazareth was merely a man, a man from a nation far away, the church would fall, Christianity would fall, and the New Testament would fall. The whole issue rests on whether Jesus of Nazareth was man or God.</P>
