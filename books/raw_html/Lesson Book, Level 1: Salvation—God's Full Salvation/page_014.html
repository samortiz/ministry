<h1 class="title">JUSTIFICATION</h1>
<h2 class="head2">Scripture Reading</h2>
<h2 class="head2" style="font-weight:normal">Rom. 3:22-24, 28; 4:25; 5:1; 8:33-34</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Outline</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Justification by faith</li>
<li>Based upon Christ&rsquo;s redemption</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head2">Text</h2>
<p>Romans chapter three, verses 23-26 says, &ldquo;For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by His grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus: whom God set forth a propitiation-cover through faith in His blood, for the showing forth of His righteousness in respect of the passing by of the sins that occurred before in the forbearance of God; for the showing forth of His righteousness in the present time, that He should be just and justify the one who is of the faith of Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH</h2>
<p>[What is justification? Justification is God&rsquo;s action in approving people according to His standard of righteousness. His righteousness is the standard, not ours. Although we think we are righteous, our righteousness is only a quarter inch high. Regardless of how righteous we are or how righteous we think we are, our righteousness is just a fraction of an inch high. How high is God&rsquo;s righteousness? It is unlimited! Can you be approved by God according to your own righteousness? This is impossible. Although you may be right with everyone&mdash;with your parents, your children, and your friends&mdash;your righteousness will never justify you before God. You may justify yourself according to your standard of righteousness, but that does not enable you to be justified by God according to His standard. We need justification by faith. Justification by faith before God means we are approved by God according to the standard of His righteousness.</p>
<p>How can God do this? He can do it because our justification is based upon the redemption of Christ. When the redemption of Christ is applied to us, we are justified. If there were no such redemption, it would be impossible for us to be justified by God. Redemption is the basis of justification.]</p>
<p>Are you justified? How were you justified? The Bible tells us that we were justified by faith in Christ, not by works (Rom. 3:28, 5:1).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. BASED UPON CHRIST&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s death accomplished redemption for us. Based upon His redemptive death, God justified us. &ldquo;Who shall bring a charge against God&rsquo;s chosen ones? It is God who justifies. Who is he that condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died, but rather who was raised...&rdquo; (Rom. 8:33-34). Because Christ has died already, whoever is of the faith of Jesus is justified.</p>
<p>God is righteous. He cannot allow Christ to die for nothing. Since Christ died for us, then we are all justified. God cannot make His claim on Christ and then again on us. Since Christ paid the price, there is no need for us to pay it again. We are justified simply by believing in Him. Praise the Lord!</p>
<p>Because of God&rsquo;s righteousness, we were condemned. Because of Christ&rsquo;s one righteous act, His death on the cross for our sins, we are all justified according to God&rsquo;s righteousness. Now we can say to God, &ldquo;By believing in Christ, I am as righteous as You.&rdquo; Would you dare to say this? If you believe the Bible, repent for your sins and believe in Christ, you would certainly say this. This is the basic Christian faith.</p>
