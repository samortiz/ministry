<P>We also need to help the new ones to participate in the fellowship of the group meetings. This fellowship is the flow of life among the members in the group. In such a fellowship, the new ones will be nourished and cherished by the vital members of the group as nursing mothers. The apostle Paul considered himself a nursing mother in his care for the young believers in Thessalonica (1 Thes. 2:7), and we need to follow his pattern. The vital persons within the group become the mothers who can nourish and cherish the new ones through the fellowship in the group meetings.</P><P>The newly saved ones also need to be helped to learn to function in the mutual teaching and mutual perfecting. They need to be equipped and perfected, according to Paul's word in Ephesians 4:12, unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ. This kind of equipping and perfecting takes place mainly through the mutual teaching. This mutual teaching is one of the major items of the vital group practice. The mutual teaching can be carried out through the mutual asking and answering of questions. The new ones need to be helped to participate in the mutual teaching through the asking and answering of questions in the vital group meetings. The members of the vital groups can ask and answer questions regarding matters such as God's economy, the Lord's recovery, justification, reconciliation, sanctification, the confession of sins, the exercise of the spirit, and the ground of the church. Many matters can be brought up in the atmosphere of the vital group meetings, and through the mutual teaching by all the group members, an all-inclusive teaching can come forth that no single member could give by himself. This will render the best perfecting to the new ones in the crucial matters related to life and truth. We should not underestimate the capacity of the newly gained ones. Recently, two young churches have been raised up in Russia in the cities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Within six months some of the newly gained ones in these two churches were able to speak forth the truths with a certain measure. If we are faithful to learn how to impart life and teach the highest truths in the proper way, eventually the newly gained ones will become perfected and equipped.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THEY SHOULD INSTRUCT AND GUIDE<br>THE NEWLY BAPTIZED ONES TO GAIN OTHERS<br>AND TO PROPHESY IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS</H2><P>In the group meetings we must also take the opportunity to instruct and guide the newly saved and baptized ones to gain others and to prophesy in the church meetings. Before we can help the new ones to be fruitful, we must first become patterns to them by being fruitful branches ourselves. We need to help them to see that our goal is not merely to win souls but to convert sinners into living members of the Body of Christ. We should not delay in bringing our new ones into this matter, because they are able to gain others immediately after they are saved. Finally, we must bring the new ones into a vision that prophesying builds up the church (1 Cor. 14:4). We must also help them to learn to prophesy by practicing to speak the Lord's word.</P><P>We all must rise up to be vitalized and endeavor to rid ourselves of any kind of deadness and lukewarmness. The only way to accomplish this is to be desperate and absolute to practice all that the Lord has shown us concerning the vital groups. The vital groups are the only thing that can renew the Lord's recovery and bring in the prevailing increase.</P><P>6 brothers</P>
