   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First John 3:11 says, "For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 23 says, "And this is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, even as He gave a commandment to us."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Loving one another is a commandment from God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God commands us to do two things: to believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have already believed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we also should love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God gave us this love, and He also gave us the commandment to love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God first gave us this love and then He gave us the commandment to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today we must love one another according to God's commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must also love one another with the love which God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must exercise the love which God has put into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must apply it according to its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should never quench it or hurt it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First John 4:7-8 says, "Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and everyone who loves has been begotten of God and knows God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He who does not love has not known God, because God is love."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must love one another, because love is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who have love are begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who do not love have not known God because God Himself is love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When God begot us, He also begot love in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We were without love, but today we have love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today the love we possess is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God has begotten love in everyone who is born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God has given love to both you and others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why we can love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who are begotten of God have received a life a life which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is love; therefore, those who are begotten of God have such a love begotten within them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The life which we have received from God is a life of love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone who is begotten of God has love in him, and everyone who has love in him spontaneously loves the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It would be strange if we could not love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God gave every Christian a life of love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He also gave him the commandment of love based upon this life of love: "Let us love one another."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God first gives us the love, and then He tells us to love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He first gives us a life of love, and then the commandment of love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should bow our heads and say, "Thank You!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's children can now love one another."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>IF ONE DOES NOT LOVE THE BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now let us consider all the verses under this category in 1 John.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First John 2:9-11 says, "He who says he is in the light and yet hates his brother is in the darkness until now.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause of stumbling in him; but he who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are you clear?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whether or not a man is a brother and whether or not he walks in the light and turns away from darkness are determined by whether or not he loves his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a person knows that you are a brother and yet he hates you in his heart, it proves that he is not a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If he has seen five brothers and says, "I love four of them, but I hate one in my heart," it proves that he is not a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must realize that we do not love a brother because he is lovable but because he is a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We love him because he is a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the only reason for us to love.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a person knows that you are a brother and are of the Lord yet still hates you, it proves that he has no life in him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here it says, "He who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is in the darkness and he walks in the darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In other words, the Bible denies the possibility that anyone can hate his brothers; it does not accept this as a possibility at all.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you know that a person is a brother and yet hate him, you must say, "Lord, I am not walking in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am in the darkness and am walking in the darkness."</S>
