        <h2 class="head1">WAITING FOR CONFIRMATION</h2><p>The brothers and sisters here are very burning. There have been three baptism meetings since January with a total of forty-eight people. They all miss you since you left, even though they do not know you because they are new believers. They have heard so much about you that they feel they know you. May you not forget the seeds you sowed with tears for three years.</p><p>When I came from Tai-Yuan to Tien-Shui, the call I received was for six months. Now there are just a few more days left. My time will be fulfilled on the twenty-third. I am still not clear if the Lord will lead me to leave Tien-Shui or to stay here. Although I have called you an old prophet and insulted you before, my original going from Tien-Shui to Tai-Yuan and then from Tai-Yuan to Tien-Shui was through your confirmation. You have always been the one who gave me confirmation. This time cannot be any exception. Please confirm again.</p><p>I will not be useful at all if I continue staying here. First, I am immature in life; second, I do not have light; and third, I stutter. The brothers and sisters all need feeding. They are starving, and I cannot serve anything to them.</p><p>I beg you to tell me briefly the important points of the messages released by the senior ones (especially concerning the practical matter of life and the foundational lessons). I am really like someone walking in a black cave. I cannot see or feel my way.</p><p>Liu Shao-wu<br />April 15, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: 1 Cheng-Yuan Alley, Tien-Shui, Kansu</p><h2 class="head1">THINGS LEARNED IN THE PAST TWO YEARS</h2><p>In the past few years, I have felt the need to step back because of the things that happened in the churches in Manchuria. I have not dared to touch the things which the Lord commissioned to me. As a result, I have not had much fellowship with the brothers. Thank the Lord! He tears down, and He builds up. He skins and wounds, but He also nourishes and bandages. He led me into the valley of death, and He also caused me to begin again in resurrection. I know God and the sweetness of living in His presence in the spirit of revelation. I used to suffer by having His presence and then losing it. I have recently gained some experience in continuous fellowship and in continuously turning inward. Sometimes I am not faithful, but I immediately confess my sin. Through the blood I can still peacefully lift my heart back to God. The work, the environment, and my position cannot really affect me inwardly. I do not allow them to entangle me or rob me of my central service. For the past two years I have struggled to keep myself out of any kind of entangled condition. Presently, I can rest a little. However, I do not want to lose my zeal for the work and my impetus for resisting the enemy. Sometimes when I am pulled away from the center, I return to the Lord as soon as I feel empty inside. I really feel that that day is drawing near, yet my experience of life is still so shallow. I really am short of His glory!</p><p>I recently learned that you had returned to Shanghai and had had some fellowship with the co-workers. I desperately want to join you and receive teaching and correction from all the leading brothers, but the time and environment do not allow me. It is really impossible. The Lord's way is higher than my way. Perhaps the Lord is removing my spiritual laziness through this, that I might draw closer to Him and learn to be led into the hidden places of God. I can only yield to Him obediently. The only problem is that I am foolish and shallow. I am afraid to miss the teaching from the leading brothers and fall into darkness and be shut out of the Lord's central work. It is a small thing for me to lose the blessing, but I must pay attention to the Lord's heart's desire. I have recently written a letter to the brothers and sisters in Shen-Yang. I am enclosing a copy of that letter. I am begging for your comment and corrections.</p><p>I bear much of the blame for all that has happened in the churches in Manchuria. Before God and before the church, I feel that there is only one reason for this: I do not have enough growth. If I prostrate myself humbly before the Lord and give myself to be thoroughly dealt with by Him, nothing is beyond hope of recovery. We are immature in Manchuria and lack spiritual knowledge. There is a great possibility we will be cheated and fall into darkness. Therefore, I want to lay my condition and the content of that letter before you, brother. I hope you can give me some advice and tell me which way I should go from now on. If you feel to show the letter to some other mature brothers and sisters, I am very willing to receive their teaching and care in the Lord.</p><p>The Lord's children in Ch'ang-ch'un have been blessed by the Lord. He has kept us and watched over us. At the same time, He has built us up. I hope you will remember us in your prayers. We are lambs between Satan's teeth. I greet you with peace in the Lord. Greet the brothers and sisters in the Lord in Shanghai for me.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Hwa Tien-min<br />April 5, 1949</p><p>Mailing Address: 101 West 4th Street, Ch'ang-ch'un</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
