   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SIXTY THE MAN-SAVIOR S GOD-MAN LIVING 1 Scripture Reading: Heb 2:14a, 16-17a; Phil 2:6-8; John 1:1, 14; 5:30; 6:38</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The title of this message is The Man-Savior s God-man Living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Have you ever considered this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Have you ever realized that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, His living was a God-man living?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His living was not merely that of a man; rather, His living was the living of a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>SOME QUESTIONS CONCERNING GOD S SALVATION The Need for God s Incarnation</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to save us, God had to live in a man for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Have you ever thought about this?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In creating the universe God used only six days, and on the seventh day He rested.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why, then, did God need to live on earth in a man for so many years in order to save us?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not only did the Lord become a man; He lived on earth as a man for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Shortly after I was saved, I began to consider God s way of saving us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I said to myself, God is almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If He wanted to, He could save us by snatching us out of hell and bringing us to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why did He become a man and live on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord s human living was genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Genuine human living is found not with the upper class but with the middle and lower classes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus did not live His human life as part of the upper class of society.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, He was a member of a poor family and worked as a carpenter, living in the lower class of society.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even though He was a royal descendant of the family of David, He was born into a poor family and lived among the lower class for thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the age of thirty, He came forth to minister and ministered for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since God is almighty, why did He not save us in the same way He created the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In His creation, God simply had to speak, and a certain matter came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, He said, Let there be light, and there was light Gen 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Concerning creation, Psalm 33:9 says, He spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since God created the heavens and the earth in this way, why was it necessary for Him to live on earth for thirty-three and a half years in order to save us?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Application of Christ s Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Another question we have concerns the application of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Man-Savior accomplished redemption more than nineteen hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why did He not immediately apply this accomplished redemption to all His chosen people and thereby not give the enemy the opportunity to do so many evil things?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Consider the situation from the time Christ accomplished redemption until now.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yes, Christianity has spread throughout the world, but actually there is little life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It seems that during the past nineteen centuries God has not accomplished very much.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God has been working throughout the years, but there has been a great deal of opposition and attack.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Satan, God s enemy, has attacked God s chosen people again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why does this happen?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why did the Lord not apply His redemption immediately?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If He did this, there might not be the need even for the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the application of redemption, everything would become new.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There would be a new heaven, a new earth, and the New Jerusalem, where all God s redeemed ones would be.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Have you ever considered matters such as these?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Have you ever wondered why there is such a gap between the accomplishment of redemption and the application of redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I can testify that I have been thinking about these things for more than fifty years.</S>
