<h2 class="head2">The Restored Oneness Having the Nature of God</h2>
<p>God created all things by His might and held all things in accord without chaos. Through Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, this oneness in creation was brought into the realm of death, and the universe became chaotic. God is restoring this oneness not only by His power but also with His life. In this process He gives His resurrection life to created and redeemed man to recover the oneness that was damaged by death (Col. 1:15-20), thus making the oneness in creation again possible through the oneness in resurrection. The oneness in creation is related only to God&rsquo;s might, not God&rsquo;s life. Hence, the oneness in creation did not have God&rsquo;s nature. However, the oneness in redemption involves resurrection. This oneness has not only God&rsquo;s might but also God&rsquo;s resurrection life. Hence, it has God&rsquo;s nature (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Restoration Beginning with the Church<br />
and Then Spreading to All Things</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s work to restore the oneness in the universe begins with the church. God is working His life into the church so that oneness may be recovered first in the church. When oneness is completely recovered in the church, God will enlarge this oneness out from the church and through the church into all things in order to restore the oneness of all things. When God fully recovers the oneness in the church, all things will be headed up (Eph. 1:22-23).</p>
<p>James 1:18 says that God &ldquo;brought us forth by the word of truth, purposing that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.&rdquo; We are the firstfruits among God&rsquo;s creatures. Firstfruits are a matter of life. A house cannot ripen, because it has no life, but fruit ripens because it has life. God has imparted His life into created and redeemed people. This life is working to ripen them. The ones who ripen first are the firstfruits. The issue of ripening is oneness. God&rsquo;s life must first enter into the church and operate in the church to swallow up death so that the church may be the firstfruits among all things and be the first to enter into one accord. When medication is injected into the body, it first acts at the point of injection. When the church is fully matured and in one accord, God will bring in the restoration of all things so that all things will be headed up. This stage can be likened to medication working throughout the body.</p>
<p>The disharmony, discord, among all things in the universe will continue until the restoration of all things (Acts 3:21), that is, until the coming of the kingdom age. Romans 8:21-22 says, &ldquo;In hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God...The whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now.&rdquo; Because creation has been corrupted, it is still groaning and suffering pain. Creation hopes to be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of glory, which we, the children of God, will obtain. Creation&rsquo;s being freed from the slavery of corruption is the restoration of all things. When God&rsquo;s operation in the church is finished, the children of God will obtain the freedom of glory, and all things will be restored.</p>
<p>When God&rsquo;s work in the church is finished, all elements of the old creation in the church will pass away, and everything will be related to the new creation (2 Cor. 5:17). The church will be in one accord; there will be no discord. Furthermore, the whole church will enter into God&rsquo;s new creation, which is in glory. Then God will be able to free all things from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the new creation, that is, to free all things from the disharmony of the old creation into the oneness of the new creation. Romans 8:19 says, &ldquo;The anxious watching of the creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the sons of God.&rdquo; All creation is anxiously watching and waiting for the revelation of the sons of God. This indicates that God will first work the oneness thoroughly into the church and then work the oneness into all things.</p>
<p>It is not yet time for God to deal with all things; rather, it is the time for Him to deal with the church. If the church is not brought into oneness through God&rsquo;s dealings, all things will not be in oneness in the future. God regards the church as the firstfruits among all things; hence, He is working to first recover all things in the church into one accord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The One Accord in the Church<br />
Being out of Life</h2>
<p>God is not using methods, might, or conduct to recover the one accord in the church; His work of recovery is altogether by life. The more God&rsquo;s life operates in the church, the more the one accord is recovered in the church. The more God&rsquo;s life transforms the church, the more the one accord is manifested in the church. The extent to which God&rsquo;s life operates in the church is the extent to which the one accord is manifested in the church.</p>
<p>Some people, matters, and things in the church are in confusion and disarray. These things cannot be cleared up through man&rsquo;s doing or exhortation but by letting God&rsquo;s life flow through the church, that is, by giving God&rsquo;s life sufficient opportunities to transform. When everyone in the church has the inward flow of life and is gradually being transformed, one accord will spontaneously be manifested in the church.</p>
<p>The oneness in the church comes out of growth. If we do not let God&rsquo;s life grow in us, we cannot be one with the brothers no matter how much we try. Being united is not oneness. Oneness is God; hence, oneness can be manifested only through God&rsquo;s life. If we do not let God&rsquo;s life transform us, we cannot be one, nor can we have the oneness of the church. Politeness, humility, meekness, and self-cultivation cannot make us one, nor can they give us the oneness that God desires. The oneness of the church is the life of God being lived out of us. This is the oneness of the church in resurrection. This oneness is not the oneness in creation but the oneness of life.</p>
<p>God is our life in Christ. The only way to recover the oneness of the church is by God&rsquo;s life. Hence, only when we live Christ, live out His life, can there be genuine oneness in the church. In ourselves we can never be one. Only when we live in Christ can we have true oneness. This oneness is just Christ.</p>
<p>The oneness of God&rsquo;s life is inseparable from the fellowship of life, because the fellowship of life is the oneness of life. When we let God&rsquo;s life inwardly transform us, the fellowship among us will deepen. As this fellowship deepens, the oneness increases. Fellowship is not based on having the same views or having a common faith; fellowship is based on life, because fellowship is life. Death severs all things from God and brings all things into disharmony, but life joins us to God and makes us one with one another.</p>
<p>Whenever we touch life, we sense that we are entering deeper into God, and our oneness with those who are in life increases. Therefore, when life comes, oneness comes, because this oneness is life. When we reject ourselves and live in Christ&rsquo;s life, there are fellowship and oneness among us. If there are elements in us that are still not in Christ&rsquo;s life, then these elements are not in Christ&rsquo;s fellowship. Anything that is not in fellowship is in discord and is dead. Hence, God needs to operate in us until everything in the church is in Christ&rsquo;s life, and the church is in one accord and is headed up.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:13 says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; The word <em>at</em> is used three times here: <em>at</em> the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, <em>at</em> a full-grown man, and <em>at</em> the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. The oneness, the heading up, that God desires to recover in the church is the full-grown man, that is, the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ in the church. As long as the church lacks Christ, the church has a deficiency. As long as an element in the church is not up to the standard of Christ, the church has an element of disharmony. The harmony that God desires, the oneness that He wants to recover and arrive at in the church, is Christ. This is God in Christ becoming our life.</p>
<p>Such harmony and one accord through life in the church are the conditions of the coming New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the crystallization of God&rsquo;s recovery work by His life. Everything in the New Jerusalem is in one accord. This one accord is the issue of the river of water of life flowing out of the unique throne of God in the New Jerusalem. Everything in this one accord is according to God&rsquo;s nature of pure gold and the flowing of God&rsquo;s life. Revelation 22:1-2 says, &ldquo;A river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing...fruit each month.&rdquo; The river of water of life with the tree of life flows through the city. Everything that this city has and expresses is the issue of the circulation of life. Therefore, there is oneness in this city, not discord. Everything in this city is of the same life and same nature.</p>
