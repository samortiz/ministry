   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Hence, today our faith is not in the blood of the Lord Jesus' redeeming us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We can never fully understand this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even a man as spiritual as Andrew Murray, who knew God so well, said that he did not know how much value there is to the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even he said that when he went before God, he could only pray, "God, I do not know how much worth is the blood of Your Son before You.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But I ask that all the worth of Your Son's blood be realized in me."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord's blood is of such worth that if I would only say so much, I will not be able to receive all that He has done, and His work would be limited by my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not know the worth of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But we do know the worth of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The blood of the Lord satisfied God's demand, and we do not know how great that demand is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But we do know how great the satisfaction is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not know how much I owed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Perhaps it was ten talents or perhaps ten million talents.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But I know that the death of the Lord is sufficient to save me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How do I know this?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is because He has resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am not trusting in the money I put into the bank to be enough or not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not what I am trusting in. I do not even have to trust that all the money that I have put in was genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What I am trusting in is that God would not give me a counterfeit receipt.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even if the redemption of the Lord were wrong, whatever mistakes there could be, God would never issue a wrong receipt.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, though I do not know how much the blood has met God's demand, I do know that it has satisfied God's demand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the Lord had not satisfied God, God would not have resurrected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, you can believe in a most ignorant way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You do not have to ask whether the blood of the Lord is sufficient, or whether the Lord's work of redemption is approved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You only have to ask if God has resurrected the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since the Lord Jesus has resurrected, all you have to do is believe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We believe in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why the Bible only requires us to believe in resurrection; it does not require us to believe in the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The work of the cross is only conveyed to us to let us know what the Lord has done before God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What we preach and believe is the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It includes His death and His life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once I see the receipt, immediately I know that the amount is adequate and that every bank note is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Tonight I can sleep well because the Lord Jesus has resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the Lord had not resurrected, even though He has died and redeemed us, we still could not sleep in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How do I know that His blood is sufficient?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How do I know that the problem of sin is solved?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because we are justified, He has resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, we believe in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not know how many are sitting here who are still worried about their salvation, who are still doubting and are not sure.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you ask yourself whether you have trusted in Jesus, you may say yes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When you ask yourself whether you believe that Jesus has died for you, you may also say yes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But in you there is still a question.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You may think that to believe in Jesus is not sufficient to be forgiven of your sins, that you may still have to do some good works.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You may still think this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But you only need to know one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Why did God resurrect the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why did God issue a receipt?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The fact that God is willing to issue you the receipt proves that the amount that you have put in was right.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When God raised His Son from the dead, it proved that the redemption that His Son accomplished was a righteous one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God cannot do anything unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Resurrection proves that the work of the Lord Jesus is effective before God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is why the New Testament emphasizes so much our believing that God has raised His Son from the dead.</S>
