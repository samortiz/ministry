The word spirit is mentioned twice: 'God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness'
The world cannot receive or know this Spirit, but we the believers know Him, because He abides with us and shall be in us
In verse 18 the Lord told the disciples that He would not leave them as orphans and that although He would leave, He would come back again
When God gives us the Holy Spirit, there are two issues: one is that we abide in Him, and the other is that He abides in us
Spirit is also mentioned twice: first, in the phrase that which is born of the Spirit, and second, in the expression is spirit
God's salvation altogether depends on its spiritual reality; without spiritual reality, there would be no salvation of God
The heat that comes from an electric heater is the expression of the electricity but not the essence of the electricity
On the one hand, some Christians know the Spirit, but on the other hand, no Christian can see the essence of the Spirit, the Spirit Himself
We can experience the presence of the Spirit, see the manifestation and power of the Spirit, and touch and contact the Spirit in the saints
When we fellowship with God, we are fellowshipping with the Spirit; when we touch God, we are touching the Spirit because God is Spirit
The Bible tells us that when God created man, He not only created man in His image, but He also created a spirit in man
God Himself is the uncreated, eternal Spirit, and in order for this uncreated, eternal Spirit to come into man, God created a spirit for man
While a person is in high school, owing to his youth, he may be very proud of himself and may never confess that there is God
After he goes to college, he may have an even higher opinion of himself, thinking that scholarship and knowledge are God
When he starts working, he may become more conceited, considering capability and reputation to be everything and absolutely neglecting God
Some may worship a piece of stone, some may worship a piece of wood, and some may even worship a piece of paper
God alone can be the unique satisfaction for the human spirit because it was created for the purpose of containing God
Man's heart of filial piety, sympathy, and compassion, man's conscience, and man's human virtues all come out of the spirit of man
When He was among the disciples, outwardly He was almost the same as them, but inwardly there was a big difference
Although they had seen His glory, tasted His love, and listened to His prayers and teaching, He could not enter into them
The truth and the center of the entire Bible is concerning God as the Spirit entering into the human spirit to mingle with man as one spirit
In the Old Testament, we can see that God has a desire, an intention, which is for Him to enter into man and be joined to man
In these four thousand years, God greatly desired to achieve the goal of entering into man and mingling Himself with man as one
From Adam to John the Baptist, there was not a proper man who could allow God the opportunity to enter into him and mingle with him as one
Since the Lord Jesus is God, He is also the expression of God, the Word of God, and as the Word of God, His words are spirit
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son , who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
When He was in Jerusalem, He could not be in Samaria, and when He was in Judea, He could not be in Galilee at the same time
In His death and resurrection, He brought this finite man through death and resurrection and returned with this man into the glory of God
In the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, that humanity that He had put on in His incarnation was brought into glory
In this universe there is a prototype that has been successfully produced-the God-man, the man-God, Jesus the Nazarene
He brought God into man and was hidden in a man for thirty-three and a half years, mingling divinity with humanity
The finite man now became infinite, and what was once limited by time and the space of the universe surpassed the limit of time and space
The God who was uncreated and eternal, through incarnation, brought God into man, and through death and resurrection brought man into God
The definite article-the- in the Greek text of 2 Corinthians 3:17 indicates that the Spirit is the unique Spirit in the universe
Everything having to do with the spirit and all spiritual reality hinges on the contact and mingling of the Spirit with our spirit
We have to know, however, that genuine Christians do all these things not by outward regulation or teaching but by the inner power of life
Revelation 1:13a reads, 'And in the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet'
Verse 14 follows, 'And His head and hair were as white as white wool, as snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire'
Chronicles 169 says For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro throughout all the earth to strengthen those whose heart is perfect toward Him
On the one hand, Christ has ascended to heaven, but on the other hand, He has come to tens of thousands of people as the Holy Spirit
In other words, after the Lord ascended to heaven, He came to the earth through the Holy Spirit to reach all who believe in Him
In the midst of the churches on the earth, Christ is walking as the Son of Man in the midst of the golden lampstands
In Matthew 28 the Lord clearly promised that even though He would ascend to heaven, He would still be with the disciples
The Lord's being with His disciples after His ascension is from the time of His ascension until His coming again
The situation of the church over the past two thousand years testifies that the ascended Lord has never left the church
On the day the apostle John was on the island of Patmos, he saw the vision of the seven golden lampstands, which refer to the seven churches
In this world of darkness, the church is shining as a lamp, and Jesus Christ is walking in the midst of these seven lampstands, the churches
Revelation 4 and 5 show us the Christ in heaven, and the first three chapters of Revelation show us the Christ in the church
When a car is running at night, it requires two headlights, and the two headlights are like the two eyes of the car
When the seven lamps of fire before the throne of God eventually shine upon the entire universe, the darkness in the universe will vanish
We see the throne and the coming forth of God Himself as the Spirit, who is a consuming fire and lamps of fire
The seven lamps in chapter four are the seven Spirits, and the seven eyes in chapter five are also the seven Spirits
When we read Revelation, we cannot read it literally; rather, we have to read it like we would a poetic, idyllic painting
After Christ's death and resurrection, He ascended to God, and His seven lamps became the seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God
Not only so, God also has passed through death and resurrection to become the seven eyes of the slain and resurrected Lamb
By this looking and shining, we are enlightened, and we sense what we have done wrong and sense in which matters we have sinned
The result of our being enlightened is that we immediately sense that the Holy Spirit is moving within us and filling us
When all these experiences come to us, we sense that we are full of the presence of God, full of the presence of Christ
From that time on, my mother, my wife, my brother, and my sister-in-law would often say, 'This person is captivated
Those who are in such a situation do not need anyone to exhort them to love God and man and to not love the world
When He sees us, He shines on us, when He shines on us, He burns us, and when He burns us, He motivates us within
Since her parents had no way to change her, they told her out of anger, 'If Jesus wants you to preach Him, that is fine
God's eyes are His lamps of fire, and when these lamps of fire shine within a person, there is a burning within him
The center of the entire Bible is that God wants to work Himself into man to the extent that He is fully mingled with man
God will then be able to say that we are the same as He is, and we also will be able to say that God is the same as we are
It is obvious from the Scriptures that in God's heart, He wants to work in man to the point that man is exactly the same as He is
God's work throughout the generations will not be accomplished until the day that the holy city, New Jerusalem, is manifested
The glory, radiance, color, and appearance of the New Jerusalem are exactly the same as God in His glory, radiance, color, and appearance
We all know that the One on the throne is God, because the seven Spirits which come forth out of the throne are the seven Spirits of God
In Leviticus 10, Nadab and Abihu came before God, but because they violated the statute of God, fire came out and consumed them
The seven Spirits are seven lamps of fire because God is a consuming fire, and what is diffused from Him must also be fire
In Revelation 4 we see that the One who is on the throne is God, and the One who comes out of the throne is the Spirit
In other words, God the Father who is on the throne passes through God the Son-Christ who has been slain and resurrected-and is diffused
On this throne there is one God, and before this throne there are seven lamps, which are the seven eyes of God, the seven Spirits of God
Wherever there are God's lamps of fire, there is the presence of God, and wherever there are God's lamps of fire, there is God Himself
Eventually, the result of the burning of the fire of God will be a group of people who are one hundred percent exactly the same as God
Our God is a consuming fire, but when He passed through Christ, He became lamps of fire and the eyes of the Lamb
When we are filled with the Spirit, we are filled with the element of God, and this element, which is God Himself, is a consuming fire
The One who is sitting on the throne is like a jasper stone, and the expression of the holy city is also like a jasper stone
The city itself is pure gold because it has the nature of God, but the wall of the city is jasper as a result of transformation
The oyster being wounded to produce a pearl signifies Christ being wounded by us and dying for us in order to make us pearls
Everything that belongs to the city is inside the wall, and all that does not belong to the city is outside the wall
They cannot tell what is of God and what is not of God what pleases God and what displeases Him or what God wants and what He does not want
They do not have the power of separation in their friendships, their work, or their career, because they lack a wall, a separating boundary
If the element of God increases in us by 'three feet,' then the separating boundary in us will also increase by 'three feet'
Both gold and silver are created but precious stones are produced through a process of burning high heat high pressure and reconstitution
The Holy Spirit who is within us puts us-those who were originally made of clay-into the fire of the Holy Spirit
The Lamb, Christ, who passed through death and resurrection has eyes that transfuse God and convey His feelings
Because of this, when we taste the visitation and grace of God, our first inner feeling is that God's eyes are looking at our inner being
Every time we have fellowship with God, His eyes look at our inner being, for these eyes are sent forth into all the earth
The burning of fire, on the one hand, deals with everything that should not exist and, on the other hand, motivates us inwardly
Through the work of the Holy Spirit, a man of clay can be burned to the extent that he becomes part of the New Jerusalem
Romans 8:9-11 says, 'But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you
The Lord Jesus told us that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness
For the Spirit of God to enter into our spirit, Christ had to pass through incarnation, death, and resurrection
God's goal in the universe is to mingle Himself with man, and the resurrected and ascended Christ is God mingled with man
In addition to being the prototype of God's goal, after resurrecting and ascending, Christ sent the Holy Spirit
After we are regenerated the work of the Holy Spirit in us is to bring us through death and resurrection so that we will be mingled with God
No matter where a person may be, as long as his spirit is open to God and desires God, the Holy Spirit will visit Him by 'looking at him'
The Holy Spirit is the eyes of the Lamb, which are sent forth into all the earth to look at those who are on the earth
Through this looking, shining, and burning, God who is in Christ, and Christ who is in the Holy Spirit are wrought into us
We are like a cup, and as such we are able to contain the Spirit of God, the fire of God, the life of God, and the nature of God
The Holy Spirit who dwells in us will eventually bring every part of our soul-our mind, emotion, and will-into the Spirit
Our mind emotion and will may not have entered the Spirit may not submit to the ruling of the Spirit and may not be directed by the Spirit
He has a strong mind, emotion, and will, yet his mind, emotion, and will are no longer in the first place but in the second place
His mind, his preferences, his opinions, and his decisions are ruled and directed by the Spirit, and as a result, he is spiritual
In this kind of living not only does God enter into man, but man is also brought into God by the Spirit of God
If we check with ourselves based on this word we may find that the inner condition of our mind emotion and will are truly independent of God
From this we can see that many times the more the Holy Spirit prohibits us, the more independent our emotion becomes
Philippians 2:13 says, 'For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure'
Outwardly there is a working, inwardly there is a willing, and both this willing and working are God's operation in us
As those who have been saved, we have God in us, but often our willing and working are not under God's ruling, the ruling of the Holy Spirit
If both our willing and working are under the operation of God, we will be brought into God and will spontaneously enter into the Spirit
The will of God is to bring our mind under the ruling of the Spirit so that our mind will become a mind of the spirit, a spiritual mind
Whether we are loving the brothers or fellowshipping with the sisters, all of our emotions should be restricted and ruled by the Holy Spirit
If the Holy Spirit agrees with our love, then we should love, but if the Holy Spirit is against our love, then we should not love
Similarly, our mind has to submit to the leading of the Holy Spirit, and our will has to follow the feeling of the Holy Spirit
In this way we will no longer be soulish or fleshly but spiritual, and we will have the expression of a spiritual condition
God has a purpose in this universe, and this purpose is to mingle Himself with man to the extent that man would be exactly the same as He is
For Him to mingle with man, man must have a spirit that is identical to and compatible with the essence of God
For God to enter into man, mingle with man, and make man exactly the same as He is, He first had to become flesh
After becoming flesh, the further steps that the incarnated Lord Jesus took were to die, resurrect, and ascend to the heavens
The significance of His resurrection is that it enables man to receive everything of God, that is, it brings man into all the riches of God
At that time He was purely God, purely Spirit, and there was nothing other than the element of God and Spirit in Him and on Him
When He descended on the day of Pentecost, He had already passed through incarnation, death, resurrection, and ascension
We can also say that this Spirit possessed the death of the cross, the life of resurrection, and the riches of ascension
God and all that He has passed through were in the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost and continue to be in Him today
After we are saved, the Holy Spirit lives within us, but very few of us realize how rich this Holy Spirit who dwells in us is
The death of the cross, resurrection, ascension, and the riches and authority of the heavens are in the Holy Spirit
God is the Spirit, and the Spirit is God Himself, but when God became flesh, He passed through man and put on humanity
He also passed through burial in the tomb, resurrection, and even ascension, in which He received all the authority in heaven and on earth
When a person touches the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit brings him into the reality where he is able to touch God
When they touch the Holy Spirit, however, this spiritual reality will be in them, and resurrection will become real to them
In addition, incarnation, the cross, resurrection, ascension, the throne, authority, blessing, and the glory in the heavens are all real
Although there is truly a spiritual reality of all these matters, for finite man all of these matters are too far away
Whenever we touch the Holy Spirit, all these matters become real to us, because all these matters are real in the Holy Spirit
Because spiritual reality is in the Holy Spirit, in order for a person to have it, his human spirit has to touch the Holy Spirit
Spiritual reality depends on the Holy Spirit, and today this exceedingly rich Spirit is dwelling in our spirit
As long as we turn to our spirit, we will touch the Spirit who is God Himself and who contains all spiritual riches and reality
As long as we turn to our spirit our mind emotion and will spontaneously are put in second place and our spirit will have the first place
We will be able to contact and touch the Spirit of God in our spirit that we may touch the reality of the Holy Spirit
All the spiritual reality that we need can be received by us in this Spirit because all spiritual reality is in the Holy Spirit
Whenever we turn to our spirit and are in our spirit, we meet Him because He has been mingled with our spirit to become one spirit
If we do something from our soul we are doing it on our own but if we do something from our spirit we are doing it by being mingled with God
The strange thing is that year after year they do not appear to make any spiritual turns or spiritual progress
Outwardly it may seem that we are the ones who are praying, but actually we are cooperating with the Lord in prayer
What it speaks of is related to the matter of good and evil, and what it focuses on is whether the 'I' does good or evil
Chapter seven focuses on what we do-good or evil, whereas chapter eight focuses on who does it-the flesh or the spirit
We have to ask a further question: When she knelt down to pray, was she the one praying, or was it the Lord who was praying?
While she is saying this, however, within her there may be a voice saying, 'O Lord, look how disobedient this sister is'
On the deeper layer, however, we may have a feeling in our spirit that our situation is not good and that we need to pray for ourselves
The wonderful thing is that it is at this time that we have another feeling deep within us that we truly do not have any way
We must ask ourselves further whether it is we who pray or the Lord putting us on to pray and whether it is our soul or our spirit praying
The Christian living is not a living outside of the Lord, that is, a living in which we reject evil and do good by ourselves
In the first instance, the Spirit and life are connected together in the phrase, 'It is the Spirit who gives life'
In a sense, it is not God who mingles with and joins with man as one, but it is the Spirit who mingles with man as one
In this first step man touches God in the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God joins with man in the spirit of man
After our regeneration, we need to have spiritual experiences, make spiritual progress, live a spiritual living, and do spiritual work
Any time we do not live in such a spirit, regardless of whether we are right or wrong, we are not living a normal Christian life
The normal Christian life is not a matter of right and wrong but a matter of whether or not we are in the spirit
What matters is whether our morning watch, reading the Bible, and praying are in the spirit or outside of the spirit
If our morning watch, praying, and reading of the Bible are in the spirit, then this is the normal Christian life
In brief a Christian is one who lives in the spirit whereas a religious person does not live in the spirit but in a kind of religious ritual
Rather, you strictly observe religious regulations, read the Bible, and pray daily, living a life of Christian rituals
In other words, when we live in the spirit, we live in the realm of resurrection, and the death of the cross has an effect on us
Living in resurrection leads us to the experience of death on the one hand and the experience of ascension on the other
One who lives in resurrection will have the experience of death and ascension, so death is the fourth item, and ascension is the fifth item
In our spiritual experience, when we live in our spirit we sense the presence of the Lord as a kind of transcendency
In other words, when we live in our spirit, we live in resurrection, and when we live in resurrection, we touch spiritual reality
Any time we turn to live in our spirit, we are living in resurrection, and at that time we sense the presence of the Lord
In chapter six He said that it is the Spirit who gives life, and the words which He spoke are spirit and are life
In Romans 8 he said that by setting our mind on the spirit we touch life and that the mind set on the spirit is life
In 1 John 5 the apostle John even said, 'He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life'
We all know that God is the Spirit, that the Spirit is God, and that there is no difference between the Spirit and God
When He comes out of His sanctuary to reach and contact man, and when man worships and fellowships with Him, He is the Spirit
When God comes out and reaches man, He is the Spirit, and when the Spirit is received and touched by us, He is life
When God comes out to contact us, He is the Spirit, and when the Spirit is received and touched by us, He is life
Once we touch life, there will be four definite expressions, that is, four kinds of conditions or feelings that we will have
When you talk to a brother or pray with a sister, you will know whether this person's spirit is depressed or living
If their spirit is depressed, nothing will come out of them, and they will be unable to pray out their burdens
Throughout the whole day or the whole week they have been living not in their spirit but in their soul or even in their flesh
When people contact them in the Lord's table meetings and the prayer meetings, they find that they are inwardly deadened and depressed
If throughout the whole week or the whole day they learn to live in their spirit and to touch the spirit, they will surely touch life
The Spirit is God coming out to be touched by us, and life is the Spirit coming into us to be received and touched by us
Every time we turn to our spirit to touch the Spirit we touch life and once we touch life we are lifed that is we live and become strong
You feel as if you have fallen into a cave, an underground vault, or some place that is very dark and without any light or brightness
The reason that a person lacks brightness is not because he does not have life within but because he is not living in the Spirit
There was once a certain person who was stumbled because the usher arranged for him to sit under a fan in the meeting
The more living a person is, the stronger he is and the more life-energy he has, because life causes man to be strong
May the Lord have mercy on us to strengthen us that our expression may prove that we are living in spirit and in life
The living of some Christians is empty, dissatisfied, uneasy, uncomfortable, and rough, as if a hand were grasping them every day
When we touch the Holy Spirit inwardly and experience the Holy Spirit, He becomes our spiritual life and our spiritual living
He has morning watch, reads the Bible, prays, acts carefully and cautiously, and does not get puffed up or irritated
After the first hymn, due to his nervousness and considerations, all the opportunities for prayer are taken away
There are some people who are always thinking of other brothers and sisters and who want to have more fellowship with them
For others, it is inconvenient to go to visit people, but for them it is miserable to be unable to go to visit people
Although this kind of living would eliminate cultivated behavior, it would result in an unruly kind of living, which would be even worse
On the one hand, if we fellowship with people and visit them wherever they are, others will say that this is the zeal of the flesh
On the other hand, if we stop all our activities and do none of these things, others will say that we are loose
God as the Spirit comes to contact us, and when the Spirit enters into us to be touched and experienced by us, He becomes our spiritual life
We are all familiar with these verses, and we often say that the Lord is our life and that once we touch the Lord, we touch life
According to the revelation in the Scriptures, we see that God causes us to receive His life through Christ, in whom is life
When we receive Christ in the Holy Spirit, we receive life, and when we touch Christ in the Holy Spirit, we touch life
Specifically, life is in the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit enables us to receive life, touch life, and experience life
We must realize that we cannot touch the Spirit by thinking in our mind, feeling with our emotion, or deciding in our will
On the other level you develop the internal strength that enables you to hit the crucial point of your opponent with a fist
Some people, however, may not speak much, and their words may be simple, but their words can enter into your deepest part
It is because those words came from their inner being, their spirit, which is deeper than their mind, emotion, and will
The prayers of some Christians are similar to the reciting of The Three-Character Classic or the Book of Family Names
When we pray from the deepest part of our being, we spontaneously touch the intention of God and cooperate with Him outwardly in action
For this reason, we need to have our mind, emotion, and will broken so that we may enter into our innermost part to pray
The more we pray, the more our spirit will be stirred up, and the more we pray, the more our spirit will be burning
Those who truly know the Lord's salvation and live in spiritual reality by the grace of God have their living mingled together with God
It is generally acknowledged that those who have a religious living are nobler than those who merely have an ethical living
There is no spiritual element or flavor in an ethical and religious living because there is no spiritual reality or weight in it
We do not act loosely but are ethical toward our relatives, colleagues, classmates, and the saints in the church
We have the thought that since we are upright people who believe in the Lord, our living should be proper, regulated, careful, and serious
From this we see that in our living there is more or less some flavor of God, something that issues from the help of God
How many of the proper upright and even ethical things that we do throughout the day are produced by our spirit touching the Spirit of God
What will come forth will not be merely an ethical living or a spiritual living but a spiritual living that includes an ethical living
Their sympathy and love toward others are merely their own sympathy and love and do not come from touching the Spirit of God
For the majority of Christians, praying before meals is merely part of a religious living, because in their prayers they do not touch God
If we are not moved in the spirit, then our outward gospel preaching is a religious ritual; it is an aspect of the religious living
If our spirit does not touch the Spirit, then even our coming to the meetings may be an aspect of a religious living
While the unbelievers watch television or play mah-jongg after work, we Christians rush to the meeting hall to attend meetings
We can live out these two kinds of living without fellowshipping with God, without the Spirit of God, and without the exercise of our spirit
A normal, genuine, and spiritual Christian living is the issue of the spirit of man touching the Spirit of God
After we are saved and begin to live a spiritual living, we may encounter some problems and may be unaccustomed to a spiritual living
Gradually, however, we will begin to learn not to live by ourselves but to turn to our spirit and to think of God in our living
We need to be enlightened and saved to see that the most detestable matter concerning us is not the fact that we still sin or love the world
When we live by the spirit, the Spirit of God is living, strong, and powerful, but we still may not fully submit to Him
He may require us to deny our self, to come out of our flesh, to turn to our spirit, and to submit to the feeling in our spirit
The feeling in his spirit was requiring him to put his friend aside, but emotionally he was absolutely unwilling to put him aside
When this happens, the living that we live out will not be merely an ethical or religious living but a spiritual living
When we have this living, we will live in the spirit, have spiritual reality, and live a life of mingling with God
Our problem is that it is not easy for us to turn from the outward to the inward, that is, from our soul to our spirit
When we turn from our soul to our spirit, we will touch the Spirit of God in our spirit and will have some feeling within
The main reason we do not always have light within and are often confused, unclear, and darkened is that we do not turn to our spirit
If we are willing to turn to our spirit, our inner being will be enlightened, and our understanding will be opened
We will be able to touch God's feeling regarding our future, our job, our conduct, and our management of the affairs of the church
The reason why they become more confused the more they pray is because they are so accustomed to living in their soul
If there is no light in the theater and everything is dark, although the veil may be lifted, we still will not see the scenery
Revelation is the unveiling of a certain thing, shining is what enables the eyes to see, and the result of seeing is a vision
These people have the riches of God in their spirit, and when they live in their spirit, they have light and life
In this way, day by day they are those who live in the spirit, who live in God, and who are filled unto all the fullness of God
A person who pursues the Lord should not serve the Lord according to his natural feeling, his natural insight, or his natural view
Saul of Tarsus was one who served God fervently, but he served God in a natural way, not according to revelation
They are pursuing for their own interests and by their own inclination, without any revelation, seeing, or vision
Their pursuit is a waste of effort because they have not pursued what they should pursue and have not obtained what they should obtain
The first mention of man in the Bible is in Genesis 1, which speaks of how man was created in the image of God
In the beginning God created man in His image and made man just like Him because His intention is that man would be a vessel to contain Him
The last mention of man in the Bible is in Revelation 21, which describes the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth
Man is called the New Jerusalem; second, he is called the wife of the Lamb; and third, man is the tabernacle of God in which God dwells
The tabernacle in the wilderness was mobile, but when it became the temple in the land of Canaan, it became stationary
Although the New Jerusalem is a city, it is the dwelling place of God among men throughout the ages and is typified by the tabernacle
Before He went away He was with the disciples by being in their midst but when He came back He would be with the disciples by being in them
Romans 8 clearly reveals that Christ's being in man is not only God's being in man but also the Spirit of God's being in man
Ephesians 3 shows us that Christ makes His home in our hearts through faith that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God
If the inside of the house is not too messy we can simply move in but if it is messy then we must put things in order before we can move in
If we listen to messages and attend special meetings, yet God does not enter into us, all of these things are futile
The most important matter in our Christian life is that God would be brought into us so that He would enter into us to gain a dwelling place
Whenever we disregard our mind, ignore our thoughts, and use our deepest part to touch God and to pray to God, we are filled with God
May God be gracious to us that we may despise all other matters and simply seek to be joined and mingled with God in spirit
After you pray, you must discern what your inner condition is and then decide whether or not you should go to a brother for fellowship
If you do not pray before you go to other people for fellowship, your inner being certainly will not be satisfied
We must realize that God's work of breaking and tearing down in us who have received mercy is to deal with our mind, emotion, and will
When we pursue God, He works in our spirit and requires us to submit to the ruling of the spirit and the demand of the spirit
He can easily sympathize with people, being full of love, yet we will find that his emotion is also controlled by the spirit
We need this kind of spiritual reality so that our mind, emotion, and will may all be subdued to live under the spirit
For us to allow the Lord to mingle with our inner man, our spirit, we first need to see that it is useless for us to only know teachings
We may have heard the teaching of living in the spirit several times, even to the point where we are able to speak it to people
Conversely, sometimes there is an inclination in our mind, emotion, and will, but our innermost part, our spirit, has no peace
God knows that it is only through endless smiting that our mind, emotion, and will can be subdued and controlled by the spirit
Through this kind of mutual encouragement, everyone will desire to live in the spirit and enter into a deeper union with the Lord
To merely see that we are sinners is too shallow, and to merely see that our sins have been forgiven is too superficial
We must see that God's intention is to come into us and that within us we have a spirit as a vessel to receive Him
We will be joined to Him in our spirit and will no longer live in our mind, emotion, and will but in our spirit
Romans 8:9 says that since the Spirit of God dwells in us, we are in the spirit, and therefore, we are of Christ
Only when we know the principles of incarnation and of death and resurrection can we know Christ in a thorough way
Not only was the birth of the Lord Jesus incarnation, but every time someone is saved, that is also incarnation
God entering into man and man entering into God are the two principles concerning Christ, the two stories of Christ
Through incarnation and through death and resurrection, He accomplished and passed through what He had to accomplish and pass through
The work that God wants to do is to work Himself into man and man into Himself, so that God and man, man and God, would be mingled as one
As saved ones we all have God mingled with us, and we have the assurance to say that God has entered into us and is touching us all the time
All the saved ones have the feeling that God is in them, but some may have a weaker feeling, and others may have a stronger feeling
Even though he may not be able to explain it, within him there is a mystery, a story, which only he himself is able to feel
We already know that we all have the principle of coming that is the principle of incarnation in us but do we have the principle of going
When we are joined to Him, we are joined to His death and resurrection, so we also have the principle of death and resurrection
Objectively, we have died and were resurrected, but subjectively, we have not completely died and been resurrected
From the time of our salvation, our experience, progress, and spiritual story depend on the principle of death and resurrection
These are also our stories-the stories of incarnation and of death and resurrection, of God entering into man and man entering into God
We have already said that for us to know Christ, we must know His death and resurrection and the power of His resurrection
Through His incarnation He brought God into man, and through His death and resurrection He brought man into God
Through His death and resurrection Christ brought man completely into God, just as His incarnation brought God completely into man
Through His incarnation and through death and resurrection, God and man, man and God, were fully mingled as one
From the day of our salvation, God's work in us has been to bring our humanity into divinity, to bring us into God
The Lord Jesus died and resurrected, and through His death and resurrection He brought the man that He had put on into the realm of God
We need the light and the revelation of the Holy Spirit to see these matters of incarnation and of death and resurrection
In the Gospels the Lord told people again and again who the 'Son of Man' was and what the 'Son of Man' had come for
Only once, when He was transfigured on the mountain, did He fully manifest the condition of God within Him before the disciples
While the Lord Jesus was on the earth, the life He lived was exactly the same as ours, except that He was without sin
Most of us live out the human life by our humanity, but because He was God coming into man, our Lord lived a human life by His divinity
They all lived the human life, but Peter and John lived a human life as men, and Jesus the Nazarene lived a human life as God
Although the Lord lived a human life on the earth, He spontaneously expressed His divinity and manifested His divine nature
In His death and resurrection the Lord Jesus did not put off the humanity that had restricted, bound, and limited Him
Before His resurrection this man had been finite, but through His death and resurrection this man became infinite
God is infinite and eternal, but the man the Lord Jesus put on, before entering into death, was a finite and limited man
After the Lord Jesus passed through death and entered into resurrection, the man He had put on became eternal and infinite
In His incarnation the Lord Jesus appeared as the Son of Man, but after His death and resurrection He appeared as the Son of God
In His incarnation He appeared as a man in the midst of men, but after His resurrection He appeared as God among men
Just as He lived a human life that was different from mans living so also He lived Gods life in a way that was different from Gods living
Similarly, after His resurrection, although He lived God's life, He was different from the God before incarnation, death, and resurrection
The God whom He expressed at that time was very different from the God whom He had expressed before incarnation
When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He lived a human life in which the divinity that was in Him was expressed spontaneously
Incarnation is God becoming the content of man, and death and resurrection are man becoming the content of God
Incarnation is for God to become man to live out a human life while death and resurrection are for man to become God to live out God's life
Pauls speaking was Gods speaking Peters speaking was Gods speaking James speaking was Gods speaking and Johns speaking was Gods speaking
Seemingly, He was not reasonable, overturning the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who were selling doves
In the past we were not in God, nor did we have the element of God, but now we are in God and have the element of God
Most of God's children have heard many messages and have much in the way of knowledge and doctrines but have not touched this reality
Now due to Christ's redemption all of these things have been taken away, and the element of God has been added into us
Before we were saved, we all sinned, but when we were saved, God was added into us, and as a result we are no longer slaves of sin
Though all of us have had God added into us, our lives still have different flavors because we as men have not been nullified
In eternity future God will see many different faces with many different personalities and kinds of humanity joined as one in His divinity
In the past, regardless of whether we were sinful or not sinful, good or bad, we did not have the element of God in us
After passing through death and resurrection, his stubbornness may still be there, but there will be the flavor of God in his stubbornness
What a glory it will be to Him when all of us different people are in our great God and are living out His image and His flavor!
Where there is the Lord's cross, there is the Lord's death, and whoever has the Lord's death has the Lord's cross
Before passing through the cross, He was in the flesh; after passing through the cross and entering into resurrection, He became the Spirit
The Lord's flesh was not the resurrection, but when He became the Spirit, His whole being became the resurrection
Everything of resurrection is in the Holy Spirit, and everything that is in resurrection can come into us in the Holy Spirit
The Lord's resurrection is altogether realized in the Holy Spirit, and the resurrected Lord is the Holy Spirit
After Christ's death and resurrection, the Spirit of God became Christ's seven eyes, which observe the whole universe, the whole earth
After Christ passed through death, resurrection, and then ascension, He stood in the midst of the throne and the four living creatures
The resurrected Christ put Himself into man and became the Holy Spirit so that man could contact and receive Him
In Revelation the number seven describes the function of the Holy Spirit, indicating that the function of the Holy Spirit is complete
The resurrected and ascended Christ has become the Holy Spirit, and through the Holy Spirit He looks at man's inner being and comes into man
Due to the lack of light, in the past we thought we knew about resurrection, when actually we did not know about it
When we receive Christ's death, we receive Christ's cross, and when we live in the Holy Spirit, we live in resurrection
In short, the Lord's death is the cross, that is, the Lord's cross is death, and the Lord's Spirit is resurrection
Just as the cross is the reality of the Lord's death, so also the Holy Spirit has become the reality of resurrection
Without knowing the Holy Spirit, our talk about resurrection is vain, because the Holy Spirit is the reality of resurrection
The Holy Spirit as the embodiment of the resurrected Christ is the descending of the glorified and resurrected Christ
He may immediately feel that he is a sinner, even a worthless sinner, yet God is willing to visit him with His own eyes
After He looks at us, He enlightens us; after He enlightens us, He burns us; and after He burns us, the Holy Spirit comes into us
When the Holy Spirit touches our spirit, contacts our spirit, and meets with our spirit, there is an issue-spiritual reality
Our experience of death and resurrection may last for only one day or only half a day before we turn back to our flesh
In terms of our experience we do not have a solution to this problem because in this age we still have the flesh and the old creation in us
When we turn back and live in the flesh and the self, we immediately sense that we should live in resurrection
In brief, most of us may be living in our self, our soul, being motivated and directed by our mind, emotion, and will
Our mind thinks by itself, our emotion loves by itself, and our will makes decisions by itself, and as a result we live in our flesh
We may wish to stay in the spirit all the time, but most of the time we enter into the spirit and then leave it again
When we kneel down to pray, we enter into the spirit, but when we rise up and contact people, we leave our spirit again
The principle that we must apply in our work, our service, our living, and our experience is not incarnation but death and resurrection
The principle of rapture in transfiguration is still death and resurrection, that is, to enter fully and completely into God
Question: If we say that God saves us that He may live in us, then what is the purpose of reading the Bible and praying?
Answer: The purpose of all our activities-whether reading the Bible, praying, meeting, or preaching the gospel-is for God to live in us
At the time of our salvation, we received all of God's riches, but now the big question is how to know and experience these riches
We have already received the riches but when we have more experiences then we will have the feeling of being filled with all of Gods riches
All these writings are the Word of God and the moving of the Holy Spirit, and all of them came out of the Holy Spirit
Answer: In order to see the distinction between the soul and the spirit, we must realize that the soul is the mind, emotion, and will
We should allow this sense to direct our mind, emotion, and will so that they do not take the first place but the second place in our living
In other words, our spirit should have the first place in our living, directing our soul-our mind, emotion, and will
In short, our soul is the totality of our mind, emotion, and will, and our spirit is the sense of our innermost part
Answer: When we were saved, the Spirit of God looked at us and shined into us, and at that point the Holy Spirit entered into us
After our salvation, God's eyes still look at us continuously, again and again, from the outside in and from the inside out
Sometimes we sense that the heavenly eyes are looking at us, and other times we sense that He is looking from within us
Question: Concerning the experience of death and resurrection, how is man's personality brought into God through the Spirit of God?
Answer: This question, in fact, does not require any analysis because the more you analyze, the more confusion there will be
One thing is certain-all our defilement, sins, worldliness, and corrupted nature cannot be brought into resurrection
Originally, our soul was merely our mind, emotion, and will, but now our soul is being mingled with the Spirit of God
It is not until we are raptured that the Holy Spirit will operate in our entire body, causing our body to be changed into a glorious body
Question: It is easy for our emotion to submit to the Holy Spirit, but it is not that easy for our mind to submit
Answer: If it is easy for your emotion and will to submit to the Holy Spirit but not your mind, this may be your own particular problem
If it comes merely from your mind, you have to stop it, but if it comes from the feeling of your spirit, you have to submit to it
You have to wait until there is the motivation in your spirit for you to love that brother, and then your emotion has to cooperate with it
If there is another brother whom you like in your emotion, but your spirit forbids you to like him, will you listen to your spirit?
Regarding the second brother, your spirit forbids you within and does not allow you to use your emotion, but you choose to
Resurrection is not something objective and vague because resurrection is the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is the reality of resurrection
After the Lord's death, resurrection, and ascension, the Holy Spirit descended from the resurrected Christ in the heavens
After the Lord's resurrection and ascension, the Holy Spirit descended from heaven, having passed through death and resurrection
At that time the Spirit of God had only the divine element of God, not the human element of man or the element of resurrection
Never think that God is merely God, the Holy Spirit of God is merely the Holy Spirit of God, and the two are separate
We can say that the table is the table, and we can also say that the table is wood because the essence of the table is wood
They reason that if the Holy Spirit and God were one entity, not two, then God could not have sent the Holy Spirit
That place is much more severe than the furnace of fire in Daniel 3, where men were slain even at a distance from it
When the Spirit of God came out in the Old Testament, He did not have the elements of humanity and resurrection
In other words, the Spirit in the Old Testament age was solely the Spirit of God, not the Spirit of death and resurrection
Consequently, the Spirit of God now has the divinity of God, the humanity of man, and the elements of death, resurrection, and ascension
They think that the Holy Spirit after the Lord's resurrection and ascension is the same as the Spirit in the Old Testament age
Now after the Lord's incarnation, death, resurrection, and ascension, this One who is in heaven is not that simple
Because of His incarnation, death, resurrection, and ascension, He now has other elements in Him and is no longer merely God but a God-man
In the Old Testament age the Spirit was simple, but in the New Testament age the Holy Spirit is not that simple
As a result, we may see that we have been resurrected together with Christ and are ascended together with Christ
For many years after our salvation, we may live merely in this empty doctrine because we may only believe and say what the Bible says
Today the question is not whether we have ascended to the heavens but whether the Holy Spirit has entered into us
Not only is all that God has in the Holy Spirit, but all that God has passed through and attained are also in the Holy Spirit
It is impossible to find something that God has, is, has passed through, has accomplished, or has attained that is not in the Holy Spirit
If we are not experiencing the death of the cross, we are not living in the Spirit, because the death of the cross is in the Spirit
Once we are filled with the Holy Spirit and live in the Holy Spirit, we will sense that we are living in the heavens
It is not we who have ascended to the heavens, but it is the heavens that have come into us, because the heavens are in the Holy Spirit
In the past we thought that the matter of resurrection was objective and vague and that there was no way for us to touch or comprehend it
Romans 8:16 in the Chinese Union Version reads, 'The Holy Spirit Himself witnesses with our heart that we are children of God'
When you have a grudge against a certain brother or sister, there may be something in you demanding that you be at peace with him or her
When we live in resurrection in this way, we will sense the presence of God, and we will sense that we have touched God
When we live in resurrection, we will have the clear sense that we are heavenly and that we are in the heavenly realm
Where there is the Holy Spirit, there is resurrection, and where there is the Holy Spirit, there is God and the taste of heaven
If all the responsible brothers in the different churches would learn to live in the spirit, they would absolutely be in one accord
When the brothers are in the mind, emotion, and will, the best they can do is to refrain from quarreling or talking to one another
We all know that our spirit is deeper than our mind, emotion, and will and that many times it is contrary to our mind, emotion, and will
Our mind, emotion, and will comprise everything that is of us-our views, our ideas, our opinions, our thinking, and our likes
If our mind, emotion, and will are under the ruling of the spirit, we will be in resurrection, and we will touch resurrection
Paul said, 'To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
May the Lord be gracious to us that by His grace we would live in the spirit in resurrection and see that all the spiritual riches are ours
May the Lord open our eyes to see how subjective resurrection is in the Holy Spirit and how practical resurrection is in us
When we touch the Holy Spirit we live in resurrection and only when we are living in resurrection will we have various spiritual experiences
Most Bible readers know that death is closely connected to resurrection and that resurrection is closely followed by ascension
Romans 6 speaks particularly about the death of Christ, but when Christ's death is mentioned, resurrection is also mentioned
Verse 5 says For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection
It is the Spirit of resurrection who raised us up and who not only resurrected our spirit but also brought our whole being into the spirit
We have to see that Romans 8 talks about the Holy Spirit and resurrection and that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of resurrection
If we touch Christ's death, we are in Romans 6, and at the same time, we are also in the resurrection in Romans 8
We cannot find a place in the entire New Testament that mentions only ascension without mentioning resurrection
Ascension is not a particular topic in the New Testament, but resurrection is, and resurrection is connected to ascension
Although their testimony was a testimony of resurrection, no other book in the New Testament talks about ascension more clearly than Acts
In Acts 2 we see how the apostle Peter mentioned the matter of ascension, the whole story of ascension, and the condition of ascension
Ascension is not its own topic, but resurrection is its own topic, and ascension is a section within the topic of resurrection
We clearly see that where there is resurrection, there is ascension and that it is impossible to have resurrection without ascension
The Bible mentions many times that the Lord is God, man, and resurrection, but it does not say that the Lord is ascension
Before the incarnation God was God, having no human element, but after His incarnation the story of His being God and man began in Bethlehem
Before the Lord's resurrection He had the resurrection life and power within Him, but He had not yet accomplished the matter of resurrection
In chapter twelve He said that unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies it abides alone but if it dies it bears much fruit
It is not until the seed is planted into the ground and grows out from the ground that resurrection is accomplished
Before the seed is planted into the ground, it has the life of resurrection, but it does not have the resurrection of life
It is only after the seed is planted into the ground and grows out that it has both the life of resurrection and the resurrection of life
After He was raised from the dead, the element of resurrection was added into Him in addition to His divine and human elements
At that point, God had already worked Himself into man, accomplishing the purpose of mingling Himself with man
In other words, incarnation put God in the same position as man, but God and man, man and God, had not been fully mingled together
When you were saved, your salvation was in the principle of incarnation, which is the bringing of God into man
Strictly speaking, according to the principle of incarnation, in our salvation God and man were not mingled together
In His thirty-three and a half years of human living, the Lord Jesus was God who had put on man and was living a human life on the earth
On the other side, the last three and a half years of the Lord's living were truly a living of the mingling of God and man
The incarnation of the Lord brought God into man, but He had not yet died and resurrected and had not yet brought man into God
It was not until the day when man had the element of resurrection that man and God, God and man, were mingled as one
There are the three main elements in the Holy Spirit-the divine element, the human element, and the element of resurrection
When the Holy Spirit enters into us, He brings God into us, and He also mingles into us the human element, Christ's resurrected humanity
All these elements have entered into us through the Holy Spirit that we may be mingled with God in resurrection
When you contact someone who is living in the Holy Spirit and is filled with the Holy Spirit, you will sense the flavor of God
A person who is genuinely filled with the Holy Spirit has the flavor of God, the flavor of man, and the flavor of resurrection
In other words, the death that comes from Adam causes us to perish, but the death that comes from Christ causes us to receive life
The death in Genesis 2 is a negative death, a perishing death, but the death in Romans 6 is a positive death, a life-receiving death
We can see that a person who is in resurrection surely has two signs-the sign of death and the sign of the heavens
In other words, a person who is in resurrection has the death of the cross as a mark and the condition of the heavens as a sign
Death delivers us from the old creation the world and everything that is of manwhich is corrupted fallen of human affection and fleshly
Paul said that he wanted to know the resurrection of Christ , but he did not say that he wanted to know Christ's death or ascension
As long as he knew resurrection, he would be able to experience death and ascension, because death and ascension are in resurrection
In another story, a brother testified that from the time he was saved, he became a completely different person in the Holy Spirit
Later he changed himself by talking in a softer voice and doing things in a slower way, seemingly becoming a different person
Even the prayer of confession, if it is not in the spirit, may not be profitable, because many times it is the soul that is functioning
They are very zealous, they attend every meeting, and they pray long prayers in every meeting, but they cannot touch their spirit
Rather, we must learn to cease from our emotion, from all the imaginary thoughts in our mind, and from all our high thoughts about ourselves
One is our need for the experience of life, and the other is our need for the revelation of the truth in the Scriptures
If we lack either of these two aspects, it will be difficult for us to have the knowledge of life and the growth in life
Most Christians who read the Bible confess that the Bible is consistent from beginning to end and has a unique subject
Although they acknowledge this fact, they often do not agree on what the unique subject and the consistent line are
At the end of the Bible, at the end of Revelation, we see the completion of God's work in man, in which man is exactly the same as God
The first three chapters speak of Christ being in the church, and chapters four through twenty-two speak of God being in the universe
The first section shows us that Christ is in the midst of the lampstands, and the second section shows us that God is in the universe
God chose us, predestinated us, and called us for the purpose that we would be conformed to the image of His Son
At the end of Revelation, we see that all God's redeemed people are like jasper stone, being exactly the same as the image of God
From beginning to end God works in us to fulfill this unique purpose-to make every one of us the same as He is
Colossians 115 says that the Lord Jesus is the image of the invisible God and Hebrews 13 tells us that He is the impress of Gods substance
The image and the life of God are in His Son; thus, God, who wants us to also be His sons, requires the same of us
On the one hand, He works in us that we may have His image, and on the other hand, He causes us to have His life
The jasper God becomes the center of the jasper city, and the jasper city becomes the perimeter of the jasper God
The jasper God is in the center, the jasper city is the perimeter, and the glory of God shines forth through the city
When we touch this matter, the whole Bible is linked together, and all the spiritual experiences are also linked together
For man to be the same as God in nature, appearance, radiance, and color, he must allow God's life to enter into him
In Genesis 2, however, the Adam who was created by God and who was in the garden of Eden was a man of clay, a muddy man
Although the 'clay Adam' in the garden of Eden was good, the gold, bdellium , and precious stones were outside of him and were not in him
God put Adam in front of the tree of life because He wanted Adam to eat of the tree of life and receive it into him
Chapter twenty-two mentions the throne of God again, saying that there is a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God
From the tree of life flowed a river that had four branches flowing in four directions-east, west, north, and south
The materials of the city are pure gold, pearl, and precious stones, which are the same materials in the river in Genesis
In other words, if man had touched the tree of life in Genesis 2, he surely would have touched the river of life
If man wanted to touch the tree of life in chapter three, he would have touched the flame that burns and kills man
From the throne of God proceeds a river that is sometimes the water of life that gives life and sometimes a flame that burns and kills
When this fire is cast into man, it burns in man and gives rise to conflicts among the believing and unbelieving relatives
On the day that the Holy Spirit was poured out in the house where the disciples were gathered, what the disciples saw was not water but fire
Revelation 4:5 mentions that there are seven lamps of fire before the throne and that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God
Chapter twenty-two again speaks of the throne and the river of water of life, bright as crystal, which proceeds out of the throne
When He flows to man, He is the Spirit, and when He flows into man and is received and touched by man, He is life
When this river, which is the Spirit of God or the life of God, flows out, it is sometimes water and sometimes fire
At the end of Revelation, in chapters twenty-one and twenty-two, after Satan is terminated, this river is also a river of water
Apparently, wherever Satan is, this flow of life is fire, and wherever Satan is not, this flow of life is water
After Revelation 21:8 there is no further mention of fire because Satan, death, and Hades have already been cast into the lake of fire
It is through the flow of the water of life that the content, color, radiance, appearance, and nature of God's life can enter into man
Due to man's fall, Satan brought in the world, sin, the flesh, and many things that belong to him and that oppose God
Why does Luke 12 say that when the Lord's fire is kindled in us, we will experience emotional conflict with our relatives?
Our relatives will have a negative feeling toward us because we do not love the world or enjoy the pleasures of sin with them
On the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit was poured out like a hard rain, but the disciples described it as fire
The Spirit is one, and this life also is one, but in the matter of supplying, this life is sometimes like water and sometimes like fire
Among all these prayers, the two prayers in Ephesians can be said to be the most practical and complete prayers in the New Testament
There is no other passage like Ephesians 1 that is able to tell us in such a precise and complete way what God has accomplished in Christ
There are many Christians who are able to recite the Lord's prayer but who do not have any understanding of the apostle's prayers
They often recite the Lord's prayer, but they do not care for these two prayers which are of the highest spiritual standard
The emphasis of the first prayer is on revelation and seeing, and the emphasis of the second prayer is on experience and enjoyment
These two prayers touch the same matter, which is the mysterious God in Christ working out an exceedingly great mystery in us
God and we, we and God, will be completely mingled together, and we will be filled unto all the fullness of God
The first one is regarding revelation for our seeing, and the second is regarding experience for our enjoyment
The reason is that we are short of spiritual wisdom, and our mind is not exercised enough and is not experienced in spiritual matters
When you talk about business trade with some brothers, they can fully understand you, even if you mention only a few words
They are able to say things in a more precise, concise, and thorough way because their minds are experienced in business
From Ephesians we know that the church is something very high and that the procedure through which the church was produced is marvelous
Christ's resurrection, ascension, transcending over all things, and being Head over all things are all for the church
If we do not see that resurrection was the realm in which the church was produced, we cannot understand the prayer in Ephesians 1
At the end of the prayer there is something mystical-the fullness of the One who fills all in all, which is the church
It was after Christ's resurrection, ascension, transcending over all things, and becoming the Head over all things that a mystery emerged
When we live in the Spirit, we live in resurrection, and only when we live in resurrection can we have the service of the church
If we draw the conclusion that this is the service of the church merely because of the outward condition, we are still inexperienced
We know that in order to ascertain whether something is gold, it is not sufficient to merely observe the outward color
If they do these things in the spirit, then in that place there will be the church and the service of the church
If they do these things outside of the spirit, then in that place there will not be the church or the service of the church
After you praise him some more, he comes again before two o'clock on the third day, and he feels happy and sweet
Unfortunately, a few days later, due to something improper in his service, he receives some adjusting that touches his inward feeling
Not only does he come very late on the next day, but he disappears on the third day, and eventually he does not come anymore
A person may be able to shut his mouth for today and tomorrow, but two days later, he will not be able to shut his mouth any longer
It is impossible to be one in the natural man, and there is no way to find oneness in the flesh and in the old creation
If all of us would feel in our spirit, speak in our spirit, observe in our spirit, and taste in our spirit, we would have the sweet oneness
After it is planted into the ground, dies, and resurrects, what comes forth is unconfined, big in shape, and green in color
We are not saying that our mind is useless but that our mind, like a seed, has to be put to death and then to live again
If the steel is well-refined, it can be made into different kinds of springs for watches, being firm and at the same time pliable
After the steel is refined by fire and passes through hammering and high pressure, it is no longer crude steel but wrought steel
If your thoughts and mind are something that God wants, after you have put them to death, God will surely raise them up
When we are serving together with the saints, if our mind and ideas come out quickly, we have to reject them immediately
Again and again we have to learn to put our natural mind, emotion, and will aside, reject and deny them, and turn to the spirit
Once we turn to the spirit, we will touch the Holy Spirit, and once we touch the Holy Spirit, we will touch resurrection
When we are in the spirit and in resurrection, the ascended Christ whom we know in our spirit becomes the indwelling Christ
In other words the Body of Christ is the mingling of God and man and when man is filled unto the fullness of God this is the Body of Christ
Whether a person is a member of the Body of Christ, a part of the Body, all depends on whether he has God mingled with him
If he does not have God mingled with him, though he may be saved, he is still not a part of the Body of Christ in reality
When we 'airplanes' take off, we often either scratch the paint or break the fuselage because we are too close to the earth
There is much bitterness and complaining in us because we are not in resurrection, in ascension, and far above all things
Whereas the first man is earthy, belonging to the earth, the second man is out of heaven and is 'resurrectionly' and heavenly
When we live in the second man, we live in resurrection, and when we live in resurrection, we live in the heavens
May God be merciful to us and open our eyes to see that all these spiritual truths are not doctrines or things that are abstract and distant
If we live in resurrection we will have the reality and if we live in the Holy Spirit this reality will be expressed through us practically
According to the two prayers of Paul in Ephesians, the Lord has already given us the revelation to see these divine and spiritual riches
The Body of Christ which is spiritual heavenly resurrectionly and far above all things and which is the mingling of God and man is expressed
