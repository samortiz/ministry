<P>Second, upon the sockets there were forty-eight standing boards plus four pillars in the front. Each of the forty-eight boards stood on two sockets, so there were ninety-six sockets for the forty-eight boards and four sockets for the four pillars. The standing boards became the walls of the tabernacle. A curtain hanging over the boards became the ceiling of the tabernacle. Above the ceiling there were three more layers of covering which were the roof.</P><P>In the second section, the ark was placed into the tabernacle, and into the ark were placed the two tablets of the Ten Commandments, which are called the tablets of the testimony, the pot with the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded. The ark was then covered with a lid, which the King James Version translates into mercy seat but which is better rendered propitiation cover. Two cherubim were upon this covering. The ark was put within the tabernacle and the veils were hung in place. This is the second section.</P><P>Then the table for the showbread was brought in and put on the north side of the tabernacle. This was to display the bread. Afterwards the lampstand was put on the south side of the tabernacle opposite the showbread table. This was the fourth section. Then the incense altar was placed in the middle of a triangle formed by the showbread table, the lampstand, and the ark. The sweet incense was burned upon the incense altar to please God. Finally the curtains were hung to close the entrance. This was the fifth section and completed the tabernacle on the inside.</P><P>In the sixth section an altar was set up. This was an altar for the burnt offering which was in the front of the court. Finally a laver was set up to wash the hands and feet of all the priests. All these things were done according to what Jehovah had commanded Moses. Once these things were finished God descended in His glory, first to overshadow the entire tabernacle, and second to enter into the tabernacle and fill it with His visible glory (Exo. 40:34) God was manifested in the tabernacle to make it the expression of God among His people on the earth.</P>
