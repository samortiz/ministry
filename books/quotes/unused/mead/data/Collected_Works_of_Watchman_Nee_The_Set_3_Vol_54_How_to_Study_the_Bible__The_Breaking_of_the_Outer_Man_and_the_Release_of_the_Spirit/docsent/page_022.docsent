   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 "They Removed the Roof"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Mark 2 records four men carrying a paralytic to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being unable to bring him to the Lord because of the crowd, they removed the roof where He was, and lowered the paralytic to the Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should have an impression of this picture.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people were surrounding the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was quite busy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But now another group lowered a paralytic from the roof!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should realize that the Lord was not just busy; He was also speaking in a borrowed place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the roof was removed, it had to be patched later.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What trouble this was!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the Lord did not say, "Do not do this again."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead He was happy that someone would come to Him with such a big demand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It seems that the bigger the demand was, the happier He felt.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows us what kind of Lord He is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do not have a clear impression of what the Lord has done, how can we say that we know Him?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3 "Jesus, Son of David, Have Mercy on Me!"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the Lord was traveling, Bartimaeus cried out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Mark 10:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many people rebuked him and tried to silence him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But he cried out much more.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus was not particularly fond of noise and excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Matthew 12:19 says, "He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was what the Lord Jesus was like.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But here was a man crying out in a loud way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He wanted the Lord to have mercy on him, and the Lord healed him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord is happy to see men asking great things from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He wants men to open their mouths wide.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is happy to give grace in abounding measure.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>4 "Even the Little Dogs Eat of the Crumbs</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Which Fall from Their Masters' Table"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The story of the Canaanite woman gives us a clear picture of this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The bread was for the children.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet she said, "Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table" Matt 15:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was a request that she had no right to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the Lord likes to see men asking Him in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He not only granted the request and healed her daughter, but He praised her for her great faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can find many examples like these in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we form the proper impressions of these things, we will know the Lord's heart through them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>5 "I Believe; Help My Unbelief!"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After the Lord came down from the Mount of Transfiguration, a father brought his demon-possessed son to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord first rebuked the man Mark 9:14-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He did not rebuke the leper who came to Him, and He did not rebuke the paralytic whose friends removed the roof.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They were all presumptuous, yet the Lord Jesus was happy with what they did.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But here the father first brought his sick son to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When they could not heal him, he brought him to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord asked the father, "How long has this been happening to him?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He answered, "From childhood.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>And it has often thrown him both into fire and into water to destroy him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He came to the Lord for healing, but he was not sure if the Lord could heal.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He said, "If You can do anything."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord picked up his words and said, "If You can."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Following this, He said, "All things are possible to him who believes."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord seemed to be saying, "Why are you asking if I can?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You should realize that all things are possible to him who believes!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not a matter of whether or not I can, but of whether you believe."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to visualize the situation at that moment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The man came halfheartedly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He intended to come to the Lord, but he did not have the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He did not fully trust in the Lord's healing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In pleading for His mercy, he qualified his prayer with the words, "If You can."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord rebuked this word severely.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is not pleased when men ask Him for less.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is not afraid when men say to Him, "You have to do it whether or not You are willing."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But the father did not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In effect he was saying, "If You can do it, do it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If You cannot do it, so be it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Your disciples could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I will not press for anything if You cannot do it either."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord rebuked him, saying, "You say, If You can.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All things are possible to him who believes" v. 23 . When the Lord said this, the father, "crying out...said, I believe; help my unbelief!" v. 24 . As soon as he was rebuked and his mistake was exposed, he turned and believed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He put all the responsibility on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is a beautiful picture!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The higher a man's demand is, the more the Lord is pleased with it.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The less a man asks for, the less the Lord is pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have to be a tender person and allow the Lord to impress these things upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Once we see them, we will realize that all the Gospels are filled with the Lord's glory.</S>
