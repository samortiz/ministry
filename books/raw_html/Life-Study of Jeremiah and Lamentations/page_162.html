<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Ammonites Taking the Land of Gad</H2><P>The Ammonites took the land of Gad and possessed it with their god Malcam (Jer. 49:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jehovah Causing War against the Ammonites</H2><P>Jeremiah 49:2a and 3 tell us that Jehovah would cause war against the Ammonites. Their nation would become a mound of desolation, and its villages would be burned with fire. Their god Malcam would go into exile together with its priests and its princes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Israel Dispossessing Those Who Dispossess Him</H2><P>Regarding the Ammonites, we are told that Israel will dispossess those who dispossess him (v. 2b; cf. Zeph. 2:8-9; Amos 1:13-15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Jehovah Turning Again<br>the Captivity of the Children of Ammon</H2><P>Jeremiah 49:6 prophesies that afterward Jehovah will turn again the captivity of the children of Ammon.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT<br>AND JUDGMENT UPON EDOM</H2><P>The word in 49:7-22 concerns Jehovah's punishment and judgment upon Edom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Nation Typifying the World<br>of the Old and Fleshly Man Who Struggles<br>against the God-chosen and Spiritual People</H2><P>Edom was a nation of the descendants of Esau, who was the twin brother of Jacob; who was hated by God and destined by God to serve his younger brother; and who was struggling in the flesh against his brother (Gen. 36:9; 25:21-26a; Mal. 1:3a; Rom. 9:13b; 1 Kings 11:14-16; 2 Kings 8:20, 22; Psa. 83:4-6; 137:7; Num. 20:21). As such a nation, Edom typifies the world of the old and fleshly man who struggles against the God-chosen and spiritual people.</P>
