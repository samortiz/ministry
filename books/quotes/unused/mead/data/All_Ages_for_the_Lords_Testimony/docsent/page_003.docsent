   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAINTAINING THE LORD'S TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Numbers 4:3 says, "From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the military service, to do the work in the tent of meeting" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the tabernacle was set up, those in this age group maintained it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the children of Israel were traveling, those in this group also carried the various parts of the tabernacle and its utensils.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, those between the ages of twenty and thirty were the fighting ones, and those between the ages of thirty and fifty were the ones to maintain and carry the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Applying this type to today's situation, we see that the young people are on the frontier fighting, but the older ones are at home maintaining the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Maintaining the Lord's testimony is more important than fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If there is no testimony, the young people are fighting in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, let us rise up and keep the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then the warfare in which the young people are engaged will be meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The testimony today is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The middle-aged brothers and sisters must be those who set up the testimony, maintain it, and carry it from place to place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What a responsibility this is!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE NEED FOR AN APPRENTICESHIP</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Numbers 8:24 mentions those who were twenty-five years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was the age one began his apprenticeship, not for fighting, but for serving in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Probably no apprenticeship was necessary for fighting; however, in order to learn how to minister in the tabernacle, it was necessary to pass an apprenticeship of several years in length.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A great deal of learning was necessary for this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The years of apprenticeship were necessary and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every aspect of the service in the tabernacle had to be exact; no mistakes were tolerated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, those who served in and around the tabernacle had to be thoroughly trained to do things accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After a Levite had completed his five-year apprenticeship, he was qualified, at the age of thirty, to serve in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE USEFULNESS OF THE YOUNGEST ONES</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Numbers 3:28 strangely mentions the male Levites "from a month old and upward," indicating that they also were to keep the charge of the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This verse reveals that even a very young one is useful in keeping the charge of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A baby a month old is, of course, not able to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, he can help to keep the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Concerning the service or ministry in the tabernacle, there are in the book of Numbers three age groups: those between thirty and fifty, who were fully qualified to serve; those between twenty-five and thirty, who were engaged in an apprenticeship of five years to learn how to minister in the tabernacle; and those a month old and upward, who could keep the charge of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A baby a month old may not seem to be able to do anything, but he is a help for keeping the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a thousand little children were to surround our meeting hall, they would certainly be helping to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The service in Numbers is a picture of the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church service does not depend mainly on the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For the service of the tabernacle, we need the little ones, from one month to twenty years of age; the apprentices, aged twenty-five to thirty; and those between the ages of thirty and fifty, who are fully qualified to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need many more infants, toddlers, pre-schoolers, and those in elementary, junior high and high school.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need a great many more in this age group to surround the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You may think that such young ones are useless for God's testimony, but God's economy is different from our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to Numbers 3, God would use even the infants to protect His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to follow God's strategy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that we need more young ones from one month to twenty years of age and we need enough older ones to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The churches in the Lord's recovery need to become normal in this matter.</S>
