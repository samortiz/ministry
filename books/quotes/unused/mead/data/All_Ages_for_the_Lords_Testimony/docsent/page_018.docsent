   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE COMELY AND THE UNCOMELY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 24 Paul goes on to say, "Our comely members have no need."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who are comely have no need and therefore do not require any particular care.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In a sense, we may forget about them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Both the comely and uncomely ones are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The difference here is that the comely ones have no need because they are already comely.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The uncomely ones, on the contrary, need to be clothed with honor in order to have more abundant comeliness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These verses speak of three kinds of members: the weaker ones, the less honorable or uncomely ones, and the comely ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Which kind are you?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, we are not able to say whether we are a weaker one, a less honorable one, or a comely one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should have no confidence in our estimation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I simply do not know what kind of a member I am.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, I can discern when a particular brother is lacking in honor or comeliness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How can I be at peace as long as my brother has such a lack?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I should not be at peace until I clothe him with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we all practice this, how different the church life would be!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE PROVING OF OUR SPIRITUALITY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have pointed out that in verse 24 Paul speaks of the tempering of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To temper something is to make it balanced by dealing with the extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, we cannot drink water that is either boiling hot or ice cold.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if hot water is tempered with cold water, the tempered water will be the right temperature for drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the local churches there are many different saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some are very spiritual; others are not so spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The spiritual ones need to be tempered with those who are not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then the spiritual ones will be spiritual in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The weaker ones are necessary to test the genuineness of our spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sisters, if you are truly spiritual and if you have genuinely seen the oneness, I ask you to go to the weaker, less honorable sisters and see what you can do for them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You are so hot, but they are so cold.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You are so honorable, but they are very uncomely.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because they are utterly without honor, they need to be beautified by you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you do this, you will find that both you and they are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Body there is the need for tempering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even our spirituality must be tempered.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through this tempering, we shall find out how genuine our spirituality actually is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our spirituality will be proved by God's tempering.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not expect every saint in the church life to be a spiritual giant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This will never be the situation in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the Bible, we all must be tempered, the hot ones with the cold ones, and the spiritual ones with those who are not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the proper church life there will always be the weaker members, the less honorable members, and the comely members.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nevertheless, because all are being tempered together, these are not three divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>VIOLATING THE PRINCIPLE OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In verse 24 Paul also says that God has given more abundant honor to that member which lacks.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Any group within the church that claims to be spiritual will always collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have seen this take place several times and in several places.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In my home town of Chefoo a certain group of sisters thought they were today's Madame Guyons.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They regarded themselves as the most spiritual ones, and they tried to help others to be like them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But their so-called spirituality was abnormal and a damage to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When Brother Nee was ministering on the matter of the Body in Shanghai, he emphasized the importance of seeing the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Certain co-workers testified strongly that they had seen the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, none of them became a real help to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Both those sisters in Chefoo and those co- workers in Shanghai violated the principle of the Body.</S>
