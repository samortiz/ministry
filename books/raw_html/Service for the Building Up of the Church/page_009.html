        <h2 class="head1">CARING FOR THE PHYSICAL NEEDS<br />
OF THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>We should care for the spiritual condition of the believers and also for their various physical needs. We should pray for their material needs, and at the same time, we should do our best with what the Lord has given us to care for them in secret. We should never say, &ldquo;Brother, since I am shepherding you, and you have a need, let me give you five dollars.&rdquo; This would not be right. It is best to offer money in secret through the offering box. The brother should not even recognize our handwriting. He should know that it is the Lord&rsquo;s care for him. This is according to the Lord&rsquo;s word: &ldquo;When you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing&rdquo; (Matt. 6:3). The receiver should know that it is a gift only from the Lord. This is the genuine love of brothers loving one another.</p>
<p>We should pray for the brother and follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading to help him in secret so that he will not depend on us or on the church but would learn to depend on God and look to the Lord with a living faith. Suppose he needs twenty-five dollars, but we have the ability to give only one dollar. We need to have thorough prayer for him in secret. We might say, &ldquo;Lord, I can offer only one dollar. You are responsible for the remaining twenty-four dollars.&rdquo; The Lord often answers such prayers. We should never speak to others in a loose way concerning this need. There would be love in such a situation, but not a holding to truth.</p>
<p>We must hold to truth in love. We should not be like those in 1 John 3:17, who have the livelihood of the world and see that a brother has a need but then shut up their affections from him, or like those in James 2:15-16, who only say, &ldquo;Go in peace, be warmed and filled,&rdquo; to brothers or sisters in need of clothing and daily food. If we loosen our grip on our resources, open our purse, and do our best to care for the believers, the Lord will be responsible for supplying and filling up any shortage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must believe that God will not allow us to become poor as a result of following His leading to care for the poor and needy saints. In the past three decades, I have not seen a serving one become poor because of his practical service of love.</p>
<p>If we can be led thus by the Lord to care for the needy saints without doing a work of charity, the church will be grounded in love. Such a love edifies people and does not corrupt them. A charitable love often corrupts people; it feeds people without leading them to know God. It causes people to rely on others and solicit help and thus lose their living faith. We should never consider that the believers whom we help are inferior. Rather, we should consider them to be more glorious than ourselves. We must help them to trust in God, to pray, and to see God&rsquo;s outstretched hand having mercy on them. Then they will be supplied materially, and they will also trust in God and know that God answers them; they will not feel inferior. They will be glorious persons and will not beg for pity. If we pity the believers because of their material needs, we make them feel inferior; we make them persons who expect favors and help from others. This is to despise our brother. The lack of the believers is the way for them to receive more honor (1 Cor. 12:23). Even though we are the ones supplying the need, they receive more honor. There are no poor people in the church; there are only brothers and sisters. This is the church; this is genuine love.</p>
<p>We should care not only for the material needs of the saints; we should also care for other matters. Some young brothers and sisters may need guidance and leading concerning marriage. This requires practical love. We must not be careless or loose in making recommendations. We must help the young believers to fear God in the matter of marriage and to pray for His leading. We need to ask the Lord to enlighten them and to manifest His heart to them. Then they will receive help.</p>
<p>A church with such practical love will be solid, and it will be easy for the church to preach the gospel and to sustain the new believers. The service in such a church will be carried out by a practical love, not by impulsive emotions. Such service is ruled by the throne and touches God&rsquo;s heart. If we have such a practical love toward the believers, we will be able to supply them and help them every time we contact them. We must believe that if by the Lord&rsquo;s love we care for the spiritual condition and practical needs of the believers, the Holy Spirit will do a deep work in them.</p>
<p>We do not need doctrine or theory; we need to practice love. If we want the church to be built up, we must see the throne, know authority, and touch the Savior&rsquo;s heart. Then we will realize that His heart is love and that His heart cares for everyone who belongs to Him. If we touch His love, we will be considerate of His heart. If we do not have His love, we should say, &ldquo;Lord, I am willing to be considerate of Your heart and to love those whom You love, but I have not yet touched the reality of this love. Pour out Your love into my heart. I am willing to give myself for the care of the saints.&rdquo; If every serving one would touch the Lord&rsquo;s heart, every believer in the churches would be taken care of, and the churches would be built up.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
