   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Letter from Brother Chen Jai-seng,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Han-Jiang</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Last month I went with Brother Chai Gi-chen and others to Si-Shan, Di-Lu, to learn to work on sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I received much teaching and encouragement through this hands-on experience in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One feels satisfied when he stays at home and realizes his emptiness when he travels around.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I felt ashamed when friends visiting asked for help and I could not render them any.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In my spirit I have often mused over Revelation 3:17 and have felt unqualified to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>O Lord, be merciful to me and bend me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Please do not forget to pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I have received and read Issue No. 18 of The Open Door.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The two things that Brother Witness Lee spoke of are indeed our present need.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I heard that the Lord provided Brother Nee a smooth journey back to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are very pleased about this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We hope that we can grasp some of the riches of grace the Lord has given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I heard that Brother Chen Ke-san is conducting a Bible study in Sien-You, while Brother Chai Gi-chen is staying in Pu-Tien.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I no longer rent the house in Gung-Kou.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On July 17 I moved to Shang-Lin-Chun.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This little village has about thirty local brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have been persecuted for many years by their fellow villagers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But by the grace of the Lord, they have been able to stand fast.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They have all experienced household salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because there are meetings in this village, the believers in neighboring villages come to worship and remember the Lord together.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May glory be unto Him forever, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Greetings to the brothers and sisters in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Chen Jai-seng</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>August 4</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A Letter from Wu Ren-jieh</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because our distance from the throne is the same, I have been remembering the kinfolk in Christ while looking daily to the unmatched One.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>May He gain the fullness, the glory, and everything in the church, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Nee's word on the natural strength being dealt with and Brother Lee's word on being careful in touching the Lord's work have given me a deeper understanding of the words: "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am always willing to be taught.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brother Chai Wen-bin, a responsible brother, has the burden to start an orphanage here.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Originally, he intended to start one in Chuenchow but has not found anyone whom the Lord can entrust the matter to.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, the political situation is unsteady, and it is not wise to proceed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When he read The Open Door, he found that Brother Lan Tsi-yi had started such a work in Hankow, and he would like to offer X dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Please direct this sum to Brother Lan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are happy that Brother Nee has returned safely.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please give my regards to all the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Wu Ren-jieh</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>August 16</S>
