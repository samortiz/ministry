   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE BEING WATCHFUL AND READY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND BEING FAITHFUL AND DILIGENT Scripture Reading: Matt 24:37-42, 44, 51; 25:1-30 RECEIVING THE WORD OF GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE WORD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All Christians love Scripture verses such as John 3:16, which says, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life ; Matthew 1:21, which says, You shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins ; and 11:28, which says, Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They also love the nine blessings in Matthew 5.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, not many Christians appreciate the word in Matthew 24 and 25.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matthew 24 and 25 speak of slaves and virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Regardless of whether we are brothers or sisters, we are virgins as well as slaves before God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Just as we acknowledge that believing in the Lord and being saved are important, we must also acknowledge that the Lord s word in Matthew 24 and 25 is important.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just as we love the words Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest, we should also remember the Lord s word in Matthew 24 and 25 concerning the Lord settling accounts with us when He returns.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE EVIL SLAVE AND THE FOOLISH VIRGINS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>BEING TRUE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Matthew 24:51 says that the Lord will cut asunder the evil slave.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Brethren taught that only false believers will be cut asunder.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They maintained that the Lord Jesus would not cut asunder a believer who was redeemed with His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, they said that the five foolish virgins and the evil and slothful slave in chapter 25 are false believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This teaching gave rise to many disputes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In John 10:28-29 the Lord Jesus said, I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My Father...is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Based on these verses, the Brethren taught that once we are saved, our salvation is eternally secure; therefore, they argued that genuine believers could not be cut asunder or shut outside the door.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, those who know the Bible know that the Lord would not set a false believer over His household and that a false believer cannot go forth to meet the Bridegroom with a lighted lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, we should not say that the foolish virgins are false believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A father with several children would never say that the clever ones are his real children, but the foolish ones are false children.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the same principle, we should not say that someone is a false slave simply because he is evil and slothful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Matthew 13:24-30 the Lord said that the enemy sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and that the tares and the wheat are growing together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The tares are false believers, and the Lord is waiting until the end of the age to weed out the tares, bind them into bundles, and burn them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In chapter 25, however, the virgins die and then are resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The virgins are resurrected believers who are raptured to the Lord s judgment seat to render an account to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A false believer would not be raptured to the Lord s judgment seat to give an account to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, the prudent virgins are true believers, and the foolish virgins are also true believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The good and faithful slaves are true believers, and the evil and slothful slaves are also true believers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>TO BE CUT ASUNDER MEANING TO BE CUT OFF</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>FROM OUR FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the Lord s word in Matthew 24 and 25, we will either receive a reward from the Lord or be cut asunder by Him in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The phrase cut asunder means to cut apart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In John 15 the Lord said that He is the true vine, we are the branches, and He will take away any branch that does not bear fruit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>1-2, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to our experience and knowledge of the truth, the Lord cuts off from the vine tree any branch that does not bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He does not simply cut the branch in two.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Second Corinthians 1:21 says, The One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we were baptized, we entered into an organic union with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we fellowship with Him, touch His presence, and enjoy His riches, we are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes, however, we are separated from the Lord because we commit sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even though the Lord has not cut us off, we feel as if our fellowship with the Lord has been cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As believers our union with the Lord is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, if we are evil and slothful, the Lord will cut us off from His presence when He returns.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Concerning the evil slave the master says that he will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth Matt 24:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Concerning the good and faithful slave the master says, You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Enter into the joy of your master 25:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The master then says concerning the evil and slothful slave, Cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth v. 30 . According to chapters 24 and 25, to cut the evil slave asunder means to cast him into the outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is to cut him off from the Lord s presence and cast him into the outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our union with the Lord is realized through our enjoyment and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To be cut off means that we lose our fellowship with the Lord and our enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a punishment, but it is not eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A person may say to his children that whoever receives good grades will receive a reward at the end of the semester, and whoever fails will be punished by being restricted to his room.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the semester is over, the child who receives an A receives a reward, but the child who fails is restricted to his room.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whether he is in his room for half a day or for one hour, while he is in the room, he is cut off from his father s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>His being shut in his room is a kind of cutting off.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It temporarily cuts the child off from his relationship with his father.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the same principle, for the sake of God s righteous ways, for His government, and for our benefit, we will be cut off from the Lord if we are slothful.</S>
