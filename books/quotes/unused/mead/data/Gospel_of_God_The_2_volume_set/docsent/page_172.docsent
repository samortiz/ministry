   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WE BEING THE SPIRITUAL HOUSE GOD IS BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Fifth, the church is not only a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the individual Christians come together before God, they become a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every Christian is like a stone, and the church is the spiritual house that God is building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus is the foundation of this spiritual temple.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is a great stone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every Christian is a small stone built upon the Lord Jesus to become the temple of God and the habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is what is spoken of in 1 Peter 2:5.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there were a possibility for Christians to perish, the temple of God would become more unsightly than our run-down meeting hall; one minute the stones would be taken out, and another minute they would be put back in again, and the walls would be full of holes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If that were the case, why would God not make up His mind before He saved men?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God intends that we be built up into a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If it is a spiritual house, then not one stone can be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If any stone can be lost, the spiritual house would be in trouble and would not be up to standard.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Old Testament record in 1 Kings 6:7 tells us how the temple of Solomon was built.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chapter five is an account of Solomon sending men to the mountains to cut the stones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The stones were cut in the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By chapter six, they were moved to mount Moriah for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, when the temple was being built, there was no sound from iron tools.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There was no need for further cutting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The skilled workmen had calculated accurately and prepared everything on the mountain before the materials were moved to the building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There was no more need of improvement; everything was done properly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If while building the earthly temple, Solomon's skilled men could cut the stones so well that they were exact in every way and had no need for improvement, could God change us, the living stones, once every two or three days when He builds the spiritual temple?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Could God have such oversight?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Would God not know how to calculate?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Is God worse than man?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Old Testament, God used men to build.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the New Testament, He builds by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Is God's own work inferior to man's?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the believers are stones for the building of the spiritual house, can they be lost?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, if we are in God's temple, we can never be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>HAVING THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>AS THE SEAL AND THE PLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sixth, there is another very important and wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the time that every unbeliever is saved, not only does he receive eternal life and become a member of the Body of Christ and a living stone in the temple, but he receives the Holy Spirit as a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God places the Holy Spirit in him as a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ephesians 1:13 says, "In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is that not our history?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have heard the gospel of our salvation and have believed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What happened after we believed?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every Christian has the Holy Spirit as the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is very obvious that the Holy Spirit does not belong just to some special Christians and that only specially sanctified Christians have life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 13 says that all who have heard the gospel of salvation and who have believed, have received the Holy Spirit as the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This proves that the seal of the Holy Spirit is something that all Christians have in common.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As soon as one believes, he is saved and has the Holy Spirit as the seal.</S>
