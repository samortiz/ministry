[2]  As has become manifest to Christian readers throughout the earth, Brother Watchman Nee was especially entrusted by the Lord with the burden to help the believers in the truth of God's full salvation.
[3]  In the spring of 1937 Brother Nee delivered a series of twenty-six messages on the basic truths of the gospel of God to the church in Shanghai, China.
[4]  In Volume 28, Brother Nee presents the particulars of God's salvation, that is, man's sins; God's love, grace, and mercy; the nature of grace; the function of the law and God's righteousness; the work of Christ and of the Holy Spirit in God's salvation; and faith as the way of salvation.
[5]  CHAPTER ONE SIN, SINS, AND THE SINNER THE NATURE OF THIS MEETING
[6]  Tonight we begin a series of Bible-study meetings.
[7]  But before we begin, I would like to first say a few words concerning the nature of these meetings.
[8]  I do not know if there are some here who are with us for the first time.
[9]  If we want to differentiate clearly between sin and sins, there is one portion of the Scriptures which we must consider.
[10]  It is the first eight chapters of the book of Romans.
[11]  These eight chapters show us the full significance of sin.
[12]  In these eight chapters we find one outstanding feature: from chapter one through 5:11, only the word sins is mentioned; sin is never mentioned.
[13]  From chapter one through 5:11, Romans shows us that man has committed sins before God.
[14]  From 5:12 on, Romans shows us what kind of person man is before God: he is a sinner before God.
[15]  Now we need to ask the question: Who is a sinner?
[16]  I know that some of the brothers and sisters here have been believers for over twenty years.
[17]  Some have even worked for the Lord for over fifteen years.
[18]  But once you read the Bible, you will have to reject this definition, because it is not that the ones who sin are sinners, but that the sinners are the ones who commit sins.
[19]  I have heard many say that Paul, in proving that everyone in the world is a sinner, mentioned in chapter three that all have sinned and have come short of the glory of God v. 23 . God seeks the righteous and finds none; He seeks those who understand and who seek after Him and finds none; all have lied and have turned aside vv.
[20]  We have seen the matters of sin, sins, and the sinner.
[21]  By birth, we are sinners, and our walk matches our birth.
[22]  Let me repeat that it is not because we have sinned that we have become sinners; rather, it is because we are sinners that we have sinned.
[23]  When the Bible says that man is condemned and has become a sinner in the eyes of God, it does not mean that he has committed a multitude of sins that incur God's wrath, such as murder, arson, fornication, pride, debauchery, prostitution, gambling, or other kinds of filthy and secret sins.
[24]  You must remember therefore that as Christians, we may perform all the outward services that there are to perform, and we may fulfill all the outward duties that there are to fulfill; we may pray as we always have, and we may read the Bible and attend church meetings as we always have; we may do everything as we always have, and may even do them more.
[25]  This does not mean that the other sins are unimportant.
[26]  In the Old Testament, those who did not love God committed many other sins spontaneously.
[27]  In the New Testament, those who do not believe in the Lord also commit many sins spontaneously.
[28]  From these many other sins are produced, such as unrighteous acts, evil deeds, expressions of greed, wickedness, jealousy, murder, strife, deceit, displays of hatred, slander, backbiting, blasphemy, insolence, pride, arrogance, false accusations, disobedience to parents, unfaithfulness, a lack of natural affection and mercy, self-love, the love of money, ingratitude, unholiness, ferociousness, the despising of good, betraying others, recklessness, loving pleasure rather than God, giving the appearance of godliness without having its reality, and so on.
[29]  But none of these are the most serious sin that man has ever committed, even though they are sins before God.
[30]  If he had been a person in the Old Testament age, he would have realized that there was still the sin of not loving God.
[31]  Although he would no longer be condemned by the other sins, he would not feel satisfied in the deepest part of his heart, because the Spirit of God would convict him of his sin of unbelief.
[32]  The Bible shows us that there are three aspects of sin.
[33]  To put it another way, sin is in three places.
[34]  We must know that our sin is before God, in the conscience, and in the flesh.
[35]  Tonight we will consider God's love and grace, and we will also touch the subject of God's mercy.
[36]  Many times the Old Testament says that salvation is of Jehovah.
[37]  This indicates that salvation does not originate with us.
[38]  Since sin is committed by man we would naturally think that salvation also originates in man.
[39]  But even the thought of our salvation did not originate with us; rather, it originated with God.
[40]  In order to correct the different conjectures man has concerning God, He manifests Himself in the light of the gospel and shows man that He is not an unapproachable or unfathomable God.
[41]  God Himself is love, but when this love is applied to us, we find that "God so loved the world" John 3:16 .
[42]  "God is love" speaks of His nature, and "God so loved the world" speaks of His action.
[43]  God Himself is love; hence, that which issues out from Him must be love.
[44]  After showing us that He is love, God immediately shows us that He loves the world.
[45]  God has not only loved us, but has also sent forth His love.
[46]  Although you may sin and fail, God does not change His attitude toward you, for God is love and He loves the world.
[47]  If God is love, no matter how you "hit" Him if you reject Him, deny Him, or cast Him aside He is still love.
[48]  But, brothers and sisters, God's love does not stop here.
[49]  Since God is love, the matter of grace comes up.
[50]  It is true that love is precious, but love must have its expression.
[51]  But thank the Lord that although love is something abstract, with God it is immediately turned into something substantial.
[52]  If you want to be above God, or if you want to be equal with God, you will never see the day of grace.
[53]  On the first evening we discussed the problem of sin.
[54]  Because God has shown mercy on us, He has given us His salvation.
[55]  In it we see how the Son of God, Jesus Christ, has come to the world to show forth grace and to become grace so that we might receive grace.
[56]  The first characteristic of God's grace is that it is not related to man's wrongdoings.
[57]  If the question of wrongdoing comes up and if it is stipulated that those with sin shall not have grace, then grace is basically annulled.
[58]  If you told anyone who has some consideration about God that God loved him and has given him grace, he would immediately wonder how this could be since he has committed so many sins.
[59]  If we do not have any wrongdoings, we do not need God to do anything for us, and as a result, we do not need God's grace.
[60]  Since the problem of sin is taken care of by God and since He takes the responsibility to deal with our wrongdoings, any sin we have, whether great or small, is no problem before God.
[61]  In God's eyes, all of man's acts are sins, but in man's eyes, many things he does are achievements.
[62]  Even though we dare not say that we come to God only by our achievements, you have to believe that we need some achievements before God.
[63]  Now we come to the third matter, man's responsibilities.
[64]  Suppose I give a brother ten thousand dollars to send to a certain place, but because I am afraid that he will lose the money, I charge him, saying, "You are responsible for this money."
[65]  Many think that if we behave properly after we are saved, our salvation will be preserved, and if we do not behave properly, God will take back His salvation.
[66]  At the end of the book of Revelation, after the new heaven, the new earth, the kingdom, the lake of fire, Satan's end, and the great white throne have all been covered, the Bible says, "Let him who wills take the water of life freely" 22:17b .
[67]  Thank the Lord that He has purposely put taking freely of the water of life at the end of chapter twenty-two.
[68]  After we have seen the lake of fire, the second death, Satan's end, the kingdom, the new heaven and the new earth, we may fear that God would harden His heart again; but after all these things, God purposely stated that the water of life is free.
[69]  Thank the Lord that we have grace through Jesus Christ, and that this grace is free.
[70]  But I have to ask where in the Bible is there a verse that says that we have to repay God's grace?
[71]  We realize that man's position before God is that of a sinner.
[72]  Now, let us consider why God set up the law.
[73]  Once we understand the law, we will be able to understand God's work.
[74]  God has always known man's condition, but does man know his own condition?
[75]  Since sin has been manifested before God, it should also be felt in man's conscience.
[76]  In other words, man is saved because God works for man, not because man works for God.
[77]  It is not a matter of being something before God or doing something for God, but a matter of God Himself coming into our midst to become something and do something for us.
[78]  Since man's conduct is against God, his lust is provoking him to sin, and his will is rebellious against God, there is no possibility for him to have the works of the law and be obedient to God.
[79]  Man thinks that he can be saved by the works of the law because he has never read the Bible or seen the light or the heavenly revelation.
[80]  If you want to know whether or not you can be saved by the works of the law, you need to first ask why God gave the law.
[81]  Only after you find out God's purpose in giving the law will you know whether or not you can be saved by the works of the law.
[82]  Once God tells us His intention in giving the law, we will know whether man can be saved by the works of the law or not.
[83]  Second Timothy 1:9-10 says, "Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages but now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who nullified death and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel."
[84]  After this word was spoken, Christ the Son of God did not immediately come to the world.
[85]  Abraham begot Isaac, but Isaac did not come to save the world.
[86]  And though they were very good people, they were not the Christ of God.
[87]  Through God's revelation, Paul pointed out to us that the seed of Abraham does not refer to many seeds, but to one seed, who did not come until two thousand years later.
[88]  It is true that God wants to do things for man, that God wants to give man grace.
[89]  God sees that we are not doing well, and He wants to help us; but we may still think that we are quite capable.
[90]  Paul was explaining why after four hundred and thirty years the law came in. Verse 17 says, "And I say this: A covenant previously ratified by God, the law, having come four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul so as to make the promise of none effect." Although God gave the law to man, the covenant He made four hundred and thirty years before could not be made of none effect.
[91]  In verse 19 Paul gives us the reason: "It was added because of the transgressions."
[92]  Recently I went to a certain place to work.
[93]  Because we do not have a home there, we went to a restaurant and ordered a meal of five dishes.
[94]  Actually, God does not have to give us the law, and neither did He need to give it to the Jews.
[95]  God gave the law to the Jews because He wanted to show the world through the Jews that He gave the law because of transgressions.
[96]  Let us look at this chapter, beginning with verses 7 and 8, "What then shall we say?
[97]  But I did not know sin except through the law; for neither did I know coveting, except the law had said, You shall not covet.'
[98]  But sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, worked out in me coveting of every kind; for without the law sin is dead."
[99]  Friends, remember that God gave you the law for one reason only: to show you that you have always been full of sin.
[100]  He spontaneously loves the Lord His God with all His heart, with all His soul, with all His strength, and with all His will; He spontaneously loves His neighbor as Himself, even beyond Himself.
[101]  In this way, man realized that he had sin and would wait "until the seed should come to whom the promise was made" v. 19 . It was not until the whole world saw that they were sinners and that they were really hopeless that they were willing to receive the Lord Jesus Christ whom God had promised.
[102]  Verse 19 ends in this way: "It being ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator."
[103]  The "it" here refers to the law mentioned above.
[104]  The law was not only added because of transgressions, but was also ordained by a mediator.
[105]  There are these two features to the law: it was added because of transgressions, and it was ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator.
[106]  God shuts up all under sin "in order that the promise out of faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe" v. 22b . Hallelujah! The law of God is something God uses to save us.
[107]  In the previous meetings we have seen that man has sinned and that God's salvation is based on the fact that man has sinned.
[108]  If man had not sinned, there would be no need for salvation.
[109]  Since man has sinned, God has given the law to show man that he has sinned.
[110]  Thank the Lord that though we have sin and though we have transgressed, God, who is love, purposed to give us grace and mercy.
[111]  Although God loves us and shows mercy on us and although He fully intends to grant us grace, there is one thing that makes it very difficult for God to do this.
[112]  Although we would be satisfied no matter how we are saved, God cannot say that all there is to salvation is getting us saved, without caring about whether the way we are saved is right or wrong.
[113]  God is willing to save us, but He wants us to be able to say, at the time we receive His life and are saved, that He has justified us in a most righteous way.
[114]  There is one book in the Bible, the book of Romans, that tells us how God deals specifically with this one problem.
[115]  Let us read Romans 3:25-26, beginning with the second part of verse 25: "For the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred, with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus."
[116]  They translate: "To declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God."
[117]  While God justifies those who believe in Jesus, He is shown to be righteous, and man is to acknowledge Him as being righteous.
[118]  The coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to the earth was God's requirement in righteousness; it was not God's requirement in grace.
[119]  If there had been love without righteousness, the Lord Jesus would not have needed to come to the earth, and the cross would have been unnecessary.
[120]  Without righteousness, God could save us any way He wants to.
[121]  If God said, "Since all have sinned, I will let you go this time; just do not sin again," there would be no need for a Jesus of Nazareth in the first place.
[122]  Because God loves the world and, at the same time, He is righteous, He had to send the Lord Jesus to us.
[123]  Therefore, before the Lord Jesus came to the earth and was crucified on the cross, it would have been fine for God to refuse to save us.
[124]  But because God has indeed given us His Son and put our sins upon Him that we might be redeemed from our sins, God can do nothing else but forgive our sins when we come to Him through the blood of the Lord Jesus and through His work.
[125]  It was love that brought His Son to the cross, but it was righteousness that caused God to forgive our sins.
[126]  But today when we come to God through the accomplished work of Jesus Christ, God has to forgive us based on His faithfulness and righteousness.
[127]  But now that the Lord Jesus has died, even if God were unhappy about saving us, strictly speaking He still has to do it.
[128]  Today through the Lord Jesus, not only can we pay God back, but we have more than we need to pay Him back.
[129]  Everyone has to admit that there is nothing unrighteous with God when we come to Him by the Lord Jesus and when He gives us life and forgives our sins.
[130]  Our heart can never say that God, in forgiving our sins, saved us lawlessly when He passed over our sins, exercised forbearance toward us, and justified us who believe in Jesus.
[131]  Since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God v. 23 , how can we obtain God's grace? Verses 24 and 25 say that we are "justified freely...through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God set forth as a propitiation place." God has sent Jesus to redeem us from our sins and has set Him forth as a propitiation place.
[132]  God has set forth Jesus as the propitiation place, and now through the blood of Jesus I can come by faith to God.
[133]  Only after God has done this can we say that His forbearance and His passing over of sins in the Old Testament was righteous; and only after God has done this can we say that His justifying those who believe in Jesus in the New Testament is also righteous.
[134]  Most people today are ignorant first of God's righteousness and then of the fact that the Lord Jesus has accomplished God's righteousness.
[135]  People do not know that God's righteousness is manifested apart from the law.
[136]  They still try to work up righteousness before God.
[137]  One thing we have to know is that before the Lord Jesus died, it was unrighteous for God to forgive our sins, but after the Lord Jesus died, it would be equally unrighteous for God not to forgive our sins.
[138]  Without the Lord Jesus' death, God's forgiveness would be unrighteous on His part; He could never do this.
[139]  By the grace of God, we have seen in the past few evenings what God's salvation is.
[140]  I hope to give a quick review of what we have covered in the previous five meetings.
[141]  We have seen sin, the law, God's love, His grace, and His righteousness.
[142]  It does not show us that God had a demand, that His law had to be satisfied, and that in order for man to meet the law's demand, the Lord Jesus came to fulfill God's law.
[143]  For the sake of those with unclear concepts, I will say a word first.
[144]  In the Bible, there are two important doctrines, which are the bearing of sins and the ransom for sins.
[145]  Please do not think that I do not believe in substitution.
[146]  But the substitution that some talk about is not the substitution in the Bible, because their kind of substitution involves unrighteousness.
[147]  If the sinless Jesus is to be a substitute for sinful men, it is, of course, a bargain for us.
[148]  But is it righteous to treat the Lord Jesus this way?
[149]  If the Lord Jesus is to die on behalf of all the sinners in the world, then those who believe in Jesus as well as those who do not believe in Him will likewise be saved.
[150]  Since God has love and also has righteousness, He would not allow a sinner to bear his sins, for that would mean that God was righteous without love.
[151]  While He was on the earth, His works demonstrated that God loves us.
[152]  The Lord died on the cross, but what is the significance of His death?
[153]  How can we say that the Lord Jesus died to bear our sins?
[154]  Was it not because God made the sinless One to become sin for us and laid the sins of the whole world upon Him, so that He would bear our sins upon the tree?
[155]  If the cross was something out of man's hand, if it was just the tool for some evil men to kill Him, and if there was only the human aspect to the Lord Jesus, then I would not like to listen to this prayer of the Lord.
[156]  If it had not been God who had commenced to place the burden of sins on the Lord at Gethsemane, and if it had not been God who had laid the burden of bearing our sins on the Lord Jesus, we would have to say that the Lord Jesus did not even have as much courage as those who believed in Him.
[157]  At the beginning, the prophet thought that He was smitten and stricken by God, that He was punished for His own sins and smitten by God for His transgressions.
[158]  Although it was the hands of man that nailed the Lord Jesus up, manifesting man's hatred for God, it was also God who had laid all of our sins upon Him and crucified Him.
[159]  Since the Lord Jesus died on the cross and since God made Him the propitiation place, how can we be saved?
[160]  We have already mentioned that the Lord Jesus died for us and for our sins Rom 5:8; 1 Cor 15:3 .
[161]  We have also seen how the Lord accomplished God's righteousness and, at the same time, manifested God's grace.
[162]  How do we know that the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ has been accomplished?
[163]  How do we know that such a work was accepted by God?
[164]  Although we say that the Lord Jesus has fulfilled God's righteous requirements, what does God have to say about this?
[165]  It is true that the Lord Jesus died for us and for our sins and that His work was accomplished.
[166]  But how do we know that the Lord's work of redemption is acceptable to God when it is presented before Him?
[167]  It is wonderful that Romans 3 tells us that we are justified freely through the blood of the Lord Jesus and that Romans 4 follows by telling us that because we are justified, the Lord Jesus was resurrected v. 25 . His death is the basis of our justification, while His resurrection is the proof of our justification.
[168]  Since He died, we are justified; since we are justified, He resurrected.
[169]  We are justified before God because of His death, and He was resurrected because of our justification.
[170]  His resurrection is God's proof to us that His blood is able to justify us.
[171]  Hence, if you still do not have peace and still do not know God's view concerning your salvation and whether you can be saved before God through the Lord Jesus, all you need to ask is whether the Lord has resurrected.
[172]  Among us, many co-workers also preach the cross.
[173]  We all believe that His death has saved us.
[174]  Can you find one place in the entire Bible that says that we should believe that the Lord Jesus has died for us?
[175]  I believe we all know the verse in Romans 10:9, "That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."
[176]  Why does the Bible never ask us to believe in the cross of the Lord Jesus, but ask us to believe that God has raised Him from the dead?
[177]  If Christ has not resurrected, one will not know what has become of the things that he has believed in. Another wonderful thing is seen in 1 Corinthians 15:3 which says, "Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures." But in verse 17 it says, "If Christ has not been raised...you are still in your sins." Do not these two verses contradict each other? Verse 3 says that He has died for our sins.
[178]  Hence, there are these two sides in the Bible.
[179]  Without the death of the Lord Jesus for us, we would not have been redeemed from our sins.
[180]  The Bible says that Jesus has died for our sins.
[181]  Although God has finished His side of the work, matters are still unsettled on our side.
[182]  That is why the Lord Jesus must resurrect before we know that our sins have been forgiven.
[183]  We have also seen how God through His Son Jesus died for us and for our sins, thus accomplishing the work of redemption Rom 5:8; 1 Cor 15:3 .
[184]  His work of redemption justifies us before God through faith in His blood Rom 3:24-25 .
[185]  The ascension of the Lord Jesus is His appearing before God on our behalf, that we might be accepted in Christ.
[186]  If a person does not have the light of the Holy Spirit, it is possible that he can be like Judas, who saw his sin, was suffering and had no peace within, but would not see his own position before God.
[187]  One can say that the Lord Jesus is our objective Savior from God and that the Holy Spirit is our subjective Savior from God.
[188]  What should we do now that the Holy Spirit has enlightened and we have seen our position?
[189]  There is one thing we continually neglect in our preaching of the gospel, which the Bible pays attention to all the time.
[190]  We have to realize that the work of the Lord Jesus for the sinners is indeed precious and crucial.
[191]  The Bible shows us that not only does the Holy Spirit come to enlighten us and to show us our sins, our lost position, and our unrighteousness before God and men, but this Spirit is also sent from God and is poured forth upon all flesh for the purpose that man everywhere could be saved through His work Acts 2:17-18, 21 .
[192]  Some who know a little more than others concerning the truth of the Bible think that it is easy to receive forgiveness and to accept the Lord Jesus as Savior.
[193]  The Bible shows us clearly that God sent the Holy Spirit for the purpose that we, the sinners, would receive the Holy Spirit's work and be saved.
[194]  If there is anyone today whose sins have not been forgiven and who still does not know how to be saved and receive eternal life, who does not know that the Lord Jesus is his Savior, he must remember that God has poured out the Holy Spirit.
[195]  The characteristic of the Lord Jesus is His grace, and the characteristic of the Holy Spirit is His fellowship.
[196]  Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."
[197]  He brings the love of God and the grace of the Lord Jesus into you by the way of fellowship.
[198]  God has worked to such an extent that once you open your mouth and say a word and once your heart has a place for the Lord and would invoke Him, you will be saved.
[199]  Hence, if you say that you are not very smart and that you cannot understand the work of the Lord, I will say to you that God does not require you to believe in the work of the Lord.
[200]  Now we must see how the Holy Spirit conveys the work of the Lord to us.
[201]  The Lord's work includes all that He has done on the cross, in His resurrection, in His ascension, in His second coming, and in everything that He bestows upon us.
[202]  If there is anyone who is not saved yet, he cannot say that God has not loved him, or that the Lord Jesus has not accomplished redemption for him.
[203]  During the past few days, we have seen that all that man has is sin.
[204]  God has accomplished righteousness, has caused the Lord Jesus to die and resurrect for us.
[205]  God has even sent the Holy Spirit to convict and enlighten us and to give us the strength to accept the work of God.
[206]  What must man do to be saved, now that God has finished all His work?
[207]  The first question is whether man is saved through faith with the keeping of the law.
[208]  Christianity does not tell the sons of Adam to do good.
[209]  Christianity says that Adam has been crucified and removed and that the Adamic race has been annihilated through the cross of the Lord Jesus.
[210]  Perhaps one would argue that he does not mean to keep the whole law, that he realizes that it is impossible to keep the whole law, that what he means is to believe in Jesus and then keep the law.
[211]  Please read again Galatians 2:16-17: "And knowing that a man is not justified out of works of law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we also have believed into Christ Jesus that we might be justified out of faith in Christ and not out of the works of law, because out of the works of law no flesh will be justified.
[212]  He said that if while seeking to be justified in Christ we have been found sinners, it meant that after we have believed in the Lord Jesus, we are still not justified, that we are still sinners, and must still keep the law before we can be saved.
[213]  "The works of law" is an expression we find in the Bible Gal 2:16 .
[214]  A more common understanding of the condition of salvation is that salvation is by faith and also by works.
[215]  Salvation by faith is a doctrine of the Bible, and man cannot argue against it Eph 2:8 .
[216]  Ephesians 2:8 and 9 say, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast."
[217]  Romans 4:4 and 5 say, "Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due.
[218]  But to the one who does not work, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted as righteousness."
[219]  If a man can be saved by works, then salvation becomes a reward.
[220]  There is one thing we have to be clear about.
[221]  God's Word is very clear concerning the condition for salvation.
[222]  God shows us that salvation is by faith and not by works.
[223]  Because we believe in God's work through His Son, there must not be works of our own.
[224]  Yet some who do not understand the words of the Bible have come to me, asking, "Is it not true that the book of James tells us clearly that a man is not justified by faith, but by works?
[225]  Verse 14 says, "What is the profit, my brothers, if anyone says he has faith, but does not have works?"
[226]  Notice that James does not say that this man has faith in God.
[227]  Do not add into this verse what James does not say.
[228]  James does not say whether this man is a believer or not.
[229]  He only says that this man says that he has faith.
[230]  Regardless of whether he has works or not, this man himself should not say that he has faith.
[231]  If you actually have faith before God, there is no need to talk about it.
[232]  If you saw a man who is not concerned about his behavior at all, who is free to do anything, but says that he believes in Jesus, you would say the same thing as James does.
[233]  If you encounter a poor brother or sister and would not give all that you have to help him and care for him, but would only say that you believe for him and that he can go in peace if that is the kind of faith you exercised when you believed in the Lord Jesus, would such a faith save you?
[234]  Verse 18 says, "But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works."
[235]  If a vain and boastful person keeps on boasting, someone will eventually rise up and say, "You say that you have faith.
[236]  Notice that this one does not say that he has works only; he does not say that he is without faith.
[237]  Furthermore, even if you are rich and it does not take much faith for you to give away a little, how do you know that after you have given the money, it would not spoil the receiver and cause him to look to you again the next time to bear his burden?
[238]  In verses 21 through 25, two examples are given.
[239]  They show us what justification by faith really is.
[240]  Verse 21 says, "Was not Abraham our father justified by works in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?"
[241]  If we see a person who believes that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God and that He was crucified for him, and believes in the gospel of God fully, yet will not give up such a business for fear that he would lose his livelihood, we have no way to tell if he is actually saved.
[242]  James was afraid that we would not be clear about the case of Abraham, so in verse 25 we see another illustration.
[243]  Therefore, we see that justification is not a matter of good works, but of works of faith.
[244]  In the past two messages, we have seen that the way of salvation on man's side is through faith, rather than the law or works.
[245]  It is not by faith with the law, nor is it by faith with works Eph 2:8-9 .
[246]  Those who are acquainted with the Bible dare not say that repentance is the only condition for salvation, but they would say that a man is saved by faith with repentance, or through repenting and believing.
[247]  The repentance that man talks about simply speaks of one thing: he is not willing to lower himself to the bottom rung.
[248]  He thinks that he should be at least one rung higher before God would grant him salvation.
[249]  When a farmer plants seed, can he sow it on a field without doing anything first to the ground?
[250]  If a man has not repented, and does not know that he is desolate before God, but receives the full gospel readily when he hears it, in his future experience, God still has to show him his desolation.
[251]  Let us study a few passages to see what repentance is.
[252]  Acts 2:37-38 says, "And when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, What should we do, brothers?
[253]  And Peter said to them, Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."
[254]  When some read these verses, they may say that faith is not even mentioned.
[255]  All that is mentioned is to repent, to be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and to receive the promised Spirit.
[256]  Prior to this, Peter had said, "Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man shown by God to you to be approved by works of power and wonders and signs, which God did through Him in your midst, even as you yourselves know this man...you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to a cross and killed; whom God has raised up" vv.
[257]  The apostle Peter preached to them the word of God and showed them what they had done to the Lord Jesus and what God had done to Him.
[258]  Verse 36 says, "Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified."
[259]  I mentioned earlier that repentance can never be separated from faith; it is included in faith.
[260]  After a man has some faith, he must repent.
[261]  If a man has a certain amount of faith in God's word, he must repent.
[262]  If he were to tell us that man has sinned and that the Son of God has accomplished the work of redemption and has solved the problem of sin, then he would have to mention faith.
[263]  At the same time, in order to let everyone know that He has designated the Lord Jesus as the Judge, God has raised Jesus from among the dead as a proof of their faith.
[264]  But rise up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a minister and a witness both of the things in which you have seen Me and of the things in which I will appear to you; delivering you from the people and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me. Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, but declared both to those in Damascus first and in Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea and to the Gentiles that they should repent." Why do they have to repent? It is because the Lord Jesus has accomplished the work of redemption.
[265]  Another verse tells us that repentance is not only related to faith but is related to salvation as well.
[266]  Acts 5:31 says, "This One God has exalted to His right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins."
[267]  We see here that repentance is given by God in the same way that forgiveness is given by God.
[268]  If there are those here who have not yet been saved and who do not know how to receive God's grace, we must say that God desires to give you grace.
[269]  We have seen in the past few evenings that the way for a person to be saved is not through law-keeping, good works, or repentance.
[270]  I must make one point clear; that is, we are only discussing the way of salvation and not the condition for salvation.
[271]  This is due to the fact that there simply are no conditions required of man for him to be saved.
[272]  We thank God that in recent years He has moved in many places to make many people realize in their conscience what sin is, and thus their need of the Lord Jesus to be their Savior.
[273]  He said that when we receive the Lord Jesus as Savior, we must confess our sins either before God or before men.
[274]  What this man preached was not the gospel of God nor that of the New Testament; he had brought in a human gospel which asserts that unless a person makes confession to man and to God, his sins have yet to be removed from the cross.
[275]  He said that we must believe in the word of the cross, and that if we did not nail our sins to the cross by way of confession, there would be no way for us to be saved, for that would mean that we do not trust the cross.
[276]  Let us come to a verse many love to quote, that is, 1 John 1:9, which says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[277]  There are a number who, based on this verse, state that confession is indeed a requirement for salvation.
[278]  First John 1:9 deals with our problem before God when it says, "If we confess our sins."
[279]  The Gospel of John describes the way a sinner is justified by God, but 1 John indicates how a Christian may restore his fellowship with God.
[280]  There are only three places in the New Testament which record this matter of confession of sins.
[281]  We come now to the third place, which is in Acts 19:18 and 19, which says, "And many of those who had believed came, confessing and making known their practices.
[282]  And a considerable number of those who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them before all; and they counted up the price of them and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver."
[283]  We come now to the fifth "not being."
[284]  There are many people who will add another condition to salvation.
[285]  It is not law-keeping or good behavior, nor is it repentance or confession.
[286]  They base their claim on Romans 10: "Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved" v. 13 . As a result, some believe that they must beseech God before they can be saved.
[287]  They said, "Daily I plead with God to save me, and I still do not know when He will do so.
[288]  I just do not know if God will see fit to save me."
[289]  He thinks that God hates man, and therefore he must pray for God to change His mind before He will save him.
[290]  Because they have never seen God in the light of the gospel, they believe that their begging before God will turn His heart towards them.
[291]  Second, man thinks that he must pray and plead before he can be saved because he simply does not realize that the Lord Jesus has come; He has died and resurrected, all of sin's problems are solved, and all obstacles to salvation are removed.
[292]  The righteousness out of the law results from one's works before God, and the righteousness out of faith is accomplished in us through our believing in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[293]  Verse 8 says, "But what does it say?"
[294]  Paul quoted Moses to show that even Moses preached justification by faith.
[295]  But Paul introduced Moses, saying that Moses also spoke concerning justification by faith when he said, " The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart,' that is, the word of the faith which we proclaim."
[296]  There Moses passed on all of God's law and commandments to the Israelites, telling them that if they failed to obey those commandments and keep the law, God would punish them by scattering them among the nations; and if their hearts would draw near to God in the dispersion, the word would be near them, even in their mouths and in their hearts.
[297]  We have seen the problems God encountered when He prepared this salvation for us and how He completely solved all the problems of sin.
[298]  The first is the concept that in order to be saved, man has to love God: If a man does not love God, he will not be saved.
[299]  Some think that there are evidences in the Bible that prove that man is saved by loving God, and that without loving God a man cannot be saved.
[300]  There are some sinners, when the gospel of salvation by faith is preached to them, who would say that they cannot be saved because they do not love God at all.
[301]  It does not say that man needs to love God so that he would give his son to God, so that God would trust in him and cause him not to perish, but to have eternal life.
[302]  Whatever the Lord Jesus may have meant when He spoke to the lawyer, and whatever the circumstances may have been, all those who are not familiar with the truth and the meaning in God's word would say, "Is it not clear enough that to have eternal life, a man must love God and love his neighbor?
[303]  It is fortunate that this man was quite bothersome.
[304]  He asked this question for no other reason than to justify himself.
[305]  He said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"
[306]  Since the Lord said that he had to love the Lord his God with his whole heart, his whole soul, his whole strength, and his whole mind and to love his neighbor as himself, it would have been awkward for him to ask who God was.
[307]  Did he, a lawyer, not know who his own God was?
[308]  If you tell the sinner to love God with all his heart, soul, strength, and mind, he would say that he has never loved God in his life.
[309]  If you have never heard a word about loving God, you would not know how important it is to love God.
[310]  "But a certain Samaritan, who was journeying, came upon him."
[311]  They think that the Lord Jesus wants us to love our neighbor as ourself.
[312]  Whether it is the Bible schools, the Sunday schools, or the Sunday pulpits, they all tell people that one has to be a good Samaritan.
[313]  You have to love your neighbors, to show mercy to them, and to help them.
[314]  Some people say that a man cannot be saved without being baptized.
[315]  Some would argue that this means if a man has believed but has not been baptized, he is still not saved, because this verse clearly says that he who believes and is baptized shall be saved.
[316]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE WAY OF SALVATION FAITH GOD'S SALVATION BEING FOR EVERYONE
[317]  Over the past few evenings, we have looked at the things that man considers to be ways of salvation.
[318]  If we do not twist the Word of God but trust in it, we will see from it that none of those things are a condition for salvation.
[319]  As we have mentioned already, according to the Bible there is only one condition for salvation faith.
[320]  In over thirty places we are told that through faith we receive this or that from God.
[321]  These places show us that man is favored by God through faith and nothing else.
[322]  Faith is saying that you are willing and that you want it.
[323]  First, God has accomplished redemption by the death of His Son Jesus Christ on the cross.
[324]  His death has taken place, and His resurrection has also taken place.
[325]  The Bible shows clearly that God has put all His Son's work in His Word.
[326]  If God were standing among us today, and He wanted to show us His Son's work and the proof of this work, how could He do it?
[327]  It is God who has placed the work of the Son in the Word, and it is God who communicates to us through the Holy Spirit all the works of the Son contained in the Word.
[328]  Perhaps you may ask, "Why would the Holy Spirit communicate to us all of God's work in His Word when we believe in this Word?"
[329]  The words in 1 John that we just read tell us what faith is.
[330]  Now we have to see how we have to believe.
[331]  In the whole New Testament, there is only one place that tells us the function of faith Hebrews 11:1.
[332]  At the same time, in the whole New Testament, there is only one place that tells us how to believe Mark 11:24: "For this reason I say to you, All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them."
[333]  If you meet a man today who says that he will receive, immediately you know that he does not have faith.
[334]  If you ask someone if he has believed in the Lord Jesus and if he has been saved, and if he tells you that he hopes to be saved, then he surely is not saved.
