<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF TEACHING</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 3:16-17; John 6:63; Eph. 6:17</h1><p>In this series of messages we will cover some important matters related to training teachers to serve with the young people in the Summer School of Truth. What we will consider here will be helpful not only to those who teach in our summer school but to all those who speak for the Lord.<p>We need to have the proper understanding of the words teacher, teaching, and school. Regarding these words we all may have our own “lexicons.” Let us drop the different lexicons and come to the Scriptures as the unique lexicon. The word teaching is found in 2 Timothy 3:16, where we are told that “all Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching.” The only time the word school is used in the New Testament is in Acts 19:9. This verse tells us that when “some were hardened and would not be persuaded, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude,” Paul “withdrew from them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.” Tyrannus might have been a teacher, and Paul might have rented his school and used it as a meeting hall to preach and teach the word of the Lord to both Jews and Gentiles for two years (v. 10). Paul alluded to some kind of school when he told us that he was “trained at the feet of Gamaliel” (22:3), a teacher of the law (5:34).<h2 class=head1>THE SCRIPTURES TEACHING US GOD HIMSELF</h2><p>The reason we need to set aside our personal lexicons and study the words of the Scriptures is that the Scriptures teach us the things of God and the things concerning God. We may even say that the Scriptures teach us God Himself. When some hear this they may ask, “Can we teach God? How can God be taught?” Today’s seminaries do not teach God; they merely teach about God. The Scriptures, on the contrary, teach us God and also teach us the things of God. There is a great difference between teaching about God and teaching God.<h2 class=head1>THE SCRIPTURES BEING GOD-BREATHED</h2><p>However, many Christians do not realize the significance of this difference. When they read the Bible, they read it in the same way as they read a secular book. This is absolutely wrong. The Bible, especially the New Testament, does not teach us to read the Scriptures in a common, secular way. Rather, Ephesians 6:17 and 18 tell us to receive the word of God by means of all prayer and petition. The reason we need to receive the word of God by prayer is that, according to 2 Timothy 3:16, the Scriptures are God-breathed. This indicates that the Scriptures are the breathing out of God. God has breathed Himself out in the Scriptures, and thus our reading of the Scriptures should be our receiving of God’s breath. When God breathes Himself out, He exhales Himself. When we read the Scriptures, or when we receive the Scriptures, we inhale God. Reading the Bible therefore involves both God’s exhaling and our inhaling. This is altogether different from reading a book in a secular way. Unfortunately, many believers read the Bible in the same way as they read a textbook or a newspaper. This is a serious mistake, and we must avoid it as we are taking care of the young people in the Summer School of Truth.<p>We should not conduct the Summer School of Truth in a secular way. Actually, I do not like the word school. Using this word may cause others to think that we intend to teach in a common, secular manner. Some may even have the concept that the ones who take care of the Summer School of Truth should be school teachers by profession. This concept is mistaken. Being a school teacher does not qualify one for serving in our summer school. Do not think that having been a school teacher for many years qualifies someone to teach in our summer school. Those who serve in the Summer School of Truth should not serve according to their natural ability or professional training. Our summer school does not deal with any secular matters, such as mathematics, history, geography, and science. Instead, our summer school is for the handling of the divine truth, that is, the reality of the Triune God. What we intend to teach our young people is the reality of the Triune God. Concerning this, our natural teaching ability does not avail.
