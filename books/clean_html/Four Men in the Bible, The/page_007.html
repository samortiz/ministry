<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING ONE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>Chapter 15 of 1 Corinthians reveals that Christ is the second man, who passed through death and resurrection, becoming the life-giving Spirit (vv. 45, 47) and entering into us to be our life. In this chapter we will consider the third man, the one new man. The third man in the Bible is the church, the corporate one new man. In Christianity few have seen that the church is a corporate man, and even fewer speak of the church in this regard. Although it is common for people to speak about &ldquo;going to church,&rdquo; as if the church were a building like a chapel, this is a low and erroneous concept. A chapel is something without life, but the church is living. The church as the Body of Christ is the highest and most spiritual aspect of the church in the Bible. Although there are other designations for the church, such as the called-out ones and the gathering of the called-out ones, these expressions are not as deep as the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The book of Ephesians shows that the church as the Body of Christ is a man. This is based on 2:14-15, which says, &ldquo;He Himself is our peace, He who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man.&rdquo; <em>Enmity</em> refers to the law of the commandments in ordinances, and <em>both</em> refers to Jewish and Gentile believers. Christ abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances on the cross, that is, the enmity between men, so that He might create both Jewish and Gentile believers in Himself into one new man. From these two groups, the Lord created one new man in Himself. This proves that the one new man is not an individual but a corporate man.</p>
<p>Verse 16 continues: &ldquo;And might reconcile both in one Body to God.&rdquo; Many know that the church is the Body, but few see that the church is one new man. However, verses 15 and 16 show that the one new man in verse 15 is the Body in verse 16, and that the Body in verse 16 is the one new man in verse 15. Chapter 1 speaks of the church as His Body (vv. 22-23), and verses 15 and 16 of chapter 2 show that this Body is one new man. Therefore, the church is not only the Body of Christ but also one new man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON<br />
AND LETTING HIM MAKE HOME IN US</h2>
<p>There are distinctions between the Body and the one new man. Because there is life within the human body, our body is a part of us, but the life that we have is also related to a person. We have life, and we are a person. Although a tree is a living entity, we cannot say that a tree is a person. However, human beings are both living entities and persons. Within our body there is life, and within our human being there is a person. A person can experience pain, be angry, and cry out when he is hit by another person, but a tree does not experience pain, become angry, or cry out when it is hit. It has no sense of pleasure, anger, sorrow, or joy. Neither does it have a preference, a will, or a mind. We cannot say that it is not living, because its growth proves that it is alive. However, it has only life; it has no person. Human beings are different because a human being is also a person. Human beings can be angry, laugh, and think. Similarly, the church is more than the Body of Christ with Christ as its life; it is also the one new man with Christ as its person.</p>
<p>Christ is not only in us to be our life; He is in us to be our person. Hence, Ephesians 3:17 speaks of Christ making His home in our hearts. Making home is a matter related to being a person. When we buy a table and place it in our home, we do not say that the table has made its home in our home. However, if I come to live in your home, this would involve my making home in your home. A wooden table has no person, and consequently, it is unable to make home in our home. Even if it is a beautiful table, it will feel nothing if it is kicked. In contrast, I could live in your home and even make my home in your home because I am a person. Being a person is higher than simply having life. The church is not only the Body of Christ with Christ as its life; the church is also the one new man with Christ as its person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD WANTING A CORPORATE MAN</h2>
<p>When the first man failed, God came to be the second man, Jesus. With Him there was no failure related to God&rsquo;s purpose for man. Jesus expressed God, dealt with Satan, redeemed sinners, became the dwelling place of God, and even became food for us to serve God as priests. Even though He was successful in every way, He was an individual man in His human living. However, God wants a corporate man, not an individual man. Genesis 1:26 says, &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness, and let them...&rdquo; In Hebrew <em>man</em> is singular because God created one man, Adam. Although God created one man, the pronoun that refers to this one man in the verse is not the singular <em>him</em> but the plural <em>them.</em> How many men did God create? Acts 17:26 says, &ldquo;He made from one every nation of men.&rdquo; This shows that God originally created one man, not many; nevertheless, this man is a corporate man.</p>
<p>Adam is a corporate man; Adam&rsquo;s descendants were all included in him. If Adam had died of an accident on the second day of his creation, we would not be here. Adam was a corporate man, but the Lord Jesus was an individual man while He was on the earth. However, as a grain of wheat, He fell into the ground and died in order to bear much fruit (John 12:24). As a grain of wheat the Lord Jesus died and rose in resurrection to produce us as many grains. As many grains that have been blended together, we have become a corporate new man in Christ. Individuals cannot accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose; therefore, God wants a corporate man. God&rsquo;s purpose cannot be fulfilled in the Lord Jesus as just an individual. Therefore, He passed through death and resurrection in order to bring forth many grains to produce a corporate man in Himself.</p>
