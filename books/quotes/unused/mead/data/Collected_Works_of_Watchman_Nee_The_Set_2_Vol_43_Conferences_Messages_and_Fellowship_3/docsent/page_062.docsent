   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RESTORATIVE FORGIVENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Most of us have experienced the two kinds of forgiveness spoken of above.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have obtained God's forgiveness, and His children have testified that our sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These are past accomplished facts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The other three kinds of forgiveness are not accomplished facts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are things that we experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once our previous sins those we committed before we were saved are forgiven, they are forever settled before God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When God forgives, His forgiveness is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After we are saved, however, we can still sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot say that we have become perfect, but we should not say that we are altogether evil either.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whatever we are, it is hard for us to avoid falling into sin after our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we sin our conscience condemns us, and our fellowship with God is interrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Restorative forgiveness has to do with our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once the issue of life is settled, it will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God has regenerated us, and there is no way for Him to deny our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is no way for Him to deny us as sons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, God has begotten us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the other hand, we have received eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our Father-son relationship with God in life can never be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Life never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, fellowship does change.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a son sins, he feels ashamed when he sees his father because there is a problem with fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we sin, we are no longer as bold to meet God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We become fearful of Him, and we even are afraid to see our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that sin has damaged our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What then shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to confess to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we were saved, we did not confess every sin that we had committed; no one has the mental capacity to remember all of his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we were saved, we only needed to confess that we were sinners and to believe in the redemption of God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God then forgave us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eternal forgiveness was granted the minute we believed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, since we are regenerated and alive and since we are able to tell right from wrong, we have to confess our sins to God one by one before we can secure our forgiveness in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we have offended our brothers, we must confess to them as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must ask God for forgiveness concerning our offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to acknowledge what we say and do as sins and ask God for forgiveness before our fellowship with Him can be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some people do not experience the joy of salvation after they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They do not act like children of God; in- stead, they act like adopted children.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They feel this way because they are not confessing their sins, and they are not in fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, we must deal thoroughly with every sin that we commit each day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to maintain ourselves in constant fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today we are walk- ing in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our feet can become defiled with dirt and uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We live in this world, in an unclean society.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Day by day we have weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is true that Christians need not sin, and it is possible for us not to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Unfortunately, we sometimes sin and become separated from God in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we come to God, we have to acknowledge our sinful acts honestly and ask Him for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do this, our fellowship with God will be restored; our hearts will be filled with the joy of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we allow any barrier to come between us and God in our fellowship, we will become cold and dark within because the light has gone out from us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The secret of the Christian life is maintaining oneself in constant fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must maintain ourselves in a holy position and walk in a holy way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many believers say in their heart that they will never fall.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But once they fall, they are shattered; they roll on the floor and can no longer rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must rise up and ask God for forgiveness, and we must recover the sweet fellowship we had with God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the forgiveness mentioned in 1 John 1:9.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>GOVERNMENTAL FORGIVENESS</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This kind of forgiveness is related to our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It involves God's arrangement, sovereignty, discipline, and hand.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we have offended God and have confessed to Him, He will forgive our sins and will recover our fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But this does not mean that the case is completely settled.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>David confessed to God after he sinned, and Nathan told him that God had taken away his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, he also told him that the sword would never depart from his house because he had taken another man's wife to be his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He had done it in secret, but the Lord recompensed him under the sun 2 Sam 12:7-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is easy to obtain forgiveness from God when we sin, but it is not that simple a thing when God's disciplining hand is upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We reap whatever we sow.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We may struggle and wonder why we have encountered all the things that we have encountered, while others are left alone.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should realize that this is God's disciplining hand.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should not reject it; rather, we should submit ourselves under the mighty hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At the right time, His disciplining hand will leave.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the meaning of governmental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>FORGIVENESS IN THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Many people treat others too harshly in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the kingdom age, they will be disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Lord says, "For with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you in return" Luke 6:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we treat others in a mean way and criticize others mercilessly, God will deal with us in the same way in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, we have to be careful about the way we deal with others today.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The way we deal with others will be the way that God will deal with us in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>May the Lord grant us the grace to be those who show mercy to others, who do not deal with others in meanness, sharpness, or severity so that we can obtain mercy from God in that day Matt 5:7 .</S>
