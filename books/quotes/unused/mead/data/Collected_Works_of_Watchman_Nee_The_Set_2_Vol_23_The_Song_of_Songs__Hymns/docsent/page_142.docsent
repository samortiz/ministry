   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hymns, #225</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face;</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here faith can touch and handle things unseen;</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here would I grasp with firmer hand Thy grace,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And all my weariness upon Thee lean.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here would I feed upon the Bread of God;</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here drink with Thee the royal wine of heav'n;</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here would I lay aside each earthly load;</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiv'n.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have no help but Thine; nor do I need</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another arm save Thine to lean upon;</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is enough, my Lord, enough indeed;</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>My strength is in Thy might, Thy might alone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the hour of banquet and of song;</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the heav'nly table spread for me;</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here let me feast, and, feasting, still prolong</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The brief bright hour of fellowship with Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The feast, though not the love, is past and gone;</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The bread and wine remove, but Thou art here,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nearer than ever still our Shield and Sun.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Feast after feast thus comes and passes by,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet passing, points to the glad feast above,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Giving sweet foretastes of the festal joy,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lamb's great bridal-feast of bliss and love.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My will is weak, my strength is frail,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And all my hope is nearly gone;</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I can but trust Thy working true</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To gently hold and lead me on.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I've tried my best, but still have failed,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>E'en as before I've failed and erred;</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thy patience is my only trust</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To hold and keep me to Thy word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whene'er my heart is lifted up,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How very near I am to fall;</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I dare not do, I dare not think,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I need Thyself in great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thou art my Savior, strength and stay,</S>
