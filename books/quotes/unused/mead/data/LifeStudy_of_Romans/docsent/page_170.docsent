   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FORTY-NINE REIGNING IN LIFE OVER SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To reign in life is to subdue three main enemies: Satan, sin, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider the matter of reigning in life over Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>SATAN, SIN, AND THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Satan is the source of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we have pointed out a number of times, sin is the nature of Satan injected into man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the revelation of the Bible, Satan as sin is in our flesh, in our fallen, contaminated body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 7:18 says, For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, nothing good dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When God created man, He created him with a body that was pure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But when Satan injected himself as sin into man s body, the body became corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, in the Bible man s body is called the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In our flesh we are one with Satan, for the flesh is Satan s dwelling place in man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the same principle, our spirit is the Lord s dwelling place in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A saved person is rather complicated because Satan as sin is in his flesh and the Lord as the life-giving Spirit is in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Satan, sin, and the flesh go together.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Satan injected his evil nature into man, Satan became sin in man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the nature of sin was injected into man s body, the body was transmuted into flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, Satan, sin, and the flesh are mutually related within man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we would overcome Satan and reign in life over him, we need to recognize that Satan as sin dwells in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because Satan is the source of both sin and death, he is the greatest enemy of all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not sufficient to reign over sin and death without subduing Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must also defeat the source of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we shall truly be able to reign in life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE WAY TO OVERCOME SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now we must consider the way to overcome Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In her writings, Mrs. Jesse Penn-Lewis had a great deal to say about overcoming Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, although I put her suggestions into practice, what she suggested did not work for me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What Mrs. Penn-Lewis wrote regarding this matter was correct, but I had no way to apply it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since the time Mrs. Penn-Lewis wrote her best books, more than fifty years have gone by.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By the Lord s mercy and grace, the saints have gone on during these years to see two important matters related to spiritual warfare: the Body and life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A MATTER OF LIFE AND THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the early 1940s Brother Nee gave a number of messages in Shanghai on the subject of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He told us that spiritual warfare is not an individual matter, but a Body matter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Satan is the enemy of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, in order to overcome him, we must stand with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spiritual Man, completed in 1928, presented spiritual warfare as an individual matter, not as a Body matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this reason, after he had come to see the Body, Brother Nee told some of us that he did not want to have it reprinted.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have not only seen the Body, but we have also seen the place of the divine life in dealing with God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Life is nothing less than the Triune God dispensed into us to be our content.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the book of Romans, life and the Body are one; they are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If there is no life, then there can be no Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Life is the content, and the Body is the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>SATAN CRUSHED UNDER OUR FEET</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Romans Paul does not mention Satan by name until 16:20.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this verse Paul says, Now the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Greek word rendered your in this verse is plural; this points to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God will crush Satan under the feet of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Romans 16 does not refer to the Body in a universal sense, but it refers to the local and practical expression of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that Satan can only be crushed under the feet of the practical expression of the Body in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we speak about the Body in a doctrinal way, we have nothing but terminology.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is only when we have a proper local church as the practical expression of the Body that Satan is crushed under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This practical expression of the Body is possible only through the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may have the experience of redemption and salvation, but if we do not experience the divine life, it is impossible to have the practical expression of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Body of Christ is built up with Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Satan is overcome by life and by the Body.</S>
