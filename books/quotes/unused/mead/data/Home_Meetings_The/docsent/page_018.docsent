   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR FAITH, OUR SPIRIT, AND THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now you all have to practice the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the home meetings you all have to learn to speak by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This faith, as we have seen in the last message, is wrapped up with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This spirit is not merely our spirit nor merely the Holy Spirit, but is altogether a mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We know today that we have a mingled spirit within us, the Holy Spirit mingling with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we would not care for the environment or the circumstances, but would only care for what the Bible says, we exercise our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever we exercise our faith, our spirit is involved and the Holy Spirit is also there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here we have three things: our faith, our spirit, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all must learn to speak in any kind of meeting by faith, by our spirit, and by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, the three things are just one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we speak by faith, we exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we exercise our spirit, the Holy Spirit is moving in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This makes a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Speak what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we would exercise our believing ability, faith will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we speak what the Bible says, the spirit is there and the Holy Spirit is also there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This makes our speaking so living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today we are not in the Old Testament times.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are not in that economy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are in the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this economy God has poured out His Spirit upon us already.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This Spirit is both dwelling within us and resting upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is like the blowing wind and the air.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we would just open the window, we would have the blowing and we would have the air.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the New Testament dispensation the wind is blowing all the day and the air is here all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to believe this according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we have the Spirit within us and the Spirit upon us as well.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we are just those baptized in the Spirit and drinking the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the New Testament, especially in the Acts, the baptism of the Spirit refers to the descending of the Spirit upon the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The baptism in the Spirit and the descending of the Spirit both refer to the same fact.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Old Testament the word baptism or baptize was not used, but the thought of descending is there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit of Jehovah descended upon His people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This descending of the Spirit is like the baptism of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This baptism has been fully accomplished and the issue now is resting upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not only so, we have to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even at home when you talk to your family concerning Christ, you have to exercise your faith, and you have to exercise your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You have to believe that the Spirit is upon you as well as in you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even when you are talking to your children, you have to talk in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Regretfully, we feel that it is only when we are to release a message that we need faith, the spirit, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not feel this need when we talk to our wife, to our husband, to our parents, or to our children.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our speaking to them in this way, without faith, may put them to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the divine speaking could never make people sleepy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather it stirs up people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we would practice the divine speaking, we would become accustomed to it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then on the Lord s Day we would come to the meeting speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We would not come to the meeting silent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We would be used to speaking the divine speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this way we would speak with faith, with the spirit, and with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have a heavy burden because I feel it is hard for me to stir up your heart and turn your mentality to pay full attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the meeting you nod your head to me but when you leave, you just forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You do not practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Would you promise that from now on you would begin to practice this all the time?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you do not have anyone to speak to, you can just speak to the air.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Maybe some angels would be there and some demons would be there listening to your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Anyhow, just speak in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Speak, speak, speak.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Speak by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When you do this by the exercise of your believing ability, your spirit is involved and the Holy Spirit is also involved.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then your speaking becomes divine.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is a kind of divine speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Those who are silent in the meetings may say, Brother Lee, don t blame me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You have to blame God who created me this way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is my makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I didn t do it, God did it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Brother Lee, you have to thank God for His mercy that He created you in this way speaking, speaking, speaking all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I was not created by God in this way and I cannot speak.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To say this is to annul Paul s word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Paul says you all can prophesy.</S>
