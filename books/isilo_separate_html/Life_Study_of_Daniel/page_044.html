To Him Being Given Dominion,<br>Glory, and a Kingdom, That All the Peoples,<br>Nations, and Languages Might Serve Him</H2><P>To Him was given dominion, glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages might serve Him. His dominion is an eternal dominion, which will not pass away, and His kingdom is one that will not be destroyed (v. 14; Luke 19:12, 15a). This is Christ's kingdom; it is also God's kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Coming as a Stone Cut Out without Hands<br>to Strike the Great Human Image</H2><P>In His second appearing Christ will come as a stone (Matt. 21:44b) cut out without hands (not by man's hands) to strike the great human image (the human government on earth) on its feet of iron and clay (the Roman Empire under Antichrist) and crush the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold (the entire human government on earth). All the materials of the great image will become like chaff from the summer threshing floors, and the wind will carry them away so that no trace of them will be found (Dan. 2:34-35a, 45a). The cumulative culture of all the empires signified by the gold, the silver, the bronze, the iron, and the clay will be crushed by this stone. Thus, the Lord will clear up the entire old creation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Becoming a Great Mountain</H2><P>As the stone cut out without hands, Christ will become a great mountain (a great kingdom&#151;the eternal kingdom of God) and will fill the whole earth forever and ever (2:35b, 44). In Mark 4 He was sown as a little seed to be the kingdom of God, but He grows in His increase to become a stone, the increased kingdom of God. Then He will increase further and further until He becomes the great mountain, the eternal kingdom of God. This is the Christ who fills all in all, and the church is His Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Christ's Coming Terminating<br>the Entire Human Government and Bringing In the Eternal Kingdom of God</H2><P>Christ's coming will terminate the entire human government on earth from its end to its beginning, and it will bring in the eternal kingdom of God.</P><P>The crushing of the great human image from the toes to the head will be Christ's universal judgment upon the aggregate of the human government from Antichrist back to Nimrod. In this way Christ will clear up the old creation. In His first coming Christ terminated the old creation through His death on the cross. Then in His resurrection He germinated the new creation. All this is mysterious. Outwardly, the world remains the same, and the human government that began with Nimrod continues to exist. For this reason, there is the need of Christ's second coming, His second appearing, to clear up the old creation outwardly and physically by His smashing the great human image. That clearing up of the old creation in its human government will usher in the universal and eternal kingdom of God. In the kingdom the Lord will enjoy the fruit of His work&#151;being one with His redeemed people.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> </body></html>
