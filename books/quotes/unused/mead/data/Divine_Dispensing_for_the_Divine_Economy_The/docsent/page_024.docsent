   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FATHER EMBODIED IN THE SON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE SON REALIZED AS THE SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>DISPENSING THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>INTO THE BELIEVERS AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AND LIFE SUPPLY IN ABUNDANCE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this way, the processed Triune God is dispensed into the believers as life and the life supply in abundance John 14:9-11, 16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son as the Spirit is realized in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God the Father is hidden, God the Son is manifested among men, and God the Spirit enters into man to be his life, his life supply, and his everything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the Father in the Son and the Son as the Spirit are man's portion that man may enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE ISSUE OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY AS THE DIVINE LIFE The Flowing of Rivers of Living Water</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>as the Bountiful Supply of the Divine Riches</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 7:38-39a says, "He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The issue of our breathing, drinking, and eating Christ is first the flowing of rivers of living water as the bountiful supply of the divine riches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fruit-bearing</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second issue of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity as the divine life is fruit-bearing John 15:5, 16a .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are the branches of Christ, who is the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As branches we should bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John 15 does not merely speak of the preaching of the gospel to save sinners, because John is a Gospel of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In John 15, the preaching of the gospel is the bearing of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fruit-bearing is the flowing out of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the inner life flows out, there is an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This expression is fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everyone who goes out to lead sinners to be saved must be one with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not breathe, drink, and eat Jesus, we will not have the authority when we preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our gospel will not be powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must be the breathers, drinkers, and eaters of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must have Jesus within us, not merely as a king, but as our breath, water, and food.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many of the dear saints love the Lord and the Lord's recovery very much and are seeking to practice the new way for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, they are practicing the new way in an old way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When they knock on people's doors for the gospel, they are fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then when they speak with people, they do not command them but rather converse with them in the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, the people may argue with them, and the time will be wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must not take the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To talk to people in this way is not effective.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Matthew 28:18-19 the Lord said, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must realize that it is Jesus and not we who initiate our going out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Jesus charged us to go with His authority to disciple the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we go to people, we should say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Amen, Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am going and You are going with me."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we can tell people, "The Lord Jesus sent me to you to tell you that He is your Savior and you must believe in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can command them to pray, and after they pray, we can command them to be baptized into the name of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have mistakenly believed that we must teach people before they can be saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Matthew 28:19 first says that we should disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After this, verse 20 says that we should teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A mother cannot teach her child before the child is delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After the child is delivered, there will be many years to teach him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether or not a new believer understands what has happened, his prayer and baptism are accomplished facts, and what he has done in the name of the Lord Jesus counts in God's view.</S>
