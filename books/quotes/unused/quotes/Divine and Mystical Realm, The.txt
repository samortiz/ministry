The different understandings of the Divine Trinity have been a major factor, a hidden element, of all the problems in today's Christianity
Many believers do not realize that Christ is not merely the only begotten Son of God but also the firstborn Son of God
According to the revelation in the New Testament, the Father is embodied in the Son , and the Son is realized by the Spirit
The historical background of the Lord's word was related to the Feast of Tabernacles, the last and greatest of the Jewish annual feasts
His word indicates an expectationthe expectation that although the Spirit was not yet the time was coming when the Spirit would be there
2 Corinthians 3:17 says that 'the Lord is the Spirit,' and the following verse uses 'the Lord Spirit' as a compound divine title
One of these coworkers who eventually became an opponent said that he did not believe that Christ the Son could become the lifegiving Spirit
We should believe and teach both that God became the flesh and that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit
With this compound ointment we have the number one signifying the one God and the number four signifying man as God's creature
The amount of the spices consisted of three units of five hundred shekels, or five hundred shekels times three
We should note the second unit of five hundred shekels was split into two parts , each of two hundred fifty shekels
With this compound ointment we have the number five, formed by adding the one hin of olive oil and the four spices
In Matthew 25 the ten virgins are divided into two groups consisting of the five wise ones and the five foolish ones
From all the foregoing we see that the numbers one two three four and five are all used in the type of the compound ointment in Exodus 30
The type of the anointing ointment was completely fulfilled in the life-giving Spirit, which was produced in Christ's resurrection
The life-giving Spirit is therefore the compound Spirit typified by the anointing ointment in the Old Testament
In verse 2 we have the Spirit of life and in verses 9 to 11 the Spirit of God the Spirit of Christ Christ Himself and the indwelling Spirit
Corinthians 3:17 says, 'The Lord is the Spirit,' and verse 18 says that we are transformed 'from the Lord Spirit'
Today our Christ is the pneumatic Christ, the pneumatized Christ, the Christ who is both the Lord and the Spirit
As the last Adam in the flesh, Christ could be our Redeemer, but He could not enter into us to impart Himself to us as life
Because of this degradation, the life-giving Spirit, who is both Christ and the Spirit, became intensified sevenfold
The Lord's recovery today is just the recovery of these critical points concerning the Spirit of God in the move of God's eternal economy
We thank You, Lord, that You have chosen us and have even appointed us with a commission to carry out Your eternal economy
Lord, we ask You to take away all the veils, all the logic, theologies, philosophies, and traditional teachings
We believe that You are here sitting with us wanting to have an intimate facetoface talk about Your career according to Your eternal economy
If we would enter into the realm of Christ's heavenly ministry, a realm which is altogether mystical, we need to know the mystical Christ
Concerning Christ's incarnation, there are two kinds of records in the New Testament-a physical record and a mystical record
In the synoptic Gospels, the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the record of the Lord's incarnation is altogether physical
The coworkers and the elders who take the lead in the Lords recovery must realize that the Lords recovery is resting upon their shoulders
We should not linger in this realm but should pass through it quickly, like those who are taking an express train
According to Genesis 6:3, when man fell to such an extent that he had become flesh, God decided to destroy man from the face of the earth
John 1:14 says not that the Word became a man nor that the Word became a person but that the Word became flesh
Because flesh is something condemned by God, many Christians do not have the boldness to teach that Christ was flesh
Christ was in the flesh for thirty-three and a half years, from His incarnation to become the flesh to His all-inclusive death
Some are not even on the escalator but are still on the 'ground floor'; they have not yet begun to experience the procedure
It is extremely important that we differentiate between the procedure of God's complete salvation and the purpose of His complete salvation
Christ's being the life-giving Spirit is a most important qualification for Christ to carry out His heavenly ministry
As the lifegiving Spirit Christ is carrying out His heavenly ministry by accomplishing Gods organic salvation subjectively in eight steps
We can see a sharp contrast: earthly versus heavenly, physical versus mystical, judicial versus organic, and objective versus subjective
Regeneration is to generate the redeemed believers with the divine life that they may be born of God to be His children of His species
Renewing is to have our mind changed in our religion, logic, and philosophy concerning the universe, mankind, God, etc
Building up is a matter of the believers' growth in the divine life and their being joined together with other believers in the divine life
We have been regenerated in our spirit and we now are being transformed in our soul, but our body is still the old creation
If we do not properly control our body according to the divine attributes expressed through the human virtues our body becomes an ugly thing
The sonship is of the Spirit, and the Spirit is saturating us with the sonship until our body is saturated with the sonship
We are being saved organically and subjectively through the heavenly ministry of the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit
To experience this organic salvation, we all need to enter into the mystical realm of Christ's heavenly ministry
Much later, when the Israelites, God's chosen people, were in trouble, God came down to help them as the Spirit of Jehovah
The Spirit of Jehovah was God coming near to His people in order to help them in an objective way but not in a subjective way
The Old Testament is a record mainly of two things: God's creation and the history of Israel, God's chosen people
In God's creation the Spirit was the Spirit of God, and in God's helping Israel the Spirit was the Spirit of Jehovah
God's becoming a man was something altogether new, and for this new thing a particular title is used for the Spirit of God-the Holy Spirit
The title the Holy Spirit was used with respect to the incarnation because the incarnation was something utterly holy
The Spirit who carried this out was not only the Spirit of God nor only the Spirit of Jehovah but the Holy Spirit
On the last day of the feast, the great day, He stood and cried out, saying, 'If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink
In resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit, and now He can come into the believers to impart life to them
Because many Christians have not seen the revelation in the Bible concerning the consummated Spirit, they need to be reeducated
We have seen that the Spirit has been consummated and that Christ has become the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ
At the beginning of this section the Lord Jesus indicated, in 14:1, that He intended to speak something to help us to believe into Him
In 14:1 the Lord Jesus spoke about believing into God and into Him, but here He suddenly spoke about His Father's house
To speak of living water becoming in us a spring of water gushing up into eternal life is also to speak in a mystical way
According to verse 6 Jesus said to him, 'I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me'
The phrase except through Me reveals that we can come to the Father as the house only through Christ as the way
In the next verse the Lord Jesus said If you had known Me you would have known My Father also and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him
The Christ who was in the flesh went through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ
Because He lives in resurrection, we also live, for we were regenerated in His resurrection, as revealed in 1 Peter 1:3
That day' was the day of His resurrection , the day on which He became the pneumatized Christ, the pneumatic Christ
Praise the Lord that, as believers in Christ, we are now in the divine, mystical realm of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ!
We all need to enter into the divine and mystical realm, not of the Triune God, but of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ
John 141618 speaks of another Comforter the Spirit of reality to be the reality of the Son realized as the Sons presence in the believers
By all this we can know that the Son is in the Father, that the believers are in the Son, and that the Son is in the believers
Following this, whatever Christ possesses is heard and received by the Spirit, who declares all these things to the believers
All the believers should abide in the Son that the Son may abide in them that they may bear much fruit for the glorification of the Father
In John 14-16 the Lord Jesus presented a message to His disciples, and then in John 17 He prayed to the Father
In His concluding prayer He indicated that our oneness should be in the Triune God, with the pneumatic Christ and the consummated Spirit
The believers are one with the Triune God in the divine and mystical realm of the pneumatic Christ and the consummated Spirit
Christ's heavenly ministry is carried out in this mystical realm, and God's organic salvation is practically accomplished in this realm
If we are not in this realm, we cannot participate in Christ's heavenly ministry or enjoy God's organic salvation
Note: God's intention in His organic salvation is to join the believer's spirit with His Spirit as one spirit-a mingled spirit-1 Cor
Lord, You have created for us a human spirit, and in Your organic salvation the first thing You do is to regenerate our spirit
Eventually, Lord, You put Yourself as such a Spirit in our spirit and mingled with our spirit to make us one spirit
Regretfully, even in the Lord's recovery, many of the elders and even the co-workers do not know their real status
The Spirit of reality came to convict the sinners concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment
Are Adam, the source of sin; Christ, the source of righteousness; and Satan, the one who should bear the judgment
The Spirit of reality came to convict us of this, causing us to repent of our fallen condition and enter into the death and burial of Christ
Right away the Spirit of God with the spirit of the regenerated believers witnesses that they are the children of God
When the Holy Spirit who dwells in and is mingled with our spirit spreads into our mind, that mingled spirit becomes the spirit in our mind
In Matthew 16:24 the Lord says that if we want to come after Him we need to deny ourselves and take up our cross
To put on the new man is to live and magnify Christ through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
The Lord uses the environmental sufferings to consume, to kill, our outer man that our inner man may be renewed day by day
Corinthians 416 says Therefore we do not lose heart but though our outer man is decaying yet our inner man is being renewed day by day
Since we believers all will be the consummating part of the New Jerusalem, we have to be renewed to be as new as the New Jerusalem
Our digestion and assimilation of food are a kind of metabolism to receive a new element and discharge the old element
When the peculiarity of each brother comes out, it will be hard for them to coordinate, needless to say to grow together as a building
Perhaps a certain brother feels that he cannot go along with another brother because of that brother's strong peculiarity
Paul's writings unveil to us that the church, the Body of Christ, as the dwelling place of God is in our spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God
It is by the Spirit living in us as a foundation; then the Father and the Son come to us to make a mutual abode with us
In God's organic salvation, first our life is touched, that is, God in regeneration puts Himself into our spirit to be our life
Through regeneration we began to have another life which was added into our old life, and this life is God's life
The Body is the aggregate of all the believers who through transformation have been conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God
Glorification is the final step of God's organic salvation in Christ which brings the conformed believers into God's glory
On the other hand, this glory saturates us from within by the inking of the sealing Spirit throughout our entire Christian life
Through sanctification our distorted, crooked, perverted, natural nature is adjusted and straightened with His holy nature
When we attain this glory, we will say, 'Lord God, what a mercy and grace that we are what You are, and You are what we are'
Gods full salvation is not just to redeem us judicially to forgive us wash us justify us reconcile us to Him and sanctify us positionally
He also wrote 2 John, which is an Epistle revealing the prohibition against heresy, which was already creeping into the church
The book of Revelation gives us a full record of the move of the sevenfold Spirit in Christ's heavenly ministry to do a number of things
We are saved from degradation by the speaking of the unlimited, life-releasing, sevenfold intensified pneumatic Christ
The overcoming of the degradation is by the participation of the overcoming saints who are living in their spirit
The coming Antichrist and his false prophet will be human enemies of Christ, attacking Christ to the uttermost
Christ's sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry is for the binding of Satan and the casting of him into the abyss for one thousand years
His sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry is also for the bringing in of the kingdom of Christ and of God, which will be the millennium
The conclusion of the entire Bible is a couple, which is the consummation of the universal romance of the redeeming God and His redeemed man
Lord, thank You that all the time we depend upon Your mercy, Your blessing, Your provisions, the Word and the Spirit, and Your presence
You are everything to us for the purpose of making us the same as You are in life and in nature but not in Your Godhead
The ground and the oneness are unique, which means that the ground for the church and the oneness for the Body are just one
For its existence, expression, and practice, the church surely needs a place, and that place according to the New Testament is a locality
Brother Watchman Nee pointed out that God was very wise in His way of building up the church on the local ground
Everywhere around the globe there are believers in Christ, and they should not be scattered but gathered together to be a church
If there were not the proper limitation of the ground, there would be no limitation to the setting up of churches
All the denominations have divisive grounds, including the Southern Baptists, the Presbyterians, and the Lutherans
If we believers keep the pattern set up by God in the Bible to have one church in one city, we can keep the oneness
The first gathering of the Christians was in Jerusalem, and Acts 8:1 calls that gathering the church in Jerusalem
Those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, are the constituents as the framework of the church
The Triune God is the contents of the church, with the Spirit as the essence, the Lord as the element, and the Father as the source
As called saints, Christ is our portion, and we have been called into the enjoyment, the fellowship, of Christ as the center
Some said that they were of Paul others that they were of Apollos others that they were of Cephas and still others that they were of Christ
The Japanese flavor, the Chinese flavor, the Taiwanese flavor, and the American flavor all have to be crossed out
We do not and should not participate in the Catholic heresy, the Protestant denominations, and any kind of free groups of Christians
There are four kinds of people we cannot tolerate: people who are divisive, factious, worshipping idols, or still living in sin
Also, we do not have any creed; we have only the unique Bible properly translated and interpreted by and according to the Bible itself
The renewing in the Bible is that our old man should be crossed out and consumed so that the new man within us can be renewed
All of the virtues in the Christian life should be through the cross and by the Spirit to dispense Christ for the church
Also, we do not love people for our interest but for the dispensing of Christ and for the building up of the Body
Even God the Father Himself, in a certain sense, is triune because He is above us, through us, and in us-in three directions
In the Body of Christ the Triune God is the contents-the Father is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence
In our coordination in the church life, in the Lord's work, we all have to learn not to do anything without fellowship
We may not be used to it, but after we begin to practice blending a few times, we will acquire the taste for it
Today it is very convenient for us to blend with one another because of this modern age with its modern conveniences
We should learn how to follow the Spirit, how to dispense Christ, and how to say and do something for the benefit of the Body
