   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTY-NINE THE WAY TO OVERCOME Date: August 11, 1937</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Singapore</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Luke 18:18-24; 19:1-10; 2 Cor 12:9 VICTORY BEING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During the past evenings, we have seen how the Lord Jesus gave His flesh to us as our true food, that is, how He gave His life to us to become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our victory does not depend on Christ helping, empowering, or strengthening us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The victory revealed in the Bible is a victory that belongs to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Victory is Christ in us, living for us and overcoming for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The whole issue rests on whether it is us or Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most people think that they have to depend on themselves to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if it were up to us, the good-tempered ones would overcome easily while the ill-tempered ones would not overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, victory has nothing to do with our natural goodness or wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everything depends on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A person who is gentle and a person who is bad-tempered equally need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Victory has nothing to do with our natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The only issue is whether or not we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we have Christ, we will overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE WAY TO OVERCOME</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>BY CHRIST AND NOT BY OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today we want to consider the way to let Christ live in us and the way to let Him overcome for us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let us read from Luke 18 and 19.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In chapter eighteen there is a rich man, and in chapter nineteen there is another rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In chapter eighteen there is a ruler, and in chapter nineteen there is another ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Chapter eighteen speaks of a young man, while chapter nineteen speaks of an old man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The rich man in chapter eighteen came and sought the Lord, while the rich man in chapter nineteen tried to see the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both were interested in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we put these two passages together, we will find out the way to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first rich man came to the Lord in search of eternal life; he desired to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He asked the Lord, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Luke 18:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eternal life is the life of God, the uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How can we receive this life?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord said to him, "You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and mother'" v. 20 . The Lord showed him what he should do, and the young ruler boasted that he had kept these from his youth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then the Lord said, "Still you lack one thing: all that you have, sell and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If there is anyone who is rich among us tonight, your heart may wince at this word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Selling all that one has, distributing it to the poor, and following the Lord seem to be impossible things to do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One may yield to other commands, but the command to give up one's own money is too much of a demand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, the issue was not for the rich man to do certain things to inherit eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the young man asked what he should do to inherit eternal life, the Lord told him not to commit adultery, steal, or bear false witness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord was not saying that he had to do all these things before he could inherit eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was showing him that he could not keep the commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord was not showing him how high the requirement for eternal life was and how far below God's standard the ruler's condition was.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord's goal was to expose his weakness and convince him that he could do nothing to save himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The young man did not realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He answered that he had done all these things from his youth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord then told him that he still lacked one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The one thing that the young man lacked was to give up his riches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord said that he still lacked one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every person lacks one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may think that we are patient, humble, loving, and holy, and that we have been this way since our youth, but the Lord always comes back with one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The thing that is lacking may be different in different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Perhaps we are stubborn, arrogant, or talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The "one thing" is not the same for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some are lacking this one thing, while others are lacking that one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our experience tells us that everyone is different in his own failures and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No one can commit all the sins at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every person has a certain sin that he is not able to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Victory and defeat are measured by that one sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many people do not commit adultery or steal, but they cannot give their money to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They can honor their parents and not bear false witness, but they still lack one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may overcome many sins before God and think that we have overcome, but we should not be too quick.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Have we really overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We still lack one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Everyone has one thing, one particular sin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This one thing determines a person's defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Defeat and victory are determined by the way we deal with that one sin, the sin that has been entangling us all our life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One or two sins have been following us all of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whichever way we turn, we always come across them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sooner or later we meet them again.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They seem to have a fondness for us, and we seem to habitually commit these sins.</S>
