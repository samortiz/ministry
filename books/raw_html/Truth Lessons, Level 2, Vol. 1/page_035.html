	<h2 class="head1">VI. THE CONSUMMATION OF THE COVENANT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. With Better Sacrifices</h2>
<p>The old covenant was consummated through the sacrifice of bulls and goats as burnt offerings and peace offerings (Exo. 24:4-5); the new covenant was consummated through the offering of Jesus Christ Himself as the sacrifice (Heb. 9:14, 23; 10:12). As Christ is the eternal Son of the living God incarnated to be the Son of Man, who offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit, so His sacrifices are better than all the sacrifices of the old covenant. Bulls and goats as sacrifices were shadows which could never take away sins (Heb. 10:11), but He as the sacrifices is the reality of the shadows, and He has put away sin once for all, thus finding an eternal redemption (Heb. 9:26, 12), fully satisfying God&rsquo;s desire, and enabling the believers in Him to have peace and fellowship with God that both God and man may be satisfied (Rom. 5:1; Col. 1:20-22; 2 Cor. 5:18-19). The new covenant was consummated in this way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. With the Blood of Jesus, the Son of God</h2>
<p>Since the new covenant was consummated through Jesus Christ as the better sacrifices, it was, of course, enacted with the blood of Jesus, the Son of God (1 John 1:7). It is not like the old covenant, which was consummated with the blood of bulls and goats which cannot take away sins (Heb. 10:4). The blood of Christ was shed for the forgiveness of sins (Matt. 26:28). It has accomplished eternal redemption for us (Heb. 9:12; Eph. 1:7; 1 Pet. 1:18-19) and has purchased the church of God (Acts 20:28). It washes us from our sins (Rev. 1:5; 1 John 1:7), purifies our conscience (Heb. 9:14), and sanctifies us (Heb. 13:12). By this blood we enter the Holy of Holies (Heb. 10:19) and overcome Satan, the accuser (Rev. 12:10-11). Therefore, it is precious and better than the blood of goats and bulls (Heb. 9:12-14). The new covenant was consummated with this precious blood (Luke 22:20).</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE RESULT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Believers Being Forgiven of Their Sins</h2>
<p>Thousands and thousands of sinners have received forgiveness of sins by believing in Christ. They are no longer sinners or offenders. They have been delivered from the eternal penalty of sin, and they have been freed from the bondage and power of sin.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Believers Receiving the Law of Life</h2>
<p>The believers not only have been forgiven of their sins by believing in Christ, but they have also received the eternal life with its law of life. By this law of life God can be God to them and they can be a people to Him. Furthermore, the natural function of the law of life enables them to know God subjectively from within and to enjoy all the riches of what the Triune God is to them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Believers Being Joined to the Triune God<br />
in the Triune God</h2>
<p>The believers have an organic union with the Triune God in Christ. By being joined to Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension, the believers enjoy all the riches of His divinity and humanity and participate in all that He has accomplished and attained through His all-inclusive death, His powerful resurrection, and His transcendent ascension. Thus, they become the church as the Body of Christ that God may be expressed in Christ. They will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the complete expression of God to fully express God to the uttermost in the new heaven and new earth in the new universe unto eternity. This is the ultimate issue of God&rsquo;s making covenants with man throughout the generations.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In the New Testament, through the death of the Lord Jesus, which accomplished redemption for all men, God made a covenant with all sinners, the eighth covenant that He made with man. This covenant is the new covenant; it is also a better covenant. Hence, everything in this covenant is much better than the things in the old covenant. The contents of the new covenant include the following items: God will forgive the sins of all those who believe in Christ and will not remember their iniquities anymore; God will impart His laws into their minds, and on their hearts He will inscribe them; God will be God to them, and they will be a people to Him; and they all will know God and will not need anyone to teach them. The contents of the new covenant are also the contents of the entire New Testament; they include such items as the Triune God Himself, redemption, forgiveness of sins, sanctification, justification, reconciliation, regeneration, and sonship. These bequests which the Lord bequeathed to the believers are inexhaustible and are for them to enjoy unto eternity. The Mediator of the new covenant is Jesus Christ, who executes the new testament, carrying out every item of the bequests of the new covenant in the believers. He is also the Surety of the new covenant, guaranteeing that the new covenant will become effective and that all the blessings of the new covenant will become practical experiences to the believers. The new covenant was consummated with Christ Himself as the better sacrifices and with His better and precious blood, causing the believers to have forgiveness of sins, the law of life, and a union with the Triune God in the Triune God. This is the ultimate issue of God&rsquo;s making covenants with man throughout the generations.</p>
