   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If the believer faithfully and sincerely believes the words of God and in all sincerity beseeches the Holy Spirit to reveal to him God's holiness so that he may, in the light of God's holiness, be able to see the true condition of the flesh, the Holy Spirit will certainly do so.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this way, he may be spared some of the agonies of the war he has gone through.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, such believers are few indeed!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man always desires to use his own methods and simply cannot bring himself to believe that he is really so corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the lesson must be learned, so the Holy Spirit patiently allows him to learn of his self little by little through experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have now seen that we cannot obey the flesh, nor can we mend or educate the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No matter what spiritual method is employed, it simply cannot change the nature of the flesh one bit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then what is to be done?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The flesh must die.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the way appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It must be through death and not in any other way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We want to wage war, to change, to make resolutions, and to use innumerable other methods to overcome the flesh, but God says that the flesh must die.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the flesh is dead, everything will be in order.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not a matter of victory, but a matter of death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is very reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The reason that we are fleshly is that we were born of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"That which is born of the flesh is flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From where it comes in, to there it will go out.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The way of gain is the way of loss.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since we are born of the flesh, we are of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we die, we are delivered from the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Death is the one and only way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"For he who has died is justified from sin" Rom 6:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Anything short of death will not do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Death is the only way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since the flesh is so defiled 2 Pet 2:10 , even God cannot change it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Apart from putting it to death, there is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even the precious blood of the Lord Jesus cannot cleanse the "flesh" of man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus in the Scriptures we find that the blood of the Lord Jesus only cleanses us from our sins, trespasses, and iniquities, and no mention is made of the cleansing of the flesh by the precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The flesh has to be crucified Gal 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even the Holy Spirit cannot improve the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That is why He does not dwell in the sinner, who is of the flesh Gen 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even when He dwells in the believers, His intention is not to help in the improvement of the flesh but to war against it Gal 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Upon man's flesh shall it that is, the holy anointing oil as a type of the Holy Spirit not be poured" Exo 30:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With this in view, is it not a fact that many of our prayers are meaningless, those beseeching the Lord to enable us to change for the better, to progress, to be loving, and to better serve Him?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And is it not a fact that so much of our hope is vain, the hope that we may subsequently attain sanctification, experience the Lord every day, and glorify His name in all things?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Truly we should not try to mend the flesh so as to make it cooperate with the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The predestined end of the flesh is death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only by committing the flesh to death can we have salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Otherwise, we shall forever remain as its bondservants.</S>
