   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THIRD JOHN MESSAGE TWO IMITATION NOT OF THE EVIL BUT OF THE GOOD Scripture Reading: 3 John 9-14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that the subject of this Epistle is encouragement to fellow workers in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 1 through 4 are the introduction and speak of loving in truth v. 1 , prospering in all things and in health v. 2 , and walking in truth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then verses 5 through 8 go on to speak of hospitality to traveling workers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we shall consider verses 9 through 14.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE SELF-EXALTING</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>AND DOMINEERING DIOTREPHES</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>AN EVIL EXAMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 3 John 9-12 John gives two examples: the negative example of Diotrephes v. 9 and the positive example of Demetrius v. 12 . In verse 9 John says, I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not receive us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church here is the church of which Gaius was a member.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The name Diotrephes is made up of Dios from the name of Zeus, who was the chief of the gods in the Greek pantheon and trepho, to nourish; hence, Zeus-nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that Diotrephes as a professing Christian never dropped his pagan name.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was contrary to the practice of the early believers, who took a Christian name at their baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to history, Diotrephes advocated the Gnostic heresy, which blasphemes the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John says that Diotrephes loved to be first among those in the church and did not receive the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that Diotrephes did not receive him hospitably.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Diotrephes loving to be first was against the words of the Lord Jesus in Matthew 20:25-27 and 23:8-11, which places all His believers on the same level, that of brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 2 John 9 the Cerinthian Gnostics took the lead to advance in doctrine beyond the teaching concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here in 3 John 9 is one who was under the influence of Gnostic heretical doctrine, loving to be the first in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The problem of Gnostic doctrine was one of intellectual arrogance; the problem of loving to be first was one of self-exaltation in action.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These two evils are sharp weapons used by God s enemy, Satan, to execute his evil plot against God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One damages the believers faith in the divine reality: the other frustrates their work in God s move.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The principle was the same both with the Cerinthian Gnostics in their desire to be advanced in doctrine and with Diotrephes love to be first; they wanted to be above others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Cerinthians wanted to be above others in advanced thought, and Diotrephes wanted to be first.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today s modernists can be compared to the Cerinthians in their desire to have a higher, more advanced, philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The modernists may think that the general belief among Christians is too low.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, they desire to be above others in thought or philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The desire to be above others and the desire to be first are both instances of pride and arrogance, and both were issues of heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Among Christians today these two problems still exist.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first problem, the desire to be above others in thought, is related to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The second problem, the love of being first, is related to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In doctrine many desire to be advanced, to go beyond others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In practice, many love to be first.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such a love leads even to the desire to be a pope.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sometimes this evil principle creeps into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, in standing up to give a testimony we may want to say something advanced, something that goes beyond what others can say.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, in the church life we may also desire to be first.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even in a small service group, we may want to be the first, the head.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is in principle the evil spirit of Diotrephes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Diotrephes was influenced by the Gnostics, and he advocated, promoted, Gnosticism.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this we see the subtlety of the enemy in trying to annul the enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Satan in his subtlety seeks either to distract us from the enjoyment of the Triune God, to cut us off from this enjoyment, or even to destroy it altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Consider the situation among believers today with respect to the enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even the teaching of the Bible is utilized by the enemy to keep believers away from the proper enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Concerning this matter, a battle is raging, and we are fighting for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are not fighting for doctrine; we are fighting for the reality, which is the enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we go on to read 3 John 10, we see how domineering the evil Diotrephes was: Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, babbling against us with evil words; and not being satisfied with these, neither does he receive the brothers, and those intending to do so he forbids and casts them out of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Greek word translated babbling, phluareo, comes from phluo, to boil over, to bubble up, to overflow with words, to talk idly; hence, to babble, to talk folly or nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The babbling of Diotrephes was with evil words.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Greek word for evil here is poneros, which denotes something pernicious.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Poneros differs from kakos which refers to an essentially worthless and wicked character; it differs as well from sapros, which indicates worthlessness and corruption, degeneracy from original virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The word poneros denotes something pernicious, harmfully evil, that affects and influences others to be evil and vicious.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In verse 11 John goes on to say, Beloved, do not imitate the evil, but the good.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He who does good is of God; he who does evil has not seen God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here the Greek word rendered evil is kakos, worthless, wicked, depraved.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Does good comes from the Greek agathopoieo of the root agathos, good , to be a well-doer as a favor or a duty , practicing good; hence, to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this verse John says that he who does good is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Literally, the Greek word for of means out of, out from.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because we have been begotten of God, we are out from Him, possessing His life and partaking of His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God is the source of good.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A well-doer, a doer of good, is one who has his source in God; that is, he is one who is out from God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In verse 11 John tells us that he who does evil has not seen God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Greek word rendered does evil is kako-poieo of the root kakos, worthless , to be an evildoer, practicing evil; hence, to do evil.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>An evildoer not only is not out of God, but has not even seen God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This means that he has not enjoyed God or experienced Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In verse 11 to see God actually means to enjoy God and experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We cannot see God without enjoying Him, and we cannot know God without experiencing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Seeing and knowing God are a matter of enjoying and experiencing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Recently I have been encouraged by many of the testimonies given by young saints in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>These testimonies indicate that these young saints are enjoying God and experiencing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This also indicates that they have seen God and have known Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Without seeing and knowing God, without enjoying and experiencing Him, they could not give such testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Our testimonies indicate whether or not we are enjoying and experiencing God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As we have pointed out, our enjoyment of God is our seeing of Him, and our experience of God is our knowing of Him.</S>
