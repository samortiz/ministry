   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO PRACTICALLY IMPLEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SUCH A PLAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At present we have more than two hundred sixty young people in our full-time training.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We anticipate that another two hundred or more will be added to the next term of training.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Based on this number, we will need five hundred more next year.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to reach our goal, all the elders and responsible brothers in all the churches need to pick up the burden in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to encourage the young people in our respective localities to attend the full-time training.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the same time, the campus work should aim toward this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Based on the above considerations, we can probably get by with seven hundred, but one thousand is better.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I hope that we will consider this schedule and plan and bear this burden in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not believe that I am asking too much.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all agree that it is more than right for us to gospelize Taiwan in five years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without reservation we are declaring war on Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are storming his house, breaking his forces, binding the strong man, and plundering his wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although there are only eighteen thousand regular attendants in our meetings, any corporate effort will make our job easier; where there is the will of the entire Body, there is the way to win an entire city.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as we function and offer up our part, it will not be difficult to accomplish this momentous task.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What we need now is to strive and struggle to realize our plan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to realize our plan, we need practical ways to implement it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, in order to produce one thousand full-timers, there is the need of our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to ask the Lord to give us no fewer than a thousand persons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We even need to dream of these one thousand persons.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Next, we need to operate according to some practical principles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eighteen months ago I said that the basic principle in producing the full-timers is to have one out of twenty saints in every local church giving himself to be a full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At present, we have eighteen thousand regular attendants in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means we should produce nine hundred full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The potential of our source is not poor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By next year the attendance may reach twenty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This will be more than adequate to produce a thousand full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Next, when we say that out of twenty saints we should have one full-timer, we are taking into consideration the source of our financial support.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The nineteen saints should set aside five percent of their income to support the living of the one full-timer among them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This will not pose too heavy a burden on anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe that as the saints are faithful to the Lord, we will meet this budget.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our statistics show that we are barely obtaining the number of full-timers we need and our financial offering is still inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I hope that as the elders return to their respective localities, they will fellowship the practical needs with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although we are faithful in our regular offerings, we need to set aside five percent to support the full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This will make up the lack.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Old Testament, in addition to the regular sacrifices, God s people had to pay the temple tax, which was half a shekel of silver per person Exo 30:13-16; 38:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Among the twelve tribes, the tribe of Levi served the Lord full time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The other eleven tribes took a tenth of their income to take care of the need of the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I hope that all the saints will be faithful to the Lord to make up the portion that they ought to cover so that the Lord s work can go on in a smooth way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For every saint to offer five percent of their income to support the full-timers does not mean that they should divert their regular offerings to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, they should offer this additional five percent over and above their regular offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is only half of a tenth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is strictly for the support of the full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only when we have such a budget can we move according to schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even if we do not have a thousand full-timers by 1988, hopefully we will have seven hundred; however, if our financial support covers only five hundred, our move to gospelize Taiwan will be hampered.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have received a new leading from the Lord to turn the church from the degraded situation of Christianity to the practice of the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have also received a new commission to gospelize Taiwan in five years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For this, we need a schedule and a budget.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are clear about the schedule and the budget.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What we need to do is to mobilize the entire congregation to obtain the people and the financial support so that we can carry out our plan as scheduled.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>May the Lord be gracious to all the saints in all the places, and may we set our eyes on this in steadfastness and one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although the churches in the Lord s recovery are a little flock Luke 12:32 , we thank the Lord that He has committed to us a great commission of gospelizing Taiwan in five years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is an unprecedented task and a glorious enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I hope that we will all see the bright future and share in this great enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I believe the Lord will multiply His blessing on all those who spend themselves for the Lord and His gospel, and He will bless this country.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The effect of this is far-reaching.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May we all have the wisdom to receive this fellowship.</S>
