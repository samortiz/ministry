In chapter four there are two signs. One is a well, and the other is a mountain. The well is Jacob&#8217;s well, and the mountain is Mount Gerizim. Have you ever regarded these two matters as the signs and extracts in this chapter? If we do not know these two signs, we cannot know this chapter in a deep way.<p>For years, I have treasured chapter four of John because it contains two matters that are wonderful and mysterious. The first is the living water, and the second is the worship in spirit and in truth. Even when I was a youth I came to know about these points in John 4. However, I did not know the real significance of this chapter.<p>The signs in the first three chapters of John are all genuine and typical. In chapter one we have six signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God, Bethel. None of these signs is traditional. In chapter two we have two genuine, typical signs: the changing of water into wine and the raising up of the temple. In chapter three we have three genuine and typical signs: regeneration, the brass serpent, and the bride. Although the signs in chapters one, two, and three are typical and genuine, the two signs in chapter four are traditional. In a sense, the signs of the well and the mountain in John 4 are a mixture, for they are related to the territory of Samaria.<h2 class=head1>A PLACE OF MIXTURE</h2><p>Samaria was the leading region of the northern kingdom of Israel and the place where its capital was (1 Kings 16:24, 29). Before 700 B.C. the Assyrians captured Samaria and brought people from Babylon and other heathen places to the cities of Samaria (2 Kings 17:6, 24). From that time the Samaritans became a people of mixed blood-heathen blood mixed with Jewish blood. History tells us that they had the Pentateuch (the five books of Moses) and worshipped God according to that part of the Old Testament. But they were never recognized by the Jews as part of the Jewish people.<p>Originally, Samaria was a good region, and it included the parcel of land Jacob bought in Genesis 33:19. In that territory was located the mountain of blessing, Mount Gerizim, the place where six of the twelve tribes of Israel declared the blessing of keeping the law (Deut. 27:12; Josh. 8:33). Opposite Mount Gerizim was Mount Ebal, where the other six tribes declared the curse of disobeying the law. Mount Gerizim, therefore, was a mountain of blessing. At that mountain there was a double blessing because it was a gift of the forefather, Jacob, and it was the place of God&#8217;s blessing.<p>We have seen that during the time of the kings, the people of Samaria became mixed with those who were pagans. Furthermore, the pagans brought in idol worship and mixed their worship with that of the worship of God practiced by the Jews. In this way Mount Gerizim became a place of mixture in worship. On Mount Gerizim the people practiced idol worship under the name of the Jewish God, Jehovah. They mixed their pagan worship with the worship of the genuine God.<p>Much of the worship among Christians today is also a mixture. In principle, it is the same as that practiced on Mount Gerizim: it is a mixture of pagan things with worship in the name of the true God. That mixture in worship at Mount Gerizim in Samaria was carried out by pagans and by pagan authority. Likewise, the mixture in traditional worship in Christendom was also first carried out under pagan authority.<p>The signs in John 4 are related to matters that are not pure. Yes, Jacob&#8217;s well was in a portion of Jacob&#8217;s land given to his beloved son, Joseph (Josh. 24:32). That was something pure. However, it was used by Samaritans, an impure people. Although the Samaritans claimed to be descendants of Jacob, they were a mixture. This was the reason that the Jews in ancient times would not recognize them or have any dealings with them. This was true even up until the time of the Lord Jesus. John 4:9 indicates this: &#8220;The Samaritan woman then said to Him, How is it that you, a Jew, ask me for a drink, since I am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)&#8221;<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> </body></html>
