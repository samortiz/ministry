   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>R. The Way, the Reality, and the Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 14:6 the Lord said that He is the way, the reality, and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to understand this verse, we must take care of its context.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The context begins from chapter eight, which is concerning the Lord's shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In His shepherding care for us, He is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without Him there is no way for us to shepherd others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is not only the way but also the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The way without the reality means vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The way needs the reality, and the reality needs the life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If it is a dead reality, it is still vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It must be a living reality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to experience Christ as the way, the reality, and the life for us to shepherd others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Someone may come to us and say, "I hate to lose my temper, but I lose my temper all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What can I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should help him to enjoy Christ by calling on His name and by opening up His Word to digest one or two verses by pray-reading them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, we need to help him to be fed and satisfied with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The very Christ who satisfies us is the way for us not to lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to shepherd people in this way in the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to ethical logic, a person should learn how to be patient and endure to overcome his temper, but this does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all need to exercise to take Christ as the way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then He becomes our reality as our satisfaction, our pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we have the life supply to live Him for the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John 14 through 16 is a long discourse of Christ on the night before His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That discourse is concerning the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God, the constitution of the processed Triune God with His regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To participate in this organism, the divine and human constitution, we need the way, the reality, and the life, all of which are the exercise of Christ as the eternal resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Way</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way is Christ in resurrection to be our reality and life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Vanity, as described by Solomon in Ecclesiastes, and death, as explained by Paul in his Epistles, can never be the way for anyone to participate in the organism of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Reality</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The reality is all that God is, which becomes the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The way to participate in the divine and human constitution, which is the organic Body of Christ, is to enjoy all that the person of Christ is, which is His unsearchable riches Eph 3:8 .</S>
