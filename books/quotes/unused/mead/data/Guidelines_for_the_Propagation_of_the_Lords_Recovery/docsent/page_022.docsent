   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUPPORTING THE FULL-TIME SERVING ONES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are many saints who want to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After we sounded the call, over one thousand two hundred saints signed up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Six hundred of these will serve full time, and the rest will serve part time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Half of the saints who signed up to serve full time are from Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This may be the first time in church history that over six hundred full-timers and over six hundred part-timers came forward at one time to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The long-term living expenses of the six hundred full-timers will not be small.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to pray concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ten saints should be able to support one full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In other words, one out of every ten saints should be a full-time serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everyone in the church should participate in preaching the gospel, and we should also be able to match the gospel move with our material offering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We thank the Lord that the economy of Taiwan is strong and that the standard of living is high.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no problem related to finances.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the saints need to be faithful in material offering to match the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In particular, the working saints need to endeavor to support the full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way we will all move on together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>MOBILIZING THE WHOLE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>TO BUILD UP A MODEL</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You should not rely too much on my leading.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the Lord allows, I will visit twice a year and stay for at least one month when I visit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I am here, you will not be able to sleep peacefully, because I will create a lot of work for you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our goal is to mobilize the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The full-timers are not the only ones who can have a part in the gospel activities and church services.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every one of us must have a part.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If everyone functions in the ways that we have fellowshipped, the whole church will be mobilized to gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In conclusion, we need to be aggressive to preach the gospel in our homes, to children, to students, and to those with whom we work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We also need to recover the dormant saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this way the church will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We also need to lead the brothers and sisters to focus on knowing the truth, growing in life, and living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover, the saints should also take part in the church life so that there will be a testimony of a golden lampstand in every locality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will first spread the gospel where we live, and lead many people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then the Lord may lead us to go to other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This should be our common burden.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From now on the churches in Taiwan need to rise up and take action.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This will produce a model.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then all the churches in the Lord s recovery will see this model and know how to spread and propagate in order to gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There are over five hundred churches in the Lord s recovery on five continents.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Apart from the Far East, there are over three hundred churches on the other four continents.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are over two hundred churches in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Most of the churches outside of the Far East are not large.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They may have an average of a hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A model for propagation should be established in Taipei so that the whole earth can see how the churches in the Lord s recovery increase in number.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How we promote this matter is important.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It seems as if the world has become smaller, because what happens in one place can quickly spread to other places.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once the church in Taipei begins to practice, the five hundred churches will know.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must build up a model in Taiwan, because the condition in other places is not as favorable as the condition here.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to pray for the spread of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to grasp this golden opportunity to participate in the move for the spread of the gospel through the propagation and increase.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We also need to build up a model.</S>
