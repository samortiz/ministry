   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 5 DAY 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 7:13-16</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>13 1 Enter in through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to 2 destruction, and many are those who enter through it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>14 Because 1 narrow is the gate and constricted is the way that leads to 2 life, and few are those who find it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>16 By their fruits you will recognize them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>13 1 The seventh and last section of the King's decree, vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>13-29, concerns the ground of the kingdom people's living and work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>13 2 Destruction here does not refer to the perishing of the person himself, but to the destruction of a person's deeds and work 1 Cor 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>14 1 The gate is narrow and the way is constricted because the new law of the kingdom is stricter and the demand of the kingdom higher than the law and the demand of the old covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The narrow gate deals not only with outward conduct but also with inward motive.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The old man, the self, the flesh, the human concept, and the world with its glory are all excluded; only that which corresponds with God's will can enter in. The kingdom people need first to enter in through such a narrow gate, and then to walk on such a constricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not that they first walk the way and then enter in through the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To enter in through the gate is simply to begin walking on the way, a way that is lifelong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>14 2 Life here refers to the ever-blessed condition of the kingdom, which is filled with the eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This life is in the reality of the kingdom today and will be in the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age 19:29; Luke 18:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must be deeply impressed with the fact that the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is based upon the divine life and nature of the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By the time we reach 7:12, nearly every aspect of our living and behavior has been covered.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, one thing remains: the fact that the kingdom people are on earth doing the will of God our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, in the last section the consummation of the constitution there are four crucial words: gate, way, will, and house.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only the kingdom people with the nature described in the nine blessings in chapter five can enter through the narrow gate and walk on the constricted way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As one in the Lord's recovery, are you walking on the constricted way?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those in Christianity can use rock music or other worldly methods in their services, but we cannot, because our way is constricted.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Living in spirit and walking in spirit restrict us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even when we are loving, rejoicing, and happy, we must be under restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This must even be true in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although we may fully release our spirit, we should be restricted as far as physical activity is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our way is full of limitations, restrictions, and constrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the limitations are not a frustration; rather, they will speed us on our way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The narrow gate and the constricted way lead to life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you take the way of Christianity, the broad way, eventually, everything you do will be destroyed, for that broad way leads to destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not my opinion; it is the word of the apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The fire will try the nature of your work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If your work is of wood, hay, and stubble, it is certainly on the broad way leading to destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we are taking the constricted way, we must discern who the false prophets are.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not listen to eloquent speech or to enticing words.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, wait and see what kind of fruit is produced Matt 7:15-20 .</S>
