   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God Being the God of Authority</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the God of Order</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Please remember that in God s work and in the church of God there can never be a situation in which there is no order.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to see before God that even with two people, one is put ahead of the other.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When ten people are together, there will be one in front and nine in the back.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When twelve are together, one will be in front and eleven will be in the back.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is always the God of authority and the God of order.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is never a committee system of three or five men.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no such thing in the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There may be several elders, but God does not establish a committee.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although God does not set up a chairman, we need to listen to the one whom God establishes among the elders when carrying out the Lord s affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today when we talk about the matter of the work, it is exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There were twelve apostles in Jerusalem, but God placed Peter in the forefront.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The rest of the eleven had to wait in the back and listen to what he said.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The James that we spoke of earlier was not the older brother of John.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The older brother of John had already passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This James was in the forefront in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to see this matter before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not only do we have Barnabas and Saul, but Barnabas was spontaneously ahead of Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the work there are always those in the forefront.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If two sisters have learned the lesson of recognizing authority, they will immediately realize that one of them needs to stand on the ground of obedience when they are together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first thing in the coordination of the work is the coordination of the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once we do not have the coordination of authority, all the other coordinations are empty.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Please note that God s word in the Bible is very fine and detailed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then...</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1 Cor 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must see that God is not a God of confusion but a God of order.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God does not believe in disorder or confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God believes in order, and God is a God of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That is why He says first.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It does not mean that there is a system of organization or committees, in which everyone has the right to speak and vote.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God does not recognize this at all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is man s way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In His Word God says, First...second...third...then....</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the arrangement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, when the brothers come to work in the church or in any matter, they must see their own place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They must learn to line up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today if three people are walking together, they should know spontaneously which brother is in front of them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If they have a question, they should ask that brother.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the principle of the church here.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is very beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When two or three brothers are together and something happens, some should immediately take the position of obedience and ask, Since this matter must be decided, what do you say?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even when two are together, we should know who stands before us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is not a matter of ordination or assignment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have to assign, then things have been spoiled already.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is obvious that some stand in the forefront and some stand behind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Being in the Forefront Is Having Authority</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not God s intention that we listen to the authority that He has established because this person is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, God says that this person s authority is higher than ours; therefore, we need to listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We do not listen to this person because he is more perfect than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to listen to him because he is in front of us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The basis for obedience is not that the one to whom you listen is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The basis for obedience is whether or not the one to whom you listen is in front of you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If something goes wrong, he bears the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Let me illustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God says that wives must obey their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The wife should not obey him on the basis of whether or not he is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If husbands had to be perfect, all of the wives in the whole world would not need to obey their husbands, because no husband is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The wife must obey her husband simply because he is the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whether or not he is perfect is not the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The issue is whether or not he is the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If he is the husband, the wife needs to obey him period.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is the same in the relationship and coordination among the co-workers in God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If two are put together, then they should spontaneously know their place.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When something happens, we should always know when to stand aside and say, Brother, you speak.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should wait for him to speak because he is in front of us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are not obedient to man s selection, but we are obedient to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once a brother stands in front of us, we should be obedient to him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It would be strange if there were no one to obey and if we could not even find someone to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If this is the case, we have absolutely not seen the arrangement of God s authority in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the way when two brothers are together in the work: Spontaneously, Barnabas was in the forefront and Saul was behind.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the Holy Spirit s assignment, Barnabas was naturally put in front and Saul was behind.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At the beginning of Acts 13, Barnabas was in the forefront the whole way when they went out.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Verse 7 says, Sergius Paulus...called Barnabas and Saul to him and sought to hear the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Again, Barnabas is spoken of and then Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In Acts 13:1, I would like for you to notice that Barnabas was the first one among many prophets and teachers and that Saul was the last.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Do not think that Paul was advanced at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is no such thing!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When they went out, the last one was Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers: Barnabas and Simeon, who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Barnabas was first, then Simeon, Lucius, Manaen, and lastly Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Among the five, the first was Barnabas and the last was Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Perhaps all of these others were ahead of Saul in the Lord at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When they went out, the Holy Spirit also recognized Barnabas to be in the forefront.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them v. 2 . Again it is Barnabas and Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Later, when they were on the way in verse 7, Sergius Paulus called Barnabas and Saul to him and sought to hear the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Holy Spirit still recognized Barnabas as being in the forefront.</S>
