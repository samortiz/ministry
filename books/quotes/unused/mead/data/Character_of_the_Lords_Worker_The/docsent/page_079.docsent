   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In 2 Corinthians 12:15-18 he continued, saying, "But I, I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If I love you more abundantly, am I loved less?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But let it be so!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I did not burden you; but, as some of you say, being crafty, I took you by guile.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Did I take advantage of you through anyone whom I have sent to you?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I entreated Titus and sent with him the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Titus did not take advantage of you, did he?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Did we not walk in the same spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the same steps?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brothers and sisters, think of Paul's attitude: He most gladly spent and was utterly spent on their behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In preaching the gospel, it is not enough for us just to be spent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to spend; we have to give everything we have.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is always wrong to receive money in exchange for our preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, we have to be prepared to willingly spend our money for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If our money does not go into our preaching, something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If our money does go into our preaching, we are doing the right thing and are putting our money into a worthy cause.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is what Paul did.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was willing to be spent, and he was willing also to spend.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was willing to spend and be spent for their souls.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When he was among them he was not a burden to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nor was Titus or the other brother a burden to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He would not take advantage of anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The gospel is true this is why we can spend our money on it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brothers and sisters, we have to be like our brother Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not be a burden to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the contrary, we should be utterly spent for the gospel's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because the gospel is true, it is right for us to spend and be utterly spent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our gospel must be one which carries our money along with it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the proper way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In spite of what we have said, Paul accepted the gift of the Macedonians and the Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Under normal circumstances, it is right for a gospel preacher to receive gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul accepted gifts from some places and refused gifts from other places.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was not bound in the matter of receiving gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He accepted the gift from the Macedonians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But when some criticized him and looked for opportunity to slander him in Achaia and Corinth, he refused their gift.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was Paul's way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should be the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can accept gifts from some places like Macedonia, and we should refuse gifts from other places that say things about us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brothers and sisters, we have to maintain this stand before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not think that we can accept any kind of money.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If someone is speaking behind our backs or if someone is seeking for an opportunity to criticize us, we simply cannot accept their gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In other places we may accept the gift, but not in that place.</S>
