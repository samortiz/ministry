   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE PRACTICE OF THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that we can be here to seek Your leading.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You know that our inner being is in fear and trembling; we are afraid of losing Your presence and of either walking ahead of You or behind You.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lord, be in our midst and give us a deep impression so that we may clearly touch, and carry out as well, all that You want us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Save us from vanity and mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, may we not regret what we are doing today; instead, may it be of eternal value.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, cleanse all of us that we may exercise our spirit to receive Your leading.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not want to receive man s teaching or leading, we want to receive Your leading.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, You are the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We pray that You would visit Your church, Your Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are members one of another, and we desperately need Your operating.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, we confess that we are weak, empty, and useless, and many of our activities, views, and feelings have become veils to us and restrictions, hindrances, to You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, deliver us in these matters that we may enter into You to touch Your heart s intent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, give us the words and the utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we speak and fellowship, make Your intention known to us so that we may touch the desire of Your heart, and be the testimony of Your heart s desire in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord, cleanse us and cover us with Your prevailing blood; draw the limit for us and do not allow Your enemy to overstep.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Day by day spread a table before us in the presence of our adversaries.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>PRACTICAL STEPS FOR THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this chapter we will fellowship about the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First, Acts 2 says that immediately after the three thousand were saved on the day of Pentecost, they had meetings from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They did not meet as small groups but met from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second, when we speak of meeting in a group, it seems as if the group can be either large or small, depending on our preference.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But when we speak of meeting in a house, in a family, no one can increase or decrease the size of a house, a family, at will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Third, a home is the smallest corporate unit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If our promoting of a certain matter can reach the homes, we would have done a thorough job.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we are not subdividing merely into small groups; we are subdividing with the home as a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A year and a half ago I said that we needed to work to the point that there is a meeting in every saint s home.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It should not be that only those who are strong and aggressive have meetings in their homes, whereas those who are weak, backslidden, and attend meetings infrequently do not.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We hope that every home will have a meeting, including the homes of the weak and inactive ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Delivering Meetings to the Homes</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Someone may ask, If a certain saint has stopped meeting, how can we have a meeting in his home?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is because he has stopped meeting that we need to establish a meeting in his home, to deliver the meeting to his home.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He has stopped meeting because he does not have a meeting at home.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If there is a meeting in his home, naturally he will meet.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For most of the saints, as long as a meeting is established in their homes, it will not be a problem for them to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, the best way to recover a saint who has stopped meeting is to deliver the meeting to his home instead of asking him to come to a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need only to meet in his home once, and he will begin meeting again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, the problem with non-meeting saints is that we do not deliver the meetings to their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We bear the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I hope we will all have a change in concept.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of dragging the saints and forcing them to come to a meeting, we should bring the meeting to their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose we invite someone to our home for a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If he cannot come, we should deliver the food to him so that he can at least taste the food.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I cannot guarantee that the non-meeting saints will be revived immediately, but if the brothers and sisters are willing to coordinate with one another to deliver the meeting to the homes, at least there is a great possibility for them to begin meeting again.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must carry this out.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Another advantage of delivering meetings to the homes is that it solves family disputes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Perhaps a saint has stopped meeting for no reason other than family disputes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The longer he stays away from the meetings, the more serious the quarrels between him and his wife become, and the more he loses his heart to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A wife who has stopped meeting for eighteen years might have been crying out for help the entire time but has been unable to find any help.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose one day some of the saints bring the meeting to her home; as a result of their singing and praying with her, she is nourished and filled with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then she might pray, Lord, have mercy on us, and have mercy on my husband so that he could also enjoy You as I do.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Moreover, if this sister has not been meeting for eighteen years, her children must not have been meeting as well.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now through our bringing the meeting to her home, the children also are joyful to receive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this way we reap several benefits with a single action.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Twenty-five years ago the medical field in Taiwan practiced making house calls to give injections; now we need to practice to deliver meetings to the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we deliver the meeting to the homes, not only will the inactive saints be recovered, but their friends and relatives will also be given a great opportunity to receive the gospel of the Lord s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are willing to practice this delivery of meetings to ten homes per week, I believe that at least five homes will be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At present there are at least six thousand non-meeting saints in about one thousand five hundred to two thousand homes, with at least one to two saved ones in each home.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If in three months we visit these two thousand homes three to five times, at least one thousand homes will be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is truly the best way, and it is worthwhile to endeavor in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hence, we need to encourage the saints to practice this change in the system; moreover, we must find a definite way to effectively gain the increase.</S>
