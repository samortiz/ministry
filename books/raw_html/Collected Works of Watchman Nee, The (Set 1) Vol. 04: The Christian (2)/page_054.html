<P>God allows Satan to sift the saints so that their light may shine and that God's name may be glorified. It does not mean that they are not true. But tribulation and the fiery trials manifest their true nature in the same way that fire manifests the true gold. This is God's dealing in grace towards the degraded church. The world has turned sour. The saints now know that the world lies in the hands of Satan, and that it is no longer their place of rest. While the goal of the enemy is to destroy God's children, God is using all things for the benefit of His children, so that their faith and perseverance, after passing through the trials, may be complete and lacking in nothing. Although men tried to take away their lives, the Lord turned the darkness of death into the glory of the morning. A cheap bargain, an easy walk, to have two feet on two separate boats, and to live a life that is halfway between, these are the greatest temptations that Satan presents to man. God would rather see His children attacked by Satan than to have them come under his temptations. God allows Satan to persecute the saints so that they would not become worldly people among worldly ones, but would become godly ones in the congregation of the saints.</P><P>Although Satan's power is great, and although the onslaught of tribulations is severe, everything is in the hand of the Lord. Although the Lord allows Satan to apply his great pressure to the church, the Lord restricts the work of the enemy, in the same way that He handled the case of Job. "You will have tribulation ten days." Everything is in the hands of God. Everything that happens to us has been measured by God. The Lord will not let us bear any temptation above what we are able to bear. Every saint can receive tribulations as if they come from the hand of the Lord. All the power of the enemy is under the mighty hand of God. Although the enemy can persecute the saints for ten days, causing them to be purified for God's testimony, the time of his oppression and persecution is measured by God. When He says that it will be ten days, no one can say that it will be eleven days. The Lord is restraining the oppression of His enemy in the heavens. He lets us know that the roaring lion has been chained with chains. What a comfort this is for the saints to remember in the time of tribulation! Faith in the power of God is the best help for man.</P><P>What is the meaning of "ten days"? According to man's theory, a day is a year. But this day-year theory is entirely unscriptural. In other places we have proved the error of this theory. We will not repeat this here. "Ten days" in the Bible means a very short time. When the servant of Abraham was about to take away Rebekah, "her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go" (Gen. 24:55). The Israelites asked for meat in the wilderness, and Moses answered them: "Jehovah will give you meat, and you will eat. You shall not eat one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days..." (Num. 11:18-19). Nabal of Maon dealt with David in wickedness. As a result, "about ten days after...the Lord smote Nabal, that he died" (1 Sam. 25:38). Because God wanted to protect Paul from being killed on the way from Caesarea to Jerusalem, Festus, Paul's judge, "having stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea" (Acts 25:6). Although one can interpret the "ten days" to be the ten great Roman persecutions, the meaning of the words "ten days" refers only to the limitedness of their sufferings and to the fact that they were for a short time only. Thank the Lord that He restricts as well as allows the sufferings. Everything is in His hand.</P><P>"Be faithful unto death." This was the Lord's command. Although the Lord restricted the work of the devil strictly, He did not promise immediate deliverance. The Lord was not willing to deliver His people from their temporary tribulations. Rather, He desired to uphold them through death. The Lord can intervene with Satan and stop all his attacks. The Lord has the power, and He can do this. However, He demonstrated greater power in preserving the persecuted and martyred saints. We know that it was a great disappointment to the saints of old when they were pardoned by the government and spared from execution at the time of persecution. Many moving letters that have been preserved up until today were written by imprisoned saints while they watched their companions being taken to the execution ground. These letters express their sorrow and grief at not being able to share in the privilege and honor of dying for the Lord. In many cases, they did eventually receive what they hoped for, and they rejoiced greatly. This shows us how great the power of the Lord is. Amidst the enemy's extreme opposition, the Lord is able to comfort His people.</P><P>This being the case, since the Lord has put us in tribulations, and since He has allowed the enemy to try us, we should not hope or pray for the Lord to have pity on our weakness, to lead us out of the tribulations, to stop the fiery trials, and to grant us a comfortable and peaceful living. We should instead hand ourselves over faithfully to the hand of our Maker and await the completion of the carving work that tribulation works in us. God surely knows how to bring us out of these trials. We do not need to pray for God to use His power to intervene and to stop the persecuting circumstances. Instead, we should pray for God to preserve us with His power, so that we can withstand the trials of sufferings, being faithful in persecutions, and not shirking from death. "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?...But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us" (Rom. 8:35, 37).</P><P>The expression "be faithful unto death" has two meanings. First, it means that to be faithful is a matter of a period of time. It means that one should be faithful up to the time he dies. "Unto death" means to continue until one dies. While one's breath lasts, he should remain faithful. Second, to be faithful is a matter of price. It means that we should remain faithful and should not give up even if it means losing our life. In this case, "unto death" means to maintain faithfulness at the cost of death. One should be willing to sacrifice his body in maintaining his faithfulness.</P>
