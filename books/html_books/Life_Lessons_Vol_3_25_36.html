<h2 class="head1">EXPLANATION AND FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>These lessons have been specifically prepared for the home meetings of new believers. The first two volumes cover different matters between a believer and God which he should know, understand, and practice immediately after his salvation. Then the last two volumes cover the full salvation which God has prepared in Christ for us who have believed into Him, the riches which we have obtained in Christ, the experience which we should have in Christ, the things which we should accomplish in Christ, and the goal which we should attain in Christ.</li>
<li>It is difficult to avoid certain terms which are relatively deep and hard for new believers to understand. There is no need for added explanation while reading these lessons in the meetings. As lesson after lesson is read, a thorough understanding of the terms will be acquired. Even if there is not such a thorough understanding at the time, this understanding will be gained gradually.</li> 
<li>Knowledge is empty and the letter kills; only Christ is reality and only the Spirit gives life. Thus, there must be prayer, confession of sins, and the abundantly rich filling and saturation with the Spirit of Christ before reading these lessons. In reading, there should be the practice of depending less on the mind and more on the spirit, rejecting the old way of knowledge and emphasizing the new way of life. Sentence after sentence that is being read should be pushed out by the spirit with life that others&rsquo; spirits may be touched for them to receive the life supply of the pneumatic Christ.</li> 
<li>The Bible verses in these lessons are quoted in an economical and suitable way. Furthermore, their explanations are both concise and adequate, having no need for further explanation. The only need is to repeat what is read, to emphasize what is read, to read in a living way, and to pray-read. At times, the reading should be supplemented by hymns or testimonies. Never extend the meaning of the text or develop an understanding based on inference.</li> 
<li>The Scriptures quoted in these lessons are from the Recovery Version of the New Testament and the King James Version of the Old Testament.</li> 
<li>For these lessons to be beneficial to the home meetings, there is a great need for much prayer. May the Lord bless His recovery, perfect His saints, and build up His Body.</li>

<h1 class="title">TRANSFERRED INTO CHRIST</h1>
<p>(It is suggested that this lesson, which is lengthy and deep, be read at two different times, the second beginning from the section on &ldquo;Transferred into Christ&rdquo; on page 10.)</p>
<p>The twenty-four lessons of the previous two volumes were an overview of the different matters between us and God which we, the sinners, should realize, know, and practice after we have believed in the Lord to be saved and have become a saint of God and of the Lord. Beginning with this volume, we will go further to look into the salvation which God prepared for us in Christ. We will also look into the riches we have obtained, the experiences we should have, the things we should accomplish, and the goal we should attain in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THERE BEING ONLY TWO MEN<br />
IN THE EYES OF GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Adam Being the First Man,<br />
the Initial Man</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The first man is out of the earth&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:47); &ldquo;The first...Adam&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:45).</p>
<p>Though there are millions of people on the earth, there are only two men in the eyes of God. The first one is Adam. The Bible calls him the first man and also the first Adam. He is out of the earth; therefore, he is earthy. He is the beginning of man, and there is no man before him. Thus, he is the first man, the initial man. We people in the world are all his descendants, who are out of him and who are in him to be one man with him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Christ Being both the Second Man<br />
and the Last Man</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The second Man is out of heaven&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:47); <strong>&ldquo;The last Adam&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:45).</p>
<p>These verses refer to Christ. Here the Bible calls Christ the second Man. In our eyes, since the first man is Adam, the second man should be his firstborn son, Cain, as the second generation of mankind. However, the Bible, bypassing Cain and millions of his descendants, says that the second Man is Christ. This is God&rsquo;s view! In God&rsquo;s eyes, the first man after Adam is Christ. Before Christ, there was only one man, Adam, and there was not another man besides him. Thus, Adam is the first man, and Christ is the second Man. The Scriptures here not only call Christ the second Man, but also the last Adam, that is, the last Man. This tells us that God views Christ not only as the second Man but also as the last Man, and there is not another man after Him. Though there is a first man before Christ, there is not a third man after Him. Adam is the first man, and Christ is the second Man. Therefore, in God&rsquo;s view there are only two men in the universe&mdash;Adam and Christ. All the other millions of people are either in Adam, of Adam, and one man with Adam, or in Christ, of Christ, and one man with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. BORN IN ADAM</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;And He made from one every nation of men&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 17:26).</p>
<p>In some manuscripts, the word &ldquo;one&rdquo; in this verse is rendered &ldquo;one blood,&rdquo; referring to one man. This one man is Adam. From this one man Adam, or from this &ldquo;one,&rdquo; God made every nation of men in the world. Every nation of men in the world is out of Adam and in Adam. Actually, before we were born, we were already in Adam. Because we were originally in Adam, it was possible for us to be born of Adam and be those who are of Adam.</p>
 <h2 class="head1">III. WHAT WE HAVE IN ADAM</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;For as through the disobedience of one man [Adam] the many were constituted sinners&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:19).</p>
<p>Of all the things which we have in Adam, the first is sin. The first thing Adam passed on to us was sin. To be sinful and to be sinners, we do not need to commit sins. Through the disobedience of the one man, Adam, we are already sinful and are constituted sinners. Adam was sinful and was a sinner through disobedience. We also are sinful and are sinners as long as we are in him.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;So then, as it was through one offense [the one in Eden] unto condemnation to all men&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:18).</p>
<p>Since we are sinners and are sinful in Adam, we are under condemnation. Since Adam caused us to be sinners, he also caused us to be condemned. We all participated in his one offense in the garden of Eden because we were all in him. While he was sinning, we were all in him, sinning with him. He included us and brought us with him when he sinned.</p>
<p><strong>3) &ldquo;For as in Adam all die&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:22).</p>
<p>Of all the items that we have obtained and now possess in Adam, the first is sin, the second is condemnation, and the third is death. Since we have sin, we are condemned; since we have condemnation, we will surely die. The result of sin and condemnation is death. This death is in Adam and includes several levels of meaning. First, it is the death of the spirit, that is, the human spirit losing its function because of the break in its fellowship with God. Second, it is the death of the body, that is, the human body losing its life and returning to dust. Third, it is the death of the soul, that is, the human soul going to Hades to be tormented (Luke 16:22-25). Fourth, it is the second death, that is, the human spirit, soul, and body being cast into the lake of fire to suffer the eternal torment (Rev. 20:15; 21:8). Today the spirits of the people of the world are dead to God. One day their bodies will die and their souls will go to Hades to be tormented. In the last day, their spirit, soul, and body will be resurrected and will come together to be cast into the lake of fire to be tormented eternally, which is the final and eternal death. These are the significances included in death, the common portion in Adam of the entire world.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. TRANSFERRED INTO CHRIST</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Everyone who believes into Him [Christ]&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:16, lit.).</p>
<p>Here the word &ldquo;into&rdquo; literally implies entering into. Our believing causes us to enter into Christ. We were originally born in Adam, and we continued to live in Adam after our birth. When we believed into the Lord, our believing brought us into Christ that we might enter into Him and become a person in Him.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 3:27).</p>
<p>Baptism immediately follows after believing. To believe and be baptized are two parts of one step for our entering into the Lord. To believe is to enter into Christ inwardly, while to be baptized is to enter into Christ outwardly. Our believing is our entering into Christ in reality in our spirit; our being baptized is our entering into Christ practically in water. Once we believe, we enter into Christ in the spirit. Then through baptism we confess and confirm this fact, displaying and declaring it. Thus, to believe and be baptized is a complete step which brings us into Christ, transferring us out of Adam into Christ that we may be a man in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>3) &ldquo;But of Him [God] you are in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 1:30).</p>
<p>Our responsibility is to believe and be baptized in order to enter into Christ. But to put the Spirit of Christ and the life of Christ into us is beyond our own ability; this is God&rsquo;s doing. When we enter into Christ through believing and being baptized, God puts the Spirit of Christ and the life of Christ into our spirit that we and Christ may have a spiritual organic union; all of this is God&rsquo;s doing. Therefore, as far as the Spirit and life are concerned, it is of God that we are in Christ Jesus. It is God who placed us in Christ and put the Spirit and the life of Christ into us that we might be joined as one with Christ in spirit. Except for our believing and being baptized, this was altogether God&rsquo;s doing through His Spirit. In this way, God practically transferred us out of Adam into Christ in the Spirit and in life that we may become a person fully in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. WHAT WE HAVE IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>We were born of Adam, having the things in Adam, which are the means by which our old man in Adam lives. When we are transferred into Christ, we also possess the riches in Christ, which are the means by which our new man in Christ lives. Such riches in Christ are innumerable. Those that we have chosen as important are listed below.</p>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Through the obedience of the One [Christ] shall the many be constituted righteous&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:19).</p>
<p>The first thing we have in Adam is sin, but the first thing we have in Christ is righteousness. The first thing Adam brought to us was sin; the first thing Christ brings to us is righteousness. The disobedience of Adam made us sinful and constituted us sinners; the obedience of Christ constitutes us righteous that we may become righteous persons.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;Through one righteous act [the one at Golgotha] unto justification of life to all men&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:18).</p>
<p>The sins we have in Adam caused us to be condemned in him, while the righteousness we obtain in Christ causes us to be justified in Him. The one offense of Adam in the garden of Eden caused us, who were in him, to be condemned, while the one righteous act of Christ at Golgotha caused us, who are in Him, to be justified.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the sin and condemnation we have in Adam also caused us to have death, but the righteousness and justification we gain in Christ cause us to have life. Adam&rsquo;s sin brought us death, but Christ&rsquo;s righteousness brings us life. Due to Adam&rsquo;s sin, the death of Satan entered into us to do a work of death. Thus, our spirit, soul, and body, that is, our whole being, were invaded by death. Due to the righteousness of Christ, the life of God entered into us to do a work of life to swallow up the death in our spirit, soul, and body that our whole being could be made alive.</p>
<p><strong>3) &ldquo;For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:22).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made alive&rdquo; here refers to being resurrected. We originally were dead persons. Then Christ came into us, bringing God&rsquo;s life to make us alive. Thus, to be made alive is to be resurrected. The death Adam brought to us ruined everything of our life in the old creation. The resurrection Christ brings to us begins our life in the new creation that we may partake of everything in this life of the new creation.</p>
<p><strong>4) &ldquo;Who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:3).</p>
<p>In Christ we obtain not only the three items of righteousness, justification, and life but also every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies. The selection of the Holy Father, the redemption of the Holy Son, the sealing of the Holy Spirit, and all the heavenly, spiritual blessings spoken of in the New Testament have been given to us by God in Christ and are obtained by us in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>5) &ldquo;But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 1:30).</p>
<p>It is concisely stated here that there are four important things which we obtain in Christ from God: wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Wisdom is the main item and righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are the detailed points. All that God has given to us in Christ is out of Christ&rsquo;s wisdom, or we may say that it is Christ as wisdom, which includes righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Righteousness is for us to be justified by God that we may be saved. This is in the past. Sanctification is for us to live a holy life that we may be victorious. This is in the present. Redemption is for our bodies to be redeemed that we may be glorified. This is in the future. We have obtained all these items, which are all Christ Himself, in Christ from God.</p>
<p><strong>6) &ldquo;...in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
<p>We also became a new creation in Christ. The old things in Adam have passed away and they have become new in Christ. This is a result of being transferred from Adam into Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON TWENTY-SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">JOINED TO CHRIST</h1>
<p>After we have believed and are baptized into Christ, we have a life union with Christ and are joined to Him. Our being joined to Him is based on His first being joined to us. Therefore, we must first consider how He is joined to us, and then how we are joined to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. CHRIST BEING JOINED TO US</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. By Becoming Flesh</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;And the Word [God] became flesh&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:14). Christ is the Word of God and is God Himself (John 1:1). The first step He took in joining Himself to us was to become flesh, that is, to become a man of flesh. As God, He took on a human body with the human nature to join with man as one, thus becoming a God-man. This was the beginning of His being joined to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Bringing Us through Death and<br />
Resurrection into Ascension</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;I have been crucified with Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:20); <strong>&ldquo;Our old man has been crucified with Him&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:6); <strong>&ldquo;...died with Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:20).</p>
<p>These verses reveal to us that in His crucifixion, Christ brought us with Him through the death of the cross.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;You were raised together with Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:1).</p>
<p>This word shows us that in His resurrection, Christ also brought us with Him into resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>3) &ldquo;...seated us together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:6).</p>
<p>This word shows us that in ascending into heaven, Christ also brought us with Him into ascension.</p>
<p>Christ can bring us through death and resurrection and even into ascension because He is joined to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Living and Making His Home in Us</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Christ is in you&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:10).</p>
<p>Christ first became flesh to join Himself to us, and then He brought us with Him through death and resurrection and into ascension. After He accomplished God&rsquo;s eternal redemption through these steps, He came into us to further join Himself to us, applying to us what He had accomplished as God&rsquo;s full salvation. For this purpose, He became the One who is in us and is joined to us.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;Christ lives in me&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>In entering into us and being joined to us, Christ not only is in us but also is living in us; that is, He is living His life in us.</p>
<p><strong>3) &ldquo;That Christ may make His home in your hearts&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 3:17).</p>
<p>When Christ is joined to us within, He lives His life in us, and He also wants to make His home in our hearts; that is, He wants to saturate every part of our entire being, mingling with us as one. This shows that He will be joined to us to the uttermost.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. WE BEING JOINED TO CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Through Believing and Being Baptized</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...believes into Him [Christ]&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 10:43, lit.); <strong>&ldquo;...baptized into Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 3:27).</p>
<p>Originally we were born in Adam, apart from Christ (Eph. 2:12). Through our believing and being baptized, we have entered into Christ. This is the beginning of the experience of our being joined to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Through God&rsquo;s Anointing</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;But He who firmly attaches us [the apostles] with you [the believers] unto Christ and has anointed us [with the Holy Spirit] is God&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 1:21).</p>
<p>When we believe into the Lord and are baptized, God puts His Spirit in us and anoints us, firmly attaching us to Christ. On the one hand, it is we who believe and are baptized into Christ; on the other hand, it is God who attaches us unto Christ by anointing us with His Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Becoming a New Creation in Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...In Christ&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 12:2); <strong>&ldquo;...in Christ...a new creation&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
<p>By believing and being baptized into Christ, we become men of the new creation in Christ. We become such men by being joined to Christ in our experience.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Abiding in Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Abide in Me [Christ]&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:4); <strong>&ldquo;Abide in Him [Christ]&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:27).</p>
<p>After we enter into Christ to become a new creation in Him, we must remain in Him and abide in Him, taking Him as our dwelling and our resting place. In Christ we enjoy all that He is to us. We enjoy Him as our life and life supply, and as the peace, comfort, support, leading, joy, and hope that we need to live a heavenly, spiritual, holy, victorious, and transcendent life so that we may become transcendent persons, experiencing our being joined to Him in our living and our walk.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Living with Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Because I [Christ] live, you shall live also...and I in you&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:19-20); <strong>&ldquo;...live with Him [Christ]&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:8).</p>
<p>Both of these passages speak of our living with Christ. Our being joined to Christ begins with our entering into Him, continues with our remaining in Him and abiding in Him, and is intensified by our living with Him. This is the experience in our living of being joined to Him and of taking Him as life (Col. 3:4).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Being Manifested with Christ in Glory</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;You also shall be manifested with Him [Christ] in glory&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:4).</p>
<p>The ultimate state of our being joined to Christ, taking Him as life, and living in Him is to be manifested with Him in glory when He is manifested. This is the ultimate completion of our experience of being joined to Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON TWENTY-SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">ABIDING IN CHRIST</h1>
<p>When we believe and are baptized into Christ, we are in Christ. In Christ we obtain and enjoy all the riches in Him. To maintain such a position in Christ and to continue to enjoy all the riches in Him, we must continue to remain in Him, with the result that we abide in Him. Therefore, we must consider this matter thoroughly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ABIDING IN CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being Joined to Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;I [Christ] am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:5).</p>
<p>There is a difference between being in Christ and abiding in Christ. Being in Christ refers to the fact of our having entered into Christ to partake of Him and to be joined to Him. Abiding in Christ refers to the experience of our remaining in Christ to fellowship with and enjoy Him. In this verse the Lord Jesus speaks to us specifically concerning such an experience. He describes our life of abiding in Him by the illustration of the branches abiding in the vine. He is the vine and we are His branches. This shows us clearly that, if we desire to live in Him to enjoy all His life supply, thus bearing fruit to fulfill our duty as His members, we must abide in Him. This is like the branches of the vine, which must abide in the vine in order to enjoy all the life supply of the vine and bear fruit in order to fulfill their duty. If we are separated from Christ, like branches separated from the vine, we cannot live in Him nor can we receive the life supply from Him to bear fruit for Him. Therefore, if we would live in Christ, we must not be separated from Him.</p>
 <h2 class="head2">B. Having Fellowship with Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...and report to you the eternal life, which...was manifested to us...that you also may have fellowship with us [the apostles], and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:2-3).</p>
<p>These verses tell us that the reporting of the eternal life to us enables us to have fellowship with the apostles, and that the fellowship of the apostles is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. In other words, the eternal life, the life of God in Christ, that is, Christ Himself as life, brings a fellowship to us, that we may have fellowship not only with the apostles but also with God and Christ. This fellowship is the flowing of God&rsquo;s life in us, causing us to have fellowship with God and Christ, to participate in all that They are, and to enjoy Their life supply. To have fellowship with God and Christ in this way is to abide in Christ. This abiding will result in three conditions, as given below.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Enlightened</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:5-6).</p>
<p>When we have fellowship with God, who is light, such fellowship brings us into God&rsquo;s light that we may be enlightened. Thus, we will not walk in darkness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Confessing Our Sins and Being Cleansed</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;But if we walk in the light as He [God] is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin...if we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:7-9).</p>
<p>When we are enlightened by God in our fellowship with Him, we will see our own sins. If we confess our sins in God&rsquo;s light, He will forgive us our sins, and the blood of Jesus His Son will cleanse us from all sin. If we do not confess our sins in order to be cleansed, our sins will interrupt the fellowship which we have with God and with Christ. Only when we confess our sins and are cleansed is our fellowship with God and Christ restored. Then we may again abide in Christ without anything between us and Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Growing in Life</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...grows with the growth of God&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:19). By abiding in Christ and fellowshipping with Him, the life within us will continue to grow, and we will also grow with the growth of God&rsquo;s life unto maturity.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE WAY TO ABIDE IN CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. According to the Teaching of the Anointing</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;As His anointing...has taught you, abide in Him [Christ]&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:27).</p>
<p>The anointing mentioned here is the moving of the Holy Spirit, who dwells in us. Such moving of the Holy Spirit in us, as the ointment anointing us within, teaches us the truth. We should abide in the Lord according to the teaching of this anointing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Walking as the Lord Walked</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;He who says he abides in Him [Christ] ought himself also to walk even as that One walked&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:6).</p>
<p>To abide in Christ, on the one hand, we must be according to the teaching of the anointing of the Holy Spirit inwardly, and on the other hand, we must walk as the Lord walked outwardly. This means that we must abide in Christ according to the teaching of the Holy Spirit inwardly and according to the walk of the Lord outwardly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Keeping God&rsquo;s Commandments</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;And he who keeps His [God&rsquo;s] commandments abides in Him&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:24).</p>
<p>To abide in Christ, in addition to being according to the teaching of the anointing of the Holy Spirit and walking as the Lord walked, we must keep God&rsquo;s commandments, God&rsquo;s charges to us, and be those who are submissive to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE ISSUE OF ABIDING IN CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Christ Abiding in Us</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Abide in Me [Christ] and I in you&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:4); <strong>&ldquo;...abides in Him [God], and He in him&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:24).</p>
<p>The first issue of our abiding in Christ is that Christ and God abide in us to dispense Their riches to us, supplying and transfusing them into us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Bearing Much Fruit to Glorify God</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;He who abides in Me [Christ] and I in him, he bears much fruit&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:5). <strong>&ldquo;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:8).</p>
<p>If we abide in Christ, He also will abide in us, enabling us to enjoy all the riches of His life. Thus, we will bear much fruit to glorify God, that is to live out God that He may be expressed in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Boldly Meeting the Lord<br />
and Not Being Put to Shame</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Abide in Him [Christ], that if He is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:28).</p>
<p>If we abide in Christ and bear much fruit by His life to glorify God, when He is manifested, we will boldly meet Him and not be put to shame from His glorious presence (cf. Matt. 25:30).</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON TWENTY-EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING CHRIST</h1>
<p>(It is suggested that this deeper lesson be read at two different times, the second beginning from the section on &ldquo;Living Christ&rdquo; on page 30.)</p>
<p>We believe and are baptized into Christ to be joined to Him and to abide in Him for the purpose of experiencing Him. When we experience Christ, we gain and enjoy Him practically that He may be expressed through us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Christ Being Revealed in Us</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;It pleased God...to reveal His Son in me&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 1:15-16).</p>
<p>Our first experience of Christ is His being revealed in us. This is the key to our salvation and regeneration, and it is the central result of our being saved to be joined to God. It is also the beginning of our experience of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Christ Being in Us</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:10).</p>
<p>Once Christ is revealed in us, we immediately experience His being in us, which shows us that our body is dead because of sin, the very sin we inherited from Adam, and that our spirit is life because of righteousness, the righteousness we obtained from Christ. This is an experience which Christ gives us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Christ Abiding in Us</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;He who abides in Me [Christ] and I in him, he bears much fruit&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:5).</p>
<p>When we abide in Christ according to the fact of our being in Christ, Christ will abide in us, placing Himself in us to be our life and life supply that He may become our experience in life for us to bear much fruit.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;If anyone loves Me [Christ], he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:23).</p>
<p>Christ abides in us with the Father. We experience this when we love Him and keep His word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Christ Being Our Life</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...Christ our life&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:4).</p>
<p>The foremost and main thing that Christ does when He abides in us is to be our life that we may take Him as life and live by Him, no longer walking by our natural life. We should experience this day by day and moment by moment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Christ Living in Us</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>We must not only experience Christ abiding in us to be our life but also experience Christ living in us to be our living. To experience Christ in this way, we must deny ourselves by being in His death, and be able to say that it is no longer I who live. We must die in order to experience Christ living in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Christ Making His Home in Us</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith...that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 3:17-19).</p>
<p>We also need to experience Christ making His home in our hearts. He will not only live in us but also inwardly occupy every part of our being, make His home in our hearts, and settle down in us, saturating and filling our entire being that we may become the fullness of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Christ Being Formed in Us</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;I [the Apostle Paul] am again in travail until Christ is formed in you&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 4:19).</p>
<p>We also must experience Christ being formed in us, that is, His growing in us unto maturity until we reach His very stature (Eph. 4:13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Living Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;To me to live is Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 1:21).</p>
<p>&ldquo;To live is Christ&rdquo; is to live Christ. We must experience Christ in every aspect inwardly, and we must also experience living Him outwardly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. Magnifying Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 1:20).</p>
<p>Outwardly, we should have the experience not only of living Christ but also magnifying Christ. All things that happen to us are for us to magnify Christ. The more difficult the environment and the busier the work, the more we can magnify Christ. This is the peak of our experience of Christ outwardly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Christ Being Everything to the New Man</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Having put off the old man...and having put on the new man [which is corporate]...where [in the new man, the church] there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian [the most barbarous], slave, freeman, but Christ is all [persons] and in all [persons]&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:9-11).</p>
<p>These verses say that we who have believed in the Lord and are regenerated have put off our old man and have put on the new man. In this new man, the church, there is not the old man of a certain race, religion, culture, or class but Christ who is our life and the element which constitutes this new man. Christ is all the persons in this corporate new man, and He lives in all these persons. We should have many experiences of Christ related to this matter, and we should also have this full experience of Christ when our experiences of Him reach their peak.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE CONDITIONS<br />
FOR EXPERIENCING CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Abiding in Him</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;He who abides in Me and I in him...&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:5).</p>
<p>The first condition for experiencing Christ abiding in us is our abiding in Him. We must abide in Him, giving Him the time and space so that He may be able to abide in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Remaining in the Co-crucifixion with Him</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>Moreover, the experience of our co-crucifixion with Christ is also a basic condition for our experience of Christ. Since we are abiding in Him, we are surely remaining in our co-crucifixion with Him, that is, in His all-inclusive death, which nullifies our existence, so that it is no longer we who live. Thus, we allow Christ to live in us that we may experience and enjoy Him as our life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Loving Him and Keeping His Word</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:23).</p>
<p>Loving Christ and obeying His word are also conditions for us to experience Christ abiding in us. If we love Him and keep His word, He and the Father will come to abide with us that we may enjoy all the blessings of the Triune God abiding with us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Being Strengthened into the Inner Man</h2>
<p><strong>1) The Father &ldquo;would grant you...to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts...&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 3:16-17).</p>
<p>Our being strengthened by God with power through His Spirit into our inner man (our spirit) is the condition for our experiencing Christ making His home in our hearts. This experience of Christ is deep, and therefore its condition, which is that our whole being be strengthened by God into our spirit, is weighty.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Having All Boldness</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;With all boldness, as always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 1:20).</p>
<p>In order to magnify Christ, we must have boldness in all things, not caring for whether we live or die. This is the highest condition for our topmost experience of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE MEANS OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;For me this shall turn out to salvation through... the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 1:19).</p>
<p>We do not experience Christ by our ability or by our endeavoring, but through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of God, who participated in the incarnation, human living, and crucifixion of Jesus and the resurrection, ascension, and glorification of Christ. This Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit who is the ultimate expression of the Triune God. This bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit is the power and means for us to experience Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE ISSUE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Christ Being Formed in Us</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...until Christ is formed in you&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 4:19). The first issue of our experience of Christ is that Christ is formed in us. This refers to Christ growing and maturing in us unto a full stature (Eph. 4:13) that He may be fully expressed through us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. We Becoming God&rsquo;s Full Expression</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...Christ may make His home in your heart... that you...may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth [the unlimited dimensions of Christ]...that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 3:17-19).</p>
<p>The second issue of our experience of Christ is that we become God&rsquo;s full expression. This refers to Christ making His home in us that we may apprehend with all the saints His unlimited dimensions, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God to be the corporate expression of God.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON TWENTY-NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">TAKING CHRIST AS EVERYTHING</h1>
<p>The main revelation in the New Testament, especially in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, is the very Christ, whom God in His economy has prepared for us to be our experience. We have looked at this matter in a concise way in the previous lesson. Now let us see, in the book of Philippians, its conclusion, which is to take Christ as everything.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. TAKING CHRIST AS OUR LIVING</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;For to me to live is Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 1:21).</p>
<p>This word reveals to us that Paul, who experienced Christ richly and abundantly, took Christ as his living. In Philippians 1 he said that he lived Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. TAKING CHRIST AS OUR EXPRESSION</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;As always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 1:20).</p>
<p>This word shows us that Paul, who was rich in the experience of Christ, took Christ also as his expression. All his life and work were not for expressing himself or for displaying his knowledge, his ability, or his other merits and strong points. What he was and what he did were for expressing Christ, even for magnifying Christ, that Christ would be not only expressed through him but even magnified in him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. TAKING THE MIND OF CHRIST AS OUR MIND</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 2:5).</p>
<p>This verse means that we need to take Christ&rsquo;s mind as our mind. Paul not only took Christ as his living and expression without, but he also took the mind of Christ as his mind within. According to the text which follows, the thinking in the mind of Christ in this verse was that of One who changed from the form of God into the likeness of man to become a man, even emptying Himself to take the form of a slave and to humble Himself, becoming obedient unto death, even the death of a cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. TAKING CHRIST<br />
AS OUR LIVED-OUT RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;And be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God based on faith&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 3:9).</p>
<p>In experiencing Christ, Paul was found by others to be a man in Christ, not having a righteousness which was from his own keeping of the law, but having the righteousness from God through his faith in Christ, which is just Christ Himself lived out from him to be expressed as his righteousness. In such a way, Paul took Christ as the righteousness which he lived out.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. CONSIDERING THE KNOWLEDGE<br />
OF CHRIST EXCELLENT</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them refuse that I may gain Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 3:8).</p>
<p>Paul, who was rich in the experience of Christ, undoubtedly considered Christ to be the most excellent One. Thus, he shows us in one of the verses following Philippians 3:8 that he pursued the knowledge of Christ. His pursuit indicates his consideration of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. Because of the Christ whom he knew, he forsook all things, that is, he suffered the loss of all things and counted them refuse, that he might gain Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. TAKING CHRIST AS OUR GOAL</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;One thing&mdash;forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 3:13-14).</p>
<p>Paul, who pursued the knowledge of Christ in order to experience Him more deeply, considered his pursuit of Christ to be his only task. Thus, he pursued by forgetting the things which were behind and stretching forward to the things which were before. His pursuit was toward one aim, one goal, and that goal was Christ. He took Christ as his goal, pursuing to obtain the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. This prize is also Christ, that is, Christ as the enjoyment of His pursuers. Paul pursued upward, toward the heavens, to gain Christ, whom he took as the goal and prize.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. TAKING CHRIST AS OUR VIRTUES</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is righteous, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is well-spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 4:8).</p>
<p>Truthfulness, honor, righteousness, purity, loveliness, and that which is well-spoken of are six praiseworthy virtues. These virtues are the expressions of God&rsquo;s attributes lived out from within the pursuers of Christ, who is the embodiment of God. Paul, who pursued to experience Christ, charged the brothers to consider these things, that is, to live out these virtues and express all the attributes of God in Christ. Since he charged the brothers in this manner, he himself must obviously have been expressing God&rsquo;s attributes by taking Christ as his virtues.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. TAKING CHRIST AS OUR POWER</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;I can do all things in Him who empowers me&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 4:13).</p>
<p>Paul, who experienced Christ, was empowered by Christ; hence, he was able to do all things in Christ, which is mainly to live out the various kinds of virtues which express God&rsquo;s attributes mentioned in verse 8 preceding this word. This shows us that Paul experienced Christ by taking Christ as power to live out Christ as his magnificent living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IX. TAKING CHRIST AS OUR SECRET</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;I have learned, in whatever circumstances I am, to be content. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to be in want&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 4:11-12).</p>
<p>In any environment and in any matter, Paul, who experienced Christ richly and abundantly, learned the secret to be content and to rejoice always. According to his speaking throughout the book of Philippians, the secret he learned was just Christ. Thus, he took Christ as the secret to experience Christ, being content and rejoicing always in any situation and in any matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">X. TAKING CHRIST AS OUR EXPECTATION</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;For our citizenship is in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transfigure the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory, according to the operation of Him who is able even to subject all things to Himself&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 3:20-21).</p>
<p>The life which Paul lived in the experience of Christ was one that awaited the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who would come from the heavens to transfigure his body of humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory. Thus, he took the Christ whom he experienced as his expectation.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON THIRTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</h1>
<p>We can experience Christ and take Christ as everything because we have become one spirit with Him. This is a deep mystery, yet it is a sure fact which each of us who has believed into Christ and is joined to Him in His divine life must believe, confess, and practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. GOD BEING SPIRIT</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;God is Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (John 4:24).</p>
<p>This speaks of the nature of God. As far as the divine essence is concerned, God, the complete Triune God, is Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION OF<br />
THE TRIUNE GOD BEING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 28:19).</p>
<p>The Triune God is three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father is the source, the Son is the expression of the Father, and the Spirit is the realization of the Son. Hence, the Spirit is the ultimate expression of the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. CHRIST BECOMING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:45b).</p>
<p>The last Adam is the incarnated Christ, who through death and resurrection was transfigured to become the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life (2 Cor. 3:6, 17) as God&rsquo;s ultimate expression.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. OUR CENTER ALSO BEING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;May your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 5:23).</p>
<p>This verse clearly and definitely reveals to us that our complete person is of three parts&mdash;spirit, soul, and body. The body is our outermost part, by which we act and walk, and by which we contact the material things. The soul is the part between our body and our spirit as our personality and self, by which we contact the psychological things. The spirit is our innermost part by which we know and worship God, and by which we contact the spiritual things. Thus, the spirit is the center of our being and is crucial to God, more crucial than even the heavens and the earth (Zech. 12:1).</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. GOD RENEWING OUR SPIRIT AND<br />
PUTTING HIS SPIRIT IN US</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;A new spirit will I [Jehovah God, who is related to man] put within you...I will put my Spirit within you&rdquo;</strong> (Ezek. 36:26-27).</p>
<p>These verses refer to what God did when He saved us, the sinners. On the one hand, He renewed our spirit to make it a new spirit, and on the other hand, He put His Spirit within our renewed spirit, causing the two to be joined together as one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE SPIRIT OF GOD<br />
REGENERATING OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit...You must be born anew&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:6-7).</p>
<p>When God saved us, He put His Spirit into our renewed spirit, and then His Spirit imparted His life into our spirit, regenerating it, that is, regenerating us to make us His children (John 1:12-13).</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE SPIRIT OF GOD<br />
WITNESSING WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The Spirit [the Holy Spirit of God] Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:16).</p>
<p>After the Spirit of God regenerates our spirit, He remains in our spirit, witnessing with our spirit that we are the children of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. OUR SPIRIT WORSHIPPING THE SPIRIT,<br />
WHO IS GOD</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit...&rdquo;</strong> (John 4:24).</p>
<p>To worship the Spirit, who is God, in spirit is to worship Him with our spirit. To worship God is to contact God, which includes such things as drawing near to God, praying to God, trusting in God, and thanking God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IX. THE SPIRIT, WHO IS THE LORD,<br />
DWELLING IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...His [God&rsquo;s] Spirit who indwells you&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:11); <strong>&ldquo;...the Spirit...witnesses with our spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:16).</p>
<p>Combining these two verses, we see that the Spirit, the Spirit of God, is the Spirit who indwells us and who is joined to us as one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">X. JOINED TO THE LORD AS ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:17).</p>
<p>Based upon the various facts revealed in the foregoing verses, we may say that since we are joined to the Lord, we are one spirit with the Lord. This means that the spirit, which is the mingling of our spirit and the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit, is both the Spirit of the Lord and our spirit; it is the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit mingled with our spirit and our spirit mingled with the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit. The New Testament, in verses such as Romans 8:4-6 and Galatians 5:16 and 25, often uses this word, the spirit, which is the mingled spirit, to speak concerning what the Lord is to us and concerning our experience of the Lord. All our spiritual experiences after we are saved, such as our fellowship with the Lord, our prayer to Him, our living with Him, and our obedience to Him, are in this spirit, the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit and our spirit mingled into one.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON THIRTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIVING IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</h1>
<p>Once we believe into the Lord, we have a union with Him in life. This life then brings us the fellowship of life in which we should live, fellowshipping with God and sharing in all His riches. We ought to know this, pay attention to this, and practice this immediately after we are saved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;We...report to you the eternal life...that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:2-3).</p>
<p>Once we believe in the Lord and receive the eternal life, which was reported to us, it brings its fellowship of life, its flow of life, to us, that there may be a fellowship, a flow, between us and God. This fellowship carries God Himself and all His riches into us for our sharing and partaking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE TWO ASPECTS OF<br />
THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</h2>
<p><strong>1) Having fellowship with the apostles and with the church, which they represent&mdash;&ldquo;...we...report to you the eternal life...that you also may have fellowship with us [the apostles]&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:2-3).</p>
<p>The fellowship which we have through the entering into us of God&rsquo;s eternal life is of two aspects. On the one hand, we have fellowship with the apostles and with the church, which the apostles represent (1 Cor. 12:28); that is, we have fellowship with all those who possess the life of God. On the other hand, we have fellowship with God and the Lord. The aspect of our fellowship with all those who have God&rsquo;s life is called the fellowship of the apostles (Acts 2:41-42). All those who have believed into the Lord to have the life of God participate in this fellowship. The Lord&rsquo;s life is reported by the apostles to those who believe into the Lord that they may become the church, the Lord&rsquo;s Body, and the apostles are the representatives of the church, which is brought into being through the Lord&rsquo;s life. Hence, the fellowship of life in the church is called the fellowship of the apostles. When we have fellowship with the apostles, we have fellowship with the church.</p>
<p><strong>2) Having fellowship with God and with the Lord Jesus&mdash;&ldquo;That you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:3).</p>
<p>The other aspect of our fellowship in the Lord&rsquo;s life is our fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. The life to which this fellowship of life belongs is the life of God. This life is also the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Himself. Thus, this fellowship of life enables us to have fellowship not only with those who jointly possess God&rsquo;s life but also with God and the Lord Jesus. In this fellowship of life, there is a mutual fellowship and flowing between us and God and the Lord Jesus, and between us and all the believers. All these parties jointly participate in the Triune God and in the church, which is His organism, thus mutually sharing in one another.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE MEANS OF<br />
THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE&mdash;THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The fellowship of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 13:14).</p>
<p>Since the Lord&rsquo;s life is in the Holy Spirit and has entered into us through the Holy Spirit to be in us, our fellowship in the Lord&rsquo;s life is by means of the Holy Spirit. Hence, this fellowship is also called the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. In the Lord&rsquo;s life, both our fellowship with God and the Lord and our fellowship with the church or the saints are in and by means of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. ANOTHER DESIGNATION OF<br />
THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE&mdash;<br />
ABIDING IN THE LORD</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;And even as it [the anointing] has taught you, abide in Him [the Lord]&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:27); <strong>&ldquo;Abide in Me [the Lord]...for apart from Me you can do nothing&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:4-5).</p>
<p>As branches of the Lord, the vine, we must abide in the Lord and not be separated from Him. To thus abide in the Lord is to have fellowship with the Lord in order to practice the fellowship of the Lord&rsquo;s life, absorbing all the riches of the Lord as the branches absorb the supply from the vine.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A BELIEVER<br />
TOWARD THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</h2>
<p><strong>1) To continue steadfastly&mdash;&ldquo;Continuing steadfastly in...the fellowship&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:42).</p>
<p>Once we receive the Lord&rsquo;s life, we enter into the fellowship of His life. From then on, we should continue steadfastly in this fellowship of life.</p>
<p><strong>2) To obey the teaching of the anointing&mdash;&ldquo;And even as it [the anointing] has taught you, abide in Him [the Lord]&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:27).</p>
<p>For us to continue steadfastly in the fellowship of life, we must abide in the Lord as taught by the anointing, and we must obey the teaching of the anointing.</p>
<p><strong>3) To walk in the light&mdash;&ldquo;But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:7).</p>
<p>The fellowship of the Lord&rsquo;s life brings us into God&rsquo;s light. We must walk in this light that we may have fellowship with God and the Lord and with all the saints, and that we may maintain the fellowship of the Lord&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p><strong>4) To confess our sins&mdash;&ldquo;But if we walk in the light...we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His [God&rsquo;s] Son cleanses us from all sin...if we confess our sins, He [God] is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us...and cleanse us&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:7-9).</p>
<p>If we live in the fellowship of the Lord&rsquo;s life, the Lord&rsquo;s light of life within will show us our sins in the fellowship of His life. We will sense our sins and confess to God, and He will then forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness that we may more deeply live in the fellowship of His life.</p>
<p>The preceding four items are our responsibility toward the fellowship of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE ISSUE OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</h2>
<p><strong>1) Receiving God&rsquo;s light&mdash;&ldquo;God is light...if we say that we have fellowship with Him...if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:5-7).</p>
<p>This word shows us that when we have fellowship with God, who is light, we will surely receive God&rsquo;s light and walk in it that we may have uninterrupted fellowship with one another.</p>
<p><strong>2) Being cleansed by the Lord&rsquo;s blood&mdash;&ldquo;But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:7).</p>
<p>When we are enlightened by the Lord&rsquo;s light of life in the fellowship of life, and thus realize our sins and confess them to God, we are cleansed by the Lord&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p><strong>3) Having the Lord abide in us&mdash;&ldquo;He who abides in Me and I in him...&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:5).</p>
<p>When we abide in the Lord to have fellowship with Him, we have the Lord abiding in us as our enjoyment of life.</p>
<p><strong>4) Bearing much fruit to glorify God&mdash;&ldquo;He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:5); <strong>&ldquo;In this is My Father glorified&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:8).</p>
<p>When we abide in the Lord as branches in the Lord, the vine, and have an uninterrupted flow with Him, we receive the supply of the rich sap from Him as the vine to bear much fruit that the Father may be glorified.</p>
<p>The above four items are issues of our living in the fellowship of the Lord&rsquo;s life.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. THE BREAKING OF<br />
THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</h2>
<p><strong>1) The relationship of life between the believers and God being eternally unbreakable&mdash;&ldquo;They shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:28-29). The relationship of life between the believers and God will never be broken, because they have received the eternal life from God, which causes them never to perish. Moreover, since God&rsquo;s hand is mighty, nothing can snatch them out of His hand.</p>
<p><strong>2) The fellowship of life between the believers and God being breakable&mdash;&ldquo;But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:7). The word &ldquo;if&rdquo; in this verse indicates that the fellowship of life between us and God is breakable. If we walk in God&rsquo;s light, we will live in the fellowship of God&rsquo;s life. However, since we often fail to live in God&rsquo;s light, often disobeying and sinning, we often lose the fellowship of God&rsquo;s life, thus causing it to be broken.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. THE RESTORATION<br />
OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</h2>
<p><strong>1) By the confession of sins&mdash;&ldquo;If we confess our sins, He [God] is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:9). Thank God that although our fellowship of life with Him can be broken, it can also be restored. If we are willing to confess our sins to God according to His shining, He will forgive us and cleanse us from our sins. This is according to His faithfulness based on His word and according to His righteousness because of the Lord&rsquo;s blood in order that our fellowship of life with Him may be restored.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IX. THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE NEEDING TO BE MAINTAINED BY THE SENSE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>1) The Lord&rsquo;s life in us not only has its fellowship but also has its sense. This sense of life is for the fellowship of life. The fellowship of life is maintained in the sense of life. Whenever we neglect the sense of life, the fellowship of life is broken and lost, and the sense of life thus becomes dull.</p>
<p>2) If we will once again care for and obey this dull sense of life, the fellowship of life will be restored, even deepened, and the sense of life will also be keener. These two&mdash;the sense of life and the fellowship of life&mdash;reciprocally affect each other in a continuous cycle, causing the believers to grow in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">X. THE DANGER TO A BELIEVER NOT LIVING<br />
IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</h2>
<p><strong>1) Losing the supply and function of life and suffering loss&mdash;&ldquo;Every branch in Me [the Lord] that does not bear fruit, He [God] takes it away&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:2); <strong>&ldquo;If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is dried up; and they gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:6). If a saved person, who is a branch of the Lord, the vine, does not bear fruit, he will be taken away. The reason for his fruitlessness is that he does not abide in the Lord, in the fellowship of His life. Hence, he is taken away, cast out, dried up, gathered, and cast into the fire to be burned. If we do not abide in the Lord and live in the fellowship of life, we will run a great risk of being cut off from the Lord and of losing our supply and function, thus suffering loss. However, this is not to perish but to suffer loss, to be punished (1 Cor. 3:15), because here the Lord is not speaking about the conditions of salvation but about the conditions of fruitbearing.</p>
<p><strong>2) Being fearful and put to shame&mdash;&ldquo;Abide in Him [the Lord], that if He is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:28).</p>
<p>If we abide in the Lord and have fellowship with Him, we spontaneously walk before the Lord and live in His will. This will cause us to have boldness and not be put to shame at the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Otherwise, when we see Him, we will be in fear and will be put to shame, being separated from His presence. Such danger should warn us to live in the fellowship of the Lord&rsquo;s life.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON THIRTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">OBEYING THE SENSE OF LIFE</h1>
<p>When we believe into Christ and are joined to Him in life, His life in us produces a sense of life, which we who are joined to Him, who are one spirit with Him, and who experience Him must pay attention to and obey in our spiritual life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. WHAT THE BELIEVERS HAVE ONCE THEY ARE SAVED</h2>
<p>In order to obey the sense of life, we must know the six items which we have once we are saved.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Light of Life</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:12); <strong>&ldquo;The life was the light of men&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:4).</p>
<p>The moment we receive the Son of God as our Savior, we have the Son of God and we have the life, because the life is in Him (1 John 5:11). This life is the light of men. Therefore, since we have this life, we also have the light of life illuminating us within.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. God&rsquo;s Laws Inscribed on the Heart</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 8:10).</p>
<p>In the Old Testament God&rsquo;s laws were written on tablets of stone outside of man. In the New Testament, God imparts, or puts, His laws into our mind within us and inscribes them on our hearts. This is accomplished through God imparting His life to us and putting it inside of us, that the law within His life may become the law of our heart and of our mind. A law is not necessarily a life, but a life surely is a law with an innate ability and function. Furthermore, the higher the life, the higher the law of this life. Since the life of God within us is the highest life, this life in us is not merely a law, but the highest law with the highest innate ability and function. Once we are saved and have the life of God, we have this law of life inscribed on our hearts.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Law of the Spirit of Life</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:2).</p>
<p>The Spirit of life is the Spirit of God in our spirit. Since the Spirit of God is of life, His law must also be of life. This is the law of the Spirit of life. Hence, the law of the Spirit of life and the aforementioned laws written on our hearts are related and are one. That the laws are written on our hearts indicates that these laws are in life, the emphasis being on the function of life. The law of the Spirit of life indicates that the law of life within us is of the Holy Spirit, who is in our spirit, the emphasis being on the function of the Holy Spirit. As soon as we are saved, we have both.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. God Operating Within</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 2:13).</p>
<p>Once we are saved, God comes to live in us and to operate in us that we may will within and work without to fulfill His good pleasure.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Christ Living Within</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Christ lives in me&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>Once we are saved, we also have Christ living in us as life. His living in us is both effectual and active.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Anointing Within</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The anointing which you received from Him [the Son with the Father] abides in you&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:27).</p>
<p>In the Bible the anointing oil refers to the Holy Spirit (Luke 4:18). As soon as we are saved God anoints us with His Spirit (2 Cor. 1:21-22). The anointing is the inward moving of the Holy Spirit, with whom we are anointed. The moving of the Holy Spirit is like an ointment anointing us within, causing us to sense God&rsquo;s mind and teaching us in all things.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE SENSE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>1) The shining of the light of life within us causes us to have a sense within.</p>
<p>Since the light of life is the Lord&rsquo;s life shining in us, this shining will definitely produce a sense of life within, so that we may sense what is of the Lord and what is pleasing to Him.</p>
<p>2) The manifestation of the function of the laws inscribed on our hearts by God and the law of the Spirit of life also enables us to have a sense within.</p>
<p>Since both the laws written on our hearts by God and the law of the Spirit of life within us are an innate function of the Lord&rsquo;s life in us, whenever this function is manifested, we will have a feeling. This feeling is the sense of life, which we can perceive through the function of the law of life.</p>
<p>3) God&rsquo;s operating in us also causes us to have a sense within.</p>
<p>Since God&rsquo;s operating in us is an activity, it will produce a feeling within. This feeling is the sense of life in us, which causes us to sense what God desires us to will and to do.</p>
<p>4) Christ&rsquo;s living in us also causes us to have a sense within.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s living in us is full of doings, definitely causing us to have a sense within. Since this sense is out of the activities of Christ&rsquo;s life within, it is surely of life. Therefore, it also is the sense of life.</p>
<p>5) The anointing in us also causes us to have a sense within.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit anoints us as the ointment within us. His moving also causes us to have the sense of life in our spirit. Hence, after we are saved, we have not only life but also the sense of life within that we may know inwardly the mind of God and the things pertaining to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; RESPONSIBILITY<br />
TOWARD THE SENSE OF LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Walking Only according to Spirit,<br />
Setting the Mind on the Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Walk...according to spirit;...the mind set on the spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:4-6).</p>
<p>The sense of life in us is from the Spirit and is also in our spirit. Thus, our first responsibility toward the sense of life is to walk only according to spirit, setting our mind on the spirit. That is, we should obey the spirit and mind the spirit in everything.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Caring for the Inner Sense of Life</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The mind set on the spirit is life and peace&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:6).</p>
<p>When we set our mind on the spirit, we have life and peace within. Both life and peace are the sense of life within, which can be perceived by us. Hence, we need to care for the sense of life and peace within.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Obeying with Fear and Trembling</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Even as you have always obeyed...work out your own salvation with fear and trembling&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 2:12).</p>
<p>We must obey with fear and trembling the operation of God which we sense within, whether this operation is for the willing or the working. Fear is our inward motive, and trembling is our outward attitude. We should obey in this way the sense of life within us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Abiding in the Lord<br />
according to the Teaching of the Anointing</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;As His anointing...has taught you, abide in Him [the Lord]&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:27).</p>
<p>The anointing in us teaches us to know the Lord and the things pertaining to the Lord. We should abide in the Lord to have fellowship with Him according to this teaching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE ISSUE OF OBEYING THE SENSE OF LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Enjoying Life and Peace</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The mind set on the spirit is life and peace&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:6).</p>
<p>By setting our mind on the spirit, we have the sense of life. If we obey this sense of life, we will enjoy life and peace. Life is satisfaction, and peace is rest. The enjoyment of the satisfaction of life and the rest of peace is an immediate issue of our obeying the sense of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Abiding in the Lord</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;As His anointing...has taught you, abide in Him [the Lord]&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:27).</p>
<p>The teaching of the anointing gives us the sense of life within. By obeying this sense of life, we can abide in the Lord. This also is an issue of obeying the sense of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Living Out Our Salvation</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;You...obeyed,...work out your own salvation with fear and trembling&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 2:12).</p>
<p>We have obtained salvation, but after obtaining salvation, we still need to live out this salvation, as this verse says, &ldquo;Work out your own salvation.&rdquo; When we obey with fear and trembling the sense of life that comes from God&rsquo;s moving within us, we live out the salvation that we have obtained. This also is an issue of our obeying the sense of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Fulfilling God&rsquo;s Good Pleasure</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;You...obeyed...God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 2:12-13).</p>
<p>The fulfilling of God&rsquo;s good pleasure is another issue of our obeying the sense of life from the operation of God in us.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON THIRTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">OBEYING THE TEACHING<br />
OF THE ANOINTING</h1>
<p>Obeying the teaching of the anointing is intimately related to obeying the sense of life covered in the previous lesson. Obeying the sense of life is related to Christ as life within us, whereas obeying the teaching of the anointing is related to the moving of the Holy Spirit within us. The former is a matter of life and the latter is a matter of the Spirit. These two together are just one thing, that is, to live in the Spirit of life, to live and walk by following the operation of the law of life, and to live a spiritual and victorious life which manifests the Triune God in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ANOINTING</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;And you have an anointing from the Holy One&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:20); <strong>&ldquo;The anointing which you received from Him abides in you&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:27).</p>
<p>In biblical typology, the ointment signifies the Holy Spirit, with whom God anoints those whom He would use (Luke 4:18). The anointing of the holy ointment is the moving of this Holy Spirit as ointment within us. This is not merely the ointment but the anointing. It signifies not only the Holy Spirit but also the moving of the Holy Spirit. This is/the continuous anointing and moving, which we receive from the Holy One, the Father and the Son, and which abides in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things...&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:27); <strong>&ldquo;You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:20).</p>
<p>The teaching of the anointing is the sense and the knowledge that come from the anointing, the moving, of the Holy Spirit as the ointment within us. This teaching does not cause us to understand or to know by the written word or by speaking; rather, it causes us to sense and to realize by its moving and gentle rubbing, which often are comprehensible but unutterable. The sense derived from the anointing and the sense of life from the Lord&rsquo;s life within us are actually one. The moving and gentle rubbing of the Holy Spirit become feelings which we can sense through the sense of life from the Lord, causing us to understand God&rsquo;s mind and the things pertaining to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE ELEMENTS OF THE ANOINTING</h2>
<p>The anointing carries with it certain elements, just like the paint which can be applied to furniture. The elements which the anointing carries with it are just God Himself, God&rsquo;s substance. The more this anointing gently rubs us within, the more the elements of God and the substance of God are rubbed into us. Thus, this anointing brings us not only its teaching but also God&rsquo;s elements. It causes us not only to know God and the things pertaining to God but also to obtain God&rsquo;s rich elements. It causes us not only to do the things of God but also to gain the increase of God within, resulting in our growth and our increase in stature in the elements of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
THE ANOINTING OF THE OIL<br />
AND THE APPLICATION OF THE BLOOD</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand: and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the Lord: and the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering&rdquo;</strong> (Lev. 14:25-28).</p>
<p>The blood of the trespass offering mentioned here typifies the redeeming blood which Christ shed for us. The oil mentioned here typifies the Holy Spirit, with whom God anoints us. The Holy Spirit as oil anointing us signifies God in the Spirit as His ultimate expression reaching us. God&rsquo;s reaching us in this way must be based on the blood of the redemption which Christ accomplished for us. This redeeming blood of Christ is the very basis upon which God reaches us. In the Old Testament type, first the blood was put upon the person, and then the oil for anointing was put upon the blood. In the New Testament, first the blood of Christ sprinkles us (1 Pet. 1:2); then the Spirit, with whom God anoints us, is anointed into us and is being continually anointed into us based upon the redemption of Christ&rsquo;s blood. Thus, in order for us to obtain this Spirit and to have the Spirit anointing us continuously, we must rely on the precious blood of Christ&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING<br />
AND THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR MIND</h2>
<p>The teaching of the anointing is the sense which comes from the moving of the indwelling Spirit in our spirit, causing us to sense deep within the things which God wants us to know. The understanding of the mind is our interpretation of the teaching of the anointing. This interpretation is in the comprehension of our mind. By this means we understand the things which God wants us to know through the teaching of the anointing. This can be illustrated by the experience of a person who goes to see a movie after he has just been saved. He feels uncomfortable and uneasy deep in his spirit, but he does not understand the reason. Eventually, after being taught, his mind comes to realize that there are many ungodly elements in the matter of watching movies, and he begins to understand that the discomfort and uneasiness in his spirit is the anointing, the moving, of the Holy Spirit within him. In this way he is taught by the anointing, the moving, of the Holy Spirit in him, and he is sanctified.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. OBEYING THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The anointing which you received from Him abides in you,...and even as it has taught you, abide in Him&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:27).</p>
<p>This word tells us to abide in the Lord according to the teaching of the anointing within. To walk according to the teaching of the anointing is to obey the teaching of the anointing. This is necessary for our abiding in the Lord and our maintaining fellowship with the Lord. When we obey the inward teaching of the anointing, we are following the Spirit, we are living in the fellowship of the Lord&rsquo;s life, and we are living before God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE ISSUE OF OBEYING<br />
THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING</h2>
<p>Since the anointing is the gentle rubbing and moving of the Holy Spirit in us with God&rsquo;s element, when we obey its teaching, we have the increase of God&rsquo;s element within and are led to live before His face at every time and in every place, abiding in Him and fellowshipping with Him in an uninterrupted flow. Thus, we obtain His abiding in us and enjoy the topmost blessing of His presence. At such a time we enter into the realm mentioned in the chorus of <em>Hymns</em>, #551, which says, &ldquo;I have passed the riven veil, here the glories never fail...I am living in the presence of the King.&rdquo; This is our passing through the veil of the flesh to live before God, our entering into the Holy of Holies, our living in our spirit to have fellowship with God face to face.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON THIRTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</h1>
<p>Obeying the teaching of the anointing, in the previous lesson, and obeying the sense of life, in Lesson Thirty-two, are closely related. Likewise, the subject of this lesson&mdash; walking according to spirit&mdash;and obeying the teaching of the anointing, in the previous lesson, are just one. Hence, these three&mdash;obeying the sense of life, obeying the teaching of the anointing, and walking according to spirit&mdash;are but three aspects of one thing. Obedience to the sense of life is related to Christ as life and is a matter of life; obedience to the teaching of the anointing is related to the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s anointing, or moving, as the ointment and is a matter of the Spirit of life; walking according to spirit concerns our walk according to the mingled spirit, and is not only a matter of the Spirit of life but also of our regenerated spirit. These three join together Christ, who is life, the Spirit of life, and our regenerated spirit. Christ as life causes us to have the sense of life, the anointing and moving of the Holy Spirit causes us to be taught by the Spirit, and our being mingled with the Spirit of the Lord&rsquo;s life into one spirit causes us to walk in our spirit according to the sense of the Lord&rsquo;s life, which comes from the moving of the Spirit of life. This is the processed Triune God mingling Himself with us as one. This mingling is in Christ, who became the life-giving Spirit, through the Spirit of life as His ultimate expression, and in our regenerated spirit. As a result, the Triune God accomplishes His New Testament economy, that is, His eternal economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SPIRIT WHICH IS THE MINGLING<br />
OF TWO SPIRITS INTO ONE</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:17).</p>
<p>The New Testament clearly and emphatically reveals to us that we, who are regenerated by the Holy Spirit to have God&rsquo;s Spirit of life indwelling our regenerated spirit, are one spirit with the Lord. This means that our regenerated spirit and the Spirit of life, who regenerated us, are mingled as one spirit. In such New Testament verses as Romans 8:4, and also verses 5 and 6, as well as Galatians 5:16 and 25, the word &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; refers to this mingled spirit, which is the Spirit of God and also is our spirit. On the one hand, it is our spirit; on the other hand, it is the Spirit of God. The Apostle Paul was full of the experiences of this mingled spirit. Thus, he told us to walk according to this mingled spirit. This is not merely to walk according to the Spirit of God but to walk by following our regenerated spirit, which is indwelt by the Spirit of God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE LIVING AND WALK<br />
WHICH THE BELIEVERS SHOULD HAVE</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk [live and walk] according to flesh, but according to spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:4).</p>
<p>According to the desire of the Triune God, who mingled Himself with us, our living as believers is not only a living that is scriptural, nor merely a living that is &ldquo;sanctified&rdquo; and &ldquo;victorious,&rdquo; but a living that is a walk according to the spirit in us, which spirit is the mingling of two spirits as one. Such a living causes our flesh, our self, our soul, and our natural life to lose their position and function, and allows the processed Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, to gain the full ground in us in order that He may reach the goal of mingling Himself with our tripartite being, the spirit, the soul, and the body, that is, that we may be fully occupied by Him and filled and saturated with Him, taking Him as our life, our person, and our everything, that we may be completely one with Him to be His full expression. This experience far surpasses that which is expressed by such spiritual terms as obeying God, being sanctified unto God, abiding in the Lord, and fellowshipping with the Lord. This living not only satisfies the righteous requirement of God&rsquo;s law so that, with respect to His righteousness, He is no longer hindered; it also fulfills the purpose of God&rsquo;s economy so that He is fully satisfied with respect to His holiness and has absolutely no shortage with respect to His glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. TWO KINDS OF WALK</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 5:16).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk&rdquo; in this verse is the same word as in Romans 8:4. It refers to the general walk in our living, and it is different from the walk in Galatians 5:25, which is according to a rule.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk [according to a rule] by the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 5:25).</p>
<p>Walking orderly refers to walking in a definite line, by a definite rule. Although this too is a &ldquo;walk by the Spirit&rdquo; in our living, it is not general but specific and according to a definite rule. In Galatians 6:15 and 16, Paul, the author of the book, advises us that we must walk according to &ldquo;this rule,&rdquo; the rule that circumcision is nothing, and that the crucial thing is to be a new creation. The two kinds of walk in our living as believers, whether the general walk or the specific walk that is according to a definite rule, must be according to the spirit in us, which is the mingling of the two spirits into one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. LIVING AND WALKING ONLY ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Do not walk [live and walk] according to flesh, but according to spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:4).</p>
<p>Since, as indicated previously, living and walking according to spirit is so crucial, we must not live and walk according to flesh but according to spirit. Actually, any living and walking that is according to things other than the spirit is a living and walking according to flesh. If we do not walk according to spirit but endeavor to walk according to the Bible, we are actually, if not apparently, walking according to flesh. This is because we are keeping the words of the Bible with our own strength, just as the Israelites kept the law with their own power. One who walks according to spirit does everything by the spirit and not by his own strength. In this way, our walk is not merely to do what pleases God according to His will but to carry out what God wants us to do by God Himself, who is the Holy Spirit mingled with our spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON THIRTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">AWAITING THE LORD&rsquo;S COMING</h1>
<p>If we, the believers, live a life in the Triune God that is sanctified, spiritual, victorious, and one spirit with the Lord according to that which was covered in the previous ten lessons of this volume, we will surely await the Lord&rsquo;s coming with eager expectation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE LORD&rsquo;S PROMISE</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The Son of Man [the Lord] is about to come&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 16:27); <strong>&ldquo;I [the Lord] come quickly&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 22:20).</p>
<p>In these two portions and in many other verses in the New Testament, the Lord definitely promised that He will come again.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. WHAT THE LORD&rsquo;S COMING IS TO THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Rapture of the Believers</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;The Lord Himself...will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we who are living, who remain, shall be caught up at the same time together with them in clouds into a meeting of the Lord in the air; and so we shall be always together with the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 4:16-17).</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;So also shall the coming of the Son of Man be. Then shall two men be in the field; one is taken...Two women shall be grinding at the mill; one is taken&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:39-41).</p>
<p>Both passages clearly show us that, when the Lord comes back, He will rapture us who belong to Him from this dark world and this corrupted earth to meet Him and be together with Him forever.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Transfiguration of the Believers</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;From which [the heavens]...the Lord Jesus Christ...will transfigure the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory, according to the operation of Him who is able even to subject all things to Himself&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 3:20-21).</p>
<p>These verses reveal to us that the Lord Jesus will come from the heavens to transfigure with His great power the believers&rsquo; body of humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory. This is for the redemption of our body, which will free us from all the problems in the old creation (Rom. 8:23).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Rewarding of the Believers</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Behold, I [the Lord] come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book [because he will be rewarded]&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 22:7).</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;Behold, I [the Lord] come quickly, and My reward is with Me to render to each one according to his work&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 22:12).</p>
<p><strong>3) &ldquo;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever...to give the reward to Your [the Lord God&rsquo;s] slaves the prophets, and to the saints and to those who fear Your name, to the small and to the great&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 11:15-18).</p>
<p>The above three passages indicate to us that, when He comes again to possess the kingdom, the Lord will reward all those who belong to Him (Of course, some will receive His punishment, because He said, &ldquo;My reward is with Me,&rdquo; implying that there is not only reward but also punishment.)</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE ATTITUDE THE BELIEVERS<br />
SHOULD HAVE TOWARD THE LORD&rsquo;S COMING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Waiting</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;We should live soberly and righteously and godly in the present age, awaiting the blessed hope, even the appearing of the glory of the great God and our Savior, Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 2:12-13).</p>
<p>Regarding the coming of our Lord, we should have a godly living in which we await His glorious appearing. This appearing should be the blessing we hope for.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Watching</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:42); <strong>&ldquo;And take heed to yourselves lest at some time your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and anxieties of life, and that day come upon you suddenly as a snare; for it will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of all the earth. But be watchful, at every time beseeching, that you may prevail to escape all these things which are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 21:34-36).</p>
<p>These two portions of the Scripture tell us that we must be careful and watchful, and we must be beseeching, so that when the Lord comes we may overcome and be able to escape all the calamities which will come upon all peoples on the earth and to stand before Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Loving</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Henceforth, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord...will award to me in that day; and not only to me, but also to all those who have loved His appearing&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:8).</p>
<p>Even more, we need to desire and love the Lord&rsquo;s coming again, not that we may gain His reward, but that we may gain His lovely Self.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 22:20).</p>
<p>This should be the longing and cry of those who love the Lord and who love His coming again. This should also become our constant prayer.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON THIRTY-SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">RAPTURED TO MEET THE LORD</h1>
<p>After we have believed in the Lord and are saved, because of the demand of the divine life which we have received and because of the intensity of our love toward the Lord, we desire to pursue a life that awaits the Lord&rsquo;s coming. In such a life of loving the Lord and waiting for the Lord, we also expect, according to that which is revealed and prophesied in the Bible, to be raptured to the Lord, to meet together joyfully with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. TWO CATEGORIES OF RAPTURE</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, the rapture of the believers is divided into two categories according to the difference in their individual life and work before the Lord after their salvation. The first is the rapture of the overcoming believers, and the second, the rapture of the majority of the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE RAPTURE OF THE OVERCOMING BELIEVERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Need</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;For then there shall be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall be&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:21).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus prophesied here that, at the end of this age, great tribulation, such as is unequaled either before or after its time, will come upon the people of the world.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;...and that day come upon you suddenly as a snare; for it will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of all the earth&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 21:34-35).</p>
<p>&ldquo;That day&rdquo; refers to the day mentioned above, the day of the coming of the great tribulation, which is unequaled before or after its time. At the end of this age, the day of the great tribulation will suddenly come as a snare upon all the inhabitants of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>3) &ldquo;...the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 3:10).</p>
<p>This verse tells us that the great tribulation, which is about to come, is to try the people of the whole inhabited earth.</p>
<p><strong>4) &ldquo;Whenever they say, Peace and security, then sudden destruction comes upon them, as birth pangs to a woman with child, and they shall by no means escape&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 5:3).</p>
<p>The coming great tribulation mentioned previously will come suddenly upon men when they are saying, &ldquo;Peace and security,&rdquo; that is, when they are seeking peace and security. It will come upon them as birth pangs to a woman with child, and they will by no means escape.</p>
<p>According to the revelation in the foregoing Scriptures, the believers who live in this corrupt, dark age, which will be beset with calamities, definitely need to be raptured that they may be delivered out of this evil earth to be with the Lord, whom they long for.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Promise</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;But be watchful, at every time beseeching, that you may prevail [or, be counted worthy] to escape all these things which are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 21:36).</p>
<p>In the original language, &ldquo;to stand&rdquo; in this verse is in the passive voice; hence, it has the meaning of being put in a certain place, referring to our being raptured to the presence of Christ. In this word the Lord promised that if we are watchful and beseeching so that we overcome to escape (or, are counted worthy to escape) all the coming tribulations, we will be placed in, that is, raptured to, His presence.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 3:10).</p>
<p>In this word the Lord promised us that if we keep the word of His endurance, He will keep us out of the hour in which the people on the whole earth will be tried, that is, He will take us out of the hour in which the whole earth will suffer the great tribulation.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Fact</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...so also shall the coming of the Son of Man be. Then shall two men be in the field; one is taken, and one is left. Two women shall be grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:39-41).</p>
<p>This is the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy, that at His coming, some believers will be raptured and others will be left. Undoubtedly, those who are raptured are the believers mentioned previously, who overcome or are counted worthy to escape; those who are left are the believers who are defeated and who remain.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;And she [the woman] brought forth a son, a man-child, who was about to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:5).</p>
<p>The woman refers to the totality of God&rsquo;s chosen people throughout the generations. The man-child refers to the overcomers among God&rsquo;s chosen people, who will rule the nations. Before the end of this age, the overcomers among God&rsquo;s chosen people will be raptured to God and to His throne in the heavens.</p>
<p><strong>3) &ldquo;...the Lamb standing on mount Zion [in the heavens], and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand...These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He may go. These were purchased from among men as firstfruit to God and to the Lamb&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 14:1-4).</p>
<p>This word of prophecy discloses to us that before the end of this age, a group of overcomers, signified by the one hundred and forty-four thousand, will be raptured to the heavens to stand with the Lamb-Christ on the heavenly mount Zion. Purchased from among men, they are those who follow the Lamb absolutely and who have become the firstfruit to God and to the Lamb.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Time</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;I also will keep you out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 3:10).</p>
<p>The hour of trial for all those who dwell on the earth is the time of the great tribulation. Here, the Lord promises the overcoming saints that He will keep them from the hour of trial; that is, He will take them away from the earth, which is under trial, to the heavens before the great tribulation.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;...a man-child...was caught up to God and to His throne. And the woman fled into the wilderness...so that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days,&rdquo;</strong> that is, <strong>&ldquo;a time, and times, and half a time&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:5-6, 14).</p>
<p>One thousand two hundred and sixty days, or three and a half years, is the time during which the people of the earth will be tried by the great tribulation. Before the three and a half years, the overcoming man-child, the overcoming saints, will be raptured to God and to His throne in the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Place</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Caught up to God and to His throne&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:5); <strong>&ldquo;On mount Zion [in the heavens]&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 14:1).</p>
<p>These two verses show us that the overcoming believers who are raptured before the great tribulation are taken to mount Zion in the heavens, where God and His throne are.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Conditions</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;But be watchful, at every time beseeching&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 21:36); <strong>&ldquo;Watch...be ready...&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:42-44); <strong>&ldquo;...looking for their own lord...that when he comes...&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 12:36).</p>
<p>The items mentioned in these verses&mdash;to be watchful, to beseech at every time, and to look for the Lord&rsquo;s coming&mdash; are the conditions for us to be raptured as the overcomers among the believers.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;...those who have loved His [the Lord&rsquo;s] appearing&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:8); <strong>&ldquo;You have kept the word of My [the Lord&rsquo;s] endurance&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 3:10); <strong>&ldquo;He who overcomes, and he who keeps My [the Lord&rsquo;s] works [which the Lord accomplished and will accomplish] until the end&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 2:26).</p>
<p>The items mentioned in these verses&mdash;to love the Lord&rsquo;s appearing, to keep the word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance, and to overcome and keep the works which the Lord accomplished and will accomplish, that is, to keep all that the Lord has accomplished for us&mdash;are also conditions for us to be raptured as the overcomers among the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE RAPTURE OF THE MAJORITY<br />
OF THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p><strong>1) The fact&mdash;&ldquo;And He who sat on the cloud [the coming Christ] thrust His sickle over the earth [that is, sent the angels], and the earth [the believers] was reaped [raptured]&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 14:16).</h2>
<p>This verse speaks of the rapture of the majority of the believers, which is apart from that of the overcoming believers.</p>
<p><strong>2) The persons&mdash;the resurrected saints and the believers &ldquo;who are living, who remain&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 4:16-17).</p>
<p>These verses indicate that the majority of the believers who will be raptured are the dead saints, who will be resurrected, and the believers who are living and remain after the rapture of the overcoming believers.</p>
<p><strong>3) The time&mdash;&ldquo;...the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together [being raptured] to Him...the day...will not come unless...the man of lawlessness [Antichrist] is revealed&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 2:1-3); <strong>&ldquo;...at the last trumpet&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:52).</p>
<p>These two passages tell us that the time of the believers&rsquo; rapture will be after the revelation of Antichrist, at the end of the great tribulation, when the angel sounds the last trumpet and the Lord comes to gain His kingdom (Rev. 11:15; 1 Thes. 4:16).</p>
<p><strong>4) The place&mdash;&ldquo;...in clouds...in the air&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 4:17).</p>
<p>The majority of the believers will be raptured to the air, unlike the overcoming believers, who will be raptured to the throne of God in the heavens.</p>
<p><strong>5) The condition&mdash;&ldquo;The harvest [the believers]...is ripe&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 14:15).</p>
<p>The condition for the rapture of the majority of the believers is maturity in life. Like the unripened harvest that cannot be reaped, an immature believer cannot be raptured.</p></body></html>
