   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE FORTY-ONE WALKING BY THE SPIRIT TO LIVE CHRIST Scripture Reading: Gal 1:13-15a, 16a; 2:19-20; 3:2, 5, 26-27; 4:6, 19, 29; 5:16, 18, 22-23; 6:18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the book of Galatians God s two economies, His Old Testament economy and His New Testament economy, are dealt with in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning each of these economies, the Bible uses a particular word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word for God s economy in the Old Testament is law, and the word for His economy in the New Testament is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Which do you prefer, law or Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In contrast to the Jews, who love the law, we who believe in Christ would all say that we prefer Christ to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yes, on the one hand, we do love Christ, but, on the other hand, we may still embrace the law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In actual experience, we may embrace the law more than we embrace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A HIDDEN LOVE FOR THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Most Christians who love the Lord and have a heart to seek Him have a hidden love for the law.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When some hear such a word, they may argue and say, We don t want the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We love Christ and want only Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This may be the situation on the surface, but deep within, subconsciously, most Christians still love the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although they may not realize it, there is some kind of law hidden within them, like a cancer growing on a person s vital inward organs.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such a person may appear healthy on the surface, but he has a serious disease within him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only when surgery is performed does the extent of this disease become known.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may be good Christians who love the Lord and seek Him; however, we may not be conscious of the fact that we still keep the law hidden within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not many Christians have their daily walk according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Can you say that you have been walking according to Christ today?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During times of prayer we may have our living and our being according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But after we pray we may have our living and our being according to something other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we do not live according to Christ, we live according to law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is my reason for saying that although we love Christ, we still hold to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our situation can be compared to that of Abraham, who loved Sarah, his wife, but who also became involved with Hagar, a concubine, who signifies the law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 4:24 and 25 Paul identifies Hagar with Mount Sinai, the place where the law was given.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In typology Hagar, the maidservant, signifies the law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In a very real sense, Hagar, the law, is within us, and we love her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This law may not be the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, it may be some type of self-made law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As seeking Christians, we may walk day by day according to the law hidden within us, not according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suppose, for example, that a sister is subject to many irritations, but she does not become angry and lose her temper.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Her behavior is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, we need to ask why she does not lose her temper.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Is it because she is living according to Christ, or because she is walking according to certain rules and regulations?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us suppose, as another example, that whenever a certain brother is tempted to tell a lie, he exercises himself to speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But why does he tell the truth instead of a lie?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Does he speak the truth according to Christ or according to some kind of rule or regulation?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In other words, in the matter of telling the truth, does he live according to Christ or according to the law?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is very possible in matters such as this to live not according to Christ, but according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>FOUR KINDS OF LAWS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From my experience I have learned that it is easy for Christians to live according to various kinds of laws instead of according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may live by ethical teachings we have assimilated from our culture, or according to biblical principles learned from studying the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moreover, we may live according to the laws we ourselves have made.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How easy it is for us to make laws for ourselves!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although we make laws easily, it is difficult for us to change them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In addition to living by ethical teachings, principles, and our self-made laws, we may also live according to what may be called the law of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we live by this law, we may try without Christ to deal with the flesh or deny the self.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead of living according to Christ, we may live according to these four different kinds of law the laws of social ethics, biblical ethical principles, self-made laws, and the inner life law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Recently, I have been enlightened of the Lord and also rebuked by Him concerning how little I actually live Christ day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have had to confess to the Lord that only a small part of my time each day has been spent in living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Most of the time I unconsciously and automatically live according to ethics, some kind of law, or certain habits I have built up.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead of having Christ as the unique constituent of my daily walk, I have ethics, principles, self-made laws, and even the law of the inner life as my constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a result, much of the time I live by natural ethics, biblical ethics, self-made laws, or the inner life law instead of according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Living by these four kinds of laws does not require that we pray, trust in the Lord, or depend on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our attitude may be that the Lord may sit on the throne in heaven, but we do not need Him to help us live on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may think that we ourselves are quite capable of living in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We can be ethical and even spiritual without Christ and without the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may even succeed to bear the cross and crucify ourselves, also without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Nevertheless, in doing all these things, we are not living according to Christ, but according to certain of the laws I have mentioned.</S>
