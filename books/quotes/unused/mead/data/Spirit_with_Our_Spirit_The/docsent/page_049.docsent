   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Seeking Them Carefully by</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Enlightening Them until Finding Them</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we need to consider what the Spirit did when He sanctified us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The sanctifying of the Spirit before our repentance is recorded in the Bible in a very detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the Bible is like a big jigsaw puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It does not give you every part of the picture in a gathered way, but the pieces are scattered throughout it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to learn how to put the pieces together to see a complete picture.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Luke 15:8-9 says, "Or what woman having ten silver coins, if she loses one silver coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek carefully until she finds it?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And when she finds it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This portion of the Word gives us a picture of the Spirit's sanctifying work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to notice the words seek and finds.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The woman, signifying the Spirit, seeks the lost silver coin carefully until she finds it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Luke 15 the Lord gave us three parables: the parable of a good shepherd finding the lost sheep; the parable of a fine woman seeking for her lost treasure; and the parable of a loving father expecting his prodigal son to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we get into the significance of this chapter, we can realize that this surely refers to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Father is waiting lovingly to receive the sinners back to Himself, but how could they come back?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, the Son is the good Shepherd taking care of the lost sinners, and then the Spirit is working.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We saved sinners were God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The coin, before being lost, was the treasure of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The woman signifies the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit who is working on us and in us is not like a tiger or even a man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit works like a sister, a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The sisters are finer and sweeter than the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were born that way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thank the Lord that the Spirit is the Woman, the Lord is the Shepherd, and God is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Father with the Shepherd and the Woman work together in love to save fallen sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is detailed in the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Spirit as a woman came to the lost sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They were once in God's hand as His treasure, His coins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even before we were lost, we were treasures in the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then one day we became lost.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in eternity God predestinated us to bring us back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first blessing that God rendered to us in eternity past was His choosing us unto sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ephesians 1:4 says, "He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy...."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He has chosen us to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is unto sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our being made holy began when the Spirit as the woman came to seek us, to bring us back to God unto His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In time the Spirit as the woman came to seek us, not just to find us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She came to seek carefully for the lost coin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I like the word carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Who does this careful work?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The sanctifying Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit is almighty, all-capable, and omnipotent, but She I use the female pronoun here needs to seek carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is because we were very complicated before we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It was not easy for the Spirit to find us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>So the woman, the Spirit, came to seek for us carefully by lighting a lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The lamp here signifies the word of God Psa 119:105, 130 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One day when we heard the gospel, some of the words in the Bible began to shine in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In my youth I got to know John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But for many years that did not work on me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One day, however, the seeking Spirit caused this verse to shine within me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The word of God is a lamp used by the Spirit to illuminate and expose the sinner's position and condition that he may repent.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Spirit as a woman lit a lamp, and then she swept the house.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To sweep the house is to search and cleanse the sinner's inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Spirit who sought us lit the word and swept within us, in our inner being, until she found us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To find is to get.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, the Spirit is a woman coming to seek us by lighting the word and sweeping within us, in our inner being, until she gets us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The word began to shine within us while the Spirit was sweeping to clear away all the dirt from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>She did this until she got us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the sanctifying of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we were in the world, among a heap of sinners, the Spirit came to seek us, to visit us, to seek us out carefully by lighting God's word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At the same time, she was sweeping within us to clear away all the dirt within us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then we started to repent.</S>
