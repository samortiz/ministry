Church history during the past several centuries shows that the church was built up by special gifts of God. I love all those brothers. I love Luther. I love Wesley. I love Darby, etc. All of these spiritual giants were greatly used by God at the beginning, but gradually the only thing that was left was a denomination. This is really pitiful. I cannot reject the truth released through these persons, but I cannot accept the churches they have formed. Because they did not see the local church, they set up churches according to their ministries and controlled these churches. In the Scriptures, one never finds a minister of the gospel controlling a certain church or several churches. In other words, no minister is greater than the local church; rather, the local church is greater than the ministers (cf. 1 Cor. 3:21-23). If this principle is not upheld, sects will be produced immediately. Once an assembly comes under a certain minister or a certain commission, it becomes a sect. Baptism is a truth which we preach and practice. We should immerse people into the water so that they can become disciples of the Lord. But making a commission the basis for setting up a church and putting the church under the commission of a truth is forming a sect.</p><p>In a department store there are apparel, shoe, watch, handkerchief, and souvenir departments. All of the departments work together. If we do this, there will be no possibility of having a denomination. Praise God, He has commissioned me with a ministry. I confess that I am not worthy. However, since God has been gracious to me, I have become bold. Should I then preach myself? No, I should not. But should I be unfaithful? No, I cannot be unfaithful either. When I go to a certain place, I will establish an assembly there; I will save sinners and also have my ministry there. But after I finish my work, I will leave and be satisfied. I should not expect the entire city of Shanghai to be handkerchief stores and force others to use handkerchiefs for everything&mdash;eating with handkerchiefs and drinking with handkerchiefs. Furthermore, I should not demand that all other shops be closed.</p><p>What relationship should a worker hold with the assembly? In the assembly a worker is the same as other brothers who are holding other jobs. Whether the brothers who hold other jobs make money or lose money has nothing to do with the church. For example, George Muller set up an orphanage. This work had nothing to do with the church. Likewise, the condition of a worker has nothing to do with the church.</p><p>For the students at Cheloo University to have their own table is unscriptural. Only the church in Tsinan is qualified to represent Tsinan. Cheloo University cannot be a unit upon which a table is set. If one stands on the ground of the church in Tsinan, he can break bread. In God's ordination, every church is directly related to that locality alone. The purpose of this is to maintain the oneness. Is the church that every Christian attends a church in the locality, or is it a church that is smaller than the locality?</p><p>I am a brother in Shanghai, but my work is in Jen-Ru. Many people want to replace the church with the work, but the work can never replace the church. I should not expect God's children to belong to me. If this is not the case, may the Lord forgive me. I am a brother in Shanghai. If tomorrow I go to Nanking, I will immediately become a brother in Nanking and not a brother in Shanghai.</p><p>I hope you will not demand believers in Shanghai to leave this and that organization in a negative sense. You have to talk positively about the local church. Whoever has been redeemed by the precious blood of Christ and has been regenerated by the Spirit is in the church in Shanghai. There should be no discrimination of any kind. Our heart needs to be enlarged to include all the believers in Shanghai. May all the workers be clear about the nature of our testimony and the practice of the local church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 43: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (3) &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
