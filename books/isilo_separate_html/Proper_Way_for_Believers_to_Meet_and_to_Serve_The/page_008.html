<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word is made real by the Spirit. The Spirit is the word, and the word is the Spirit; both are one (John 6:63). We speak the Lord&rsquo;s word, but when we receive His word, we receive the Spirit. What we speak to others is the word, but what they receive is the Spirit. What comes forth is the word, but what enters is the Spirit. Thus, the Spirit and the word are one. On the one hand, we have the name of Jesus on which we can call. On the other hand, we also have His word, which is the Spirit, the breath, and which is in our mouth and in our heart (Rom. 10:8).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through the Lord&rsquo;s Inward Regulating</h2>
<p>The Lord is in us, and He also rules and regulates us. He tells us when to speak and when not to speak. We are very talkative; when we hear others gossiping about someone, we want to add a few words. But before we open our mouth to speak, the Lord Jesus will say, &ldquo;Do not speak; that is gossiping.&rdquo; Then our tongue will be bridled, and we will not be able to say a word. We will also sense the Lord&rsquo;s inward presence. Then we can say, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for being with me. Without Your inward regulating and correcting me, my idle words would have been uttered.&rdquo; This is an example of a practical experience of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>In order to experience the Lord as the Spirit dwelling in us, we must see that we are joined to the Lord as one spirit and that we need to always walk according to the spirit in every matter.</p>
<p>The Lord is now the Spirit, and every believer has a human spirit. When we believed in the Lord by calling on Him, confessing our sins, and repenting, He came into our spirit. From that day onward the Spirit and our human spirit have been mingled as one spirit. This matches what the Bible says: &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:17). This is a precious word. Salvation is not only a person; it is a person who has come into us. I can proclaim with assurance and conviction that I am not by myself; Someone is with me. Every believer can say that the Spirit is mingled with his human spirit. The Spirit follows us wherever we go, and He is with us in every situation. This is the way that we can experience the Lord as the Spirit of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Since we are one spirit with the Lord, we should &ldquo;not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit&rdquo; (Rom. 8:4). It is not easy to read the Bible. We often read the Bible as if it were for others, and we rarely apply what we read to our own living. We may have read Romans 8:4 many times without experiencing it. In the Greek text the word <em>but</em> is emphatic. We should not walk merely according to the spirit; we should walk <em>but</em> according to the spirit. This is a most precious word. Our problem is that we know that the Lord is in us, that He is one spirit with us, and that we should walk according to the spirit, but we rarely walk according to the spirit. We do not walk according to the spirit ninety-five percent of the time. Those who have more growth in life might walk according to the spirit fifteen percent of the time. In two more years they may advance and walk according to the spirit twenty-five percent of the time, and after thirty years they may be able to walk according to the spirit seventy-five percent of the time. I have been a Christian for over sixty years, and although the percentage of time that I walk according to the spirit is higher than when I was young, it is still not sufficient, because according to the Lord&rsquo;s Word, we should walk only according to the spirit. I occasionally joke with ones I am familiar with. However, every time I joke, the Lord rebukes me, saying, &ldquo;What did you say? Why did you joke? You should use your lips, tongue, and teeth to speak for Me, not to tell jokes.&rdquo; I am often rebuked in this way because it is difficult to drop these small habits.</p>
<p>Before I was saved, I enjoyed going to Chinese operas and playing soccer. Now, however, regardless of how much I am compelled, I will not watch Chinese opera or play soccer. These were &ldquo;big balls&rdquo; that were easy to abandon and overcome, but it is rather difficult to deal with &ldquo;little balls.&rdquo; Telling jokes is a little ball. We usually feel that it does not matter whether or not we play with this ball, because it is not a big ball. Afterward, however, we feel remorse and confess our mistake. We even make up our mind never to play with this little ball again. But after five minutes we begin to play with this ball again with another brother. This shows that we do not walk according to the spirit all the time. Walking according to the spirit can be compared to a chain with many links. It is not necessary for every link in the chain to be disconnected in order for the chain to be broken. A chain is broken when only one link is disconnected. Likewise, if we fail to walk according to the spirit even one percent of the time, our &ldquo;chain&rdquo; will be broken. If I tell a joke today but overcome in every other matter, in the evening I cannot say, &ldquo;Lord, thank You that I lived an overcoming life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sisters have a particularly difficult time overcoming the matter of shopping. Businessmen devote much time studying the devilish tactics of how to stir up people&rsquo;s emotions and attract their eyes. Hence, we should beware of department-store display windows. Once we glance at them, it is easy to be &ldquo;hooked.&rdquo; Many sisters who love the Lord have experienced being happy when buying something but then regretting afterward. There is a sister who bought a piece of expensive fabric and was happy. However, for a week after that she could not sleep well. Whenever she looked at the fabric, the Lord would tell her to give it to a needy sister. Although she struggled, she was eventually compelled by the Lord to give it away. Then she was released. Many of us have had similar experiences.</p>
<p>I have been giving messages for nearly sixty years, but I still make mistakes. Whenever I speak longer than necessary, a voice within tells me to stop speaking. Nearly every time after giving a message, I have to confess, &ldquo;Lord, I have spoken unnecessary words again. Please forgive me.&rdquo; Before giving a message, I always offer a prayer with a strong spirit, saying, &ldquo;Lord, preserve me to be only Your mouthpiece, and keep me from speaking unnecessary words.&rdquo; However, toward the end of a message I can become excited and speak in a joking way. This is to speak not according to the spirit. A person who speaks according to the spirit will not utter superfluous words. I have learned many lessons in this matter.</p>
<p>Being talkative is a common fault between husbands and wives. Because they are too familiar with one another, they tend to talk about everything and do not keep matters pertaining to others confidential. A wife will usually become unhappy because her husband talks too much. Those who are married are learning this lesson. I have been learning this lesson for sixty years. A husband knows that it is not easy to make his wife greet him with a smiling face. He must be very careful and refrain from sarcastic words and insinuating remarks; otherwise, his wife will get angry. Likewise, a wife should be careful. A husband can get angry because his wife says unnecessary things. We all have spoken too much and have thus provoked our spouse to anger. If we could be silent, we would be successful and overcoming. I dare not say that I have learned this matter, but I have learned a secret: Whenever the conversation becomes tense, I stop talking and call softly with a smile, &ldquo;O Lord! O Lord!&rdquo; In this way both parties are appeased. A believer who can walk according to the spirit in his married life is an overcomer. We all have this same problem and can sympathize with one another. It is difficult to walk according to the spirit.</p>
<p>It is good that the Spirit has entered into us, but this is also a problem because He troubles us. Marriage is wonderful because you gain a spouse, but marriage is also difficult because a spouse is also a problem. Some couples quarrel on their wedding day concerning whether the windows should be opened or closed at night. The husband cannot sleep with the windows closed, but the wife cannot sleep with the windows opened. Who should give in? As believers, we have an advantage because the Spirit is in us as our supply and consolation. However, we also have a problem because He never gives in and always interferes with the things in our daily life, both great and small. He requires us to walk only by the spirit, not according to anything else. The word <em>but</em> is a severe restriction to us.</p>
<p>Many saints walk according to the spirit in many things except in the matter of their hairstyle. Brothers, do you comb your hair according to the spirit? Sisters, can you tell the Lord that your hairstyle and hair adornment are according to the spirit? I doubt that many sisters can say that her hairstyle is according to the spirit. Some arrange their hair like a high tower. Many women wear their hair so that it is difficult to tell whether they are a male or a female. The Bible says that a woman should not cut her too short (1 Cor. 11:15). God does not like indistinctness between males and females. He wants women to adorn themselves as females and men to express themselves as males so as to avoid confusion. The sisters should be careful when they go to a beauty parlor; it is difficult for people to be according to the spirit in such a place. I will never go to a luxurious and fashionable place to get a haircut. I go only to simple and ordinary places.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
