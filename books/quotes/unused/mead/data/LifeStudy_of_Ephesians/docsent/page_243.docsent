   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEEKNESS AND GENTLENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2 Corinthians 10:1 Paul says, Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul did not say that he imitated the meekness and gentleness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To imitate Christ is one thing, but to live in Christ s meekness and gentleness is another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul enjoyed these aspects of Christ s unsearchable riches and they also should be our enjoyment today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we contact others, we should not try to imitate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, we should contact them in the meekness and gentleness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to enjoy the meekness and gentleness of Christ, we need to be in the Spirit, for all the riches of Christ are in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we turn to our spirit, contact Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit, and take Him as our person, His meekness and gentleness become our food, nourishment, strength, and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no need for us to desperately attempt to restrain ourselves or to manufacture meekness or gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The meekness and gentleness of Christ are our spontaneous enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can actually feed on these aspects of Christ s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we take Him as our person, we spontaneously enjoy His meekness and gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead of self-effort, we simply enjoy whatever Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was the living of the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE TRUTH OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 2 Corinthians 11:10 Paul says, The truth of Christ is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Within Paul there was something true and real of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because he enjoyed the truth of Christ, His reality, he knew that what he was relating to the Corinthians was of the truth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a further indication that Paul lived not by the self, but by taking Christ as his person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul did not boast that he had any truth of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the contrary, he boasted of the truth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should learn from this never to boast of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to forget what we are and not speak of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, we need to live according to Christ and behave by the truth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we contact others in the meekness and gentleness of Christ, we need to speak as the truth of Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE GRACE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 2 Corinthians a number of verses speak of the grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, 2 Corinthians 8:9 says, For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By grace, Christ lowered Himself and left His position for our sake.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He gave up His riches so that we may become rich.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can do such a thing only through the grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we take His grace as our enjoyment, spontaneously we shall do the same thing Christ did.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, we shall not be the ones who do this, but it will be Christ living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In chapter twelve Paul asked the Lord three times that the thorn in the flesh might depart from him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, the Lord said, My grace is sufficient for thee: for My strength is made perfect in weakness v. 9 . Therefore, Paul could say, Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses so that the power of Christ might overshadow me v. 9, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>. The Lord told Paul not to care about the thorn or about his sufferings, but to enjoy His sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul realized in his experience that Christ s strength was made perfect in his weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today many complain of their weakness or lack of ability.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, they need to see that in their weakness Christ s strength is made perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Their weakness gives them an opportunity to enjoy the strength of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 2 Corinthians 12:10 Paul went on to say, Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>. Paul was strong because Christ s strength was made perfect in his weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>PAUL S BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have pointed out that the book of 2 Corinthians ends with a blessing: The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all 13:14, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>. Today many pastors pronounce these words as a formal benediction.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul here was not giving such a benediction.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, he was telling the saints that they could partake of the riches of Christ and enjoy them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The grace of Christ issues out of the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that the love of God is the source of the grace of Christ, and that the grace of Christ is the expression of the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, this grace is in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Through the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, the grace of Christ with the love of God becomes our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This enjoyment is just what we need today.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we all experience and enjoy the riches of Christ, we shall have much to speak concerning Christ whenever we come together.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As we fellowship with others in the Lord, we shall speak of what Christ is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We shall not speak about doctrine or gifts, but about the genuine experience of Christ and the real enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The more the riches of Christ are dispensed into us, the more we shall be sanctified and metabolically transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As a new element discharges the old element, we shall be nourished, cherished, and, eventually, glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The goal of the Lord in His recovery is to bring His people into this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After the time of Paul, the enjoyment of the unsearchable riches of Christ was lost to a large extent.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Praise the Lord that this experience is being recovered!</S>
