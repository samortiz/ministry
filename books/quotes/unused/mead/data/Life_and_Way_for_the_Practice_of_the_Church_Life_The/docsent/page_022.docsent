   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX WHAT IS THE SPIRIT?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SPIRIT OF THE GLORIFIED JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 7:37-39 says, "Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Lord was speaking this word to His disciples, the Spirit of God was already there.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet the Spirit at that time was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To find out the meaning, we have to know when He was glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many of us think that the Lord was glorified when He was taken into the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But this is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Luke 24:26 shows that by His resurrection the Lord was glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That verse says, "Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This word was spoken before the Lord was taken up to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After His resurrection, He met the two disciples and told them that He had entered into glory already.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, it was by resurrection that the Lord was glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What does it mean for the Lord to be glorified?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord is the God of glory Acts 7:2; 1 Cor 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One day He was incarnated to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The very God of glory came into a man and put man upon Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He concealed all the glory of God within this man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, the glory of God was covered, veiled, by this man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When He was on this earth, people just saw Him as an ordinary man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Outwardly, He was merely a humble man, yet inwardly, He was the God of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, He passed through death and was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By His resurrection He was glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can use a grain of wheat or a seed of any kind of beautiful flower as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Within the seed, the glory of the flower is concealed, veiled.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once the seed falls into the earth and grows up and blossoms, that is its glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through His resurrection the very glory of God which had been concealed, veiled, covered, in His flesh was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Lord was on the earth, the Spirit was not yet, because the Lord had not yet been glorified John 7:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was after the Lord's glorification, that is, after His resurrection, that the Spirit entered into His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the Lord resurrected, He came in the evening to the disciples and breathed into them, saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit" 20:19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This shows clearly that the Holy Spirit came into the disciples after the Lord had been glorified in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE SPIRIT OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now let us read Acts 16:7: "And when they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, yet the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Spirit of Jesus is a special term.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not the Spirit of God and not even the Spirit of Christ, but the Spirit of Jesus as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now let us read the previous verse.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 6 says, "And they passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit of Jesus in verse 7 is the Holy Spirit in verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After the Lord's resurrection, the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
