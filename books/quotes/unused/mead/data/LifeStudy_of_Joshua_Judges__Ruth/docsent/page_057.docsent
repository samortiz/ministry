   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF RUTH MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: Ruth 1:1-5; 2:1-2; 3:1; 4:9-10, 13, 21-22; Matt 1:5-6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will give a brief introductory word to the Life-study of Ruth</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I. RUTH BEING AN APPENDIX</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>TO THE BOOK OF JUDGES, CONTEMPORARY WITH</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE FIRST HALF OF JUDGES</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ruth is an appendix to the book of Judges, contemporary with the first half of Judges.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Judges is a book of Israel s miserable history, dark and stinking; Ruth is the record of a couple s excellent story, bright and aromatic.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The main role in this story is like a lily growing out of brambles and a bright star in the dark night.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE BOOK OF RUTH BEING AN IMPORTANT PART</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>OF THE GENEALOGY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The book of Ruth is also an important part of the genealogy of Christ Matt 1:5 , which is the record that concerns the incarnation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the whole universe, there is nothing greater than the incarnation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After the eternal God created man, He was nearly silent for four thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During that time no one knew what God was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The angels did not know, and the men in the Old Testament, such as Abraham, Moses, and David, did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then the eternal God came out of eternity and entered into time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He came out of eternity with His divinity in order to enter into humanity to make Himself, the Divine, one with man, the human, to become a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the greatest thing in the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The short book of Ruth, containing only four chapters, is related in a particular way to the incarnation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE WRITER</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the contents of Ruth, its writer should be Samuel, as is the case also with the book of Judges.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE TIME</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the word Jesse begot David 4:22 , the time of writing must have been after the rule of the judges and in the time of the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The time of the history covered in this book comprises eleven years, from about 1322 B.C. 1:4 to about 1312 B.C. 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>V. THE PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The history recorded in the book of Ruth took place in Moab and Judah 1:1, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE CONTENT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The content of this book concerns a Moabitess, Ruth Ruth belonged to the tribe of Moab v. 4 . Moab was the son of Lot, the fruit of Lot s incestuous union with his daughter Gen 19:30-38 . According to Deuteronomy 23:3 the Moabites were forbidden to enter the congregation of the Lord, even to the tenth generation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, as a Moabitess, Ruth was an excluded one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, she was brought into the holy elect of God and became an important ancestor of Christ through her marriage with Boaz, the great-grandfather of King David Ruth 4:21-22; Matt 1:5-6 , which became a factor that ushered in the incarnation of Christ Matt 1:5-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From this we see that Ruth became an important ancestor to bring Christ into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This ushered in the marvelous incarnation, which made God one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the intrinsic significance of the content of the book of Ruth</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE CENTRAL THOUGHT</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The central thought of the book of Ruth is that a Gentile, even a Moabitess, could be joined to God s holy elect and become an heir to partake of the holy inheritance through her union with the one of the holy elect who redeemed her.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is not merely a type but a complete prefigure of the Gentile sinners being brought, with Israel, God s elect, into the divine inheritance through the redemption of Christ in their union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE SECTIONS</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>from the Rest in God s Economy</S>

   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The second section 1:3-7, 19-22 concerns Naomi s returning to the rest in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whereas Elimelech swerved from this rest, Naomi returned to it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>C. Ruth s Choosing for Her Goal</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some expositors speak of Ruth s resolution or determination.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What we see in Ruth, however, is not just her resolution or her determination but her choosing for her goal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is described in the third section of the book 1:8-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>D. Ruth s Exercising of Her Right</S>

   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>3 covers Ruth s seeking for her rest.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once she exercised the right that came to her through her choosing for her goal, Ruth, in wisdom, sought for her rest.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>F. Ruth s Reward for God s Economy</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because Ruth was absolute for God s economy, she received a reward from God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Ruth s reward for God s economy is covered in chapter four, the last section of this book.</S>
