   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A VOW CONCERNING OUR PRAYER LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In light of the fact that there is great resistance to praying, let us now consider in a very practical way how to persevere in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before you try to persevere in prayer, you should first make a deal with the Lord concerning your prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Pray to Him in a definite way and say, Lord, I mean business with You about this matter of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I call heaven and earth to witness that from this time forth I will have a life of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I will not be a prayerless person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, I will be a praying person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you do not have such a prayer to the Lord, you will not be able to persevere in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to say to Him, Lord, I am desperate about this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I offer myself to You so that I may have a prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, keep me in the spirit of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I forget this or neglect this, I know that You will not forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Remind me again and again about prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of prayer may be regarded as a vow made to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all need to make a vow to Him concerning our prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should tell the Lord, Lord, I know that if I forget this vow, You will not forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From the very beginning, Lord, I want to clearly hand the responsibility over to You.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lord, don t let me go.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Remind me to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>SETTING ASIDE DEFINITE TIMES</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After we make such a deal with the Lord concerning prayer, we should set aside definite times for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For instance, you may reserve ten minutes every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>During this time, prayer must be the top priority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our attitude should be that prayer is our most important business and that nothing should be allowed to interfere with it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not have this attitude, we shall not be able to have a successful prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No matter how many things we have to do each day, we can reserve at least a few minutes here and there for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may pray a little in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then again at noon, after work, and in the evening we may have other times for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By setting aside definite times during the day, we may be able to have a half hour reserved for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you are observing a set time for prayer at home, take the telephone off the hook.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This will help eliminate distractions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Prayer time is not the time for telephone calls.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, you should not pay attention to those knocking at your door.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The time you have dedicated to the Lord for prayer should be used only for prayer, not for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regarding this, you need to be strong and persevering.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to have more time for prayer, we should try to save time during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, perhaps we can reduce the time spent in personal grooming or in conversation with others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Unnecessary talk weakens our praying spirit, damages the praying atmosphere, and occupies time that can be used for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The battle over prayer is continual.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Probably it will last until eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What I have been sharing about prayer is not mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It comes from years of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As far as prayer is concerned, I must admit that I have had much failure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I do not boast of great success in my prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, I have suffered many failures because of the opposition of the enemy, the distractions around me, and even the hindrances within me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have surely learned that prayer is a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because it is a battle, a fight, we must persevere in it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE BENEFITS OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Persevering in prayer has many benefits.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By prayer we set our mind on the things above.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In fact, prayer is the only way to have our mind set on the things in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we set our mind on things above by praying, we shall not pray for trivial matters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Instead, our prayer will be occupied with Christ s heavenly intercession, ministry, and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because Christ is interceding for the churches around the world, we also pray for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Let the Lord take care of all the small matters in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our responsibility is to seek first the kingdom of God and God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since the Father knows our need, He will take care of us and meet our need.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we set our mind on the things above during our times of prayer, we become a reflection of Christ s ministry in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Through our prayer, Christ, the Head, is given a way to carry out His administration through His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we pray, we are a heavenly ambassador on earth with the extension of God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, when we are gossiping, we are not a heavenly ambassador at all.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only when we pray do we become an ambassador of the heavenly kingdom on earth in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we pray, we enter into the Holy of Holies and approach the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hebrews 4:16 says, Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Prayer is the way to come forward to the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Coming forward to the throne of grace, we receive mercy and grace to meet our timely need.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we pray, approaching the throne of grace, mercy and grace will become a river flowing in us and supplying us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How rewarding this is!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Receiving the flow of grace in prayer is actually more important than having our prayers answered.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whether or not our prayer is answered is secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The primary thing is that grace flows like a river from the throne and into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To receive this river of grace is to have our spiritual battery charged with heavenly current.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The heavenly current, the divine electricity, is the Triune God as grace flowing out of the throne and into us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The supply and enjoyment this brings is unspeakable.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Christians today are weak because their spiritual batteries are not charged.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Because they are short of prayer, they are short of the heavenly transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Again and again during the day, we need to be charged with the divine electrical current.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This surely is a reward for persevering in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Another benefit of praying is related to fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We all love the Lord s presence and anointing, and we all love to have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But how can we enjoy the Lord s presence and have fellowship with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The only way is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When we pray, we enter into fellowship with the Lord and become conscious of the fact that we are truly one spirit with Him and that He is actually one spirit with us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The more we pray, the more we experience being one with the Lord, and the more we enjoy His presence and have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>What a marvelous reward!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is always difficult at first to have a proper prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But if you practice this for a long period of time, it will get easier and easier, for you will realize the rewards of praying.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We have seen that for a normal Christian walk we need to set our mind on things above, have the renewing of the new man, have the peace of Christ arbitrating in us, and allow the word of Christ to inhabit us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>These four matters, however, all require prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>To practice them and to experience them we need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Prayer ushers us into the reality of these four things and keeps us in this reality.</S>
