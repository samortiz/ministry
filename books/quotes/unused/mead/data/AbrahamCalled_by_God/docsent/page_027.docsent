   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>6 THE TRIAL OF THE CALLED And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis 12:9-10 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Genesis 13:2, 5-7</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this message we come to Abraham's experience of trials.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen how Abraham was called by God and how, by God's appearing, he was strengthened to answer that call.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have also seen that, by God's appearing, Abraham was brought to the very place where God intended him to be.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Firstly he was brought to Shechem 12:6 and then to the place between Bethel and Ai, the place between the house of God and the heap of ruins 12:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That place between the house of God and the heap of ruins was the high point, and Abraham should have remained there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, suddenly, after such a high attainment in his experience of God, Abraham continued his journey, going toward the south 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In studying this chapter, I have spent much time to find out the reason why Abraham continued his journey.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why did he journey on and not remain there between the house of God and the heap of ruins?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Abraham had attained the high point, the place where God intended for him to be.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By God's mercy, he should have remained there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But Abraham journeyed southward.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that he went downward.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After such a high attainment in the experience of God, any journey would be downward.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This continuing of his journey was the cause of Abraham's failure.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have seen that, at the beginning, Abraham dragged his feet through mud and water.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, he was victorious, going all the way to Shechem and afterward to the place near Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In both of those places he built an altar and at the place between Bethel and Ai he also called upon the name of the Lord and pitched his tent as a declaration to the whole world that he was an anti-testimony to the situation at Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you not think that in doing so Abraham had arrived, attained the high point of his experience of God?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps you are thinking that if you had been Abraham, you surely would have remained there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But we should not think this way, for we are today's Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The ancient Abraham was just like us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we have pointed out elsewhere, Abraham's experience was a seed of our own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The record of Abraham in Genesis is his biography, but it is our autobiography.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may say, "No, it is Abraham's autobiography and my biography."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But this record is your autobiography not your biography, because the biography of Abraham was written by Moses and your biography is written by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Abraham's experience corresponds with ours.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We and he are one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Have you not had a wonderful time with the Lord in which you reached the high point and shouted, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How good it is here!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No place is better than this place.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the best place for me to be."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Have you not said this?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But what happened the very next day?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You began to journey downward.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The night before you said, "Hallelujah, this is the place for me," and the next morning you began to journey downward to the border of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that you journeyed to a place that was so close to the world, close to the movie theaters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One night you were on the high point in Canaan and the next morning you were moving downward to the border of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Has this not happened to you?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am so happy and surprised to hear the junior high young people offer such wonderful prayers in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But I need to say an honest word to them; I do not trust you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After praying such a wonderful prayer one night in the meeting, the next morning you may journey downward to the border of worldly entertainments.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today you may say, "Hallelujah, this is the best place for me," and next weekend you may move downward to the movie theater.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Remember that we are today's Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is easy to reach the high point, but it is not easy to remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is not much room on the high point.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you move just slightly, you will fall downhill.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is very difficult to keep the God-appointed position.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The high point is surrounded by pits, and it is easy to fall into one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The called ones will not usually go backward, but it is easy for them to go downward into Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Abraham never went back to Chaldea, but he did go down into Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In 12:9 13:18 we see Abraham's trial.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The word trial is not a pleasant word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No one likes to experience trials.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do you like to have trials in your life?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although no one likes trials, they are good experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Not too long after Abraham was called and began to live by faith, a trial came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not pray, "Lord, You are so good to me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Don't let any trials come to me."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This kind of prayer will only hasten the coming of the trials.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord will answer your prayer in just the opposite way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you say, "Lord, don't send any trials," the Lord will say, "I will send a trial very quickly."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I am assured that no one can say that since he was called by the Lord he has always enjoyed good times.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>No one can say that.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our God is not only the God of love but also the God of sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Our God is sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Our God is not only the God of love, the God of light, and the God of life, but also the God of sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everything is under His dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He manages the whole world just for us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must all believe that God manages the entire universe for every one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You may say, "How small I am!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>How could the sovereign God manage the universe just for me?"</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But He does manage it just for you.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You must believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You are not so small that God does not sovereignly arrange your environment for you.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You are big enough to have God's sovereign arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I have learned this from my own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Fifty years ago I did not like this story of Abraham going down to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I simply could not be happy with that experience.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When, at that time, I read some messages on Abraham's downward experience, I did not understand it and did not feel good about it.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I even questioned God.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But now, after many years of experience, I am very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>How we need to hear this message on Abraham's trial!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is easy to reach the high point in our experience with God, but it is not easy to remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Look at the environment that surrounds you on every side.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It was sovereignly arranged before you were born.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God is sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Although you may consider yourself a small creature, as far as God is concerned, you are a very important person.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Before the foundation of the world, God arranged everything for you.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He even arranged that you would be reading this message right now.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We are under God's arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Do not try to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If you escape to a certain place, you will find that place to be the exact place that God arranged for you.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>When you reach old age, you will bow down and say, "Lord, I am fully convinced that You arranged everything for me before the foundation of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Abraham's trial was for him to learn a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We all need to learn some lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We cannot learn these lessons from our parents or from the experienced brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We all must learn some lessons of God's sovereignty.</S>
