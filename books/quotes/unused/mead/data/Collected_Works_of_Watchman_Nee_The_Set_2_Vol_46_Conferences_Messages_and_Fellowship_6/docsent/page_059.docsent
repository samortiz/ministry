   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because of man's fall, worship was ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without salvation man cannot worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 4:23 says that "the Father...seeks such to worship Him."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Who are these "such"?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are the ones who are "born anew" 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Father wants such to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John 4:24 tell us of an eternal principle: God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since man's spirit was poisoned, he could no longer come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He could have feelings and thoughts about God, but he could not worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the fall man became twisted in his feeling, reasoning, and thought.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word "truthfulness" can also be translated as truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only that which is of the spirit is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Using thoughts or feelings to praise God is not worshipping in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the Old Testament, the proper worship was at Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The sacrifice of Isaac was on Mount Moriah.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Old Testament records many times that worship should be in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even in the kingdom, the nations will worship in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The temple, altar, and sanctuary were all in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet these were but shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>People forgot what they spoke of.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In actuality it is all a matter of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reality of Jerusalem in God's plan is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not enough to worship God in Jerusalem; we must worship Him in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must also realize the position of Jerusalem in God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jerusalem represents God's purpose; it is God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God will inherit Jerusalem as His dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ephesians tells us that the saints are God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, what in us can we give to God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is one thing which God will inherit in us; it is our free will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Satan is doing his best to hinder our free will from being occupied by God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is doing his best to frustrate God's purpose and to destroy any worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When our free will is taken up by God, we render God the proper worship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Jerusalem there is the temple on Mount Moriah.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Where there is the reality of worship, there is the need of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"And I, if I be lifted up" John 12:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"So must the Son of Man be lifted up" 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Worship and the cross are related.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we do not know the cross, we cannot worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God must touch the natural life before He can secure in us the proper worship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the cross touches man, his constitution is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the one hand, we are dead with Christ, but on the other hand, the death of Christ is killing us daily.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order for God to gain our worship, we must go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The special characteristic of the cross is its stripping us of our trust in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The cross makes us dependent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we do not take a position of dependence, we cannot worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Old Testament temple is also a type of the New Testament church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Old Testament, no one could worship outside the temple. the temple was the container of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today worship is realized in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Apart from the Body, it is difficult to have the proper worship.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Worship in the New Testament is a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once I went to Fukien to preach the gospel, but I knew that the Lord was not in my endeavor.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet the result was marvelous: two hundred souls were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Later, I read John 15:5, which says, "Apart from Me you can do nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It was quite hard for me to believe this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to my thought, there were many things that could be done without Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet we will not be judged by how much we can do, but by how much we are doing things by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The principle of the fall in Eden is to boast that we can do what God can do.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Such an attitude must go if we are to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the temple there is the incense altar, which signifies that everything that we are and have belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All that we have is God's. If we can say, "Lord, I want nothing for myself," God will get the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When all that we have is offered to God, He will gain the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The ultimate point of the Lord's prayer is that God gains everything.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The kingdom is His, not ours or Satan's. The power is His, and the glory is His.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we stand in this position, God will receive worship.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In summary, worship is typified by: 1 Jerusalem, which is God's central purpose, 2 Mount Moriah, which includes the dealing of the cross on our soul, and the 3 incense table, which signifies that everything that we are and have belongs to God.</S>
