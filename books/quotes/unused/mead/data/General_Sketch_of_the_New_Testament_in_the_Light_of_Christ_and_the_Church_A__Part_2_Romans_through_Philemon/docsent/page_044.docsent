   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Triune God in Ephesians</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In no other book is the Triune God revealed as much as in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Of course, we do not have here the word Trinity, but we have the reality, the fact, of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Of the seven "ones" in chapter four, three relate to the Three of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verses 4-6 say, "One Spirit one Lord one God and Father."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are other passages in this book that contain the thought of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 3 of chapter one says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse speaks of the Father and Christ the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In addition, every spiritual blessing is related to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, this verse speaks of the Three of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In chapter three Paul says, "For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>14-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These verses once again mention the Three of the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit yet They are one God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Three work together to cause us to realize the fullness of this one God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Father is the source, the fountain, from whom all the families in the heavens and on earth are named; the Spirit is the working means; and the Son is the very object for whom the Father planned and the Spirit works.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These Three cooperate with one another for us to realize the fullness of God, that is, to make the fullness of God one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way, these verses show us the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Triune God Being for Our Experience</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no need for us to know the Divine Trinity for the purpose of mere doctrine and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, the Divine Trinity is for our experience, that we may realize the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verses 14 through 19 tell us that the Father grants us to be strengthened through His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The issue of this is that Christ, the very central One, may make His home in our heart by the working of the Spirit according to what the Father planned.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then the fullness of God becomes our experience; that is, we are filled unto all the fullness of the Triune God, the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the Divine Trinity is a matter of experience, not a matter of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In doctrine we can never understand the Divine Trinity in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moreover, no one can explain the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How can we say that the Three are one God?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever the Scripture mentions the Divine Trinity, it is for our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Matthew 28:19 tells us to baptize people into the name, not into the names, of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To baptize the repenting and believing ones is to cause them to experience the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Similarly, 2 Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a matter not of doctrine but of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same way, throughout the book of Ephesians there are many verses referring to the Divine Trinity, but they are for our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we have seen, 1:3 speaks of the Father who has blessed us in the Son with every spiritual blessing; this also is not for doctrine but for our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to doctrine alone, we can never understand the Divine Trinity, but by our experience we can realize that the Three are one God in actuality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Several verses in the New Testament tell us clearly that the Holy Spirit today is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No one can argue with this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>John 14:17, for example, says that the Spirit of reality would be in the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are also several verses that tell us that Christ is in us, such as Romans 8:10.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Galatians Paul said, "It pleased God to reveal His Son in me" 1:15-16 , "It is Christ who lives in me" 2:20 , and "Christ is formed in you" 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These verses do not speak of the Spirit of Christ or Christ in the Spirit; they clearly indicate that Christ Himself is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If Christ and the Spirit are not one, then there must be two who are in us, but to say this is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How can we say that we have two in us?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That there is one who is in us indicates that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This illustrates that the Divine Trinity cannot be understood doctrinally.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He must be realized by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In our experience the Three of the Godhead are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is not merely my word; it is the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Not only are Christ and the Spirit in us, but the Father also is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Ephesians 4:6 says, "One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the one hand, the Father, Son, and Spirit are three.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then are there three in us, or is there one in us?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That there is one in us indicates that the Father is the Son and the Son is the Spirit; otherwise, there must be three in us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Again this illustrates that we can realize the Divine Trinity only by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can never define the Divine Trinity in the way of knowledge because our knowledge is too limited.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In reality, in our experience, the Three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the Scriptures it is clear and unarguable that the Spirit is in us, Christ is in us, and the Father is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All Three today are in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We do not believe that the Three are separate and not one.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, in Ephesians 3 the Three of the Godhead work together to fill us unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means that the fullness of the Godhead is mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are filled with the Triune God, and the Triune God mingles Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is divinity mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We sometimes speak of the seven wonders of the world, but these are not the real wonders.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the entire universe the unique wonder is the Triune God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What a wonder that the Triune God is working Himself into us!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to read Ephesians again, forgetting about traditional theology.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Traditional theology damages us and hinders us from understanding the things in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must put all the above points together like a jigsaw puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then we will see the whole picture that the Father is in the Son, the Son is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is within us.</S>
