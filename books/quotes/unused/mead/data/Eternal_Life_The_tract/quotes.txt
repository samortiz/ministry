[1]  The Bible, God s inspired record, tells us clearly that the life of God is embodied in Christ the Son and made available through the Spirit to all who believe in Him.
[2]  The life of this life-giving Spirit is Christ as life, the eternal life of God; and when this life is given to man, it is given as the Spirit.
[3]  The Triune God is the God of life, and through Him as the source of life, the embodiment of life, and the reality of life, we mortal human beings can participate in and enjoy the immortality of God.
