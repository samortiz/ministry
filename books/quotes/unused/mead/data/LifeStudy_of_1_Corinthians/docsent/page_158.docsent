   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Man Not out of Woman,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>but Woman out of Man</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 8 Paul gives us a second reason for head covering: For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a rib taken out of man, woman was made out of man Gen 2:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God did not create a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He formed a male body from the dust of the ground and breathed into this body the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a result, a man, named Adam, became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and then He opened his side, took out a rib, and used that rib to build a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, woman was not created, but came out of man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that the woman s place is by the side of the man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, a man should not be proud regarding his position in relation to the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Notice what Paul says in verses 11 and 12: However, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For just as the woman is out of the man, so also is the man through the woman; but all things are out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Lord s plan and arrangement, neither is the woman apart from the man nor the man apart from the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man is the source of the woman s existence.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, the woman is out of the man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But woman is the means through which the man is born.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the man is through the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Regarding the relationship between man and woman, Paul is balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, he says that the woman is out of the man, for she was made from a rib out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the other hand, Paul says that the man is through the woman, for man comes into existence through his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We also should be balanced, realizing both that the woman is out of the man and that the man is through the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>C. Man Not Created for the Sake of the Woman,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>but the Woman for the Sake of the Man</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 9 says, For also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here the apostle takes God s purpose in the creation of man and woman as another strong ground for his teaching of head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is based not upon any human-made customs, but upon the divine purpose of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In creation woman was made for the purpose of matching man Gen 2:18, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>D. Woman Having Authority on Her Head</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>for the Sake of the Angels</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 10 Paul continues, Therefore the woman ought to have authority on her head for the sake of the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Authority here denotes the head covering, which signifies the authority of man s headship over the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this verse we have another ground for the teaching of head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Head covering is closely related to God s headship, God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The archangel with his subordinates rebelled against God s headship Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>28:13-18; Isa 14:12-15; Matt 25:41 , establishing his kingdom of darkness Matt 12:26; Col 1:13 , and became Satan, God s adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After God created man, Satan seduced man to follow him and rebel against God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then God sent His Son to destroy Satan and rescue man out of his authority back to God s kingdom 1 John 3:8; Heb 2:14; Col 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now when the believers worship God in praying to God and speaking for God, they should have signs that they are under God s headship, the divine authority, showing the observing angels see 1 Cor 4:9 , who are concerned with this matter, that they the believers keep God s ordained order in His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this sake, the sisters should have a sign, a covering, on their head.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is significant that Paul says that the woman ought to have authority on her head for the sake of the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Satan, a chief angel, had been commissioned to control the universe for God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But he rebelled, and certain angels followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Of course, a good number of angels remained faithful to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God created man to deal with the rebellious angels.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But Satan seduced man, and man followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then in redemption God came in to bring fallen man back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God s redeemed people are now the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As the church, we should declare to the angels, both to the rebellious and to the submissive ones, that as God s redeemed people we are not rebellious against His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, we remain under the headship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Not only in the coming kingdom age in eternity shall we be under God s headship, but even in this rebellious age we submit to His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The covering on the sisters head is a sign declaring this to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In verse 13 Paul asks, You judge among yourselves: Is it fitting for a woman to pray uncovered to God?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Here Paul is indicating that, judging according to the reasons he has given, it is not fitting for a woman to pray uncovered to God.</S>
