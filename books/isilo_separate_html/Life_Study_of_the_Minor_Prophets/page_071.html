<h1 class="title">ON MALACHI</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INTRODUCTORY WORD<br />
AND<br />
JEHOVAH&rsquo;S LOVE OF JACOB<br />
AND HIS DEALING WITH THE SONS OF LEVI</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mal. 1:1&mdash;3:4</h1>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider the prophecy of Malachi. The book of Malachi is the concluding word of the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2>
<p>Malachi 1:1 is the introductory word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of the Name Malachi</h2>
<p>The name Malachi in Hebrew means &ldquo;My messenger,&rdquo; signifying that Malachi was a messenger of God to minister the word of Jehovah to His people Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Time of Malachi&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>The time of Malachi&rsquo;s ministry was about 400 B.C., at Nehemiah&rsquo;s time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Place of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The place of his ministry was Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Object of His Ministry</h2>
<p>The object of his ministry was the returned Israelites.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Subject</h2>
<p>The subject of his ministry is Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with the sons of Levi (the priests among Israel) and with the sons of Jacob (the people of Israel).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Central Thought</h2>
<p>The central thought of the prophecy of Malachi is the correcting of the priests among Israel for the coming of Christ as the Messenger of God and the advising of the people of Israel for the appearing of Christ as the Sun of righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Revelation concerning Christ</h2>
<p>In Malachi Christ is revealed in His first coming as the Messenger of God (3:1-3) and in His second coming as the Angel of the covenant (3:1) and as the Sun of righteousness (4:1-3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Sections</h2>
<p>The book of Malachi has four sections: the introductory word (1:1); Jehovah&rsquo;s love for Jacob (1:2-5); Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with the sons of Levi (1:6&mdash;3:4); and Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with the sons of Jacob (3:5&mdash;4:6).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. JEHOVAH&rsquo;S LOVE FOR JACOB</h2>
<p>Malachi 1:2-5 speaks of Jehovah&rsquo;s love for Jacob.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah Loving Jacob but Hating Esau</h2>
<p>In verses 2b and 3a Jehovah utters a very frank word related to Jacob and Esau. He says, &ldquo;I loved Jacob; but Esau I hated.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Edom Being Called<br />
the Territory of Wickedness</h2>
<p>Jehovah goes on to say that Edom (the country of Esau) would be called the territory of wickedness and the people with whom Jehovah is indignant forever (vv. 3b-4). Both the place and the people were displeasing to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Jehovah Being Magnified<br />
over the Territory of Israel (in Edom)</h2>
<p>Verse 5 says, &ldquo;Your eyes will see it, and you yourselves will say, Jehovah is magnified over the territory of Israel.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;over the territory of Israel&rdquo; means outside this territory. Even though the nation of Edom has been condemned and the people of Edom are the object of God&rsquo;s indignation, yet even in Edom, outside Israel, Jehovah will be magnified.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_070.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_072.html">Next</a> </body></html>
