   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHURCH BEING ONE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 12:12-13 says, "For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that the church comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we want to see how the church is one in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This speaks of its origin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every Christian possesses a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The one life of Christ has become millions of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 12 speaks of a grain of wheat which falls into the ground and dies and bears much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the grains which are produced from the one grain have the same essence as the original grain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One grain has become many grains, and the many grains come out of that one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How then can the many Christians who possess the same life become the one Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is where the work of the Holy Spirit comes in. The one Christ has become millions of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now the Holy Spirit baptizes these millions of Christians into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the fundamental teaching recorded in 1 Corinthians 12:12-13.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Body is one, yet it is composed of many members.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How can the many members become one Body?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, this Body comes into being through baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through baptism in the Spirit, the many Christians are immersed into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every Christian is like a piece of stone hewn out of a big rock.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Holy Spirit is like the cement which cements the stones back together to become one rock.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Body of Christ has two basic principles: First, apart from that which comes out of Christ, there is no Body of Christ; second, apart from the operation of the Holy Spirit, there is no Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There must first be the baptism of the Spirit and the infilling of the Spirit; God's children must all be baptized by the Spirit in order to become the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was what happened at Pentecost in Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many had received the Lord's life and had become His many members.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then the Lord baptized these many members through the Holy Spirit into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who know the Lord and the Holy Spirit also will know this one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are many members in the human body, but the head rules over them all through the nerves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, the Head of the church joins the many members into one Body through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church is out of Christ, and it is formed into one Body in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christian fellowship and communion should be based on one's standing in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have no relationship other than this relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are not bound together because we are Jews or Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We commune with one another because we are all members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our communion with one another is based on the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is only one basis for our fellowship in the church our being fellow members with one another in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot have any fellowship that is based on any other foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Any fellowship outside the Body of Christ is a division.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Any fellowship that is not as large as the Body, that is in fact smaller than the Body, is not the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Any boundary that is different from the boundary of the Body, though it may not contradict the boundary of the Body, is a hindrance to the Body boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such a variation in boundary will always hinder the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We cannot accept any fellowship that is different from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are here to maintain the fellowship of Christians, the fellowship of the Body, not any fellowship that is smaller than the Body.</S>
