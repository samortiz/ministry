The subject of Hymns, #62 is Christ's humanity, and the fourth stanza of this hymn indicates that in the heavens Christ is still a man:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>In the time which God appointed<br>Thou wilt come, dear Lord, again,<br>With the glory of the Father,<br>Still appearing as a man.<br>Even on the throne of judgment<br>Son of man Thou still wilt be;<br>And with this, our human nature,<br>Thou forevermore wilt be.</P><P>Stephen saw Christ as the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God after His ascension (Acts. 7:56). In His second coming, Christ will be a man (Matt. 26:64). Christ has also been appointed by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead (Acts. 10:42). Because He is a man, God has given Him the authority to judge men (John 5:22, 27). According to the New Testament, God has authorized the man Jesus to judge the living at His coming, before the millennium on His throne of glory (Matt. 25:31-46), and the dead after the millennium on the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). In eternity He will still be a man (John 1:51).</P><P>Today on the earth the dispensing of God Himself into humanity includes not only Christ but also all of His believers. Hallelujah, Christ is the God-man, and we also are God-men. Jesus is the dispensing of God Himself into humanity, and we too are the dispensing of God Himself into humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. To Destroy Satan and to Save the Believers<br>in Christ from Sin and Death</H2><P>The purpose of the seed of the woman, the son born of a virgin, was to destroy Satan and to save the believers in Christ from sin and death (Heb. 2:14; Matt. 1:20-21; 1 Cor. 15:53-57). To bruise the head of the serpent is to destroy the serpent (Gen. 3:15). Through His death Christ destroyed the devil (Heb. 2:14). Since Adam's fall three things have bothered mankind: Satan, sin, and death. These three things are one. Thus, in His death and resurrection Christ destroyed Satan and saved His believers from sin and death.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> </body></html>
