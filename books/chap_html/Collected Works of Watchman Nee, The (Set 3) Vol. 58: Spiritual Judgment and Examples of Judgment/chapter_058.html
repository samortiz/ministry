D.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. My father was a deacon in a denomination. My mother often told me Bible stories. I was nurtured in a good way in my family. By nature I am a timid person, and from my youth I was afraid of hell. When I was twelve, my father passed away. I fainted, and my mother comforted me. When I grew up, I went into business and lost money many times. I was mocked and criticized by my colleagues. I had insomnia for a few months and tried to kill myself a few times. My love for my family stopped me from taking my own life. My cousin introduced me to Brother Nee's magazine The Christian. I received much help from it and was actually saved through it. After I was saved, I came to know more about the truth and had the assurance of salvation. I know that no one loves me in this world like the Lord does. His love constrains me, and I have consecrated myself to Him. I began to have a burden for the gospel.</p><p>In 1941 I was a teacher in a commercial school. The principal of the school considered me quite highly. After working there for five years, I was given the highest position in the school. I also received spiritual profit through my spiritual pursuit during this period. I became proud on account of my few good works. For years I had been learning to serve in the church, but I was dry spiritually. I was up and down all the time, living a vacillating life. When I saw others loving the Lord and found myself not being able to do the same, I felt condemned. One day a brother fellowshipped with me, and I was revived. For a year I rose up every morning before daybreak to read the Bible and to pray. I experienced victory during this time. However, this fed my pride once again. The Lord allowed me to fail again. This time the fall was too great; I no longer could stand up. In 1945 a brother visited me, and I was revived once again. In the winter of 1947 I returned to Swatow and received some help. I had the strong intention then of dropping everything to serve the Lord. God showed me something through a dream. I saw all of my relatives coming to my funeral, and I was on my way to my grave. I told them, "Either you separate yourselves from me, or you will have to take the same way I have taken."</p><p>At the end of March 1948, I received a letter from Brother Witness inviting me to come to stay for a short time in Shanghai and to attend the national co-workers' fellowship. Brother Nee also agreed to let me come. I arrived in Shanghai, and the brothers arranged for me to be a learner in the service through taking a secular job. I was not happy about this. In my fellowship with Brother Witness Lee, I was told that I was unfit, and I knew that I was unfit. Later I left to join my uncle in Nanking, but I was still troubled. Now Brother Nee has agreed to let me come to the mountain to be trained. However, I was told that I should not consider myself part of the work. I feel bad about this. I am confused, and I am not able to touch God. I know that I am wrong in many things. I do not know how to pray. I feel that I am lazy, yet I cannot quite fall down. I am facing a crossroads. I do not know what I should do. Although I have experienced many dealings from the Lord, I have not learned many spiritual lessons. I am a very emotional person. I love the brothers and sisters very much, but now even my emotion has no taste for anything. As my emotion cools down, my love for the Lord cools down as well. However, I must say that this love for the Lord is still within me.</p>
