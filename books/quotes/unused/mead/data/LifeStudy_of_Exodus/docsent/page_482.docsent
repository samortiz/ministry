   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PSALMIST S APPRECIATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE TWO ALTARS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because the two altars are connected, the psalmist speaks of them together: Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God Psa 84:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Writing in a poetic way, the psalmist appreciates the two altars.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is especially interesting when we realize that in God s dwelling place there were other furnishings and utensils, such as the ark, the table, and the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the two altars are foremost in the psalmist s appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The sparrow and the swallow signify us, human beings who are small, weak, and unworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus said that two sparrows were sold for a penny Matt 10:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nevertheless, we who are as frail as sparrows can find a house at the Lord s altars.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, as swallows, we can lay our young at these altars.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who do not have the proper appreciation of Psalm 84 may wonder how sparrows and swallows could possibly make their nest at the Lord s altars.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who view the psalm in this way may regard the altars as desolate and not taken care of by anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, Psalm 84 is very sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is filled with appreciation of God s dwelling place, in particular, of the two altars.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These altars signify Christ s death and His intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The offering altar is the altar of Christ s death, and the incense altar is the altar of Christ s intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I can testify that these two altars, joined together, have become very sweet to me in my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am like a sparrow or a swallow nesting at the altars and laying my young ones there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE TWO ALTARS IN OUR EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In their experience many Christians have only one altar, the first altar, the offering altar in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that they have the cross, but they do not have the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our experience we need both altars.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now that we are studying the incense altar described in chapter 30 of Exodus, I am burdened to point out that we are not merely having a Bible study or simply teaching the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the points we are covering should be applied to our prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our prayer life must be in God, and it must be with God in us as our supply and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are to have a proper prayer life, we must also offer Christ to God as incense.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, it is very important for us to see that this kind of prayer is linked to the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I would encourage you to bring all these matters to the Lord in prayer and ask Him to show you something further.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The revelation concerning the incense altar has helped me a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Often it has served to govern my prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But sometimes, due to the environment, I too have prayed in a rather natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May the Lord have mercy on us that we may see that the proper and genuine prayer life is in God and requires that God be in us; that it is one with the resurrected and ascended Christ as our incense to God; and that it is linked to the crucified Christ by the blood, the fire, and the sweet savor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we have this kind of prayer, we shall be able to live a life that motivates God s move.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kind of prayer governs God s dispensation of grace and His administration of His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that the prayer offered at the incense altar governs the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a matter of great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>May our eyes be opened to see it.</S>
