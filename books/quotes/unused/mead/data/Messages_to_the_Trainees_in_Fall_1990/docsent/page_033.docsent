   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWING IN THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITHOUT FLUCTUATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should go on in the Christian life in a very sober way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When things are going well, we may be tempted to be excited.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, we must tell ourselves to cool down.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the same way, when things are not going well, we must tell ourselves not to be bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not be affected by the environment or the conditions around us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should simply be genuine and not quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There should be no fluctuation in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To us, a day of sorrow should not be different from a day of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should only care for the divine facts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have a regenerated spirit, and the divine Spirit is living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we consider our past experience, we will realize that we have not been consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, we have made some mistakes due to our being too excited.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the other hand, when we have been cold, we have stayed cold for too long a time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not the proper Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The real growth, the real advance, in the Christian life is evidenced by our always remaining the same with no fluctuation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many encouraging and discouraging things may happen to us, but we still should remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the portrait of the Lord Jesus in the Gospels we cannot see a fluctuation in His living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When a good report came, He was not excited, and when a bad report came, He was not discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Fluctuation is a sign that we are childish.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Babies fluctuate all the time, but the more one grows, the more consistent he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Neither good news nor bad news affects a mature person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the church life and in the Lord's work, we need persons who do not fluctuate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this we need the growth in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have been talking about the new way for the church life for several years, but some among us are not taking the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is because it is not exciting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To take the new way should be like doing our duty to go to work every day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not many people would prefer to work at a regular job if they had a choice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, most people do have a job because they must make a living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whether we are happy or sorrowful, we have to work at our job every day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our going on in the church life should be in the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we grow in life, this growth will cause us to be consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every day we will pray and contact people, and we will become trustworthy and reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Most of our problems stem from our inconsistency and untrustworthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, the very Triune God is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We fluctuate too much, but He is trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more we grow in life, the more we will match the indwelling Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The indwelling Spirit within us is always the same.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we must learn not to quench the Spirit but to stand with the spiritual facts and live a life according to these facts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more we grow in life, the more we will live this way, and the Lord will be able to use us to accomplish many things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Question: If we are always consistent, will we have expressions such as those of the Lord when He drove the moneychangers out of the temple John 2:14-15 or of Paul when he dealt with the Corinthians in tears 2 Cor 2:4 and in boldness 1 Cor 4:21 ?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Answer: Even when the Lord and Paul had such expressions, they still remained consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After driving out the moneychangers, the Lord returned again to the temple to minister Matt 21:12, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He remained consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must simply not quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead, we must follow the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we are excited or sorrowful, we have to check whether we are following the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we are sorrowful when the Spirit is not sorrowful, our sorrow is a quenching to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Quite often, burdens come to us from many directions, and the burdens do affect us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may be sensitive to the situations, but we should not follow our sensitivity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must follow the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we do not quench the Spirit, we will not be excited or made sorrowful by our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To quench the Spirit is to go our own way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we go our own way, we are not caring that we have the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are forgetting that we have been "married" to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must not quench Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is always right.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we quench Him, we will make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To grow in the divine life is to be decreased while the Spirit is being increased in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This takes place by our following Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God wants us to be one with the Spirit, to be led by the Spirit as the sons of God Rom 8:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not be affected by the outward environment.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Rather, we should follow the Spirit and not quench the Spirit.</S>
