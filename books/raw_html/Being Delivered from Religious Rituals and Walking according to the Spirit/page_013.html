        <h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE BRIDEGROOM</h2>
<p>Christ is new, and He is outside religion. He is our Bridegroom, and He is the new cloth for making our new garment. He is the new wine for us to drink, and He makes us a new wineskin to contain the new wine. We have been saved for many years, but have we enjoyed Christ as our Bridegroom? One day we said, &ldquo;Lord, I receive You as my Savior. Thank You, You died for me on the cross, and You resurrected and ascended.&rdquo; However, have we ever said, &ldquo;O Lord, You are so lovely. You are our Bridegroom&rdquo;? In the bread-breaking meeting, we have praised the Lord for descending from heaven, putting aside His throne, being born in a manger, suffering afflictions in His human living, dying, and resurrecting. Now we say, &ldquo;O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah!&rdquo; We dropped the clich&#233; of the past, but we have a new clich&#233;. Not many saints may have experienced the loveliness of the Lord during the bread-breaking meeting. Not many saints say, &ldquo;O Lord! You are the lovely Bridegroom. O Lord! You are so lovely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord is not only our Savior but also our Bridegroom. In Matthew 9:10 the Lord Jesus was reclining at table in the house, and many tax collectors and sinners were also feasting with the Lord and His disciples. However, some disciples of John did not like that the Lord and His disciples were feasting, so they came to the Lord and said, &ldquo;Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?&rdquo; (v. 14). John had been ministering for about a year, and he had overthrown the old religion, but his disciples formed a new religion. Hence, not only the disciples of the Pharisees questioned the Lord, but the disciples of John also questioned the Lord. Furthermore, the disciples of John took the lead to give the Lord Jesus a difficult time. The Lord Jesus gave them a profound answer. The disciples of John paid attention to methods, but the Lord Jesus did not reply with a method. His answer was concerning His presence. The Lord said, &ldquo;The sons of the bridechamber cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they?&rdquo; (v. 15). Hence, it is not a matter of fasting or feasting. It is a matter of having the Lord&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>The young people like to be loud. Why are they loud? They should reply, &ldquo;It is because of the Lord&rsquo;s presence. The louder I am, the more I touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence, touch Him as the Bridegroom, and touch His loveliness, sweetness, and freshness.&rdquo; If this is the case, they should always be loud. Why do the older saints like to be quiet? Can they say that the more they are quiet, the more they have the Lord&rsquo;s presence and touch His freshness and His loveliness? If this is the case, they should be quiet. We should not care about whether we are quiet or loud; rather, we should care about whether or not we sense the Lord&rsquo;s presence. In the church there should be no regulations, no ordinances, and no rituals. In the church we care only for the Lord&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus did not give any reasons to John&rsquo;s disciples. He did not say, &ldquo;You have formed a new religion, and in order to tear down your new religion, I do not want My disciples to fast.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus did not say this. However, some saints might have this thought. The older ones may say, &ldquo;The young people&rsquo;s being loud has turned into a new religion, so I will be quiet. I will use silence to counter their loudness. They are loud in order to oppose our old methods, so now I object to their new method by being quiet.&rdquo; The older saints may have overthrown the new religion by being quiet, but they have also produced a third religion. The Lord is not concerned with methods.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said that He was with His disciples as the Bridegroom. If He as the Bridegroom wanted them to fast, they should fast, and if He wanted them to eat and drink, they should eat and drink. Likewise, if the Lord&rsquo;s presence wants us to be loud, we should be loud. If we can touch the presence of the Bridegroom by being quiet, we should be quiet. If we cannot touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence in our quietness, we should proclaim, &ldquo;O Lord! Lord Jesus!&rdquo; By calling on Him in this way, we will enjoy the presence of the Bridegroom. The older saints say that to proclaim loudly is not right. I am not saying that it is right. However, the older saints should try to touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence by declaring His name. Once they taste the Lord in this way, they will enjoy it. This is not a theory but a fact.</p>
<p>We are not speaking of the Lord&rsquo;s ordinary presence but of His presence as the Bridegroom. A bridegroom is a special person. He is the most lovely and most admired person. Our Lord should be so sweet and precious to us. We must touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence as the One who is our Bridegroom. Hallelujah! He is not merely our Savior, our Redeemer, and our Lord, but He is even more our Bridegroom.</p>
<p>The first stanza of <em>Hymns,</em> #170 says, &ldquo;Lord, Thou art the lovely Bridegroom, / God appointed, dear to us; / Thy dear self is so attractive, / To our heart so beauteous!&rdquo; When we truly see that the Lord is our Bridegroom, our meetings will be different. They will become wedding meetings. Can we fast when we have the Lord&rsquo;s presence as our Bridegroom? Suppose a young brother is getting married and will soon become a bridegroom. To fast for him would be to put him to shame. We would fast for him only if he had encountered misfortune. Has the Lord encountered misfortune, or is He our Bridegroom? He is our Bridegroom! Hence, we need not fast. Let all the religionists fast. Let the followers of religion fast. We will eat and drink, and we will sing of our Lord being the lovely Bridegroom.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
