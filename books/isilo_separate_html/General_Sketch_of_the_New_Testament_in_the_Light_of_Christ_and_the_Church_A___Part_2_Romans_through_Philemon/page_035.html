Not one bit of his soul is turned to his spirit. The soul of a young believer in Christ is also very much on the side of his body. Although he loves the Lord, his soul is not much incorporated with the spirit. How much of our own soul is attached to our flesh, and how much does our soul stand with our spirit? We spend too much time with the flesh and very little with the spirit. In what way can our soul turn from the flesh to the spirit? It is not by teaching but by suffering. Teaching is not adequate to turn our soul from the body to the spirit. Teaching can cause us to understand, but it does not bring us into the reality.<p>The more a brother or sister suffers physically and materially, the more his or her soul progressively turns from the side of the flesh to the spirit. This means that the outer man is being consumed and the inner man is being renewed. I have seen many dear brothers and sisters who were strong persons prior to their suffering. They were strong in the body and in the flesh. Then the Lord put them into a situation of sickness, and they suffered physically for many years. Gradually, the more they suffered physically, the more their mind, will, and emotion were turned from the body to the spirit. Eventually, such persons who have been suffering physically for a long time become very spiritual. Their mind, emotion, and will are very much on the side of the spirit instead of on the side of the flesh. This indicates that the outer man is consumed and the inner man is renewed. It is in this way that the Lord deals with our soul. Suffering turns our soul from the body to the spirit. This is the work of the ministry.<h2 class=head1>MINISTERS OF GOD BY THE WORKING OF THE CROSS</h2><h2 class=head2>Being Wrought with the Lord and Knowing Him</h2><p>Chapter six stresses the working of the cross and Christ being wrought into us. Verse 4 says, &#8220;But in everything we commend ourselves as ministers of God.&#8221; In other books written by the apostle Paul, he called himself a servant or slave, but in this book he uses mostly the word minister. In the Greek text, the words slave and minister are different. The word slave has a particular background. At that time around the Mediterranean Sea there was a custom that one could be sold to a master to be a bondman, someone without any freedom. This was Paul&#8217;s meaning when he used the word slave. The apostles were the Lord&#8217;s slaves. The word minister, on the other hand, means that something of the Lord has been wrought into someone to make him the minister of the Lord.<p>Someone may be a person&#8217;s slave but not be a good minister to him. To be a slave means that he has no liberty. He has been sold to another, he has no rights, and he submits to his master. However, it is very possible that he may not know anything about his master. He may know how to submit to him, but he does not know what his master intends to do and what his thoughts and desires are. Then, although he may be a good slave, he is not a good minister. In order to be a minister and deal with people on behalf of his master, a person must be wrought by his master. The master&#8217;s heart, desire, intention, thought, and relationships with others must be clear to that person. Then he can go to others as a minister representing his master and speaking exactly according to him.<p>We can see this in diplomatic affairs. The foreign minister of a country, such as the American ambassador to China, must be a man who knows the affairs of his government. If someone knows his government&#8217;s intention, purpose, policy, desire, and relationship with other nations, he can be the proper representative to another country. However, if someone is a citizen of a country yet does not know anything about his government&#8217;s affairs, he can never be a minister of his country. In the same way, if something of the Lord has been wrought into a servant of the Lord, he becomes a minister of the Lord.<p>In 2 Corinthians the term minister is used more than in other books because in this book the servants of the Lord are wrought by the Lord. Something of the Lord&#8217;s character, life, intention, desire, and purpose has been wrought into them to make them the ministers of Christ.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> </body></html>
