<h2 class="head2">A Love for Sinners' Souls</h2><p>Concerning the second question, my answer is that you can pray for a love for sinners' souls. First, you have to see the pitiful condition of a sinner. This will stir up your love for him and give you an earnest sense of responsibility which can never be shaken off. It will become a driving force within you. On the one hand, you can ask God to give you a love for sinners' souls. On the other hand, this is a kind of revelation. Once you have such a revelation, your spirit will be empowered.</p><h2 class="head2">A Levite's Living</h2><p>Concerning the third question, my answer is that the Levites in the Bible serve as a pattern for our living. Ordinary brothers and sisters are different from us; they have fixed incomes. We do not have any fixed income. When the Israelites offered up their sacrifices, the meat that was left went to the Levites. This means that when there were many offerings, they had much meat. When there were few offerings, they had little meat. Some think that the Levites had a great deal of meat to eat. But they fail to see that the living of the Levites is related to the living of God's people. The book of Malachi speaks of the people of Israel robbing God's offerings (3:8-10) and thus depleting the supply of His priests. Many people only saw Paul in his abundance; they did not see him in his poverty. Every worker should maintain his dignity before the brothers and sisters and should appear rich to them; he should not appear poor. Anyone who cannot stand on the ground of trusting God in financial matters is not qualified to work for Him. We would rather have men consider us rich than have them consider us poor. Paul said, "But I, I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls" (2 Cor. 12:15). Paul spent himself for others. I am not afraid of criticisms against a worker, who is spending himself on others, for being well-dressed and well-fed. Those who criticize him for this are critical because they are not willing to offer their money. When they see others offering money, they become jealous. This is wrong. It seems that more money has gone out of my hands than from any other person's hand. But it can also be said that I have the experience more than others of holding one last dollar in my hand.</p><p>If the brothers in the church in Chefoo do not intend to support you, take up a secular profession. You do not need to spend their money. Paul had a profession of making tents when he said, "You yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me" (Acts 20:34). For Paul to say this was not a glory for the Corinthians but a loss. Paul had to make tents in Corinth. In Philippi he did not have to do this. When the church is short of regular supply, we have to think of ways to make a living. But we should not pay too much attention to this matter.</p><p>Finally, I do not have much to say to you personally. This is a very critical hour, and we should give ourselves to the work. When darkness comes, no one will be able to do anything.</p>
