I believe that the brothers and sisters can see the reason for our arrangements.</p><p>We have to realize that all problems in our service rest entirely with the person of the workers. For this reason, we have to be trained in our very person as well as in the ministry. This time we have seen a little concerning the way to serve. Actually, our greatest lack before God is not our ministry but our personal daily walk. In this training sixty-nine brothers and sisters have presented their testimonies. Their condition is a fair representation of all the brothers and sisters everywhere. During the second morning session, we have covered the need of knowing the proper kind of Christian walk. Our training has emphasized three things: ministry, our walk, and new believers' lessons. Now that you have seen these things, please remember that you must not repeat and duplicate what we have talked about here. We were free to say what was said because we have all handed ourselves over to the Lord.</p><p>I am not making any clarification for myself; rather, I am showing you that I have never interfered with others' business in the past. Some brothers like Simon Meek and Faithful Luk have known me for decades. Brother Luk, who is very close to me, has asked me twenty times by letter and even three times while we were here on the mountain, to open up myself. This time I am giving myself to you. I am revealing my own secrets. In the future if I open up myself again, I want to do it myself. If you try to do it for me, it is unrighteousness as far as I am concerned. What we have released here, with the exception of our lessons on the way to study the Scripture and the messages in the evenings, should not be broadcast. In particular, you should not imitate my style or my tone. In other places I have done exceptional things for the sake of meeting the needs of the churches in those places. In my life I have done three very exceptional things. First, I felt the need to write The Spiritual Man when I had tuberculosis and the doctor told me that I was about to die. Second, I spoke on matters that I had been constrained from speaking about for many years when I returned from overseas. When I was abroad, friends asked if I had learned my utterance in China. When I came back to China, some thought that I picked up my utterance overseas. Often we imagine things that bear no resemblance to reality at all. Third, I have spoken as I have done during the past months in Kuling. I have opened up myself and given myself to you. I have done it once, and I will not do it again. I owe the church nothing, because I have done all I can. I have spoken all that I should speak. I have given myself to you unreservedly. I hope that you will see the Lord's way. If you do not rise up now, the church will have no way to go on. If the ministers will not rise up, the church will have no way to go on. The responsibility is not on me any longer. I have washed my hands. The fault does not lay with me any longer. The responsibility is now on your shoulders.</p><p>I thank you all for coming this time. We made the decision to have this training at the last minute. It was a little unfair to you because we did not give you enough time to prepare yourselves. I hope that you will not communicate to ordinary brothers and sisters what we have done here in Kuling. Allow me to say a word "beside myself" (2 Cor. 11:23). I have received enough glory and suffered enough shame already. In the future I do not wish to receive any more glory or shame. I have my scruples and reasons for doing what I did here in Kuling. Some people say, "Do not worry; everything will be settled at the judgment seat." I do not have their confidence. I dare not say such a word. I am in God's hand, and I know that I am a hard person to deal with. I need God's word to deal with me. As one psalm says, "If [God is] silent to me, I become like those who go down into the pit" (Psa. 28:1).</p><p>After the last storm in my ministry, I became even clearer than before about what I have felt for the past ten years, which is that my ministry is for serving the ministers. My ministry is not to serve God's children in general; my ministry is among the ministers. I hope that you will not force me to move among the brothers and sisters in the church. If you do, I will be exposed before all the believers. Please do not imitate me. No brother or sister can be the same as I am in disposition or service. Everyone has his own pathway. Romans 14:4 tells us clearly that each one of us has our own pathway before the Lord, and the Lord will make us stand.</p><p>I know inwardly the way I should take. I know that I was slandered and attacked twenty times in pamphlets and through mass distribution of negative booklets. For this reason my service to other Christians can only be indirect; I cannot serve them directly. I am not saying that I am angry at the pamphlets and the booklets. God knows that I smiled at them more than I frowned at them. When others accused me of weaknesses, I readily admitted it. The facts might have been wrong, but it was right that I should receive criticism. As far as the facts are concerned, they might not have condemned what I condemned, and they might have condemned what I would not condemn. At any rate, I do not want other brothers and sisters to know what I am doing here at Kuling. If they know about it, I am afraid much damage will be done. You should only let others see and hear the spiritual benefits you have received; you should not teach others the doctrines and outward practices you have received.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> </body></html>
