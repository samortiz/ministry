It comes spontaneously and without reluctance because we put our trust only in those that we consider trustworthy. We do not need greater faith, we need to know the faithfulness and trustworthiness of God. If we realized that God was the source of our faith, we would no longer seek faith in ourselves. Instead, we would lift up our eyes to God and seek to know Him. When we realize that God is reliable, our faith will spontaneously grow. If we know that God is reliable, we will trust Him. If we consider God to be unreliable, we will not trust Him.</P><P>Our faith has a basis because it rests in God. We do not believe in ourselves but in God Himself. We must make a distinction: what we believe in is not our faith but God. The mistake of some believers is that they believe in their feelings of faith more than they believe in God. If they feel they have no faith, they do not trust in God or commit their things into God's hand. If they feel they have faith, they boldly entrust their things to God. What is this? This is not believing in God. This is believing in their own faith! We should not pay much attention to this faith. We should not ask or search to see if we have faith, and we should not trust in God only when we have faith. We should ask whether or not God is reliable. If He is --and of course He is --then why do we not trust in Him? If we think, "I am not afraid now because I have faith," then we are trusting in our own faith and not trusting in God. Likewise, if we say, "I cannot commit these things to God because I have no faith," it does not mean that we do not believe in God. This only indicates that we doubt our own faith. We fail to trust in God not because He is untrustworthy but because we do not have faith. The problem is not with God. The problem is with man. It may be true that you do not have faith, but is God unreliable? If God is reliable, why do you not trust in Him? You only have to be concerned about God, not yourself. If God is trustworthy, then spontaneously you will trust in Him. Otherwise, even if you have faith, it is futile. Do not trust in your own faith; your faith is not trustworthy. Instead, trust in God. "For I know whom I have believed"; therefore, "I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit" (2 Tim. 1:12).</P><P>The Bible not only tells us that God is the source of our faith; it also tells us that the word of God is the source of our faith: "So faith comes out of hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ" (Rom. 10:17). Why do I first say that God is the source of our faith and then say that the word of God is the source of our faith? Here we see the wonder of God's word. How do we know God? We know Him by the word He speaks. The word He speaks represents His heart's desire. When we understand His word, we will realize what God has promised for us and what He does and does not want to do. Only through the Word of God --the Bible --can we know God's promise. When we know His promise, we will trust in Him according to His promise and beseech Him through prayers. If we do not have the word of God, we will have nothing at all. "How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe into Him of whom they have not heard?" (Rom. 10:14). If we do not have the promise of God, but mindlessly believe in Him, we will fall into a kind of superstition. Faith must be based on something. Mindlessly believing, without a basis, is superstition, and no one will receive anything from this kind of faith. If my father promises me something, I believe he will give it to me. This believing is solid because my faith is based on the promise of my father. If my father has not promised me anything, but I force myself to believe that he will give me something, then I am not believing but dreaming because I believe in something that is not factual but my own imagination. From this example, we can see the important relationship between faith and promise.</P><P>God's promises are only recorded in God's Word, the Bible. To know the promises of God, one must know the Word of God. Without the promises of God, our faith is not real faith. The promises are in the Word of God. "So faith comes...through the word of Christ" (Rom. 10:17). We have said that we need to believe in God's faithfulness, trustworthiness, and reliability. We have also said that if we know God, we will spontaneously have faith. This is related to God's promises, that is, to His words. If God has not promised anything, how can we know that He is faithful? He must promise something before we can talk about His faithfulness.</P><P>What is faith? Faith is holding on to what God has said and praying for God's work to be realized. Faith is believing that God will do what He has said. Faith is believing that God is faithful and that He will work out what He has said. Whether our faith is great or small is not the issue. The issue is: if God has promised something, will He lie and change? The only question we should ask is whether or not we believe that God is honest. This has nothing to do with our faith being great or small.</P><P>We know that God loves us. Therefore, we should have no doubt that He is for us. The Bible shows us at least two aspects concerning His promises: "What He [has] promised He [is] able also to do" (Rom. 4:21). God is powerful and His power fulfills His promises. Our God is not a weak and powerless God who cannot do what He says He will do. If this were so, what good would His promises be? All of His promises would be empty words. But God is not only powerful in promising something, He is also powerful in carrying out His promise. Whatever He has promised, He is able to carry it out. "He is able" --this is what the Bible tells us about His person. "For the Lord is able to make him stand" (Rom. 14:4). "God is able to make all grace abound unto you" (2 Cor. 9:8). "He is able to guard..." (2 Tim. 1:12). Abraham offered up Isaac because he knew that "God was able to raise men even from the dead..." (Heb. 11:19).</P><P>God is not only able to do what He has promised to do; He is also intent on doing it. Even if someone has the ability to carry them out but does not keep his words, the promises are vain. God is not only able; He is intent on carrying out His promises. "For He who has promised is faithful" (Heb. 10:23). "If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself" (2 Tim. 2:13). God intends that all of His promises, every word and every sentence, be fulfilled in His children. Whatever He says, He will keep. Whatever He has promised, He will fulfill. Otherwise, His deity would be threatened. Since He cannot deny Himself, He must remain trustworthy whatever the circumstances. If His promises are vain words, we cannot entrust all things and ourselves to God. How can we still doubt if He has promised something, since He is faithful and will not break His words?</P><P>Therefore, brothers, please learn this lesson today. You are not the basis of faith. Never ask yourselves, "Do I have faith? Is my faith sufficient?" It is useless to ask such questions. The more you ask, the less faith you will have. Please ask God. What is God's promise concerning this matter? Has His love towards you changed? Will He break His word of promise? Is He able to carry out His promises? Is He trustworthy? Is He reliable? When you consider more about God, you will not have to manufacture faith. Faith will come spontaneously. Remember, you are not trustworthy, and your faith is also not trustworthy. Only God is trustworthy.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_067.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_069.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 06: The Christian (4) &nbsp; pg 68</div><br></body></html>
