<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>WHAT CHRIST IS</H1><P>Christ is the life and reality of the church. Now we need to know the right way, even the best way, for us to apply and experience Christ as life to us. However, before we get into this matter, we need to find out what Christ is. If we want to apply Christ as life to our experience in our daily life, we need to know what kind of Christ He is. Of course, it is impossible to know Christ in a thorough way. We can never exhaust the knowledge of Christ because He is all-inclusive and His riches are unsearchable (Eph. 3:8). Nevertheless, we have to try our best to know what He is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED TO KNOW CHRIST<br>WITH THE CHURCH</H2><P>At the end of the first chapter, we pointed out that in Ezekiel 1 there is a big wheel moving all the time on the earth (vv. 15-21). If you consider this matter in the light of the whole Scripture, you will realize that this wheel is the move of God in the universe. This wheel as the means by which God acts and moves in this universe must be Christ with the church. Christ is the center, the hub, and the church is the circumference, the rim. If we want to practice the church life, the Body life, we need to know the church and where the church is in God's economy. Even more, we need to know what Christ is. Christ and the church are the great mystery in the universe (Eph. 5:32). Where the church is, there is Christ, and where Christ is, there is the church. You can never separate Christ from the church. Whenever we speak about the church, we must know what Christ is and how He is related to the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST BEING THE MIGHTY GOD</H2><P>We all know that Christ has many names, and I believe that among these many names the first must be the Son of God. Then we have to ask, "Who is the Son?" Let us read Isaiah 9:6: "For a child is born to us,/A son is given to us;/And the government/Is upon His shoulders;/And His name will be called/Wonderful Counselor,/Mighty God,/Eternal Father,/Prince of Peace." The little child is the Mighty God. This is the difference between the very God in whom we believe and the God in whom the Jewish people believe. The Jewish people believe the only God, who is the Mighty God, but they do not believe that this Mighty God became a child.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST BEING BOTH THE SON AND THE FATHER</H2><P>Then there is another name&#151;the Eternal Father. He is the Son, yet He is called the Eternal Father. Some people try to argue by saying that the Son is called the Father, but the Son is not the Father. I cannot understand how the Son can be called the Father yet not be the Father. It is foolish to say that a person is called John Clark, yet he is not John Clark. If the Son is called the Father, He must be the Father. If He is not the Father, how can He be called the Father? The clear and definite prophecy in Isaiah 9:6 tells us that the very child born in the manger in Bethlehem is the Mighty God and that the Son given to us is the Eternal Father. A Son is given, yet His name is called the Eternal Father. The very Son who has been given to us is the very Father.</P><P>This is confirmed by John 14:8-11. Now let us read this portion carefully: "Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us. Jesus said to him, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; but if not, believe because of the works themselves." Here again we see that the Son and the Father are one. Some would say, "How could the Son pray to the Father if the Son is the Father?" This is not a problem. Andrew Murray once said that the best prayer is the Christ who dwells in us praying to the Christ who is in heaven.</P>
