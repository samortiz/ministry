   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RUNNING THE RACE TO OBTAIN THE REWARD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter nine the point we should pick up is the matter of running the race to obtain the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 17 Paul says that if he preaches the gospel voluntarily he has a reward; but if not of his own will, he has been entrusted with a stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul continues to say, What then is my reward?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That in preaching the gospel I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel v. 18 . Then he continues in verses 24 through 27: Do you not know that those who run in a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may lay hold.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; those, therefore, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so I box, not as beating the air; but I buffet my body and lead it as a slave, lest having preached to others, I myself should become disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The crucial point is to run the race to obtain the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here Paul uses two illustrations from the Olympics: running a race and contending in a game.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both are illustrations for our Christian walk and work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our Christian walk and work are like running in a race-course and contending in a game.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The reward which the Lord will award His overcoming saints who win the race, is something in addition to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We, His believers, have all received His salvation through faith in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was settled once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But whether we shall be rewarded by Him depends upon how we run the race.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>ENJOYING CHRIST FOR</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>OUR FELLOWSHIP WITH ALL THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The main point in chapter ten is the enjoyment of Christ for our fellowship with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The beginning of this chapter refers to the eating and drinking by the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They ate the manna and drank the water from the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the end of verse 4, Paul indicated definitely that this is a type because he said the rock was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The manna must therefore also be Christ and the living water must be the very Spirit that comes out of Christ, the cleft rock.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These two items are for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verses 14 through 22 of this chapter the Lord s table is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the context of the entire chapter, our enjoyment at the Lord s table should equal the Israelites enjoyment of eating manna, the spiritual food, and drinking the spiritual drink, the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today we enjoy the Lord s table, where the manna is the bread on the table and the spiritual drink is in the cup on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In all of these verses are many good points which are defined either in the footnotes of the Recovery Version or in the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s people should be a people of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their enjoyment is of God Himself embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Old Testament, the very God was embodied in manna and in the spiritual drink that came out of the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then in the New Testament, God is embodied in the bread and the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We eat Him, we drink Him, and thus we enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is for our fellowship of the blood of Christ and of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that we have fellowship in the Body and that we have fellowship in the blood by our eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we enjoy the Lord by eating and drinking Him, we have the fellowship with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our fellowship with all the saints is in our enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE UNIVERSAL HEADSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 11:3 Paul says, But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In three aspects this is the universal headship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not a very interesting or exciting point, but it is something very solid which we cannot skip over.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here the headship of Christ over every man is concerning individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ is both the Head corporately of the Body, the church, and individually of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is the Head directly of every one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the divine governmental ordination, woman is under the headship of man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God created the female in this way Gen 2:18-24; 1 Tim 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the nature v. 14 created by God, woman is subordinate to man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul also says in verse 3 that the head of Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ is God s anointed One, appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, He is under God, and God as the Originator is His Head.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This refers to the relationship between Christ and God in the divine government.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>THE LORD S SUPPER</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Following the universal headship, Paul comes to the Lord s supper in 11:17-34.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The emphasis of the table of the Lord is the fellowship of His blood and of His body 10:16-17 , the participation in the Lord, the enjoyment of the Lord in mutuality, in fellowship; whereas the stress of the Lord s supper is the remembrance of the Lord 11:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At the Lord s table we receive His body and blood for our enjoyment; at the Lord s supper we give Him our remembrance for His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The real remembrance of the Lord is to eat the bread and drink the cup v. 26 , that is, to participate in, to enjoy, the Lord who has given Himself to us through His redeeming death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To eat the bread and drink the cup is to take in the redeeming Lord as our portion, as our life and blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is to remember Him in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The thought of the apostle in using this expression the body v. 29 , not the body of the Lord, may imply the mystical Body of Christ Eph 4:4 in addition to the physical body of the Lord v. 24 . In taking the Lord s supper we need to discern the Lord s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, when we participate in the Lord s table, we must discern whether the bread on the table signifies the one Body of Christ or any division of man any denomination .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In discerning the Body of Christ we should not partake of the bread in any division or with any divisive spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our participation in the Lord s table must be the unique fellowship of His unique Body without any division either in practice or in spirit.</S>
