<p>Concerning the experience of Christ, the saints should walk in Christ (Col. 2:6). We need to walk in Christ instead of focusing on persuasive speech (v. 4). Christianity focuses on eloquence. If a person is eloquent and learned, he will be successful. However, eloquent words that do not minister Christ to people are called persuasive speech. In the church we do not care for what people say or how they speak; our only concern is that what is spoken ministers Christ and enables us to walk in Christ. Whether we are at home or abroad, we must be in Christ in the great things and the small things. We have been rooted in Him, and we are being built up in Him (v. 7). Hence, my only concern is to be in Christ. If I do something, it must be because Christ is doing it, and if I speak, it must be because Christ is speaking. We must not listen to persuasive speech, nor should we care for philosophy, empty deceit, or the tradition of men; we must be only according to Christ (v. 8). We should do everything according to Christ and in Christ. Our living and walk must be in Christ. This is God&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN<br />
AND PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>In Colossians 3 Paul puts down and brings to naught Greeks, Jews, circumcision, uncircumcision, barbarians, Scythians, slaves, and free men (v. 11). This indicates that in the church we need to put down everything that is not Christ. We need to put off the old man every day (v. 9). A brother from Shantung who still has a Shantung flavor has not put off the old man. To put off the old man includes putting off the Shantung element, the Hong Kong element, and the Japanese element. Some might think that only hatred, jealousy, and wrongdoings are the old man and that to put off the old man is to do good and love one another. However, this is a superficial thought. Regardless of where we were born and where we were raised and regardless of our nationality, we are the old man, which must be put off. If we do not put off the old man, the mystery of God cannot be expressed.</p>
<p>In putting off the old man, we must first put off our person and then put off what is hidden within us. Paul seems to be referring to putting off the Jewish, Greek, Chinese, British, and American elements. However, he is saying that we should put off the old man hidden within us. We need to put off the old man so that we can put on the new man, who is Christ. The Lord has no way on the earth if He has no way in us. There is something hidden within us. This something is our being, our old man, and he occupies the place of the Lord within us. We say that we are consecrated to the Lord and that we will take the Lord&rsquo;s way and allow Him to work. However, the Lord cannot do anything with our old man. If we would put off our old man, it would not be difficult for the Lord to have a way in us.</p>
<p>There are many people who are saved but do not love the Lord. There are also some who love the Lord, but their old man is still intact. These ones have the outward appearance of the new man, but within they are still the old man. As a result, there may be many local churches but not much blessing. We do not have more blessing, because it is hard to put off the old man hidden within the believers. If the old man is not put off, the new man cannot be put on, and the church life will not have much weight.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PEACE OF CHRIST AND THE WORD OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In Colossians 3 Paul also speaks of the peace of Christ and the word of Christ. In verse 15 Paul says, &ldquo;Let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts.&rdquo; We are complicated within, because we always compare and weigh things to see whether they are fitting or right. At such times, we need to let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our being. Instead of listening to the voice outside of us, we should listen to what the peace of Christ says within us. The peace of Christ should be a stabilizing force, a balance, and an arbitrator within our being. We are called in one Body to this peace. There should be peace in the Body of Christ, and this peace comes from the arbitration of Christ.</p>
<p>The word of Christ is the supply. In verse 16 Paul says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.&rdquo; Here the word <em>dwell</em> means &ldquo;make home.&rdquo; To let the word of Christ make home in us is to let the word of Christ have the ground in us and be the Lord in us. Then this word will supply, enlighten, strengthen, establish, and perfect us. The word of Christ will become everything in us. This word is not merely the words that Christ spoke in the Gospels. All the words in the Epistles are part of the word of Christ, because the words in the Epistles are spoken by Christ in the apostles. We should always let these words have ground, settle down, make home, and be the Lord in us. In this way the word supplies, enlightens, strengthens, and perfects us and also builds us up. Then Christ will be lived out from us.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
