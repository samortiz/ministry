   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Matured 1 The Process of Maturity</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In chapter thirty-seven Jacob was an old man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With respect to both time and geography, he had journeyed a long way and had finally come to Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jacob had passed through many things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Probably no one in the Bible has passed through as many intermixed and complicated situations as Jacob did.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was dealt with by God to such an extent that he had lost nearly all he had cared for.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the time of chapter thirty-seven, Rachel had died, and Jacob was living in Hebron, enjoying the fellowship that his forefathers Abraham and Isaac had known there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It seems that Jacob had retired at Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, there is no retirement in the spiritual life, and God intervened to upset what appeared to be Jacob's retirement.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I believe that at Hebron Jacob tried his best to have a calm life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As Jacob was in fellowship there he may have had many memories.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the stillness he may have thought, "I shouldn't have grabbed Esau's heel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I shouldn't have cheated Esau or my father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Also, there was no need for me to lose my mother and to flee to my uncle Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, I didn't have to love Rachel so much.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My, what trouble loving her caused me!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why was I so foolish?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I shouldn't have been cheated by Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why did I promise to work all those years to get Rachel?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During the years I was with Laban, I had to suffer the heat and the cold."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you had been Jacob, what would you have done in your retirement?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You might have said, "From now on, I simply want to lead a quiet life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There will be no more supplanting, no more heel-holding.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Esau, Laban, and Rachel are all gone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now is the time for me to be quiet and to enjoy life."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Surely Jacob must have been enjoying a calm life there in Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jacob loved Joseph more than all his other sons, and he made for him a coat of many colors v. 3 . If Jacob had not been in retirement, he would not have been able to make such a coat for Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A busy father could not spend the time to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But Jacob was enjoying life and he had plenty of time to make the coat for his favorite son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a proof that he had retired.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The mention of the coat of many colors is a little window through which we can see Jacob's character, desire, intention, goal, and disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>a The Dealings in the Last Stage</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After having had so many dealings under God's hand, Jacob was undoubtedly tired of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was weary of supplanting, cheating, struggling, and fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His life was calm and he had a favorite son who was the treasure of his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because of the partiality of his love for Joseph, he made him a coat of many colors.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Was Jacob right in doing this?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why did he not make such a coat for Reuben, the oldest, or for Benjamin, the youngest?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although Reuben had defiled himself by committing adultery with Jacob's concubine, Benjamin was the baby of the family and was too young to have done anything wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, Jacob's heart was set firstly on Joseph and secondly on Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jacob was partial.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As we shall see, Jacob's partiality toward Joseph caused him to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everything in this chapter is under the sovereign hand of God; nothing is coincidental.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, immediately after Joseph's brothers had cast him into the pit, a company of Ishmaelites appeared on the scene, and his brothers decided to sell him to them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then Joseph was taken to Egypt and sold to Potiphar, Pharaoh's chamberlain.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All this was under God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In fact, even Jacob's partiality toward Joseph was under God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In chapter thirty-seven God exercised His sovereignty to deal with this partiality so that Jacob might mature.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Prior to this chapter, Jacob was a transformed person; however, he was not yet mature.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be transformed is to be changed in our natural life, whereas to be matured is to be filled with the divine life that changes us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may be transformed in our natural life, yet not be filled with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Chapters thirty-seven through forty-five are a record of the process of Jacob's maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This process began in 37:1, and it lasted until 45:28.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the last five chapters of this book we see a Jacob who has fully matured.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Probably in all his life Jacob never suffered as much as he did in these nine chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are truly a story of Jacob's suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In these chapters we have the dealings in the last stage of Jacob's life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The sufferings he underwent here deeply touched his personal feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After these chapters, Jacob had no further dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, he was fully matured, he was filled with the divine life, and he had the expression of God and the dominion of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For God's expression and dominion there is the need of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only a mature life can bear God's image and exercise His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even in chapter thirty-seven Jacob could not bear God's image or exercise God's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although he was transformed, he was not yet mature.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His partiality toward Joseph proves that he was not mature.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This partial love was a weak point.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do not think that a transformed person cannot be partial in his love or have other weak points.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, God sovereignly placed Jacob under His hand that he might become mature.</S>
