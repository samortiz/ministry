   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This thought is not only in 1 Corinthians but also in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The tree of life is a plant.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Along with the tree of life there is a river, and this is the watering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, we have the planting and the watering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then at the flow of the river there are gold, bdellium pearl , and onyx stone, a precious stone vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>9-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The thought in 1 Corinthians 3 was there already in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The growth of the plantation produces minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, this is very scientific.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Something of the mineral life is in the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we eat the plant life, we also receive something of the mineral life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We receive minerals such as iron, salt, sulphur, and zinc.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our physical body is built up with a number of minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church is not something that is organized or formed in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is a body built up with Christ, yet this Christ is of the plant life and the mineral life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you want to know more about this, I would ask you to read The All-Inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In that book I point out a number of aspects of Christ which are typified by both the vegetable life and the mineral life see chapters five through eight, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>46-87 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is the vegetable life to us to produce all the minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The farm of God, the plantation of God, produces the precious material, gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now in the church we, the laborers of God, are planting and watering with the expectation that God's farm will produce the precious material for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ as the vine in John 15 produces the fruit for the Father's glorification v. 8 , but if we have just the fruit, we do not have the material for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot build a house with clusters of grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The plantation of God's farming is for producing gold, silver, and precious stones for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some may just want to be the fruit, which is soft and sweet, but ultimately our growth is for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have met a number of sweet saints, but there is nothing good in them for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today in God's house, God needs the hard, solid material.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You and I have to be so solid, not so soft and sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are so sweet, the building is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today in all the places, we need some hard ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The grapes are good for appreciation, but not good for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God today needs some solid material to be produced out of the growth of God's plantation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul planted, Apollos watered, and God gave the growth, not to produce fruit, but to produce gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord has to change our concept, to turn our natural understanding to His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Gold signifies God's divine nature, the nature of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Silver, in typology, signifies redemption, the redeeming work of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Precious stones are transformed material, signifying the transforming work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the work of the Triune God to produce gold, silver, and precious stones, which are the material to build up God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all need to grow in life for the transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some of the sisters among us are wild and bold.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is natural.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Other sisters are so timid.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is also natural.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to grow so that we will become so strong and solid in the Lord's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the church life all the timid sisters have to be strong, not in a natural way, but in a spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the time comes for a sister to give a testimony, her testimony should be solid.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At that time she should be so strong, solid, and hard, like a diamond.</S>
