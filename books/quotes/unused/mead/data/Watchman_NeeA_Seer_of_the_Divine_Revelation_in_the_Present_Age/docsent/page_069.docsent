   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TESTIMONY OF A WESTERN MISSIONARY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Elizabeth P. Rademacher was a missionary in Shanghai during World War II and now serves the Lord in the church in Huntington Beach, California, U.S.A. The following is her testimony regarding Watchman Nee:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Forty-eight years have elapsed since I last saw Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was February 1943, and America was at war with Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Most foreigners living in the International Settlement in Shanghai, China, were under the jurisdiction of the Japanese.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Just the evening before I was interned along with many other Americans my co-workers were British , through our gate came Watchman Nee, unannounced, as was his custom when visiting us four Westerners.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After sharing some refreshments and enjoying some sweet fellowship, he handed me a small unlabeled bottle of highly concentrated vitamins produced at CBC Laboratories with the instruction: "Take half a drop a day."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What forethought and concern for a little sister about to be confined for an undetermined period of time!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I first heard the name Watchman Nee in 1934, I knew nothing about him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I pictured an aged man with a flowing white beard!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Little did I realize that he wasn't much older than I probably at that time about thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Several years later I saw him for the first time at Hardoon Road, where, with an older missionary, I sometimes attended the Lord's table and special meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit's Indwelling</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the beginning of 1938, Watchman Nee conducted a Bible study with the church in Shanghai on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Having had a Pentecostal background, I was somewhat confused and disillusioned.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I desired to hear what he had to say, hoping to receive help on a number of puzzling questions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, why were there inconsistencies in the lives of so many who professedly had received the outpoured Spirit with manifestations?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Where was the godly living?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why did I live a defeated life?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word the Lord spoke to me through Watchman Nee made a revolutionary impact on my life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The evening I heard him say that Jesus became the Spirit to dwell in us, light dawned.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before, the Lord had seemed so far removed from me; now He was real within.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This solved my basic problem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I could now locate Him within my being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I saw further that the work of the Holy Spirit is twofold.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is the outward aspect with gifts and manifestations; but more important still, there is the inward aspect the infilling that transforms lives.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He used a helpful illustration which made an indelible impression: If a heavily loaded vehicle is run without adequate air in the tires, it is possible that the car will be wrecked.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is an apt picture of one who experiences many outpourings of the Spirit without having a commensurate work of the Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I thanked God I had not become a wreck.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now I understood why so many I had been acquainted with in the past had wound up bringing disgrace to the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On another occasion he gave his testimony concerning the girl he had loved and given up for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He quoted Psalm 73:25: "Whom have I in heaven but thee?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee," and testified that this had become his reality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This testimony amazed me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I had never heard or met anyone who could honestly make such a statement.</S>
