   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Satan Withstanding God through Mammon</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Usurping Man's Worship through Mammon</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we gain God, we have all things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the same way, when Satan takes hold of money, he has everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Money is omnipotent; everything can be bought with money.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To buy wood, stones, or any other things that we like, we need mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this way, mammon becomes the power, the center of man's worship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Is man going to worship God or mammon?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This becomes the controversy of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The worship of God lies on one side of all things, and the worship of mammon lies on the other side of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Mammon is diametrically opposed to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why can mammon withstand God?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is because it is the only thing that can unify all things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Covetousness is not only a root of all evils 1 Tim 6:10 ; it is even the same as idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Riches are an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible says that covetousness and idolatry are the same kind of sins Eph 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After a man is saved, if he has not dealt with his money in a clear way, he is not yet fully saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a person still keeps wooden or stone idols in his house, will we accept such a one for baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet, many people have never dealt with the matter of money after they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today, we say that India is a nation of idols and that there are more idols than people in that land.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet, there are countless more people today who worship mammon than people who worship idols.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From the people in Asia to those in Africa, from the scientists to the most superstitious people, everyone worships mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Mammon is the most common object of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Being Delivered from Mammon to Serve God</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God wants to gain us, and mammon also wants to gain us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Unless God's people are delivered from the power of mammon, they will not have a proper testimony and cannot be proper Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a man tries to hold on to both sides, he will not be able to serve the Lord well.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why did the Lord put such a harsh requirement upon the young ruler and ask him to sell all he had?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That young man was quite good and had kept all the laws.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the Lord said that he lacked one thing, the most important thing, which had to do with mammon Luke 18:18-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The same principle applies when Zaccheus, at his repentance, gave half of his possessions to the poor Luke 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The same principle can also be seen in Acts 4 where the disciples sold their land and possessions, and no one said that any of his possessions was his own v. 32 . By the time we come to the Epistles, we see Paul saying, "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack" 2 Cor 8:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Overcoming Mammon to Have Spiritual Power</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In church history, the Moravian church was the group that had the strongest mission.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Its founder, Count Zinzendorf, gave up all his possessions for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sister Eva also gave up all that she had.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A few decades ago, seven Englishmen came to China to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They were known as the Cambridge Seven.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Among them was C. T. Studd, who was a cricket champion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He had received an inheritance of two hundred fifty thousand pounds, which equals 1.2 million U.S. dollars, and he gave it all away.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When he told the British Consulate that he was going to China, the Consulate General was shocked by his consecration and dared not accept his application.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After a week, Mr. Studd was still firm concerning his decision.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God could use Mr. Studd in a great way because he had overcome mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Mammon stands in opposition to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason, every child of God has to overcome the power of mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If anyone does not overcome its power, he will have no spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The power of mammon does not lie in how much mammon a person possesses.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Its power on the poor may be stronger than its power on the rich.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Working Only to Sustain Our Living,</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>and Not for Making Money</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For this reason, no Christian should try to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Men think that it is wrong to make money by unrighteous means and that it is right to make money by righteous means.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But mammon itself is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Just as God Himself is righteous, in the same way mammon itself is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Luke 16 mentions making friends with the "mammon of unrighteousness" v. 9 . Money is intrinsically unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Its nature is contrary to God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to be clear about the position money occupies.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are not clear, it will be difficult for us to go on as a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christians cannot try to make money from the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do, we will lose our Christian standing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We say that our Father is over and above everything, and that we are His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Yet if such a person as we are would try to make money from the rickshaw coolies, whether it is ten thousand or twenty thousand dollars, it would be a shame to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There are only two kinds of people on this earth, the unbelievers and the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot make money from the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What then about making money from the brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Would we not feel ashamed to make money from our brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, no one can neglect dealing with money properly.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A Christian cannot make money; he can only work to sustain his living.</S>
