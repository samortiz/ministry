   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In chapters one and two, we saw the divine economy and the satanic chaos in both the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then in chapter three we saw the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all should say, "If I am a man, I have to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If I am a Christian, I have to be an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If I am an overcomer, I have to prophesy, to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If I prophesy, I have to open up my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I open up my mouth, I have to exercise my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If I open up my mouth and exercise my spirit, I speak forth Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To speak forth Christ is to exhibit Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all need to fan into flame the gift of God which is within us 2 Tim 1:6 to be those who speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not be those who are hot for only a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to be burning in spirit all the time Rom 12:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our burning should be eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to be the overcomers, we need to cooperate with the Lord to speak Him forth for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ 1 Cor 14:4b .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After seeing the revelation concerning the overcomers, we saw the truth concerning God's economy in chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this chapter we want to see the church life in God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The preceding chapters in this book are all directed toward this goal --the church life in God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE STANDING OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many have opposed us because of our stand for the truth that there should be only one church in a locality Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev 1:11 as a local expression of the one Body in the universe Eph 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are many so-called churches today, and it seems that people feel the freedom to start a church in the same way that someone would feel the freedom to open a restaurant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But we need to practice the church life according to God's way as revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Acts 8:1 speaks of the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that time there were thousands of believers in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the day of Pentecost, three thousand were added to the church there 2:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later, five thousand more were added 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, James told Paul that there were tens of thousands of believers in the city of Jerusalem 21:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to Acts 8:1 these myriads of believers were the one church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regardless of how many believers there are in a city, they are still the one church in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the church life spread to Antioch, the believers there met as the church in Antioch 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Revelation 1:11 says, "What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John was told to send what he wrote to the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To the seven churches equals to seven cities --to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first to, to the seven churches, equals the seven tos, to the seven cities.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that a church in a certain city should be equal to that city.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The practice of the church life in the early days was the practice of having one church for one city, one city with only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we say that we are the church in a certain locality, such as the church in Los Angeles, this is not a name but a description of a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are just the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church does not have a name just as the moon does not have a name.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once in the Far East, someone was so impressed with the United States that he said even the moon was bigger there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But there is no such thing as an American moon or a Chinese moon.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Just as there is one moon, there is only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the moon appears in London, it is the moon in London; when it appears in Los Angeles, it is the moon in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Regardless of where the moon appears, it is still the same moon.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just as there is the moon in Los Angeles and the moon in London, there is the church in Los Angeles and the church in London.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is one church, and this church is manifested or expressed in different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the degraded situation today, however, there are many so-called churches.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are churches denominated according to race, such as Chinese churches and Korean churches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is an Anglican church, an Episcopalian church, in Anaheim, and there are churches representing Taiwan in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are also churches named after the street on which they meet.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This shows us the situation of division and confusion today.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even the unbelievers wonder why there are so many divisions among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They may ask, "Since you all have the same Christ and read the same Bible, why are there so many different denominations?"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I grew up in a city called Chefoo in mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I was educated there and worked there.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At a certain point, I gave up my job to serve the Lord full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Within a short period of time, the Lord used me to gain a number of people, and I spoke the truth to them concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There were a number of missionaries in Chefoo at that time, and they were surprised that my preaching was attracting so many people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They were also concerned about my speaking regarding the church being one and the denominations being divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I used the illustration of the moon as I did above, pointing out that there is only one church, one Body, expressed in different cities.</S>
