OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(14)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall begin to consider Christ&rsquo;s person in the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">N. IN THE FULFILLMENT<br />
OF THE OLD TESTAMENT PROPHECIES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Creator Who Remains Unchanged<br />
and Whose Years Shall Not Fail</h2>
<p>Psalm 102:25-27 prophesies that Christ as the Creator of the universe will remain unchanged and that His years will not fail. These verses from Psalm 102 are concerned with the eternity of Christ. He is the eternal One, the very God, from eternity to eternity, the everlasting One, who will never change. The fulfillment of this prophecy concerning Christ is in Hebrews 1:10-12. In this fulfillment we see that Christ is the Creator. As the Creator He existed before creation. Hebrews 1:11 indicates that the old creation will be terminated and that the new heaven and the new earth will be ushered in. But Christ will be the same, and His years will not fail (v. 12). This means that He will be the everlasting One in eternity. He will remain forever and ever in eternity future.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The Seed of the Woman</h2>
<p>In Genesis 3:15 we have a prophecy regarding Christ as the seed of the woman: &ldquo;I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.&rdquo; This prophecy was given immediately after the fall of man, when Adam and Eve were in fear and trembling concerning their destiny. God came in to promise that the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent who had damaged them. In Galatians 4:4 we have the fulfillment of this prophecy: &ldquo;When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law.&rdquo; The woman here is, of course, the virgin Mary (Luke 1:27-35). The Son of God came of her to be the seed of woman, as promised in Genesis 3:15. The Lord Jesus, the seed of the woman, bruised the head of the serpent. As revealed in Hebrews 2:14 and 1 John 3:8, He destroyed the Devil, the one who has the power of death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. The Seed of Abraham</h2>
<p>Christ is also the seed of Abraham. This is prophesied in Genesis 17:8 and fulfilled in Galatians 3:16: &ldquo;But to Abraham were the promises spoken and to his seed. He does not say, And to the seeds, as concerning many, but as concerning one, And to your seed, who is Christ.&rdquo; Christ is the seed, and the seed is the heir who inherits the promises. Here Christ is the unique seed inheriting the promises. In order to inherit the promised blessing we must be one with Christ. Outside of Him we cannot inherit the promises given by God to Abraham. In the sight of God Abraham has only one seed, that is, Christ. We must be in Him so that we may participate in the promises given to Abraham. Christ is not only the seed inheriting the promises but also the blessing of the promises for inheritance.</p>
<h2 class="head2">4. The Lion of Judah</h2>
<p>In the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies Christ is the Lion of Judah. Because a seed is a container of life, as the seed of woman and the seed of Abraham, Christ is for the dispensing of life and the propagating of life. But as the Lion of Judah, Christ has won the victory over all enemies. On the one hand, Christ is the seed of Abraham; on the other hand, He is the Lion of Judah, a royal tribe from which Christ came to be the King. As the Lion of Judah Christ has conquered the enemy.</p>
<p>The prophecy concerning Christ as the Lion of Judah is found in Genesis 49:9: &ldquo;Judah is a young lion: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he couches, he lies down as a lion&rdquo; (lit.). The prophecy in this verse likens Christ to a young lion and to a couching lion. The young lion is for fighting, for seizing the prey. The words &ldquo;thou art gone up&rdquo; imply that the young lion first had to come down from the mountain to the plain to capture his prey. After the young lion seized his prey, he went up to the mountaintop again to enjoy it. When Christ was crucified, He was a young lion seizing the prey. After seizing His prey, Christ went up to the &ldquo;mountaintop,&rdquo; that is, to the third heaven. Ephesians 4:8 says that when Christ ascended up on high, He led a train of vanquished foes. Christ has gained the victory. As a young lion He has overcome all His enemies.</p>
<p>The New Testament reveals that Christ came as a young lion, that He went to the cross to seize His prey, and that now He is on the mountaintop in the third heaven. The figure of the couching lion in Genesis 49:9 portrays Christ as the One enjoying His rest in the heavens. After gaining the victory and enjoying the prey, He was satisfied, and now He is resting in the heavens.</p>
<p>The fulfillment of the prophecy in Genesis 49:9 is in Revelation 5:5: &ldquo;One of the elders said to me, Do not weep; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals.&rdquo; This refers to Genesis 49:9, where Christ is portrayed as a lion, which is a symbol of Him as a strong fighter against the enemy. Christ is the fighting, victorious, and overcoming Lion. His overcoming qualifies Him to open the scroll (Rev. 5:1) and its seven seals. As the Lion of Judah, Christ has overcome Satan, the enemy of God. He has solved this problem for God and has removed the hindrances to the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose. Therefore, He is worthy to open the scroll concerning God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>In the universe there are two main problems&mdash;Satan and sin. As the Lion Christ has defeated and destroyed Satan, and as the Lamb He has taken away our sin (John 1:29). He has won the victory, and He has accomplished redemption. As the Lion He is the Fighter against the enemy; as the Lamb He is our Redeemer. He has fought to redeem us. He has won the battle over the enemy and has accomplished redemption for us. Revelation 5:5 does not say that Christ will overcome; on the contrary, this verse says that He has overcome already. As the fighting Lion He overcame the enemy, and now He is in the heavens.</p><h2 class="head2">5. The Root of David</h2>
<p>As the fulfillment of Isaiah 11:10, Christ in Revelation 5:5 is called &ldquo;the Root of David.&rdquo; This title (He is also the Root of David&rsquo;s father Jesse, Isa. 11:1) signifies that Christ is the source of David. Therefore, as his forefather in the flesh, David called Him &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; (Matt. 22:42-45).</p>
<p>As we shall see, Christ in His humanity was a descendant of David and was born of David. But Revelation 5:5 says that Christ is the Root of David, meaning that David grows out of Christ. The Bible also says that Christ is the Branch of David (Jer. 23:5). Hence, Christ is both the root and the branch. In Isaiah 11:1 and 10 we see that Christ is also a branch and a root of Jesse.</p>
<p>We have seen that Christ is both the Root of David and a descendant of David. In the sight of God David was the unique person in the Old Testament who fought the battle and gained authority, fighting the battle for God and gaining His authority. The fact that Christ is the Root of David means that He is greater than David. This is the reason He holds the key of David (Rev. 3:7). Whatever David was and whatever he had and did were altogether out of this root. Therefore, as the Root of David Christ is more powerful and victorious than David and has God&rsquo;s authority in full.</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. The Seed of David</h2>
<p>Christ is not only the Root of David but also the seed of David. In 2 Samuel 7:12 and 13 is a prophecy regarding Christ as the seed of David: &ldquo;I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.&rdquo; The fulfillment of this prophecy is found in Romans 1:3: &ldquo;Concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh.&rdquo; This verse speaks of Christ&rsquo;s humanity, His human nature, saying that He was born out of the seed of David according to the flesh. Christ, therefore, is both the source of David and the issue of David. On the one hand, David came out of Him; on the other hand, He came out of David. In this we see the all-inclusiveness of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">7. God Whose Throne Is Forever and Ever<br />
and the Scepter of Whose Kingdom Is Uprightness,<br />
and the One Whose God Has Anointed Him<br />
with the Oil of Exultant Joy above His Partners</h2>
<p>In Psalm 45:6 we have the following prophecy concerning Christ: &ldquo;Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter.&rdquo; In Hebrews 1:8 this word is applied to Christ, the Son: &ldquo;As to the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.&rdquo; This reveals that Christ, the Son, is God Himself. Furthermore, He has an eternal throne, and the authority, the scepter of His kingdom, is a right scepter. This refers to Christ&rsquo;s reigning in the kingdom. He is God Himself, and He will be the King in the millennium reigning over the entire earth.</p>
<p>Psalm 45:7 goes on to prophesy further of Christ: &ldquo;Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.&rdquo; The fulfillment of this prophecy is in Hebrews 1:9. Righteousness represents what is related to God, and lawlessness represents what is related to Satan, the wicked one. For Christ to love righteousness and hate lawlessness means that He loves the things related to God and hates the things related to Satan. Christ loves God and hates Satan.</p>
<p>Because Christ loves righteousness and hates lawlessness, God, even His God, has anointed Him. In Hebrews 1:8 and 9 &ldquo;O God&#133;Your God&rdquo; refer to the Son. Since the Son is God Himself, He is God; therefore, verse 8 says, &ldquo;O God.&rdquo; Since the Son is also a man, God is His God; therefore, verse 9 says, &ldquo;Your God.&rdquo; Christ, the very God, has been anointed by God. He is the One whose God has anointed Him with the oil of exultant joy.</p>
<p>According to Hebrews 1:9, God has anointed Christ with the oil of exultant joy above Christ&rsquo;s partners. This verse does not mean that Christ&rsquo;s partners are not anointed; rather, it means that they are anointed under Him. We are Christ&rsquo;s anointed partners. He is anointed above us, and we are anointed under Him. He is the anointed One, and we are the anointed ones.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s economy Christ is God&rsquo;s appointed One to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan, and we are Christ&rsquo;s partners in the divine interest. He was anointed by God, and we share with Him in this anointing for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose. We are partners of Christ, sharing with Him the spiritual anointing, even as the members of the Body share the Spirit with the Head.</p><h2 class="head2">8. A Child Born to Us</h2>
<p>In the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies Christ is also the child born to us. Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;Unto us a child is born.&rdquo; Luke 2:11-12, the fulfillment of this prophecy, says, &ldquo;A Savior was born to you today in David&rsquo;s city, who is Christ the Lord. And this is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.&rdquo; This little baby is called the mighty God in the prophecy concerning Him in Isaiah 9:6.</p>
<h2 class="head2">9. Emmanuel Born of a Virgin</h2>
<p>Isaiah 7:14 prophesies, &ldquo;Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel.&rdquo; The fulfillment of this prophecy is found in Matthew 1:23. Emmanuel, meaning &ldquo;God with us,&rdquo; was the name called by man, not the name given by God. Christ is God with us. God is He, and He is God incarnated to dwell among us (John 1:14). He is not only God&mdash;He is God with us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">10. The Christ Born at Bethlehem</h2>
<p>Micah 5:2 says, &ldquo;But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel.&rdquo; This prophecy is fulfilled in Matthew 2:4-6: &ldquo;And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born. And they said to him, in Bethlehem of Judea, for so it has been written by the prophet: And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the governors of Judah; for out of you shall come forth a Ruler who will shepherd My people Israel.&rdquo; Mary conceived a child in Nazareth (Luke 1:26-27, 31). But according to the prophecy, Christ had to be born in Bethlehem. Under God&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement, Caesar Augustus ordered a census (Luke 2:1-7). This made it necessary for all the people to return to their native places. Mary and Joseph, in particular, were forced to return to Bethlehem, their home town. Immediately after they arrived in Bethlehem, the child Jesus was born in fulfillment of the prophecy in Micah 5:2.</p>
<h2 class="head2">11. As the Newborn Christ Fleeing to Egypt<br />
and Escaping to Galilee to Dwell in Nazareth</h2>
<p>The report of Christ&rsquo;s birth aroused the hatred and jealousy of King Herod, who was angered that a kingly child had been born. Then Joseph received guidance in a dream to take the child Jesus to Egypt (Matt. 2:13-15). This enabled God to fulfill the prophecy of Hosea 11:1 that Christ would be called out of Egypt. Without the trouble that occurred after the birth of Christ in Bethlehem, there would have been no occasion for Him to be taken to Egypt by Joseph.</p>
<p>After Herod died, Joseph received word in another dream to return to the land of Israel (Matt. 2:19-20). When Joseph returned and learned that Archelaus, the son of Herod, was in power, he was afraid to remain in the territory around Bethlehem. &ldquo;Being warned in a dream, he departed into the parts of Galilee, and came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, He shall be called a Nazarene&rdquo; (vv. 22-23). Christ was born in the esteemed town of Bethlehem, but He grew up in the despised city of Nazareth. The flight to Egypt and the escape to Galilee to dwell in Nazareth were fulfillments of Old Testament prophecies concerning Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">12. A Root out of a Dry Ground,<br />
Having No Form nor Comeliness</h2>
<p>Prophesying of Christ, Isaiah 53:2 says, &ldquo;He shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.&rdquo; This word is fulfilled in 2 Corinthians 8:9b and Matthew 13:55-57. In the Gospels we see that Christ grew up like a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground. He was raised in the home of a poor carpenter in the despised town of Nazareth and in the despised province of Galilee. This was the fulfillment of the dry ground in Isaiah.</p>
<p>The Lord had no form or comeliness, no physical beauty, that He should be desired. Rather, He was despised and rejected by men. He did not have any form or comeliness that would cause others to appreciate Him.</p>
<p>In this message we have covered twelve aspects of Christ in the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies. In the fulfillment of these prophecies we see Christ in both His divinity and His humanity. He is the very God, the Creator who will remain unchanged forever and ever. Nevertheless, He was anointed by God. This One who is God the Creator was born of a virgin to be a child. As such, He is Emmanuel. In this divine title we can see both God and man, for Emmanuel means God with us.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s human living began with suffering. Shortly after He was born, it was necessary for Him to escape to Egypt. In this way He became a refugee. After fleeing to Egypt, a condemned country, He was brought back to the land of Israel. Because it was not safe to stay in Bethlehem, He was taken to Galilee, to the despised city of Nazareth, where He grew up in a poor family as a root out of dry ground. Although He was the God-man, having divinity and humanity, He grew up in a poor family and had no form or comeliness that He should be desired.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(15)</h1>
<p>In the foregoing message we saw that in the fulfillment of certain Old Testament prophecies Christ is both God and man. Christ is the God-man for the purpose of bringing God into man. As the God-man, He has prepared the way for God to dispense Himself through humanity into His chosen people. If we have an inclusive view concerning Christ as the One who is both God and man, we shall see that He, the very God, became a man so that God may have a way to dispense Himself into us. For this dispensing it was necessary for Christ to carry out His ministry. Let us now consider some prophecies related to Christ&rsquo;s ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">13. The Lord before Whom Elijah Came<br />
to Prepare His Way</h2>
<p>In His ministry Christ is the Lord before whom Elijah came to prepare His way. This is prophesied in Malachi 4:5 and 6: &ldquo;Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.&rdquo; This word is fulfilled in Matthew 3:1-3 and 17:10-13. Malachi 4:5 prophesied that Elijah would come. When John the Baptist was conceived, it was said that he would go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah (Luke 1:17). Hence, John may be considered &ldquo;Elijah, who is about to come&rdquo; (Matt. 11:14).</p>
<p>According to Matthew 3:3, John the Baptist was sent to prepare the way of the Lord, to make His paths straight. This was to change the mind of the people, to turn their mind to the Lord and to make their heart right, to cause every part and avenue of their heart to be straightened by the Lord through repentance for the kingdom (Luke 1:16-17). John the Baptist prepared the way so that Christ could come to dispense God into all those who would be called by Him.</p>
<p>In Matthew 17:10 some of the Lord&rsquo;s disciples asked Him, &ldquo;Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?&rdquo; The matter of Elijah coming first is according to Malachi 4:5-6. In Matthew 17:11 the Lord replied, &ldquo;Elijah indeed is coming and will restore all things.&rdquo; This will be fulfilled at the time of the great tribulation, when Elijah will be one of the two witnesses (Rev. 11:3-4). In Matthew 17:12 the Lord continued, &ldquo;But I say to you that Elijah already came, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wished.&rdquo; This refers to John the Baptist (Matt. 17:13), who came in the spirit and power of Elijah (Luke 1:13-17) and was rejected (Matt. 11:18) and beheaded (Matt. 14:3-12). On the one hand, Elijah has come; on the other hand, he has not yet come in full. John the Baptist was Elijah, but he was not Elijah in full. The full coming of Elijah will take place in the future.</p>
<p>In the Bible the fulfillment of prophecy is often like this. First there is a partial fulfillment, then the complete fulfillment. In His ministry Christ was the One before whom Elijah came to prepare His way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">14. The Lord&rsquo;s Anointed to Bring Good News<br />
 to the Poor and to Proclaim the Lord&rsquo;s Jubilee</h2>
<p>Isaiah 61:1-2a says, &ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.&rdquo; This is a prophecy of Christ being the Lord&rsquo;s Anointed to bring good news to the poor and to proclaim the Lord&rsquo;s jubilee. This prophecy is fulfilled in Luke 4:18-19. The Lord came to Nazareth where He had been brought up. According to His custom, He entered on the Sabbath day into the synagogue and stood up to read. The book, the scroll of the prophet Isaiah, was handed to Him. He opened the scroll and found the place where it was written concerning Him as the One anointed to bring good news to the poor and to proclaim the jubilee. After reading this portion, He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. Then He declared, &ldquo;Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your ears&rdquo; (Luke 4:21).</p>
<p>The Spirit of the Lord was upon Christ because God had anointed Him to bring good news to the poor. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;bring good news&rdquo; in Luke 4:18 is <em>euaggelizo,</em>which means to evangelize, to announce good news. To preach the gospel was the first commission of the Lord as God&rsquo;s anointed One, the Messiah. The good news was to be preached to the poor, that is, to the poor in heavenly, spiritual, and divine things (Luke 12:21; Rev. 3:17; see Matt. 5:3).</p>
<p>Luke 4:18 speaks of captives, the blind, and those who are oppressed. The captives are prisoners of war, as exiles and prisoners under Satan&rsquo;s bondage (Isa. 42:7). The blind include those who are physically and spiritually blind (Zeph. 1:17; John 9:39-41; 1 John 2:11; Rev. 3:17). Recovery of sight is related to release from the power of Satan (Acts 26:18). The Greek word translated &ldquo;oppressed&rdquo; comes from a verb meaning to break in pieces (Matt. 12:20). Those who are oppressed are those oppressed under Satan in sickness or in sin (Luke 13:11-13; John 8:34).</p>
<p>In Luke 4:19 we see that Christ was anointed to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. This acceptable year is the New Testament age typified by the year of jubilee (Lev. 25:8-17), the time when God would accept the returned captives of sin (Isa. 49:8; 2 Cor. 6:2) and when the oppressed under the bondage of sin would enjoy the release of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>In Luke 4:18 and 19 Christ proclaims the jubilee of grace. The term &ldquo;the acceptable year of the Lord&rdquo; denotes the jubilee described in Leviticus 25. According to this chapter, the year of jubilee was a time when slaves were released and property was returned to the rightful owners. Hence, the year of jubilee was a year of release, freedom, and return of lost property. Those who had been sold into slavery were released during the year of jubilee.</p>
<p>Every Israelite was allotted a portion of the good land, which typifies Christ. Therefore, to lose one&rsquo;s right to the good land is to lose the right to enjoy Christ. Every fallen human being has lost the right to enjoy God as the tree of life and the right to enjoy Christ as the good land. Furthermore, every fallen one has sold himself to sin, the world, and Satan. All fallen people, therefore, have lost their right to enjoy Christ and have sold themselves to negative things. But the year of jubilee indicates that we can be released from bondage and recover the right to enjoy Christ as our portion. At the start of His ministry Christ declared the jubilee, the acceptable year of the Lord. This indicates that the entire New Testament age is actually a single year, the year of jubilee, the year for Jehovah to accept fallen human beings.</p>
<p>The proclamation of the jubilee is the real gospel, the rich and whole gospel. A partial gospel tells people that they are sinners destined for hell, but Jesus loved them and died on the cross for them, and that if they believe in Him they will have eternal life. This is only a part of the jubilee. The jubilee is a proclamation of release from slavery and of the recovery of our spiritual birthright. In the jubilee we are recovered to the enjoyment of the Triune God as our portion. Our birthright, which had been lost, has been recovered in the New Testament jubilee. In the jubilee we are also released from bondage. Once we were captives, but we have been released from slavery and brought back to the freedom of the glory of the children of God.</p>
<p>According to Leviticus 25, in the year of jubilee everyone was restored to his original condition. Since the New Testament age is the real year of jubilee, this means that God will restore us to our original condition. In Adam we became lost, and we sold ourselves to sin as slaves. But Christ has come and has brought in the acceptable year of the Lord. This acceptable year is, in the New Testament, the fulfillment of the Old Testament jubilee. In this year we are released, and our lost birthright is recovered, redeemed, and restored.</p><h2 class="head2">15. A Great Light Springing Up<br />
to the People Sitting in Darkness<br />
and the Shadow of Death</h2>
<p>Isaiah 9:2 prophesies, &ldquo;The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.&rdquo; This prophecy is fulfilled in Matthew 4:15 and 16. When Christ came to people, He came as a great light. Peter, Andrew, James, and John did not realize that they were in darkness as they were working by the Sea of Galilee to make a living. They did not know that they were in the shadow of death. As Peter and Andrew were casting their nets into the sea, Christ as the great light shined upon them.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s ministry did not begin with earthly power&mdash;it began with heavenly light. This light is Christ Himself as the light of life, shining in the shadow of death. When the Lord began His ministry as light, He made no display of power or authority. Rather, He walked by the seashore as a common person. But when He came to those four disciples by the Sea of Galilee, He shined upon them with a great light, shining in the darkness and in the region of the shadow of death. At that juncture, Peter, Andrew, James, and John were enlightened, attracted, and captured. Immediately they forsook their jobs and followed the Lord.</p>
<p>In Matthew 4 there is no record, as in Luke 5, of any miracle being done by the Lord when Peter was called. In Matthew 4 there is the great light that attracted the first disciples. This attraction did not come from what the Lord Jesus did; it came from what He was. He was a great light with the power to attract people and capture them. In this way He attracted and captured the first four disciples. Peter, Andrew, James, and John were attracted and captured at the seashore not by seeing what the Lord did, but by realizing what the Lord was. Because they had been attracted and captured, they became faithful followers of the Lord Jesus unto the end.</p>
<h2 class="head2">16. The One Whose Zeal for<br />
God&rsquo;s House Devoured Him</h2>
<p>Psalm 69:9a says, &ldquo;The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.&rdquo; This word was fulfilled at the time Christ cleansed the temple, the house of God (John 2:12-17). After the Lord cleansed the temple, &ldquo;His disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of Your house shall devour Me&rdquo; (John 2:17). Within the Lord Jesus there was a zeal for the house of God. This zeal devoured Him, ate Him up, consumed Him. He was absolutely for the Father&rsquo;s house. The Father&rsquo;s house was His heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>When the Lord saw the corrupted situation in the temple, He could not tolerate it, but cleansed it, even with a whip. He was driven by zeal for His Father&rsquo;s house to drive all the defilement out of it. His heart was pure for the Father. He could not bear to see that the temple, His Father&rsquo;s house, was contaminated by the things of man&rsquo;s greed. Therefore, in His zeal, He cleansed the temple.</p>
<h2 class="head2">17. A Prophet Raised Up by God</h2>
<p>In the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies Christ is also the Prophet raised up by God. The prophecy concerning this is in Deuteronomy 18:15, 18-19, and the fulfillment is in John 1:45 and Acts 3:22-23. Christ was not only the One who proclaimed God&rsquo;s jubilee, and He was not merely a light shining in darkness. Furthermore, He was not only the One whose zeal for God&rsquo;s house devoured Him. The Lord was also a Prophet to speak forth God and to predict many things concerning God&rsquo;s economy. Some of Christ&rsquo;s speaking recorded in the Gospels is the speaking forth of God. Some of His speaking in the Gospels includes predictions concerning God&rsquo;s economy, especially concerning the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy. In His ministry Christ surely was a great Prophet.</p>
<h2 class="head2">18. Jehovah&rsquo;s Servant, Not Striving nor Crying Out,<br />
Not Breaking a Bruised Reed nor<br />
Quenching the Smoking Flax</h2>
<p>Isaiah 42:1-3 prophesies that in His ministry, His service, Christ would be Jehovah&rsquo;s Servant, not striving nor crying out, not breaking a bruised reed nor quenching the smoking flax. This prophecy is fulfilled in Matthew 12:17-21. Matthew 12:19 says of Christ, &ldquo;He shall not strive nor cry out, nor shall anyone hear His voice in the streets.&rdquo; In His ministry the Lord did not strive with others, and He did not promote Himself. He did not seek to make Himself known to people on the streets. He had no fame, and He made no name for Himself. In a sense He was very hidden. When the Lord Jesus was living on earth, He never made Himself great. Rather, He always kept Himself small. We should be hidden and concealed all the time as Christians. If we would enjoy Christ, we should remain small, concealed, and hidden.</p>
<p>Matthew 12:20 goes on to say, in fulfillment of Isaiah 42:3, &ldquo;A bruised reed He shall not break, and smoking flax He shall not quench.&rdquo; Not only did Christ make no noise in the streets; He did not break a bruised reed nor quench a smoking flax. This indicates that He was full of mercy. The Jews often made flutes of reeds. When a reed was bruised and no longer useful as a musical instrument, they broke it. They also made torches of flax to burn with oil. The oil ran out, the flax smoked, and they quenched it. Some of the Lord&rsquo;s people are like a bruised reed that cannot give a musical sound; others are like smoking flax that cannot give a shining light. Yet the Lord will not &ldquo;break&rdquo; the bruised ones who cannot give a musical sound, nor &ldquo;quench&rdquo; the ones like dimly burning flax that cannot give a shining light.</p>
<h2 class="head2">19. A Man of Sorrows Despised<br />
and Rejected of Men</h2>
<p>Christ was also a man of sorrows despised and rejected of men (Isa. 53:3; Psa. 22:6-7; Luke 22:28; 23:11; Matt. 27:39). He was not a man of enjoyment, happiness, or blessing. As we consider Isaiah 53, Psalm 22, Luke 22, and Matthew 27, we see a portrait of Christ as a despised man of sorrows.</p>
<h2 class="head2">20. The One Willing to Be Humiliated</h2>
<p>Isaiah 50:6 prophesies of Christ as the One willing to be humiliated: &ldquo;I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.&rdquo; This word is fulfilled in Matthew 26:67: &ldquo;They spit in His face and beat Him with their fists, and they slapped Him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">21. The One upon Whom Fell<br />
the Reproaches of Those Who Reproached God</h2>
<p>According to Psalm 69:9b, the reproaches of those who reproached God would fall upon Christ: &ldquo;The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.&rdquo; Christ suffered not only for us but even for God. He suffered as God&rsquo;s Substitute, for the reproaches of those who reproached God fell upon Christ. Hence, Christ was not only our Substitute bearing our problems, but was also God&rsquo;s Substitute bearing God&rsquo;s problems. In Romans 15:3 Paul quotes the prophecy in Psalm 69:9b in order to encourage the saints to bear the problems of others just as Christ bore God&rsquo;s problems.</p>
<p>If you consider the matters we have covered thus far concerning the person of Christ in the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies, you will see a portrait of who Christ is and what He is. All these matters are related to Christ&rsquo;s coming to dispense God into His chosen people. Every aspect of Christ&rsquo;s person prophesied in the Old Testament and fulfilled in the New is for this purpose.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">(16)</h1>
<h2 class="head2">22. The One Who Bore Our Griefs (Infirmities) and Carried Our Sorrows (Diseases)</h2>
<p>Isaiah 53:4 says, &ldquo;Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.&rdquo; This prophecy is fulfilled in Matthew 8:17: &ldquo;In order that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, He Himself took our infirmities and bore our diseases.&rdquo; All healings accomplished on fallen people are due to the Lord&rsquo;s redemption. He took our infirmities and bore our diseases on His cross and accomplished full healing for us there. However, the application of healing by divine power can only be a foretaste in this age; the full taste will be accomplished in the coming age.</p>
<h2 class="head2">23. The Meek King Mounting a Donkey&rsquo;s Colt<br />
and Entering Jerusalem Triumphantly,<br />
to Whom the Crowds Cried, Blessed Is He<br />
Who Comes in the Name of the Lord</h2>
<p>In Isaiah 62:11, Zechariah 9:9, and Psalm 118:26 we have the prophecy concerning Christ as the meek King mounting a donkey&rsquo;s colt and entering Jerusalem triumphantly, to whom the crowds cried, &ldquo;Blessed be He that cometh in the name of the Lord.&rdquo; The fulfillment of this prophecy is in Matthew 21:4-10. This prophecy is actually related to Christ&rsquo;s death. The Lord purposely went back to Jerusalem not to minister but to present Himself as the Lamb of God to be crucified. Therefore, His mounting a donkey&rsquo;s colt and entering Jerusalem triumphantly was for His wonderful, all-inclusive death.</p>
<p>Matthew 21:4 and 5 say, &ldquo;Now this took place that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King is coming to you, meek and mounted on a donkey and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.&rdquo; The way the King came into Jerusalem fulfilled the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9. The term &ldquo;daughter of Zion&rdquo; refers to the people of Jerusalem (cf. Psa. 137:8; 45:12). This prophecy was being fulfilled to them.</p>
<p>Matthew 21:6-8 continues, &ldquo;And the disciples went and did as Jesus directed them, and led the donkey and the colt and put their garments on them, and He sat on them. And most of the crowd spread their own garments in the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them in the road.&rdquo; Garments signify the human virtues of people&rsquo;s conduct. The disciples honored the lowly King by putting their garments on the donkey and colt for Him to ride on, and the crowd honored Him by spreading their garments in the road for Him to pass through. The people honored the Lord with their clothing, that is, with whatever they had.</p>
<p>In verse 8 we are told that others cut branches from the trees and spread them in the road. These were branches of the palm tree (John 12:13), signifying the victorious life (Rev. 7:9) and the satisfaction of enjoying the rich produce of this life as typified by the feast of tabernacles (Lev. 23:40; Neh. 8:15). The crowd used both their garments and the palm tree branches to celebrate the coming of the lowly King. A palm tree is rooted deeply in hidden springs and grows prevailingly upward into the air. This signifies the victorious life. In honoring the meek King with whatever they were, the people recognized that He was the One with the victorious life.</p>
<p>According to Matthew 21:9, &ldquo;The crowds who went before Him and those who followed cried out, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest!&rdquo; The Hebrew word hosanna means &ldquo;save now&rdquo; (Psa. 118:25). The title &ldquo;The Son of David&rdquo; was the royal title of the lowly King. In the warm welcome of the King, the people shouted out a quotation from Psalm 118:26: &ldquo;Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.&rdquo; According to Psalm 118, only the One who came in the name of the Lord was qualified to be praised in such a way. Thus, the spontaneous praise of the people sovereignly indicated that this meek King came not in His own name but in the name of Jehovah. Those who welcomed the King indicated through their praise that He was the One sent by the Lord, thus the One who came in the name of the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">24. The One Praised by the Babes and Sucklings</h2>
<p>In Psalm 8:2 we have the prophecy that Christ would be the One praised by babes and sucklings. As the fulfillment of this prophecy, Matthew 21:16 says, &ldquo;And said to Him, Do you hear what these are saying? And Jesus says to them, Yes; have you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings You have perfected praise?&rdquo; At the time of Matthew 21, Christ was warmly welcomed and exalted, and He was praised even by babes.</p>
<h2 class="head2">25. The One Who Comes to Do God&rsquo;s Will</h2>
<p>Prophesying that Christ would come to do the will of God, Psalm 40:6-8 says, &ldquo;Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.&rdquo; Hebrews 10:5-8 is the fulfillment of this prophecy. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;Wherefore, coming into the world, He says, Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me.&rdquo; All the sacrifices offered according to the law were a shadow of Christ. At the fullness of time, Christ came with a body of blood and flesh to replace the sacrifices of the law. In the flesh He offered Himself to God once for all to take away sins.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:7, 9, and 10 tell us that it was the will of God to take away the first, the animal sacrifices of the Old Testament, so that the second, the sacrifice of Christ of the New Testament, might be established to replace the sacrifices of the Old Testament. Christ, as the real sacrifice for sin which has taken away sins, has sanctified us through the offering of His body once for all (v. 10).</p>
<p>The Triune God determined in His divine plan in eternity past that the second of the divine Trinity should be incarnated and die on the cross to accomplish His eternal redemption for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose (Eph. 1:7-9). Hence, the second of the divine Trinity was ordained to be the Lamb of God (John 1:29) before the foundation of the world, that is, in eternity past (1 Pet. 1:19-20). In the sight of God, Christ as the Lamb of God was slain from the foundation of the world, that is, from the existence of God&rsquo;s fallen creatures (Rev. 13:8). From the time of man&rsquo;s fall, lambs, sheep, calves, and bulls were used for God&rsquo;s chosen people as types (Gen. 3:21; 4:4; 8:20; 22:13; Exo. 12:3-8; Lev. 1:2), pointing to Christ who was to come as the real Lamb foreordained by God. In the fullness of time the Triune God sent the second of the divine Trinity, the Son of God, to come in incarnation to take a human body (Heb. 10:5) so that He might be offered to God on the cross (Heb. 9:14; 10:12) to do the will of the Triune God (Heb. 10:7), that is, to replace the sacrifices and offerings, which were types, with Himself in His humanity as the unique sacrifice and offering for the sanctification of God&rsquo;s chosen people (Heb. 10:9-10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">26. The One Betrayed by His Friend<br />
Who Sold Him for Thirty Pieces of Silver</h2>
<p>In the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies Christ is the One betrayed by His friend, who sold Him for thirty pieces of silver. Psalm 41:9 says, &ldquo;Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.&rdquo; This verse was fulfilled at the time the Lord Jesus washed His disciples&rsquo; feet. John 13:18 says, &ldquo;I do not speak concerning all of you; for I know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.&rdquo; This refers to the betrayal of the Lord by Judas. Another verse related to the fulfillment of this prophecy is Mark 14:18: &ldquo;As they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, Truly I tell you that one of you will deliver Me up, one who is eating with Me.&rdquo; The Lord spoke this word as He and the disciples were eating of the Passover feast.</p>
<p>Zechariah 11:12 prophesies that the one who would betray the Lord would sell Him for thirty pieces of silver: &ldquo;I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.&rdquo; According to Exodus 21:32, a slave was priced at thirty pieces of silver. Christ was priced as a slave, and Judas betrayed Him for this price, selling Him for thirty pieces of silver. In Matthew 26:15 Judas asked the chief priests, &ldquo;What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver Him to you? And they weighed out to him thirty pieces of silver.&rdquo; This clearly is the fulfillment of the prophecy in Zechariah 11:12.</p><h2 class="head2">27. The Smitten Shepherd</h2>
<p>Zechariah 13:7 prophesies concerning Christ as the smitten shepherd: &ldquo;Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.&rdquo; This verse speaks of a man who is the Lord&rsquo;s fellow, the companion of the Lord of hosts. This man is Christ, for He is equal to God as His fellow. When Christ came as a man to be the Shepherd, He was rejected, betrayed, and sold for thirty pieces of silver. However, not only was He rejected and betrayed by men, but He was even smitten by God. Christ was sold for thirty pieces of silver by men, but following that He was smitten on the cross by God Himself.</p>
<p>The fulfillment of Zechariah 13:7 is found in Matthew 26:31: &ldquo;Then Jesus says to them, You will all be stumbled in Me this night, for it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.&rdquo; This verse is part of a warning given by the Lord to His disciples. The Lord was the Shepherd, and the disciples were the sheep who were to be scattered. However, all the disciples said that they would not deny Him. All, especially Peter, had the assurance and the confidence that they would follow the Lord to the end, no matter what the pathway might be. Eventually, what they did was the reverse (Matt. 26:56b, 69-75).</p>
<h2 class="head2">28. As a Lamb Brought to the Slaughter<br />
and as a Sheep Dumb before Its Shearers</h2>
<p>Isaiah 53:7 says, &ldquo;He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.&rdquo; This prophecy is fulfilled in Matthew 26:62 and 63a: &ldquo;The high priest stood up and said to Him, Do you answer nothing? What are these testifying against you? But Jesus remained silent.&rdquo; The Lord, standing before the Sanhedrin like a sheep before its shearers, would not say a word to vindicate Himself, fulfilling Isaiah 53:7.</p>
<h2 class="head2">29. The One Executed with Two Criminals</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the One who was executed with two criminals. Isaiah 53:12c tells us that &ldquo;he was numbered with the trangressors,&rdquo; and verse 9a, that &ldquo;he made his grave with the wicked.&rdquo; As the fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah 53, Luke 23:32 and 33 say, &ldquo;Two others also, who were criminals, were led with Him to be executed. And when they came to the place called Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left.&rdquo; The fact that Christ was executed with two criminals indicates that the Roman authorities considered Him a criminal. This was done under God&rsquo;s sovereignty that the prophecy of Isaiah concerning Christ&rsquo;s execution might be fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head2">30. The One Who Made Intercession<br />
for the Transgressors</h2>
<p>In Isaiah 53:12 it is prophesied that Christ would make &ldquo;intercession for the transgressors.&rdquo; According to Luke 23:34, the fulfillment of this prophecy, Jesus said, &ldquo;Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.&rdquo; While He was on the cross the Lord made intercession for the transgressors, mainly for the Jews. He interceded for them regarding the evil of the transgressors, the result of their ignorance, a trespass that He prayed would be forgiven by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">31. The Robbed One Whose Garments<br />
Were Divided by the Crucifying Soldiers</h2>
<p>In Psalm 22:18 there is the prophecy that the crucified Christ would be robbed of His garments: &ldquo;They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.&rdquo; In fulfillment of this prophecy, Matthew 27:35 says, &ldquo;When they had crucified Him, they divided His garments among them, casting lots.&rdquo; Here we see that the Lord suffered the sinners&rsquo; robbery to the uttermost. According to John 19:23 and 24, &ldquo;The soldiers then, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, a part for each soldier, and also the tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven from the top throughout. They said therefore to one another, Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.&rdquo; This was not of the soldiers but was of God&rsquo;s sovereignty. It happened that the prophecy of Psalm 22:18 might be fulfilled. The soldiers did exactly what was prophesied. By this we see that the Lord&rsquo;s death was sovereignly planned. If God had not planned it, no one could have put Christ to death. All the fulfilled prophecies prove that the Lord&rsquo;s death was not of man but of God&rsquo;s sovereignty.</p>
<h2 class="head2">32. The One Wounded for Our Transgressions,<br />
with Whose Stripes We Are Healed</h2>
<p>Isaiah 53:5 says, &ldquo;But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.&rdquo; First Peter 2:24b says, &ldquo;By whose bruise you were healed.&rdquo; Here the word &ldquo;bruise&rdquo; is a suffering that resulted in death. According to Genesis 3:15, the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent, and the serpent would bruise the heel of the woman&rsquo;s seed. The bruise in Genesis 3:15 is related to the bruise in 1 Peter 2:24.</p>
<p>According to 1 Peter 2:24, we have been healed by Christ&rsquo;s bruise. This is the healing of death. We were dead (Eph. 2:1), but Christ&rsquo;s suffering of death healed our death so that we may live in His resurrection.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(17)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall see more aspects of Christ&rsquo;s person in His crucifixion and burial as revealed in the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies.</p>
<h2 class="head2">33. The One on Whom Jehovah<br />
Laid Our Iniquity and Who Bore Our Iniquities<br />
and Was Made Sin for Us</h2>
<p>Christ is the One on whom Jehovah laid our iniquity and the One who bore our iniquities. This is prophesied in Isaiah 53:6b, 11c, and 12d. On the cross Christ bore our sins. When Christ was on the cross, God took all our sins and put them upon Him as the Lamb of God. Three verses are very clear concerning this: 1 Peter 2:24, 1 Corinthians 15:3, and Hebrews 9:28.</p>
<p>After God laid our sins upon the crucified Christ, God considered Him the unique sinner, even as sin itself. According to 2 Corinthians 5:21, God made Christ, who knew no sin, to be sin for us. In fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies, Christ died as our Substitute bearing our iniquities. As the One made sin on our behalf, Christ was judged by God once for all.</p>
<h2 class="head2">34. The One Forsaken by God</h2>
<p>Psalm 22:1 prophesies concerning Christ as the One forsaken by God: &ldquo;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&rdquo; The fulfillment of this prophecy is in Matthew 27:46: &ldquo;About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&rdquo; The Lord was crucified at the third hour, and suffered on the cross for six hours. In the first three hours He was persecuted by men for doing God&rsquo;s will; in the last three hours He was judged by God for the accomplishment of our redemption. It was during this time that God counted Him as our Substitute for sin. Because our sin and sins and all negative things were dealt with, darkness came upon all the land (Matt. 27:45), and God forsook Him because of our sin. God forsook Christ on the cross because He took the place of sinners (1 Pet. 3:18), bearing our sins and being made sin for us. In the sight of God, Christ became a great sinner. Because Christ was our Substitute and was even made sin for us, God judged Him and forsook Him.</p>
<p>According to Matthew 1 and Luke 1, the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit. Later, for His ministry, He was anointed with the Holy Spirit, who descended upon Him (Luke 3:22). Before the anointing Spirit descended upon the Lord Jesus economically, He already had, essentially, the begetting Spirit as the divine essence within Him as one of the two essences of His being. The begetting Spirit as the divine essence never left Christ essentially. Even when He was crying out, &ldquo;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&rdquo; He still had the begetting Spirit as the divine essence. Then who left Him? It was the anointing Spirit through whom He presented Himself to God (Heb. 9:14) who left Him economically. After God accepted Christ as the all-inclusive offering, the anointing Spirit left Him. But although the anointing Spirit left Him economically, He still had the begetting Spirit essentially. When the Lord Jesus, the God-man, died on the cross under God&rsquo;s judgment, He had God within Him essentially as His divine being. Nevertheless, He was forsaken by the righteous and the judging God economically.</p>
<h2 class="head2">35. The Cursed One Hanging on a Tree</h2>
<p>In Deuteronomy 21:23 there is the prophecy that Christ would be the cursed One hanging on a tree. In fulfillment of this word, Galatians 3:13 says, &ldquo;Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, Cursed is every one hanging on a tree.&rdquo; Here the word &ldquo;tree&rdquo; denotes the cross made of wood. Elsewhere in the New Testament the cross is called a tree (Acts 5:30; 10:39; 13:29). In particular, 1 Peter 2:24 says that Christ &ldquo;carried up our sins in His body onto the tree.&rdquo; As our Substitute on the tree, the cross, Christ not only bore the curse for us, but He also became a curse for us. The curse of the law issued from the sin of man (Gen. 3:17). When Christ took away our sin on the cross, He redeemed us out of the curse.</p>
<p>Adam brought us all under the curse. But the curse was not altogether official until the law was given. Now the law declares that all the descendants of Adam are under the curse. Therefore, the curse brought in by Adam has been made official by the law. Through His crucifixion Christ redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf.</p><h2 class="head2">36. The One to Whom Gall<br />
Was Given, and Vinegar Also</h2>
<p>Psalm 69:21 says, &ldquo;They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.&rdquo; This is a prophecy that Christ would be the One to whom gall and vinegar would be given. Matthew 27:34 says, &ldquo;They gave Him wine to drink mingled with gall; and having tasted it, He would not drink.&rdquo; The wine mingled with gall (and also with myrrh&mdash;Mark 15:23) was intended as a stupefying drought. But the Lord would not be stupefied; He would drink the bitter cup to the dregs.</p>
<p>Close to the end of His crucifixion, people continued to mock Him by giving Him vinegar to quench His thirst. John 19:28 and 29 say, &ldquo;After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had now been accomplished that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst. A vessel full of vinegar was lying there; so they put a sponge full of vinegar on hyssop and brought it to His mouth.&rdquo; Thirst is a taste of death (Luke 16:24; Rev. 21:8), and the Lord Jesus suffered it for us on the cross (Heb. 2:9). The hyssop in John 19:29 should be the reed in Matthew 27:29 and Mark 15:19, which was a hyssop reed. At the beginning of His crucifixion, the wine mingled with gall and myrrh was offered to the Lord as a stupefying drought, which He would not drink. But at the end of His crucifixion, when He was thirsty, vinegar was offered to Him in a mocking way (Luke 23:36), and He took it. &ldquo;When Jesus then had taken the vinegar, He said, It is finished! And He bowed His head and gave up the spirit&rdquo; (John 19:30).</p>
<h2 class="head2">37. The One Who Poured Out His Soul unto Death</h2>
<p>In Isaiah 53:12 we see that Christ would be the One who poured out His soul unto death. Philippians 2:8b says that Christ was &ldquo;obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.&rdquo; In His crucifixion Christ suffered to such an extent that He poured out His soul, His entire being, unto death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">38. The Pierced One</h2>
<p>In the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies related to His death, Christ is also the pierced One. Psalm 22:16 says, &ldquo;They pierced my hands and my feet.&rdquo; Zechariah 12:10 prophesies, &ldquo;They shall look upon me whom they have pierced.&rdquo; The New Testament fulfillment of these prophecies is found in John 19:34 and 37. Verse 37 is a quotation of Zechariah 12:10. Verse 34 says, &ldquo;One of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.&rdquo; Here we see that two substances came out of the Lord&rsquo;s pierced side: blood and water. Blood is for redemption, dealing with sins (John 1:29; Heb. 9:22) for the purchase of the church (Acts 20:28); water is for imparting life, dealing with death (John 12:24; 3:14-15) for the producing of the church (Eph. 5:29-32). Christ&rsquo;s death is, on the negative side, to take away our sins and, on the positive side, to impart life into us. Hence, it has two aspects: the redemptive aspect and the life-imparting aspect. The redemptive aspect is for the life-imparting aspect.</p>
<h2 class="head2">39. The One of Whose Bones Not One Was Broken</h2>
<p>Christ is the One of whose bones not one was broken. This is typified in Exodus 12:46, prophesied in Psalm 34:20, and fulfilled in John 19:32-36. Exodus 12:46 says that the children of Israel were not to break any of the bones of the Passover lamb. Psalm 34:20 says, &ldquo;He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.&rdquo; When Christ was crucified as our Passover lamb, His legs were not broken (John 19:33, 36). The Jews, not wanting the bodies to remain on the cross on the Sabbath, asked Pilate that their legs might be broken. The soldiers then broke the legs of the two thieves who had been crucified with the Lord. But when they came to Jesus, they saw that He had already died. Because He had died, it was needless for them to break His bones. Therefore, under God&rsquo;s sovereignty not one of the Lord&rsquo;s bones was broken. Both the type in Exodus 12:46 and the prophecy in Psalm 34:20 were fulfilled in the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross.</p>
<p>The fact that Christ&rsquo;s legs were not broken signifies that in Him there is something unbreakable and indestructible. This unbreakable and indestructible element is His eternal life. The Roman soldiers and the Jewish people could come together to put Christ on the cross, but they could not break His eternal life.</p>
<p>We can prove from the Scriptures that the bone signifies life. According to Genesis 2:21-22, the Lord took a bone, a rib, out of Adam and built it into a woman. The woman, Eve, was produced from a bone taken out of Adam. Hence, a bone signifies life that imparts life. The bone taken out of Adam imparted Adam&rsquo;s life to Eve. In the same principle, Christ&rsquo;s unbroken bone signifies His unbreakable and indestructible eternal life that imparts His life to us. In Christ as our Passover lamb there is such an unbreakable and indestructible life that can impart life to us.</p><h2 class="head2">40. The Messiah Cut Off<br />
in the Seventh Year of the Sixty-ninth Week<br />
from the Decree to Restore and to Build Jerusalem</h2>
<p>Christ, the Messiah, was cut off, crucified, in the seventh year of the sixty-ninth week from the decree to restore and to build Jerusalem. This is prophesied in Daniel 9:25-26a and fulfilled in John 19:14-16. Daniel 9:25 says, &ldquo;Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem, unto the Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.&rdquo; In this verse a week equals seven years. Therefore, &ldquo;seven weeks&rdquo; denote forty-nine years. If you study the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, you will see that from the time that the king of Persia gave the commandment to rebuild Jerusalem unto the completion of this rebuilding was forty-nine years. Daniel 9:25 also speaks of a period of threescore and two weeks, or sixty-two weeks. This is equal to four hundred thirty-four years. The first seven weeks and the sixty-two weeks yield a total of four hundred eighty-three years. The first forty-nine years go from the commandment to rebuild Jerusalem to the completion of the building. The four hundred thirty-four years extend from the building of Jerusalem to Messiah, the Prince, that is, to the year in which Messiah was cut off.</p>
<p>Daniel 9:26a goes on to say, &ldquo;And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;cut off&rdquo; refer to the crucifixion of Christ, the Messiah. Christ was cut off not for Himself but for us. At the time prophesied by Daniel, He was crucified for us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">41. The One Buried in a Rich Man&rsquo;s Tomb</h2>
<p>Matthew 27:57-60 reveals that Christ was buried by a rich man. The Lord was wrapped in a clean linen cloth and laid in a new tomb (vv. 59-60). This kind of burial was for the fulfillment of Isaiah 53:9.</p>
<p>While the Lord Jesus was dying on the cross, many evil things and sufferings came to Him. Some people treated Him evilly, and others mocked Him. Everything in His environment was dark. But however evil were the events and however much He suffered, He endured them all and passed through them victoriously. Immediately after His death, the environment changed. After the Lord accomplished His redemptive and life-imparting death, His situation of suffering immediately changed into an honorable one. Joseph of Arimathaea, a rich man, and Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, came with linen and very expensive spices, myrrh and aloes (John 19:38-40), to prepare His body for burial. It was not the poor but the noble who cared for His body, burying Him in a new tomb &ldquo;with the rich&rdquo; (John 19:41; Isa. 53:9). By this we see that the entire situation was changed into a rich condition, a noble state. The Lord was now dear to people, and they valued Him very highly. Hence, the Lord rested in human honor. Although He was put to death in shame, He was buried in honor. Then according to God&rsquo;s sovereignty, in human honor of a high standard the Lord rested on the Sabbath day (John 19:42; Luke 23:55-56), waiting for the time to resurrect from among the dead. Because His work had been finished, He could rest and enjoy a proper Sabbath day. After this Sabbath, on the first day of the week, He would rise up from His resting place.</p>
 <h2 class="head2">42. The One Who Was Raised from the Dead<br />
on the Third Day</h2>
<p>In Hosea 6:2 there is the prophecy that Christ would be raised from the dead on the third day. This prophecy is fulfilled in 1 Corinthians 15:4 where we are told that Christ &ldquo;has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">43. The Holy One of Jehovah<br />
Whose Soul Jehovah Would Not Leave in Hades<br />
and Whom He Would Not Permit to See Corruption</h2>
<p>In Psalm 16:8-11 we have the prophecy concerning Christ as the Holy One of Jehovah whose soul Jehovah would not leave in Hades and whom He would not permit to see corruption. Acts 2:24-31 is the fulfillment of this prophecy. Another verse related to this fulfillment is Acts 13:35. Acts 2:24 says, &ldquo;Whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it.&rdquo; Christ is both God and resurrection (John 1:1; 11:25), possessing the indestructible life (Heb. 7:16). Because He is such an ever-living One, death is not able to hold Him. He delivered Himself to death, but death had no way to detain Him; rather, death was defeated by Him, and He rose up from it.</p>
<p>Acts 2:25 says, &ldquo;For David says in regard to Him, I saw the Lord continually before me, because He is on my right hand, that I should not be shaken.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;I saw&rdquo; introduce a declaration of Christ in His resurrection. Here &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; refers to God. When Christ is held by God (as in Isa. 41:13; 42:6), God is on His right hand. But when He is exalted by God, He is sitting on the right hand of God (Acts 2:33; Psa. 110:1; Eph. 1:20-21).</p>
<p>Acts 2:26 continues, &ldquo;Therefore my heart was made glad and my tongue exulted; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope.&rdquo; This is a quotation from Psalm 16:9 in the Septuagint. But in the original Hebrew text the word for tongue is &ldquo;glory,&rdquo; which is a synonym of soul, according to Genesis 49:6 and Psalm 7:5. In His trust in God, Christ&rsquo;s heart was made glad, and His soul exulted while He was in Hades (Acts 2:26-27).</p>
<p>The Greek word translated &ldquo;rest&rdquo; in Acts 2:26 may also be rendered dwell, reside, pitch its tent. After Christ died on the cross, while His soul exulted in Hades, His flesh (body) rested in the tomb in hope, trusting in God.</p>
<p>Acts 2:27 goes on to say, &ldquo;Because You will not leave my soul in Hades, nor will You permit Your Holy One to see corruption.&rdquo; Hades, like Sheol in the Old Testament (Gen. 37:35; Psa. 6:5), is the place where the souls and the spirits of the dead are kept (Luke 16:22-23). Here in Acts 2:27 &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; refers to the corruption of the body in the tomb.</p>
<p>Acts 2:28 says, &ldquo;You have made known to me the ways of life; You will make me full of gladness with Your presence.&rdquo; Here the ways of life are the ways to get out of death into resurrection. The Greek word for &ldquo;presence&rdquo; also means countenance. Christ was resurrected into God&rsquo;s presence, especially in His ascension (Acts 2:34; Heb. 1:3).</p>
<p>Thus far we have covered forty-three aspects of Christ&rsquo;s person in the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies. We have seen that He is prophesied as the Creator, the very God, who remains unchanged. We have seen that He was born of a virgin and grew up in a poor family; that He carried out His ministry as a faithful Servant, not breaking the bruised reed or quenching the smoking flax; that He was betrayed, sold, and despised; that on the cross He bore our iniquities, was made sin for us, and suffered God&rsquo;s forsaking of Him. After being cut off as was prophesied by Daniel, He was resurrected on the third day. How wonderful that all these aspects of Christ are prophesied in the Old Testament!</p>
<p>Although much of Christ is revealed in the Old Testament prophecies, our eyes need to be opened to see both these prophecies and their fulfillment. The Jews treasure the Old Testament as the Word of God, but because they are blinded by tradition they do not see anything concerning Christ. We thank the Lord that we have been enlightened and that our eyes have been opened to see these prophecies in the light of the New Testament revelation. Now we can understand the many aspects concerning Christ&rsquo;s person prophesied in the Old Testament.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<p>In this message we shall see more concerning Christ&rsquo;s person in the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies. In particular, we shall consider prophecies related to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head2">44. The One Who Was Begotten<br />
the Firstborn Son of God<br />
and Whose Father God Became</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament there is a prophecy regarding the matter of Christ being the One who was begotten the firstborn Son of God and whose Father God became. Psalm 2:7 says, &ldquo;The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.&rdquo; Furthermore, 2 Samuel 7:14 prophesies, &ldquo;I will be his father, and he shall be my son.&rdquo; Both verses are quoted in Hebrews 1:5: &ldquo;For to which of the angels has He ever said, You are My Son; this day I have begotten You? And again, I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son?&rdquo; &ldquo;This day&rdquo; is the day of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (Acts 13:33). Through resurrection Christ in His humanity was born to be the firstborn Son of God. The Lord Jesus was born of a virgin to be the Son of Man, yet He still needed to be born of the Father to be the firstborn Son of God. When He was born in this way, His humanity was &ldquo;sonized&rdquo; through resurrection. Therefore, God is a Father of Christ in two senses: first, in the sense that God was the Father of Christ in His divinity from eternity; second, in the sense that God is the Father of Christ in His humanity in resurrection through which Christ was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">45. The Holy and Sure Things<br />
(the Resurrected Christ as Mercies or Blessings)<br />
 of David</h2>
<p>The resurrected Christ is the holy and sure things of David, things that are mercies or blessings to us. The resurrected Christ is the mercies and blessings God gives to us in this age. These are the holy and sure things of David prophesied in Isaiah 55:3 and fulfilled in Acts 13:34.</p>
<p>Acts 13:34 says, &ldquo;As to His having raised Him up from among the dead, no longer to return to corruption, He spoke in this way, I will give you the holy and faithful things of David.&rdquo; Verses 33 and 34 are concerned with the resurrected Christ. Verse 33 says, &ldquo;That God has fully fulfilled this promise to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second psalm, You are My Son; today I have begotten You.&rdquo; We have seen that Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was His second birth to bring Him forth as the firstborn Son of God. God promised to give Him to His people, and this resurrected One is the holy and faithful things of David. The phrase &ldquo;the holy and faithful things of David&rdquo; indicates that Christ was of David, for it was out of David&rsquo;s seed that God raised up such a One. To God the resurrected Christ is the firstborn Son, but to us He is the Savior. Moreover, He is a great gift given by God to His chosen people and this gift is entitled &ldquo;the holy and faithful things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Literally, the Greek words rendered &ldquo;the holy and faithful things&rdquo; are the holy things (Gk. <em>hosios,</em> plural), the faithful or sure. The same word <em>(hosios)</em> is used for &ldquo;Holy One&rdquo; in Acts 13:35, but in the singular. But it is not the regular word for holy, which is <em>hagios. Hosios</em> is a Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word <em>chesed,</em> which is translated mercies in Isaiah 55:3; 2 Chronicles 6:42; and Psalm 89:1, both in the Septuagint and the King James Version. In Psalm 89, <em>chesed</em> in verse 1 for mercies in plural is the same word in verse 19 for Holy One in singular. This Holy One is Christ, the Son of David, in whom God&rsquo;s mercies are centered and conveyed. Hence, the holy and faithful things of David refer to the resurrected Christ. This is fully proved by the context, especially by &ldquo;Your Holy One&rdquo; in Acts 13:35, and by the verse following Isaiah 55:3.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s thought in Acts 13:33 and 34 is very deep. The resurrected Christ, who is God&rsquo;s firstborn Son brought forth through His second birth, His resurrection, is the holy and faithful things. In verse 34 the word &ldquo;faithful&rdquo; means trustworthy. The resurrected Christ is the holy and trustworthy things God gives to us. Here Paul indicates that the resurrected Christ is not only our Savior and the firstborn Son of God but also the holy and faithful things as a gift given to us by God. Actually, &ldquo;the holy and faithful things&rdquo; is a divine title, a title of Christ. In these verses Christ is called the holy and trustworthy things. The Savior God raised up out of the seed of David has become the holy and trustworthy things.</p>
<p>These holy and trustworthy things are all the aspects of what Christ is. How much Christ is to us as the holy and trustworthy things! In the Old Testament these things are regarded as mercies. For this reason Isaiah 55:3 speaks of &ldquo;the sure mercies of David.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">46. The One Who Saw,<br />
in Resurrection, the Fruit of His Travail</h2>
<p>Isaiah 53:11a says, &ldquo;He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied.&rdquo; This is a prophecy concerning Christ in resurrection seeing the fruit of His labor, the fruit of the travail of His death. The fruit is corporate and includes all the believers. No doubt, this corporate fruit is the church, Christ&rsquo;s Body. In resurrection Christ saw the church as the fruit of His travail.</p>
<p>The prophecy of Isaiah 53:11a is fulfilled in John 20:17 and Hebrews 2:11. In John 20:17 the Lord Jesus speaks of &ldquo;My brothers.&rdquo; Prior to His resurrection the most intimate term the Lord used to call His disciples was &ldquo;friends&rdquo; (John 15:14,15). But after His resurrection He began to call them brothers, for through His resurrection His disciples were regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3) with the divine life released by His life-imparting death, as indicated in John 12:24. Christ was the one grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died and then grew up to bring forth many grains for the producing of the one loaf which is His Body (1 Cor. 10:17). He was the Father&rsquo;s only Son, as the Father&rsquo;s individual expression. Now through His death and resurrection, the Father&rsquo;s only begotten Son has become &ldquo;the Firstborn among many brothers&rdquo; (Rom. 8:29). His many brothers are the many sons of God and the church (Heb. 2:10-12), as the corporate expression of God the Father in the Son. This is God&rsquo;s ultimate intention. Therefore, the many brothers are the propagation of the Father&rsquo;s life and the multiplication of the Son in the divine life. Hence, in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is fulfilled.</p>
<p>Hebrews 2:11 says, &ldquo;Both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers.&rdquo; He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God. Both the first Son and the many sons of God are born of the same Father God in resurrection (Acts 13:33; 1 Pet. 1:3). Both the firstborn Son and the many sons are the same in the divine life and nature. Hence, He is not ashamed to call them brothers.</p>
<p>As the many sons of God, we are the many brothers of Christ, who is the firstborn Son of God. He was born to be the firstborn Son through His resurrection, and we were produced to be His many brothers in His resurrection. As we have pointed out, this is the reason after His resurrection He called His disciples His brothers. Because we have the life and nature of God, we are God&rsquo;s many sons. Because we share the same life and nature as the Firstborn, we are His brothers. To God, we are His many sons; to the firstborn Son of God, we are His many brothers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">47. The Resurrected, Righteous Servant<br />
of Jehovah through Whom Many<br />
Would Be Justified</h2>
<p>Isaiah 53:11b says, &ldquo;By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many.&rdquo; This prophecy indicates that Christ is the resurrected, righteous Servant of Jehovah through whom many are justified. It is through the resurrected Christ that the believers are justified by God.</p>
<p>Isaiah 53:11b is fulfilled in Acts 13:39 and Romans 4:25. Acts 13:39 says, &ldquo;From all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified.&rdquo; Who is &ldquo;this One&rdquo;? This is the One who has been resurrected to be God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, our Savior, and the many holy and trustworthy things (Acts 13:33-34). Through the One who is the holy and trustworthy things as God&rsquo;s mercies to us we are justified from all the things from which we could not be justified by the law of Moses. Furthermore, the One through whom we are justified is Himself our justification. Justification is a mercy from God to us, and this mercy is an aspect of the resurrected Christ. Today Christ in resurrection is our justification.</p>
<p>The resurrection of Christ is a proof of our justification by God. Romans 4:25 says that Christ &ldquo;was delivered because of our offenses and was raised because of our justification.&rdquo; The death of Christ fully satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirements so that we may be justified by God through Christ&rsquo;s death (Rom. 3:24). His resurrection is a proof that God is satisfied with His death for us and that we are justified by God because of His death. In Him, the resurrected One, we are accepted by God. Furthermore, as the resurrected One He is also in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and is always acceptable to God. Therefore, Romans 4:25 says that Christ was raised because of our justification.</p>
<p>Suppose Christ died for us and our sins and was buried in the tomb, but was not resurrected by God. If this were the situation, we could not believe that His death was accepted by God and that it satisfied God&rsquo;s requirements and fulfilled His desires. However, Christ is not in the tomb. God raised Him up from the dead, and He came back in resurrection. This is a strong proof that God has accepted His death for us, that His death satisfied God&rsquo;s requirements and fulfilled whatever God wanted Him to do for us. Therefore, the resurrection of Christ is the proof of our justification by God. In Him, the resurrected One, we are justified.</p><h2 class="head2">48. Shiloh&mdash;Pacificator</h2>
<p>Genesis 49:10 says, &ldquo;The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.&rdquo; This is a prophecy concerning Christ as the Pacificator. As the Pacificator Christ is not only the Peacemaker; He is also the One who rectifies the situation between us and God and between us and one another. Christ has made propitiation for us so that there may now be peace between God and us. This was prophesied in Genesis 49:10 and fulfilled in Ephesians 2:14-16.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:14 says, &ldquo;He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;our&rdquo; refers to both Jewish and Gentile believers. Christ, who has accomplished full redemption for both Jewish and Gentile believers, is Himself our peace, our harmony, making both one. Due to the fall of mankind and the call of the chosen race, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles. Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption this separation has been removed. Now in the redeeming Christ, who is the bond of oneness, both are one.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:15 goes on to say, &ldquo;Having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, making peace.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;the two&rdquo; refers to the Jewish and Gentile believers. By Christ&rsquo;s abolishing in His flesh the separating ordinances and creating the Jewish and Gentile believers into one new man peace was made between all believers.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:16 continues, &ldquo;And might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, slaying the enmity by it.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;both&rdquo; refers to the Jews and the Gentiles. Not only the uncircumcised Gentiles but also the circumcised Jews needed reconciliation to God through the redemption of Christ accomplished on His cross. The cross of Christ, on the one hand, has slain the enmity caused by the ordinances which were given because of the flesh, and, on the other hand, has redeemed us with the blood of Christ shed upon it. It was through this cross that both Jews and Gentiles were reconciled in one Body to God. Therefore, in these verses we have the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning Christ as Shiloh, the Pacificator.</p>
<h2 class="head2">49. The Stone Rejected by the Jewish Builders<br />
 Who Became the Cornerstone</h2>
<p>Psalm 118:22 and 23 say, &ldquo;The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. This is the Lord&rsquo;s doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.&rdquo; Here we have a prophecy concerning Christ as the stone rejected by the Jewish builders who became in resurrection the cornerstone. The Lord Jesus quoted this prophecy in Matthew 21:42: &ldquo;Have you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the corner-stone; this was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?&rdquo; The stone here is Christ for God&rsquo;s building (Isa. 28:16; Zech. 3:9; 1 Pet. 2:4), and the builders are the Jewish leaders, who were supposed to work on God&rsquo;s building. In this verse the Lord said that the stone rejected by the builders has become the cornerstone (lit. the head of the corner). Christ is not only the foundation stone (Isa. 28:16) and the topstone (Zech. 4:7), but also the cornerstone. The Lord&rsquo;s word here unveiled the Jewish leaders&rsquo; rejection of Him and God&rsquo;s honoring of Him for the building of His habitation among His people on earth.</p>
<p>In his preaching Peter also refers to the prophecy concerning Christ as the stone: &ldquo;This is the stone which was despised by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone&rdquo; (Acts 4:11). The Greek word translated &ldquo;despised&rdquo; also means rejected. The stone despised, rejected, by the builders has become the cornerstone. Peter had come to know Christ as the precious stone held in honor by God, as he expounded concerning Him in his first Epistle (1 Pet. 2:4-7). Peter&rsquo;s quoting of Psalm 118:22 indicates that he preached Christ not only as the Savior for the salvation of sinners but also as the stone for God&rsquo;s building. It is such a Christ who is the unique salvation to sinners and in whose unique name under heaven, a name despised and rejected by the Jewish leaders but honored and exalted by God (Phil. 2:9-10), sinners must be saved (Acts 4:12). Therefore, the stone in Acts 4:11 is the Savior in verse 12. The stone despised by the builders has become the cornerstone, and there is no salvation in any other name. We can be saved only in the name of Jesus, and Jesus is the stone. He is the Stone-Savior. In the four Gospels we have the King-Savior in Matthew, the Slave-Savior in Mark, the Man-Savior in Luke, and the God-Savior in John. According to Acts 4:11-12, we also have the Stone-Savior, Christ as the stone for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:4 also speaks of Christ as a stone: &ldquo;To whom coming, a living stone, having been rejected by men, but with God chosen, held in honor.&rdquo; This living stone is Christ for God&rsquo;s building. Although He has been rejected by men, with God He is chosen, held in honor. The Greek word translated &ldquo;held in honor&rdquo; also means precious. This word indicates preciousness as recognized and held in honor. As we experience Christ as the stone living in us, He makes us living stones, transformed with His stone nature, so that we may be built with others a spiritual house upon Him as the foundation and cornerstone.</p>
<h2 class="head2">50. A Stone of Stumbling,<br />
a Rock of Offense, at Which Israel Stumbled</h2>
<p>Christ is also a stone of stumbling, a rock of offense, at which Israel stumbled. This is prophesied in Isaiah 8:14 and 15: &ldquo;He shall be&#133;for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.&rdquo; Because Israel rejected Him, He became to Israel a stone of stumbling, a rock of offense. This word is fulfilled in Romans 9:32-33a; Luke 2:34; and 1 Peter 2:8. Christ was appointed by God to be a test to the children of Israel so that many of them would be stumbled by Him and many raised up by Him.</p>
<p>Regarding Christ as a stone of stumbling, 1 Peter 2:8 says, &ldquo;A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense; who stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed.&rdquo; This verse reveals that the reliable Christ (1 Pet. 2:6), being rejected, became a stumbling stone, at which the rejecting Judaizers stumbled (Matt. 21:44). The relative pronoun &ldquo;which&rdquo; refers to the Jews&rsquo; disobedience with the result of stumbling.</p>
<p>Christ is not only the building stone but also the stumbling stone. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 21:44a, &ldquo;He who falls on this stone shall be broken to pieces.&rdquo; In Romans 9:32 Paul says that the Jews &ldquo;stumbled at the Stone of stumbling.&rdquo; The Jews who have rejected the Lord Jesus have fallen upon this stone and have been broken to pieces.</p>
<h2 class="head2">51. A Stone of Foundation<br />
on Whom the Believers Believed</h2>
<p>In the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies Christ is also a stone of foundation on whom the believers believed. Concerning this, Isaiah 28:16 says, &ldquo;Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation; he that believeth shall not make haste.&rdquo; This prophecy is fulfilled in 1 Corinthians 3:11; Romans 9:33b; and 1 Peter 2:4, 6-7a. In 1 Corinthians 3:11 Paul says, &ldquo;Other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ.&rdquo; As the Christ and the Son of the Living God, the Lord Jesus Christ is the unique foundation laid by God for the building of the church (Matt. 16:16-18). No one can lay any other foundation. In Romans 9:33b Paul says, &ldquo;He who believes on Him shall not be put to shame.&rdquo; The same thought is in 1 Peter 2:6-7a: &ldquo;Because it is contained in Scripture: Behold, I lay in Zion a chosen stone, a cornerstone held in honor, and he who believes on Him shall by no means be put to shame. To you therefore who believe is the preciousness.&rdquo; The Greek word for &ldquo;preciousness&rdquo; here is a kindred word to honor in 1 Peter 2:4 and 6. The very Christ chosen by God as a stone held in honor is the preciousness to His believers.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head2">52. The One Who in His Reproducing Resurrection Declared the Father&rsquo;s Name to His Brothers and Praised Him in the Midst of the Church</h2>
<p>Christ is the One who in His reproducing resurrection declared the Father&rsquo;s name to the brothers and praised Him in the midst of the church. This is prophesied in Psalm 22:22: &ldquo;I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.&rdquo; This verse is quoted in Hebrews 2:12, by which we see that it is a prophecy of Christ. The brothers mentioned in Psalm 22:22 are Christ&rsquo;s many brothers brought forth through His resurrection. Therefore, this verse prophesies that in resurrection Christ would declare the Father&rsquo;s name, the Father&rsquo;s person, to the Lord&rsquo;s brothers. We have seen that in resurrection Christ, the only begotten Son of God, was born to be God&rsquo;s firstborn Son and that God&rsquo;s chosen people were born with Him to be the many sons of God, Christ&rsquo;s many brothers. Therefore, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was a corporate birth, the birth of the firstborn Son and His many brothers. According to Hebrews 2:12, the firstborn Son of God declared in the church the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers: &ldquo;I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise unto You.&rdquo; Because the Father is the source of life and nature, to declare the name of the Father is to show the many brothers the source of life and nature. Although the Jewish people in ancient times knew God, they did not know the Father. They knew God as the Creator but not as the Father who begets. They knew God&rsquo;s creating power, but they did not know the Father&rsquo;s begetting life. Before Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, not even His disciples knew the Father&rsquo;s life and begetting ability. However, on the day of resurrection the Lord came to them to declare the Father in order to make them know the Father as the source of life.</p>
<p>According to John 20, the Lord Jesus visited His disciples in the evening on the day of His resurrection. But John does not say that He declared the Father to the disciples. This is mentioned prophetically in Psalm 22:22. According to this prophecy, after His resurrection Christ came to His disciples to make the Father known to them. The Father&rsquo;s life and nature had become theirs, and His very being had been imparted to them. This is what it means to declare the Father&rsquo;s name to the brothers. This declaration was not simply a matter of mentioning the name; rather, it was an impartation of all that the Father is&mdash;His life, nature, and being&mdash;into the disciples. It was from such a declaration that Peter came to realize that he was a partaker of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). We, the sons of God, have all become partakers of the divine nature. To us, God is no longer merely the creating God; He is also the begetting Father. He has begotten us. He has imparted His life, His nature, and even His being into our being. This is what it means for the resurrected Christ to declare the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers.</p>
<p>Psalm 22:22 prophesies not only that Christ will declare the Father&rsquo;s name but also that He will praise the Father in the midst of the congregation: &ldquo;In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.&rdquo; In fulfillment of this prophecy, the second part of Hebrews 2:12 says, &ldquo;In the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise unto You.&rdquo; Literally the Greek words rendered &ldquo;I will sing hymns of praise unto You&rdquo; mean &ldquo;I will hymn You.&rdquo; Here we have the firstborn Son&rsquo;s praising of the Father from within the Father&rsquo;s many sons in the church meetings. When we, the many sons of God, meet as the church and praise the Father, the firstborn Son praises the Father in our praises. It is not that He praises the Father apart from us and alone, but rather within us and with us through our praising. He sings hymns of praise to the Father in our singing.</p>
 <p>In Psalm 22:22 and Hebrews 2:12 we see that after declaring the Father&rsquo;s name, the Son sings hymns of praise to Him in the midst of the church. Throughout the centuries the firstborn Son has been singing hymns of praise unto the Father in the church. He does this in all of His brothers. Because He is in us, He sings praises unto the Father in our singing. His singing is in our singing. When we sing, He sings because He is within our singing. When we sing hymns to the Father from our spirit, Christ sings with us in our spirit. The church is one corporate Body with the firstborn Son of God. In the meetings of the church the firstborn Son, who dwells in His many brothers who compose the church, sings praise to the Father from within them. The more we, Christ&rsquo;s brothers, sing praise to the Father, the more the Lord sings in our singing.</p><h2 class="head2">53. The Priest Ordained by God with an Oath<br />
according to the Order of Melchisedec</h2>
<p>Psalm 110:4 says, &ldquo;The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.&rdquo; Here we have a prophecy of Christ as the Priest ordained by God with an oath according to the order of Melchisedec. The fulfillment of this prophecy is in Hebrews 5:6-10.</p>
<p>Hebrews 5:6, a quotation from Psalm 110, says, &ldquo;As also in another place He says, You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec.&rdquo; This refers to the ascension and enthronement of Christ (Psa. 110:1-4) which, in addition to His resurrection, are further qualifications for Him to be our High Priest. The order of Melchisedec is higher than the order of Aaron. The order of Aaron was for the priesthood only in humanity, whereas the order of Melchisedec is for the priesthood in both humanity and divinity.</p>
<p>According to Hebrews 5:6, Christ is a Priest forever. Aaron was established in honor to be the high priest only for his lifetime, for he was prevented by death from continuing. But as the Son of God, Christ was ordained in glory to be our High Priest forever. With Him there is no preventing of death. He is glorified forever to be our High Priest.</p>
<p>The book of Hebrews is focused on the heavenly Christ, and the chief point concerning this Christ is that He is a Priest, not according to the order of Aaron but according to the order of Melchisedec. All the other aspects of Christ revealed in Hebrews, such as the Son of God, the Son of Man, the Captain of salvation, the Apostle, and the real Joshua are the necessary qualifications for Him to be such a Priest, who can minister to us whatever we need and save us to the uttermost (Heb. 7:25).</p>
<p>In Hebrews 4:14 we are told that we have &ldquo;a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God,&rdquo; and in 4:16 we are told to &ldquo;come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help.&rdquo; The High Priest whom we meet at the throne of grace is not a priest typified by the order of Aaron, but a High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec ministering to us the bread and wine as our supply. Christ has been constituted to be our High Priest, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment but according to the power of an indestructible life (Heb. 7:16). Having the qualifications of His divinity and His resurrection life, He is able to minister the processed God to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">54. The One with the Key of David</h2>
<p>In Isaiah 22:22 there is a prophecy concerning Christ as the One who holds the key of David: &ldquo;The key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.&rdquo; This prophecy is fulfilled in Revelation 3:7: &ldquo;These things says the holy One, the true One, He who has the key of David, He who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open.&rdquo; Here we see that Christ has the key of David, the key of the kingdom, with authority to open and to shut. According to Genesis 1, when God created man, He gave him dominion over all creatures. This indicates that in God&rsquo;s intention man is to be the power representing God on earth. Due to the fall, however, man lost this power and has never fully recovered it. The key held by David is the key of God&rsquo;s dominion. God&rsquo;s dominion includes the entire universe, especially mankind. This dominion has a key that is possessed by the person who fought the battle for the kingdom and who made preparations for the building of the temple. The name of this person is David. David represented God in establishing God&rsquo;s kingdom on earth. Hence, he had the key of God&rsquo;s dominion in the universe. David, however, was just a type, not the reality. The real David is Christ, the greater David. He is the One who built God&rsquo;s temple, the church, and established God&rsquo;s kingdom. Therefore, in the church today, which is both a house and a kingdom, we have God&rsquo;s expression and representation. As the greater David, Christ has built up the house of God, the real temple, and He has set up the kingdom of God, the dominion in which He exercises full authority to represent God. Therefore, he holds the key of David.</p>
<p>The key of David is something representing God to open the whole universe for God. This is the key of David held by Christ. The fact that Christ has the key of David signifies that Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s economy. He is the One who expresses God and represents Him, the One who holds the key to open everything in God&rsquo;s dominion.</p>
<p>Revelation 3:7 says that Christ, the One who has the key of David is the One who &ldquo;opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open.&rdquo; Because the universal key, the key of God&rsquo;s economy, is in His hand, He opens and shuts.</p><h2 class="head2">55. The One Exalted, Lifted Up,<br />
and Made Very High</h2>
<p>Isaiah 52:13 prophesies concerning Christ as the One exalted, lifted up, and made very high: &ldquo;Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.&rdquo; Ephesians 1:20 and 21 is the fulfillment of this prophecy: &ldquo;Which He wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead, and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is coming.&rdquo; Here we see that God&rsquo;s great power that operated in Christ seated Him at God&rsquo;s right hand in the heavenlies far above all. God&rsquo;s right hand, where Christ has been seated by the surpassingly great power of God, is the most honorable place, with the supreme authority.</p>
<p>Christ is far above all rule, authority, power, lordship, and every name. Rule refers to the highest office, authority to every kind of official power, power to the might of authority, and lordship to the preeminence which power establishes. The list in Ephesians 1:21 includes not only angelic, heavenly authorities, good or evil, but also human, earthly ones. The ascended Christ has been seated by the great power of God far above all rules, authorities, powers, and lordships in the entire universe.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 1:21 &ldquo;every name that is named&rdquo; refers not only to titles of honor but also to everything that has a name. Christ has been seated far above everything, not only the things in this age but also those in the coming age.</p>
<h2 class="head2">56. The Victor Ascending to the Height,<br />
Leading Captive Those Taken Captive,<br />
and Giving Gifts to Men</h2>
<p>In the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies Christ is the Victor ascending to the height, leading captive those taken captive, and giving gifts to men. The prophecy of this is in Psalm 68:18: &ldquo;Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell among them.&rdquo; The fulfillment is in Ephesians 4:8: &ldquo;Wherefore He says, Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;height&rdquo; in the quotation of Psalm 68:18 refers to Mount Zion (Psa. 68:15-16), symbolizing the third heaven where God dwells (1 Kings 8:30). Psalm 68 implies that it was in the ark that God ascended to Mount Zion after the ark had led the way to victory.</p>
<p>Verse 1 of Psalm 68 is a quotation of Numbers 10:35: &ldquo;It came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.&rdquo; This indicates that the background of Psalm 68 is God&rsquo;s move in the tabernacle with the ark as its center. The ark was a clear type of Christ. Wherever the ark went, the victory was won. Eventually this ark ascended triumphantly to the top of Mount Zion. This portrays how Christ has won the victory and has ascended triumphantly to the heavens. Therefore, the background of Psalm 68, which is quoted in Ephesians 4:8, is God&rsquo;s move in and with the tabernacle, which typifies God&rsquo;s dwelling place, with the ark typifying Christ, as its center. This Psalm begins with the move of God and continues with the victory gained by Christ. When God moves with the tabernacle and the ark, the enemies will always be vanquished.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 4:8 the word &ldquo;those&rdquo; refers to the redeemed saints who had been taken captive by Satan before they were saved by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan&rsquo;s captivity and took them to Himself. This indicates that He has conquered and overcome Satan, who had captured them by sin and death.</p>
<p>The Amplified New Testament renders &ldquo;He led a train of vanquished foes&rdquo; for &ldquo;He led captive those taken captive.&rdquo; &ldquo;Vanquished foes&rdquo; may refer to Satan, to his angels, and to us the sinners, also indicating Christ&rsquo;s victory over Satan, sin, and death. In Christ&rsquo;s ascension there was a procession of these vanquished foes as captives from a war for a celebration of Christ&rsquo;s victory.</p>
<p>Psalm 68:18 prophesies of Christ&rsquo;s ascension. However, if we did not have Ephesians 4:8-11, we would not know the meaning of Psalm 68:18. By this passage from Ephesians we see that verse 18 of Psalm 68 refers to the ascension of Christ. Christ has ascended on high, and the implication of His ascension is that all His enemies have been defeated. Before He ascended, He vanquished every foe. Therefore, He ascended triumphantly, leading a train of vanquished foes.</p>
<p>The issue of Christ&rsquo;s ascension is that certain of the defeated foes have been given as gifts by the Father to Christ for His Body. In Ephesians 4:8 &ldquo;gifts&rdquo; does not refer to the abilities or enablements for varied services; rather, this word refers to the various gifted persons mentioned in Ephesians 4:11&mdash;apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. After conquering and rescuing them from Satan and death through His own death and resurrection, Christ in His ascension made the rescued sinners themselves such gifts with His resurrection life and gave them to His Body for its building up.</p>
<p>Actually, Psalm 68:18, the prophecy, says that the ascended Christ received gifts. But Ephesians 4:8, the fulfillment, tells us that the ascended Christ gave gifts. In Paul&rsquo;s quotation and application of the word in Psalm 68:18, he changed the thought from receiving to giving. On the one hand, when Christ ascended on high, He received gifts; on the other hand, the ascended Christ gave gifts. As we have pointed out, these gifts are the gifted persons in Ephesians 4:11. The fact that verses 9 and 10 of Ephesians 4 are in parentheses is further proof that the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers in verse 11 are the gifts given to men in verse 8. All the gifted persons were received by Christ when He ascended to the height, and then He gave them to the church.</p><h2 class="head2">57. The Resurrected Christ<br />
Seated at the Right Hand of Jehovah</h2>
<p>In Psalm 110:1 we have a prophecy regarding the resurrected Christ seated at the right hand of Jehovah: &ldquo;The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.&rdquo; Here the title &ldquo;The Lord&rdquo; is Jehovah in Hebrew. This verse is quoted frequently in the New Testament&mdash;more than ten times as a direct quotation and another ten times indirectly. Altogether, there are more than ten instances in the New Testament where the resurrected Christ is referred to as sitting at the right hand of God. Of course, it was from the time of His ascension that God made Him to sit at His right hand. This is proved by Hebrews 1:3: &ldquo;Having made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the fulfillment of Psalm 110:1, Acts 2:33-35 says, &ldquo;Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He poured out this which you both see and hear. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.&rdquo; Here the first &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; refers to God, and the second, to Christ, whom David called &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo; (Matt. 22:44-45).</p>
<p>Acts 2:34 speaks of the Lord Jesus sitting at God&rsquo;s right hand. Here &ldquo;right hand&rdquo; denotes the position of glory, honor, and power (Exo. 15:6; 1 Kings 2:19; Mark 14:62).</p>
<h2 class="head2">58. The Man Inferior to the Angels,<br />
Crowned with Glory and Honor,<br />
and Set over the Works of God&rsquo;s Hands</h2>
<p>Christ is the Man, inferior to the angels, crowned with glory and honor, and set over the works of God&rsquo;s hands. This is prophesied in Psalm 8:4-6 and fulfilled in Hebrews 2:6-9. The first man Adam, created by God in Genesis 1, failed God in His purpose with man. Then Psalm 8 alludes in the way of prophecy to another man who will replace the first man to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. Hebrews 2 reveals that this other Man, the second Man, who is Jesus, has come and accomplished so much for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s desire in man as revealed in Genesis 1:26 and 28 and alluded to in Psalm 8:4-6. Hence, in whatever Adam as the first man failed, Christ as the second Man succeeded by replacing the first man.</p>
<p>Hebrews 2:9 says, &ldquo;But we see Jesus, who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor.&rdquo; Glory is the splendor related to Jesus&rsquo; person; honor is the preciousness related to Jesus&rsquo; worth, value (1 Pet. 2:7, &ldquo;preciousness&rdquo; in Greek is the same word as &ldquo;honor&rdquo; here), and dignity which is related to His position (2 Pet. 1:17; cf. 1 Pet. 2:17; Rom. 13:7).</p>
<p>After Christ was crowned with glory and honor in His ascension, God gave Him the dominion over all things in His exaltation: &ldquo;You have made Him a little inferior to the angels; You have crowned Him with glory and honor, and have set Him over the works of Your hands&rdquo; (Heb. 2:7). This is similar to what God did with Adam. Adam lost the dominion that God gave to him, but according to the prophecy of Psalm 8, Christ has recovered what Adam lost. Now the same dominion has been given to Him as the second Man. Christ, the second Man, has been glorified, crowned with glory and honor, and entrusted with the divine dominion that was lost by the first man. As a man in the flesh, He was inferior to the angels, yet He was crowned with glory and honor in His ascension. Furthermore, God has set Him over the entire universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">59. The One under Whose Feet<br />
God Has Put All Things</h2>
<p>Christ is also the One under whose feet God has put all things (Psa. 8:6-7; Eph. 1:22). Psalm 8:6b says, &ldquo;Thou hast put all things under his feet.&rdquo; Here the word &ldquo;feet&rdquo; implies the Body, since the feet are parts of the body. God has subjected all things under Christ&rsquo;s feet. On the one hand, the ascended Christ is far above all; on the other hand, all things have been subjected under His feet. The former is Christ&rsquo;s transcendency; the latter is the subjection of all things to Him. This is a matter of subduing power, the power to subdue all things.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FORTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(20)</h1>
<p>This is the last message on Christ&rsquo;s person in the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies.</p>
<h2 class="head2">60. The Coming Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">a. As the Son of Man on the Cloud</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament there are prophecies of four matters related to Christ&rsquo;s coming back. The first is that He will come as the Son of Man on the cloud. Concerning this, Daniel 7:13 says, &ldquo;I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.&rdquo; This prophecy is fulfilled in Matthew 26:64 and Revelation 14:14.</p>
<p>In Matthew 26:64 the Lord Jesus said to the high priest, &ldquo;Henceforth you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.&rdquo; The Lord was the Son of Man on earth before His crucifixion, He is now the Son of Man in the heavens at the right hand of God after His resurrection (Acts 7:56), and He will still be the Son of Man even at His coming back on the clouds. To accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose and to establish the kingdom of the heavens, it was necessary for the Lord to be a man. Without man, God&rsquo;s purpose cannot be carried out and the kingdom of the heavens cannot be constituted on earth.</p>
<p>Revelation 14:14 says, &ldquo;I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud One sitting like the Son of Man, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand.&rdquo; This is a vision of Christ&rsquo;s coming as the Son of Man to reap God&rsquo;s harvest. He came as the Son of Man to sow the seed, and He will come again as the Son of Man to reap what He has sown. As the Son of Man, He is qualified to execute God&rsquo;s judgment on everyone (John 5:27). Therefore, at His coming back on the cloud, the Lord Jesus will still be the Son of Man.</p>
<p>In Revelation 14:14 we see that Christ is sitting on the cloud. This means that he is no longer hidden, that His coming is now public. Prior to this, Christ&rsquo;s coming will be hidden, but now it will be open and visible. In Revelation 10:1 Christ is clothed with the cloud, but in 14:14 He is on the cloud. This corresponds to 1 Thessalonians 4:17 and indicates that Christ&rsquo;s coming back is now made public.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. Setting His Feet upon the Mount of Olives</h2>
<p>When Christ comes back, He will set His feet upon the Mount of Olives. Zechariah 14:4 prophesies of this: &ldquo;His feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.&rdquo; Because the Lord Jesus ascended from the Mount of Olives, He will also return to the Mount of Olives. When the Lord Jesus stands with His feet on the Mount of Olives, the mountain will be cleft, and a highway will be opened for the besieged Jewish people to escape.</p>
<p>Concerning Christ&rsquo;s setting His feet upon the Mount of Olives, Acts 1:10-12 says, &ldquo;As they were looking intently into heaven as He went, behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them, who also said, Men, Galileans, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you beheld Him going into heaven. Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day&rsquo;s journey away.&rdquo; As the disciples were looking intently into heaven, two men in white clothing, who were actually angels, stood beside them and asked the disciples why they were standing looking into heaven. Then they went on to say that the very Jesus who was taken up from them into heaven would come in the same way as they had seen Him going into heaven. This indicates that just as the Lord Jesus ascended physically, He will also come back physically. Christ ascended into heaven by way of a cloud, visible to human sight, and He will come back on the cloud (Matt. 24:30). Furthermore, He ascended from the top of Mount Olivet (Acts 1:12), and He will come back to the same mount. We definitely believe that in His coming back the Lord Jesus will set His feet on Mount Olivet.</p><h2 class="head3">c. With His Saints</h2>
<p>Zechariah 14:5b says, &ldquo;The Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with thee.&rdquo; This is a prophecy of Christ&rsquo;s coming with His saints. Some Bible teachers interpret the saints in this verse as being the angels, as holy ones. Actually, the saints in Zechariah 14:5 denote the Old Testament saints and New Testament saints who will come back with Christ as the Son of Man.</p>
<p>The fulfillment of the prophecy in Zechariah 14:5 is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:14: &ldquo;If we believe that Jesus died and rose, so also those who are asleep will God, through Jesus, bring together with Him.&rdquo; Another verse, 1 Thessalonians 3:13, speaks of &ldquo;the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.&rdquo; These saints are the believers in Christ, including the Old Testament saints (Dan. 7:18, 21-22, 25, 27).</p>
<h2 class="head3">d. With the Kingdom He Received of the Father</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will come with the kingdom He received of the Father. In Daniel 7:14 we have the prophecy concerning this: &ldquo;There was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.&rdquo; This prophecy is fulfilled in Luke 19:12 and 15a. In verse 12 the Lord, in a parable, says, &ldquo;A certain man of noble birth went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.&rdquo; Verse 15a says that &ldquo;he came back, having received the kingdom.&rdquo; The certain man of noble birth signifies the Savior with the highest status, the status of the God-man. The word &ldquo;went&rdquo; signifies the Savior&rsquo;s going to heaven after His death and resurrection (Luke 24:51; 1 Pet. 3:22), and &ldquo;return&rdquo; signifies the Savior&rsquo;s coming back with the kingdom (Rev. 11:15; 2 Tim. 4:1). The kingdom which the Lord will bring with Him at His second coming is the eternal kingdom that God will set up on earth (Dan. 2:44) and which is received from the Ancient of Days and belongs to the Ancient of Days, that is, to God. The kingdom which Christ will establish on earth will be the kingdom of God, the kingdom that is from ancient times, even from eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">61. The Coming Messiah<br />
Seen by Those Who Pierced Him<br />
and Wailed Over by All the Tribes of Israel</h2>
<p>In Zechariah 12:10-14 we have a prophecy of Christ as the coming Messiah seen by those who pierced Him and wailed over by all the tribes of Israel. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.&rdquo; According to this prophecy, the Lord Jesus will pour out His Spirit upon the Jewish people. Then all of the house of Judah will repent and mourn, weeping because of their rebellion against Christ. They will realize that He was the One whom they crucified and pierced on the cross. They will repent and receive Him as their Savior.</p>
<p>As the fulfillment of Zechariah 12:10-14, Revelation 1:7 says, &ldquo;Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him, those also who pierced Him, and all the tribes of the land shall wail over Him.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;land&rdquo; in this verse refers to the Holy Land. All the tribes of the Holy Land will see Christ in the open aspect of His coming back. Revelation 1:7 surely is a reference to Zechariah 12:10-14. The &ldquo;tribes&rdquo; mentioned in Revelation 1:7 are the tribes of those who pierced the Lord Jesus. According to the context of Zechariah 12, the tribes are not all the nations of the earth but the twelve tribes in the Holy Land. Based upon this, we may say that the tribes in Revelation 1:7 are the twelve tribes in the Holy Land. When Christ appears with power and glory to be seen by all in the Holy Land, the twelve tribes will behold Him and weep. In repentance the Jews will wail over Him, the One whom they pierced.</p>
<h2 class="head2">62. The One Coming in the Name<br />
of Jehovah and Blessed by Repentant Israel</h2>
<p>In the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies Christ is the One coming in the name of Jehovah and blessed by repentant Israel. This is prophesied in Psalm 118:26: &ldquo;Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord: we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord.&rdquo; The One coming in the name of the Lord is Christ as the coming Messiah. This verse will have a double fulfillment: at the Lord&rsquo;s first coming and at His coming back. Our emphasis here is on the second fulfillment. This prophecy was first fulfilled when Christ entered the gates of Jerusalem and the people laid their garments before Him and shouted, &ldquo;Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord&rdquo; (Matt. 21:9). But following that, in Matthew 22, the Jewish people rejected Him. Then the Lord said to them, &ldquo;You shall by no means see Me henceforth until you say, Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord&rdquo; (Matt. 23:39). This will be at the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, when the remnant of Israel will turn to believe in Him and be saved (Rom. 11:23, 26). Israel will not see Him again until His second coming. According to Zechariah 12, the remnant of Israel will repent when Christ comes back. Then they will say to Him, &ldquo;Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearly two thousand years have passed, and Israel still has not seen the Lord Jesus. Although He has left the nation of Israel, individual Jews may still come to Him and be saved. When the Jews are persecuted by their enemies at the end of this age, they will cry out to their God. Then Christ will descend and place His feet on the Mount of Olives, which will be cleft like the waters of the Red Sea. This will enable the Jews to escape from persecution. At that time they will repent to the Lord and call upon Him, and the nation will be saved. This salvation will be not only for individuals but for the entire nation.</p><h2 class="head2">63. The Stone Falling on the Gentile Kingdoms<br />
and Scattering Them as Chaff</h2>
<p>Christ will also be the stone falling on the Gentile kingdoms and scattering them as chaff. This is prophesied in Daniel 2:34-35, 44-45. Verses 34 and 35 say, &ldquo;Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.&rdquo; These verses indicate that when Christ comes the second time, He will be a stone cut without hands falling from the heavens upon the great image. The great image signifies the worldly powers from Babylon down to the ten kingdoms of the restored Roman Empire, which will exist at the time of Christ&rsquo;s coming back. Christ will be the smiting stone that will scatter all the broken nations as chaff. Then He will become a great mountain&mdash;the kingdom of God on earth.</p>
<p>In Matthew 21:44 the Lord, referring to the stone in Daniel 2, says that &ldquo;on whomever it falls, it shall scatter him as chaff.&rdquo; Those on whom the stone falls will be the nations which Christ will smite at His coming back. To the believers, Christ is the foundation stone, the building stone, in whom they trust (Isa. 28:16); to the unbelieving Jews, He is the stumbling stone (Isa. 8:14; Rom. 9:33); and to the nations, He will be the smiting stone. We, the believers, experience Christ as the building stone. But the Jews who reject Him and are stumbled by Him will experience Him as the stumbling stone and be broken to pieces. Eventually, the unbelieving Gentiles who fight against God will know Christ as the smiting stone, for He will smite them and scatter them like chaff driven by the wind.</p>
<h2 class="head2">64. The Coming King<br />
Setting Up His Kingdom over All the Earth</h2>
<p>Zechariah 14:9 says, &ldquo;The Lord shall be King over all the earth.&rdquo; This prophecy concerning Christ as the coming King setting up His kingdom over all the earth is fulfilled in Matthew 25:31-34 and 1 Corinthians 15:25. When the Lord comes back, He will save Israel and will smite the Gentile nations and judge them. Then He will set up His kingdom on earth for a thousand years, for the millennium. In the millennium there will be three realms: the realm of the earth, where the blessing of God&rsquo;s creation, as mentioned in Genesis 1:28-30, will take place; the realm of the nation of Israel, from Canaan, from the Nile to the Euphrates, in which the saved Jews will rule over the whole earth (Isa. 60:10-12; Zech. 14:16-18); and the heavenly and spiritual realm (1 Cor. 15:50-52), which will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, where the overcoming believers will enjoy the kingdom reward (Matt. 5:20; 7:21).</p>
<p>Speaking of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, 1 Corinthians 15:25 says, &ldquo;He must reign until He puts all His enemies under His feet.&rdquo; This will be the Lord&rsquo;s reign in the millennium, the last age of the old creation. The longer Christ reigns, the more enemies are put under His feet. Eventually, at the end of the millennium every enemy will have been put under the feet of Christ. The word &ldquo;until&rdquo; in 1 Corinthians 15:25 indicates this and points to the end of the thousand years. That will be the time when every enemy has been put under Christ&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<h2 class="head2">65. A Servant of the Circumcision<br />
for the Truthfulness of God</h2>
<p>Romans 15:8 says, &ldquo;I say that Christ has become a servant of the circumcision for the truthfulness of God, to confirm the promises given to the fathers.&rdquo; The expression &ldquo;the circumcision&rdquo; refers to the Jews, God&rsquo;s covenanted people. &ldquo;Truthfulness&rdquo; denotes genuineness, sincerity, honesty, trustworthiness, and faithfulness as a divine virtue. Romans 15:8 indicates that Christ served the Jews by fulfilling God&rsquo;s promises to their forefathers, and this He did for the truthfulness of God. In order to prove that God is truthful and for the sake of maintaining God&rsquo;s truthfulness, Christ was a Servant to the Jewish people, the circumcision, to fulfill the promises made by God to their forefathers.</p>
<p>We have considered Christ&rsquo;s person in the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies. These prophecies are concerned with Christ from eternity past until the time of the kingdom. The fact that these prophecies are fulfilled in the New Testament is a strong proof that whatever the New Testament reveals is fully of God. Only God can write such a book.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FORTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(21)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall begin to consider Christ&rsquo;s person in the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament. In His wisdom God uses not only prophecies to predict the coming of Christ but also types and figures to portray Christ. Therefore, we can see Christ&rsquo;s person both in the fulfillment of the prophecies and also in the fulfillment of the types and figures in the Old Testament. Because a figure is sometimes used in a prophecy, certain verses may be used both for the fulfillment of a prophecy and for the fulfillment of a figure. We need to learn how to understand the types and figures of Christ in the Old Testament and their fulfillment in the New Testament. We need to know what the Bible says concerning these matters, not according to the natural understanding but according to the spiritual denotation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">O. IN THE FULFILLMENT OF<br />
THE TYPES AND FIGURES OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. Light</h2>
<p>In Genesis 1:3 light is a figure of Christ: &ldquo;God said, Let there be light: and there was light.&rdquo; Light is actually a way, or a means, by which God brings created things into existence. According to Genesis 1, after light came into being, the way was opened for God to bring other things into existence. Light is necessary for generating life. According to the revelation in the Bible, light is for life. All that God created and made is focused on life and is for life. Light and life go together. Thus, for God&rsquo;s work of creation in Genesis 1, there was the need for light. God commanded the light to come, and the light came.</p>
<p>The light in Genesis 1:3 is a type of Christ as the real light. This is revealed especially in the Gospel of John. In John 1:4 and 5 we see that light is Christ, the living Word of God. When Christ comes as the real light to shine in the darkness, the darkness cannot overcome Him. In John 8:12 the Lord says, &ldquo;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&rdquo; In John 9:5 He goes on to say, &ldquo;While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&rdquo; In Genesis light is for the old creation, but in John 1:8 and 12 light is for the new creation. The old creation was brought into existence through physical light, and the new creation is brought into being through Christ as spiritual light. The physical light in Genesis 1, therefore, is a type of Christ as the spiritual light for God&rsquo;s new creation. When we received Christ, He became our life, and this life is now the light of life within us that brings us out of darkness. Furthermore, this light opens our eyes and gives us spiritual sight.</p>
<p>When we called on the name of the Lord Jesus, receiving Him into us, the divine life came into our being. As a result, we had the sense of something shining within, the shining of life. This shining is a strong confirmation that we have been born of God. Having received Christ, who is the expression of God, we now have Him as our life, and this life is the light shining within to enlighten us. Darkness cannot overcome this light or extinguish it; rather, Christ as light dispels the darkness. Christ truly is the light of life for the new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The Tree of Life</h2>
<p>Genesis 2:9 says, &ldquo;Out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.&rdquo; Here the tree of life is not a type but a figure signifying God in Christ as our life. God&rsquo;s desire to be our life cannot easily be expressed in plain words. Therefore, in Genesis 2:9 He uses a figure&mdash;the tree of life&mdash;to signify this desire. The tree of life signifies the Triune God in Christ to dispense Himself into His chosen people as their generating life. In Genesis 2 we have the figure, but in the New Testament we have the fulfillment of this figure.</p>
<p>The tree of life is the center of the universe. According to the purpose of God, the earth is the center of the universe, the Garden of Eden is the center of the earth, and the tree of life is the center of the Garden of Eden. Hence, the universe is centered on the tree of life. Nothing is more central and crucial to both God and man than the tree of life. The tree of life in the garden was an indicator that God desires to be our life in the form of food.</p>
<p>The New Testament reveals Christ as the fulfillment of the figure of the tree of life. Speaking of Christ, John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life.&rdquo; Since John 1:3 refers to the creation in Genesis 1, the mention of life in verse 4 should refer to the life indicated by the tree of life in Genesis 2. This is confirmed by John&rsquo;s mention of the tree of life in Revelation 22. The life displayed by the tree of life in Genesis 2 was the life incarnated in Christ. The Lord told us that He Himself is life (John 14:6). Furthermore, John 15 reveals that Christ is a tree, the vine tree. On the one hand, He is a tree; on the other hand, He is life. If we put together John 1:4 and 15:5, we shall realize that Christ is the tree of life. The fact that He said in John 6 that He is the bread of life indicates that He has come to us as the tree of life in the form of food. Therefore, Christ, the embodiment of God, is the tree of life.</p>
<p>Concerning Christ as the fulfillment of the figure of the tree of life in Genesis 2:9, Revelation 2:7 says, &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.&rdquo; It was God&rsquo;s original intention that man should eat of the tree of life. Due to the fall, the tree of life was closed to man (Gen. 3:22-24). Through the redemption of Christ, the way to touch the tree of life, which is God Himself in Christ as life to man, has been opened again (Heb. 10:19-20). However, in the church&rsquo;s degradation religion crept in with its knowledge to distract the believers in Christ from eating Him as the tree of life. Hence, in Revelation 2:7 the Lord promises to grant the overcomers to eat of Himself as the tree of life. The word for &ldquo;tree&rdquo; in Revelation 2:7, as in 1 Peter 2:24, is &ldquo;wood&rdquo; in Greek, not the usual word used for tree. We have seen that the tree of life refers to Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God to be our life in the form of food. Here in Revelation 2:7 this expression refers to the crucified (implied in the tree as a piece of wood&mdash;1 Peter 2:24) and resurrected (implied in the <em>zoe</em> life&mdash;John 11:25) Christ who is in the church today, the consummation of which will be the New Jerusalem, in which the crucified and resurrected Christ will be the tree of life for the enjoyment of all God&rsquo;s redeemed people for eternity (Rev. 22:2, 14). The eating of the tree of life not only was God&rsquo;s original intention concerning man; it will also be the eternal issue of Christ&rsquo;s redemption. For eternity God&rsquo;s redeemed people will enjoy the tree of life as their portion.</p>
<p>Revelation 22:2 says, &ldquo;On this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life.&rdquo; The tree of life growing on the two sides of the river indicates that the tree of life is a vine, spreading and proceeding along the flow of the water of life for God&rsquo;s people to receive and enjoy. It fulfills, for eternity, what God intended from the beginning. In eternity God&rsquo;s redeemed people will enjoy the tree of life; that is, they will enjoy Christ, the Son of God, the redeeming Lamb, as their eternal life supply.</p>
<p>Revelation 22:14a says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life.&rdquo; After his creation, man was put before the tree of life as an indication that he was privileged to partake of this tree. But because of the fall of man, the way to the tree of life was shut to man by God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness (Gen. 3:24). Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, which has fulfilled the requirements of God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness, the way to the tree of life has been opened again to the believers. Hence, the believers who wash their robes in the redeeming blood of Christ have the right to enjoy the tree of life as their eternal portion.</p><h2 class="head2">3. Adam</h2>
<p>Adam is a type of Christ (Gen. 2:7; 1 Cor. 15:45, 47; Rom. 5:14). In Romans 5:14 we are told that Adam was a &ldquo;type of the coming One,&rdquo; Christ. Adam was the head of the old collective man (mankind). Whatever he did and whatever happened to him is participated in by all mankind. In this respect he is the type of Christ, who is the Head of the new corporate man (the church, Eph. 2:15-16). Whatever He did and whatever happened to Him is also participated in by all the members of His Body, the church (Eph. 1:22-23).</p>
<p>Adam was the first man (1 Cor. 15:47) and also the first Adam (1 Cor. 15:45). Adam was created by God and had nothing of the life and nature of God. He was merely God&rsquo;s creation, a work of His hand.</p>
<p>Christ is the second Man and the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:47, 45). He is the last man, and after Him there is no third man, for the second Man is the last Adam. Following Him there is not a third Adam. This second Man was not created by God. Rather, He is a man mingled with God. He is God incarnated to be a man. The first man had nothing of the nature and life of God, for He was merely God&rsquo;s creation. The second Man is the mingling of God with His creature, full of the nature and life of God. He is a man mingled with God, a God-man. The fullness of the Godhead is embodied in Him (Col. 2:9; John 1:16).</p>
<p>As the last Adam Christ is the end of the old race, the end of mankind in the old creation. As the second Man Christ is the beginning of another race, the start of a new man. There is no second Adam, only the last Adam. In the sight of God there is one Adam beginning from Adam and ending with the man Jesus. Therefore, the first Adam is the beginning of mankind, and the last Adam is the ending of mankind.</p>
<p>The time from Christ&rsquo;s incarnation until His resurrection was a transitory period involving a transition from the old man or race to the new race. The second Man was born through incarnation, but He was reborn through resurrection. In incarnation Christ was born to be the second Man and also took upon Himself the old man. Then the old man was terminated at the cross, and the second Man was reborn in resurrection. It is for this reason that we may speak of Christ first as being the last Adam and then as the second Man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">4. The Sacrifice Affording<br />
the Coats of Skins for Adam and Eve</h2>
<p>In the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament Christ is the sacrifice affording the coats of skins for Adam and Eve. &ldquo;Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them&rdquo; (Gen. 3:21). In this verse we see an anticipation of the redemption that was to be accomplished thousands of years later. Adam and Eve were in a situation that needed redemption. Knowing that they were fallen and sinful, they tried to cover themselves with garments made of fig leaves (Gen. 3:7). Then God came in to deal with the situation, promising that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent (v. 15). Then God made coats of skins and clothed them. The expression &ldquo;coats of skins&rdquo; implies that some kind of sacrifice, probably a lamb, was slain for them. That sacrifice was a type of Christ as our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30) to cover us with Himself.</p>
<p>For God to make coats of skins for Adam and Eve and clothe them means that He justified them. To be justified means to be covered with the righteousness of God, which is Christ Himself. For Adam and Eve to be under the coats of skins signified that they were in Christ, for the coat is a clear type of Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness (Phil. 3:9) to cover us. Therefore, figuratively speaking, Adam and Eve were in Christ.</p>
<p>The sacrifice that produced the coats of skins to Adam and Eve was slain as their substitute. The putting on of the coats of skins was based on the shedding of the blood of the sacrifice. The sacrificial lamb was their substitute. Then after God covered them with a coat of lamb&rsquo;s skins, they became one with the lamb. As sinners they became one with the substitute. This is a matter of union, and union brings about the effectiveness of substitution, for without union substitution stands alone. Substitution does not have anything to do with us until we enter into a union with the substitute. Once we participate in such a union, whatever the substitute has accomplished is ours. Christ has done everything for us on the cross, but without union all that He has accomplished is not related to us. But when we become one with Christ through believing in Him, whatever He accomplished on the cross becomes ours. Therefore, union brings in the effectiveness of substitution.</p>
<p>In Galatians 2:17 and 3:27 we have the fulfillment of the type in Genesis 3:21. Galatians 2:17 speaks of &ldquo;seeking to be justified in Christ.&rdquo; Galatians 3:27 says, &ldquo;As many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; To believe is to believe into Christ (John 3:16), and to be baptized is to be baptized also into Christ. By both faith and baptism we have been immersed into Christ, having thus put on Christ and become identified with Him.</p>
<p>To put on Christ by being baptized into Christ is to clothe ourselves with Christ, to put on Christ as a garment. On the one hand, in baptism we are immersed into Christ; on the other hand, in baptism we put on Christ. When a person is immersed into Christ, he automatically puts on Christ as his clothing. This means that the baptized one has become one with Christ, having been immersed into Him and having become clothed with Him.</p>
<p>To be baptized into Christ is to enter into an organic union with the Triune God. In order to experience this organic union, we need to believe into Christ and to be baptized into Him. Believing and being baptized are two parts of one step. First we believe into Christ, then we are baptized into Him. By believing in Christ we enter into Him. We believe ourselves <em>into</em> Him and thereby experience an organic union with Him, becoming one spirit with Him. In addition to believing into Christ, which is inward and subjective, we also need to be baptized into Him, an act which is outward and objective. Through the inward action of believing and the outward action of being baptized we make one complete step to enter into the Triune God. The step which begins with believing into Christ is completed by being baptized into Him. In this way there takes place in full an organic union between the believers and the Triune God. In this union we are truly clothed with Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">5. The Ark</h2>
<p>According to 1 Peter 3:20-21, the ark made by Noah and into which he and his family entered is a type of Christ. In Genesis 6:14-16 we see that the ark had three stories, that it was made of gopher wood, and that it was pitched within and without with pitch. The ark&rsquo;s three stories signify the Triune God. Hence, in the ark we have a type of the Three of the Godhead. This indicates that the Triune God is in Christ, mingled with human nature typified by the wood used in the ark&rsquo;s construction.</p>
<p>The ark was made of gopher wood, which is a cypress full of resin. This resinous wood can withstand the attack of water. In the Scriptures cypress signifies the crucified Christ, who can withstand the waters of death. He tasted death, and death could not damage Him. The ark made of gopher wood passed through the waters, but no damage was incurred. This signifies the solidness of Christ as the crucified One. Christ is the real gopher wood, the real cypress full of resin and strong to withstand the waters of death.</p>
<p>The ark made by Noah was pitched within and without with pitch (Gen. 6:14). The Hebrew for &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; has the same root as the Hebrew word for atonement. The main meaning of this Hebrew word is to cover. The word for the cover of the ark of the testimony, the mercy seat, also comes from this same root. The entire ark was pitched with atonement. This indicates that in Christ, who fulfills the type of the ark, we have the full covering of His redemption.</p>
<p>Genesis 7:13 says, &ldquo;In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah&rsquo;s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark.&rdquo; Noah and his family could not have been saved outside of the ark. They were saved because they entered into the ark. The entering in of Noah and his family into the ark is a type of our entering into Christ. Only by entering into Christ can we be saved.</p>
<p>The ark was for the salvation not only of man but also for the salvation of all living creatures (Gen. 7:13-23). According to Hebrews 2:9, Christ tasted death &ldquo;on behalf of everything.&rdquo; This reveals that Christ&rsquo;s redemption was accomplished not only for mankind but for everything created by God. For this reason, Colossians 1:20 says that God has reconciled all things to Himself through Christ. This is clearly typified by the redemption of Noah&rsquo;s ark, in which not only eight persons but also the living things created by God were saved. The fact that creatures as well as human beings were in the ark indicates that Christ accomplished an all-inclusive death for every creature. Therefore, the ark was not only for the salvation of man but for the salvation of all living creatures.</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. Melchisedec</h2>
<p>Another type of Christ is Melchisedec (Gen. 14:18-20). Genesis 14:18 says, &ldquo;Melchisedec king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.&rdquo; Salem means &ldquo;peace,&rdquo; and Melchisedec means &ldquo;king of righteousness.&rdquo; Melchisedec is a type of Christ as God&rsquo;s High Priest. This is not revealed in Genesis 14, but it is found in Psalm 110, where we are told that God&rsquo;s anointed One, the Christ, is the Priest according to the order of Melchisedec, an order that is prior to that of Aaron. The Aaronic priesthood dealt with sin, taking care of things on the negative side. The ministry of Melchisedec, on the contrary, is positive. Melchisedec did not appear to Abraham with an offering to take away sin, but with bread and wine to nourish him. Nearly all Christians consider Christ as the High Priest who takes away sin, but few pay attention to Christ as the High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec. As such a High Priest, Christ does not take away sin, but ministers to us the processed God, signified by the bread and wine, as our nourishment.</p>
<p>In Hebrews 6:20&mdash;7:3 we have the fulfillment of the type in Genesis 14:18-20. Christ is &ldquo;forever a High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec&rdquo; (Heb. 6:20). Christ&rsquo;s purification of sins is typified by the work of Aaron, whereas His sitting down on the right hand of the Majesty on high (Heb. 1:3) is according to the order of Melchisedec (Psa. 110:1, 4). Christ&rsquo;s work on the cross typified by the work of Aaron affords us forgiveness of sin. His ministry on the throne in heaven ministers to us the heavenly supply for the overcoming of sin.</p>
<p>Whenever most Christians speak about Christ as our High Priest, they have the concept that He is the High Priest who sacrifices to God for our sins. This, of course, is correct, but it is on the negative side. Christ as the High Priest offering sacrifices to God is typified by Aaron. That was in the past. Today Christ is no longer offering sacrifices for sin; instead, He is ministering the Triune God to us as our supply. In the past Christ offered sacrifices to God for our sins as typified by Aaron. Today He is ministering the Triune God to us as our supply according to the order of Melchisedec. This is proved by the coming of Melchisedec to Abraham. As the priest of the Most High God, Melchisedec did not offer sacrifices to God for Abraham&rsquo;s sin; he ministered bread and wine to him. As indicated by the symbols of the Lord&rsquo;s table, in the Bible bread and wine signify the processed God as our supply. Our High Priest, Christ, is not according to the order of Aaron offering sacrifices to God. He is according to the order of Melchisedec ministering the processed God to us.</p>
<p>Melchisedec was a king, and his name means king of righteousness. In Isaiah 32:1 this title refers to the Lord Jesus. Christ is the King of righteousness, today&rsquo;s Melchisedec. As the King of righteousness Christ has made all things right with God and with one another. He has reconciled us to God and has appeased God for us. Righteousness issues in peace (Isa. 32:17). By His righteousness Christ has brought forth the fruit of peace.</p>
<p>Melchisedec is also the king of Salem, which means the king of peace, signifying that Christ is also the King of peace (Isa. 9:6). As the King of peace through righteousness, Christ has brought in peace between God and us. In peace He fulfills the ministry of His priesthood, ministering God to us for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>According to the type in Genesis 14, after Melchisedec, the king of righteousness and the king of peace, came, there was righteousness and peace. In such an environment and condition of righteousness and peace Melchisedec ministered the bread and wine to the victor. This portrays the ministry of Christ, our kingly High Priest.</p>
<p>Our kingly High Priest is perpetual, eternal, without beginning or ending. Hebrews 7:3 says of Melchisedec that he is &ldquo;without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually.&rdquo; Because our Melchisedec is eternal, He has no genealogy. This also is a fulfillment of the type in Genesis 14. For all the important persons in Genesis there is a genealogy, but not for Melchisedec. In the divine writing the Holy Spirit sovereignly gave no account of the beginning of his days or of the end of his life so that he might be a proper type of Christ as the eternal One to be our High Priest perpetually. This is like the presentation in the Gospel of John of the Son of God, who, being eternal, has no genealogy (John 1:1). But as the Son of Man Christ has a genealogy (Matt. 1:1-17; Luke 3:23-38). It is such a Christ who is the High Priest ministering the processed God to us as our daily supply. He is the perpetual One, the constant One, the eternal One, having no beginning of days nor end of life.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FORTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(22)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall consider further Christ&rsquo;s person in the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">7. Isaac, the Son of Abraham</h2>
<p>Isaac, the son of Abraham, is a type of Christ (Gen. 17:21; Matt. 1:1). Isaac was Abraham&rsquo;s son. A son is one who comes out of the father and who inherits all that the father is and has. This was Isaac&rsquo;s history. He was out of the father, and he inherited everything of the father. Isaac inherited all things from his father (Gen. 24:36; 25:5). It was by grace, not by effort, that Isaac became the heir of the father&rsquo;s riches. He was not required to do anything in order to inherit these riches, and he did not do anything for the inheritance. It was absolutely and unconditionally of grace that Isaac inherited all of his father&rsquo;s riches. In this Isaac is a type of Christ. The Lord Jesus, as the Son of God, came out of the Father (John 16:28) and inherited all that the Father is and has (John 16:15).</p>
<p>In addition to inheriting the riches of his father, Isaac secured a choice bride, Rebekah (Gen. 24:61-67). He gained her without doing anything. As he was meditating in the field, Rebekah was brought to him. Isaac was not a doing person; he was an enjoying person. His father and his servant did everything to secure a bride for him. Isaac did not even go to Rebekah; Rebekah came to him. Rebekah, the wife of Isaac, is a type of the church. As the real Isaac, Christ has inherited all that the Father is and has, and He has obtained the church, the real Rebekah (Eph. 5:31-32).</p>
<h2 class="head2">8. The Lamb Provided by God</h2>
<p>Christ also fulfills the type of the lamb provided by God. In Genesis 22:8 Abraham prophesied that God would provide a lamb for a burnt offering. Genesis 22:13 and 14 say, &ldquo;Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.&rdquo; In the Bible horns signify fighting power. Christ has fighting power, but His &ldquo;horns&rdquo; were caught by a &ldquo;thicket,&rdquo; which signifies humanity. We are the thicket, and Christ, the Lamb of God, was &ldquo;caught&rdquo; in us and could not escape. As the Lamb of God, Christ was willing to have His horns caught by humanity so that He might be offered as our Substitute.</p>
<p>According to Genesis 22, the lamb that replaced Isaac was provided by Jehovah-jireh. This title has two meanings: Jehovah will provide and Jehovah will see. Here we have both provision and vision. Within the Lord&rsquo;s provision we have vision. What provision and what vision we have at the cross!</p>
<p>The ram provided by God in Genesis 22 typifies Christ as our Substitute. As the ram was killed in place of Isaac, so the Lamb of God suffered crucifixion for us. The ram killed for Isaac typifies Christ, the Lamb of God, who was crucified for us. We should have gone to the cross, but God replaced us with the Lamb as our Substitute (1 Pet. 3:18).</p>
<p>In 1 Peter 1:19-20 we have the fulfillment of the type of the ram provided by God. Verse 19 refers to Christ as &ldquo;a lamb without blemish and without spot.&rdquo; We can see from the typology in the Old Testament that the animal sacrifices were to be without blemish and without spot. For example, a sheep that was to be offered as a sin offering had to be without blemish, without mixture; it also had to be without spot, without any wound. The sheep offered as a sin offering was spotless and perfect.</p>
<p>Among all the human beings who have lived on earth only the Lord Jesus is without blemish and without spot. Actually the words &ldquo;without blemish and without spot&rdquo; in 1 Peter 1:19 are Old Testament terms used with respect to sacrifices offered to God. This verse indicates that Christ is the real sacrifice to be our sin offering and trespass offering. He was offered for the redemption of the sins of God&rsquo;s people. As the Lamb without blemish and without spot, He shed His precious blood to redeem us.</p>
<p>First Peter 1:20 goes on to say that Christ, the Lamb provided by God, &ldquo;was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in the last times for your sake.&rdquo; Christ was foreordained, prepared, by God to be His redeeming Lamb (John 1:29) for His elect according to His foreknowledge before the foundation of the world. This was done according to God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and plan; it did not happen accidentally. Hence, in the eternal view of God, from the foundation of the world, that is, since the fall of man as a part of the world, Christ was slain (Rev. 13:8).</p><h2 class="head2">9. The Ladder in Jacob&rsquo;s Dream</h2>
<p>When Jacob was fleeing from his brother, he slept one night in the open air, using a stone for a pillow. &ldquo;And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it&rdquo; (Gen. 28:12). When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he said, &ldquo;How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven&rdquo; (v. 17). In this dream the ladder did not come down from heaven but was already on earth. Unlike Peter in Acts 10:9-16, Jacob did not see something coming down; he saw something that was already on earth. We are not told that the ladder reached the earth, but that it was &ldquo;set up on the earth&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the top of it reached to heaven.&rdquo; Furthermore, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.</p>
<p>In John 1:51 Christ is the fulfillment of the ladder which Jacob saw. Jesus said to Nathanael, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&rdquo; Christ is the One who brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven. According to our concept, Christ has gone away from the earth. But according to God&rsquo;s concept, Christ has been set up on earth, and no one can move Him. Our Christ, who is the ladder bringing heaven to earth and joining earth to heaven, is now not only in heaven but also on earth. Christ has been set up on earth and He is reaching into heaven for the purpose of coming to us and joining us to Him.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word to Nathanael is the fulfillment of Jacob&rsquo;s dream. Christ, as the Son of Man with His humanity, is the ladder that is set up on earth and leads to heaven, keeping heaven open to earth and joining earth to heaven for the house of God. As the universal ladder, Christ brings heaven to earth and joins earth to heaven and thereby makes God and man one. On this ladder the angels of God ascend and descend as they do their service &ldquo;for the sake of those who are about to inherit salvation&rdquo; (Heb. 1:14). Here we enjoy Christ as the ladder that joins us to heaven and brings heaven to us so that we may be a heavenly people living a heavenly life on earth and inheriting all the heavenly things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">10. Joseph&mdash;the Father&rsquo;s Beloved</h2>
<p>There is not a word in the Bible saying that Joseph was a type of Christ. However, if we read the book of Genesis carefully, we shall see not only that Joseph was a type of Christ but that his biography is virtually the biography of Christ. Joseph&rsquo;s biography indicates that he had no defects. According to the record, he was perfect. In the Bible Joseph is the perfect one in the Old Testament, and Jesus is the perfect One in the New Testament. The four Gospels reveal that the Lord Jesus is perfect, without defect.</p>
<p>Some Bible teachers say that we should consider as types only those persons and things in the Old Testament that the New Testament clearly indicates are types. However, we should not be bound by such a man-made teaching. Even those who hold this concept make an exception in the case of Joseph, thus breaking their own rule. Although the New Testament does not say explicitly that Joseph was a type of Christ, no one in the Old Testament was a more exact type of Christ than Joseph was. This indicates that certain things in the Old Testament are types which are not referred to as types in the New Testament. In many aspects Joseph was a type of Christ: in being a shepherd, in being sent by the father to minister to his brothers according to the father&rsquo;s will, in being hated by his brothers and betrayed by them, in being delivered into the prison of death, in being with two criminals, one of whom was saved and the other of whom perished.</p>
<p>In particular, Joseph was a type of Christ as the Father&rsquo;s Beloved. Genesis 37:3 says, &ldquo;Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age.&rdquo; The fulfillment is in Matthew 3:17: &ldquo;Behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight.&rdquo; This was the Father&rsquo;s testimony concerning Christ as His beloved Son.</p>
<p>Joseph was also a type of Christ as the Dispenser of rich food to His people. Joseph was the dispenser, the distributor, of the rich food of Pharaoh. As one who distributed food to the people, he was a good steward carrying out a stewardship. Christ is the real Joseph. He is the real Dispenser of the rich food of our God.</p><h2 class="head2">11. The Lion of Judah</h2>
<p>In Genesis 49:9 we have the type of the lion of Judah: &ldquo;Judah is a young lion: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he couches, he lies down as a lion&rdquo; (lit.). We need to see the picture portrayed here. A lion dwells on the mountain. When he goes after some prey, he descends from the mountain. As he is waiting to seize his prey, he couches. But after he has taken his prey, he brings it up to the mountain with him. Thus, the words, &ldquo;from the prey, my son, thou art gone up,&rdquo; indicate that the lion has gone up the mountain to devour his prey. After eating it, the lion couches, that is, lies down in satisfaction.</p>
<p>We need to apply this picture to Christ. Christ was first the young lion crouching as He waited for His prey. After seizing the prey, He brought His captive to the heavens, where He enjoyed him. Hence, the figure of the couching lion describes Christ as the One enjoying His rest in the heavens. After gaining the victory and enjoying the prey, He was satisfied. Now He is resting in the heavens in His satisfaction. This satisfaction is the result of Christ&rsquo;s victory over the enemy. Christ went to the cross and there defeated His enemies. Then in resurrection He led a train of vanquished foes to the heavens for His enjoyment (Eph. 4:8). Now in the heavens He is resting.</p>
<p>The fulfillment of the figure in Genesis 49:9 is in Revelation 5:5, where we are told that Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, has overcome. Here the Lion is a symbol of Christ, portraying Him as a strong fighter against the enemy. Christ is the fighting, victorious, and overcoming Lion. As the Lion, Christ has defeated Satan, the enemy of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">12. Moses</h2>
<p>Christ is also typified by Moses (Exo. 3:4; Heb. 3:1-6). Moses is a type of Christ as our Apostle, the sent One. When the children of Israel were suffering persecution under the tyranny of Pharaoh, God appeared to Moses and charged him to go to the children of Israel and to Pharaoh. Thus, Moses became an Old Testament apostle. Moses was God&rsquo;s sent one, the apostle who was to take Israel out of Egypt and lead them through the wilderness for the purpose that they might be constituted God&rsquo;s house and be formed into a habitation of God on earth. This habitation of God was symbolized by the tabernacle made by the children of Israel in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Christ is the first Apostle in the New Testament. He is the One who was sent to us from God and with God (John 6:46; 8:16, 29). As the Apostle typified by Moses, Christ came to us with God to share God with us so that we may partake of the divine life, nature, and fullness.</p>
<p>No matter how much Moses prefigured Christ, he was still only a part of the house, whereas Christ is the Builder of God&rsquo;s house (Heb. 3:3). As God&rsquo;s sent one to take care of God&rsquo;s house, Moses was faithful to God in all His house. This typifies that Christ, as the Apostle from God for God&rsquo;s house, is faithful to Him who constituted Him (Heb. 3:2). Moses was an apostle sent from God to constitute God&rsquo;s house on earth, and Christ was also the Apostle doing the same thing. However, Christ is not only part of the building&mdash;He is also the Builder. Christ, therefore, is superior to Moses.</p>
<h2 class="head2">13. The Passover,<br />
Including the Passover Lamb</h2>
<p>The Passover portrayed in Exodus 12 is a clear type of Christ in redemption (vv. 3-11; 1 Cor. 5:7). The word &ldquo;Passover&rdquo; indicates that the judgment of God passes over us. In Exodus 12:13 the Lord says, &ldquo;When I see the blood, I will pass over you.&rdquo; Eventually, the Passover became a proper noun in English, a noun that has its source in the words &ldquo;pass over&rdquo; in Exodus 12:13.</p>
<p>The Passover is a type of Christ. In 1 Corinthians 5:7 Paul says that Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us. Here Paul does not say that Christ is our Lamb; he says that Christ is our Passover. Christ is not only the Lamb; He is every aspect of the Passover. In Exodus 12 the lamb, the bread, and the bitter herbs are all related to Christ. In principle, therefore, Christ is not only the Lamb of the Passover but the very Passover itself. In order to be our Passover, Christ was sacrificed on the cross for our redemption and reconciliation to God. Now we may enjoy Him as a feast before God.</p>
<p>According to Exodus 12, God passed over the children of Israel because the blood of the Passover lamb had been sprinkled on the lintel and the doorposts of their houses. The house was to be their covering under which and in which they could eat the flesh of the Passover lamb. When God saw the blood sprinkled on the lintel and the doorposts, He passed over the children of Israel. Hence, this passing over was due to the sprinkled blood. According to Paul, however, the Passover is related not only to the blood but to Christ Himself. First Corinthians 1:30 says that we are in Christ. Because we are in Christ, He Himself becomes our Passover. Our Passover is based on Christ. This is the reason Paul could say that Christ is our Passover.</p>
<p>The items of the Passover in Exodus 12 include not only the lamb, the flesh, the blood, the unleavened bread, and the herbs but also the house. The house here is a type of Christ in which and by which the children of Israel were covered. Because Christ is the house that covers us, He is our Passover.</p>
<p>As typified by the lamb in Exodus 12, Christ, our Passover Lamb, is without blemish. Exodus 12:5 says, &ldquo;Your lamb shall be without blemish.&rdquo; To be without blemish is to be perfect. This signifies that Christ is perfect, without fault (John 8:46).</p>
<p>Exodus 12:5 goes on to say that the lamb had to be &ldquo;a male of the first year.&rdquo; To be of the first year is to be fresh and not to be used for any other purpose. In the sight of God, when Christ was on the cross, He was of the first year. He was fresh, never having been used for another purpose.</p>
<p>Just as the Passover lamb was examined for four days (Exo. 12:3, 6), so Christ was examined for the same period of time. After He was arrested, the Lord was subjected to six examinations, three at the hands of the priests, who examined Him according to the law of God, and three under the Roman rulers, who tested Him according to Roman law. Eventually, Pilate declared three times that he found no fault whatever in Him (John 18:38; 19:4, 6).</p>
<p>Speaking of the Passover lamb, Exodus 12:6 says, &ldquo;The whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.&rdquo; Christ was killed by the congregation of God&rsquo;s people. This means that we all had a part in killing Him.</p>
<p>Exodus 12:7 says, &ldquo;They shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side posts and on the upper door posts of the houses, wherein they shall eat it&rdquo; (lit). The blood put on the lintel and on the doorposts was for redemption. This blood typifies the redeeming blood of Christ (Matt. 26:28; John 19:34; 1 Pet. 1:18-19). As the children of Israel applied the Passover lamb, they were in houses that had been sprinkled with the blood of the lamb. This indicates that redemption is based on union. The blood of Christ cannot redeem us unless we are in union with Him.</p>
<p>In Exodus 12:8-10 we see that the flesh of the Passover lamb was to be eaten for life supply. The same is true of Christ as the fulfillment of the type. The Gospel of John says that the flesh of Christ is edible. In John 6:53 the Lord Jesus tells us that we need to eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and in verse 55 He declares, &ldquo;My flesh is true food.&rdquo; Flesh here signifies the life of Christ. The life of Christ is edible; it is our life supply.</p>
<p>In Exodus 12:8 the children of Israel were given the proper way to eat the flesh of the Passover lamb: roasted with fire. Fire here signifies God&rsquo;s holy wrath exercised in judgment. When Christ was on the cross, the holy fire of God judged Him and consumed Him. He cried, &ldquo;I thirst&rdquo; (John 19:28) because He was being burned by the holy fire of God&rsquo;s judgment. On the cross Christ suffered for us under God&rsquo;s judgment. He was &ldquo;burned&rdquo; and &ldquo;roasted&rdquo; by the holy fire of God&rsquo;s wrath. As our Redeemer, Christ was judged for us.</p><h2 class="head2">14. The Unleavened Bread</h2>
<p>Another type of Christ is the unleavened bread (Exo. 12:8, 15, 17-20; 1 Cor. 5:8). The children of Israel were to observe the feast of unleavened bread as a continuation of the feast of Passover (Exo. 12:15-20; 13:6-7). Exodus 12:18 says, &ldquo;In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.&rdquo; The feast of the Passover lasted just one day. It was held on the fourteenth day of the first month, the month Abib. Continuing from the feast of the Passover, there was another feast, the feast of unleavened bread, which lasted seven days. Therefore, the feast of unleavened bread was a continuation of the feast of Passover. In the Bible seven days indicate a complete course of time, a whole period of time. Hence, the seven days of the feast of unleavened bread signify the course of our life on earth.</p>
<p>Eating unleavened bread indicates that God&rsquo;s people should not live in sin, that is, should not live a sinful life. Unleavened bread typifies Christ as the source and supply of a sinless life. In the Bible leaven signifies what is sinful, evil, corrupt, and unclean in the sight of God. In 1 Corinthians 5:8 Paul speaks of the &ldquo;leaven of malice and evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 5:8 we have the fulfillment of the type of unleavened bread: &ldquo;Let us therefore keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and evil, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.&rdquo; The feast here refers to the feast of unleavened bread as the continuation of the Passover. As the unleavened bread, Christ is the spiritual and divine food that makes us unleavened. We have pointed out that the feast of unleavened bread lasted seven days, a period of completion, signifying the entire period of our Christian life from the day of our conversion to the day of rapture. This is a long feast, which we must keep, not with the sin of our old nature, the old leaven, but with unleavened bread, which is the Christ of our new nature as our nourishment and enjoyment. Only He is the life supply of sincerity and truth, absolutely pure, without mixture, and full of reality. The feast is a time for the enjoyment of a banquet, for a feast involves both eating and enjoyment. Whenever we eat without having enjoyment as the purpose of our eating, that eating is common. But when we eat for enjoyment, our eating becomes a feast. As indicated by Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Corinthians 5:8, the entire Christian life should be such a feast, such an enjoyment of Christ as our banquet, the rich supply of life.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 5:7 and 8 we have two feasts&mdash;the feast of Passover and the feast of unleavened bread. When we were saved, we enjoyed the feast of the Passover. Now throughout our Christian life we should enjoy the feast of unleavened bread. According to 1 Corinthians 5:8, the Christian life is a feast of unleavened bread, a feast of the enjoyment of Christ as our life supply without any leaven. Day by day we need to keep the feast of unleavened bread. We should keep this feast throughout the course of our Christian life until we see the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">15. The Manna</h2>
<p>In Exodus 16 manna is a type of Christ. Verse 31 says, &ldquo;The house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.&rdquo; Concerning manna, Moses said to the people, &ldquo;This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat&rdquo; (Exo. 16:15). Manna is a type of Christ as the heavenly food that enables God&rsquo;s people to go His way. In John 6:31-35 we see that Christ is the fulfillment of the type of manna.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;manna&rdquo; means &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; (Exo. 16:15). The manna that the children of Israel ate in the wilderness was different from the other foods they had known, for it was unlike any foodstuff on earth. When the people saw it they asked, &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; In color, shape, appearance, taste, and in every other aspect it was absolutely different from anything they had ever seen before. The fact that the word manna means &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; indicates that manna was a mystery. In describing manna, the Bible likens it to certain things. For example, Exodus 16:14 says that manna was as small as the hoar frost on the ground, and verse 31 says that it was like coriander seed and that its taste was like wafers made with honey. The Bible does not actually tell us what manna was because manna is mysterious.</p>
<p>As the real manna, Christ is mysterious; He cannot be explained scientifically. What is Christ? Christ is &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; He is extraordinary, so special that He cannot be ranked with anything else. Because Christ is mysterious, we cannot explain Him. As manna, Christ is indeed a mystery.</p>
<p>Chapter six of the Gospel of John unveils Christ as the real manna, as the heavenly food given to us by God. In verse 32, He says, &ldquo;My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.&rdquo; Then in verse 35 He declares, &ldquo;I am the bread of life.&rdquo; As the bread of life, Christ is the bread that came down out of heaven (vv. 41, 50, 51, and 58). He is the bread of God (v. 33), He is the living bread (v. 51), and He is the true bread (v. 32). Here we have five characteristics of Christ as our manna, our bread: heavenly bread, the bread of God, the bread of life, the living bread, and the true bread. As the bread that came down out of heaven, He is the heavenly bread. As the bread of God, He is of God, He was sent by God, and He was with God. As the bread of life, He is the bread with eternal life, with <em>zoe.</em> As the living bread, He is living. The bread of life refers to the nature of the bread, which is life; the living bread refers to the condition of the bread, which is living. As the true bread, Christ is the bread of truth or reality. Christ is true, real. He is the true food, and all other kinds of food are merely shadows of Him as the real food. Christ is the true bread of life sent by God to bring us eternal life.</p>
<p>As our manna, Christ is actually the tree of life. In Exodus 16 and John 6 the tree of life appears by the name of manna. In the Bible manna and the tree of life are interchangeable. This indicates that the manna in Exodus 16 was the tree of life in Genesis 2, and that the manna in John 6 will be the tree of life in Revelation 22. Manna and the tree of life are different terms to describe one thing. God does not have two different kinds of food for His chosen people. Because there is one God, there is also just one kind of food. Christ is our tree of life and our manna for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">16. The Rock with the Living Water</h2>
<p>Exodus 17:6 says, &ldquo;Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.&rdquo; The rock here is a type of Christ. In typology Moses signifies the law, and the rod represents the power and authority of the law. The smiting of the rock by the rod signifies that Christ was smitten by the authority of God&rsquo;s law. In the sight of God the Lord Jesus was put to death not by the Jews but by the law of God. During the first three hours of His crucifixion, Christ suffered under the hand of man. But during the last three hours, He suffered because He was smitten by the power of God&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>The water flowing out of the smitten rock signifies the Spirit. John 7:37 and 38 say, &ldquo;Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; This word was spoken on the last day of the feast of tabernacles. John 7:39 goes on to say, &ldquo;But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive.&rdquo; This indicates clearly that the flowing water signifies the Spirit.</p>
<p>Paul speaks of the water from the smitten rock in 1 Corinthians 10:4, where he says that the children of Israel &ldquo;all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.&rdquo; Paul tells us that the rock followed God&rsquo;s people in their journey through the wilderness. Wherever the children of Israel journeyed, the rock went with them. The spiritual drink refers to the living water that flowed out of the cleft rock, which typifies the Spirit as our all-inclusive drink (1 Cor. 12:13). Literally, the Greek words rendered &ldquo;a spiritual rock which followed&rdquo; are &ldquo;a spiritual following rock.&rdquo; The rock that was smitten and cleft to flow out the living water for God&rsquo;s chosen people was a physical rock. Yet Paul calls it a spiritual rock because it typifies Christ smitten and cleft by God to flow out the water of life (John 19:34) to satisfy the thirst of His believers. Hence, Paul says that the rock was Christ. Because it was a spiritual rock signifying Christ, it was able to follow the children of Israel. This indicates that Christ as the real rock is following His believers.</p>
<p>Paul was bold to say that the physical rock of Exodus 17:6 was a spiritual rock and that this rock was Christ. In actuality the rock in Exodus 17 was physical. However, we need to have a spiritual view of this physical rock and see through the physical into the spiritual. Because Paul viewed this rock according to his spiritual sight, in his eyes it was a spiritual rock. To him, that rock was Christ, and he boldly declared this in 1 Corinthians 10:4.</p>
<p>Through incarnation Christ came to earth as the rock. At Calvary, the appointed place, He was crucified, smitten by God&rsquo;s law with its power and authority. His side was cleft, and living water flowed forth. This living water, which is the Spirit as the ultimate issue of the Triune God, quenches our thirst and satisfies our being.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FORTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(23)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover further aspects of Christ&rsquo;s person in the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">17. The Tabernacle with All the Furniture</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament Christ is typified by the tabernacle with all the furniture: the showbread table, the lampstand, the incense altar, and the ark. Exodus 25:9 says, &ldquo;According to all that I show thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the furniture thereof, even so shall ye make it&rdquo; (lit.). This type is fulfilled in Hebrews 9:1-5; John 1:14; and Hebrews 10:20.</p>
<h2 class="head3">a. The Tabernacle</h2>
<p>Exodus 25:8 says, &ldquo;Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.&rdquo; This sanctuary was the tabernacle, which signifies God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This dwelling place was not only for living but also for enjoyment. God&rsquo;s dwelling place is the place for Him to be the enjoyment for His people, the place where God&rsquo;s people may participate in the full enjoyment of God Himself. The Old Testament tabernacle was a type, a prefigure, of the real tabernacle, which was Christ Himself in the flesh. When Christ was in the flesh, He was the tabernacle of God among men (John 1:14). In the Old Testament God was in the tabernacle, for the tabernacle brought God to the children of Israel. In the time of the New Testament Christ in the flesh was the tabernacle that brought God to man so that man might enjoy Him. Through incarnation God became a man, mingled Himself with humanity, and became His own dwelling place. In Christ, the real tabernacle, God was embodied for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; Here we see that Christ, the incarnated Word, is a tabernacle. This tabernacle signifies the Word becoming flesh as God&rsquo;s expression. Here the word &ldquo;expression&rdquo; is the same in significance as the gold in the Old Testament tabernacle. The tabernacle was built with boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold, which signifies God expressed. When Christ was on earth, there was with Him a certain kind of shining, and that shining was the expression of God typified by the gold of the tabernacle.</p>
<p>As the tabernacle, Christ shared in humanity. For the Word to become flesh means that the Word took on human nature. Humanity is typified by the acacia wood of the tabernacle (Exo. 26:15, 26). The shining gold and the acacia wood signify respectively the divine nature and human nature of Christ. Furthermore, as the tabernacle, Christ is God&rsquo;s embodiment: &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily&rdquo; (Col. 2:9). The fullness of the Godhead&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;was embodied in the tabernacle, and this embodiment was God&rsquo;s dwelling among men.</p>
<p>The fullness of the Godhead was embodied in the tabernacle so that man may enter into God and enjoy Him. Originally, God was mysterious, invisible, and untouchable. But now God has been embodied in a tabernacle that can be entered. This means that God is enterable; we can enter into Him and enjoy Him. Once we enter into God, we can experience Him in Christ as our life supply, signified by the bread on the showbread table, and as our light, signified by the lampstand. We can also experience Christ and, in particular, enjoy Him as the ark.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. The Showbread Table</h2>
<p>The tabernacle in the Old Testament had two sections: the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. The first item of furniture in the Holy Place was the showbread table (Exo. 40:22-23), which signifies Christ as our life supply (John 6:35, 57). In particular, the showbread table signifies Christ as the feast for God&rsquo;s priests, since only priests were qualified to be in the Holy Place. Because those who ate the bread displayed on the showbread table were priests, this table indicates that Christ is a feast for God&rsquo;s priests.</p>
<p>On the showbread table twelve loaves of bread were displayed. The number twelve signifies eternal completion and perfection. Christ is our eternal bread. Our enjoyment of Him as the showbread table is eternal.</p>
<p>The showbread table was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold (Exo. 25:23-24). Here acacia wood signifies that Christ&rsquo;s humanity is the basic element for Him to be our feast. The gold overlaying the table signifies the expression of God, Christ&rsquo;s divinity. Within Christ, His humanity is the basic element for our enjoyment, and upon Him is divinity as the expression of God. If we enjoy Christ, we shall express God. As we enjoy the Lord Jesus as the life supply with which we serve God, the outcome will be gold, Christ&rsquo;s divinity as the expression of God.</p><h2 class="head3">c. The Lampstand</h2>
<p>After the showbread table is the lampstand (Exo. 40:24-25), where we experience Christ as the shining light of life (John 1:4; 8:12). The fact that the lampstand follows the showbread table indicates that the light comes out of our enjoyment of Christ as our life supply. When we enjoy Christ as our food, we have light because the &ldquo;life was the light of men&rdquo; (John 1:4).</p>
<p>The lampstand in the tabernacle (Exo. 25:31-40) signifies the Triune God embodied in Christ. With the lampstand we see three important things: the gold, the stand, and the lamps. Gold is the substance with which the lampstand is made, the stand is the embodiment of the gold, and the lamps are the expression of the stand. The gold signifies the Father as the substance, the stand signifies the Son as the embodiment of the Father, and the lamps signify the Spirit as the expression of the Father in the Son. Therefore, as a type, the lampstand implies the Triune God.</p>
<p>As a type of Christ, the lampstand portrays Christ as the resurrection life growing, branching, budding, and blossoming to shine the light. The fact that the lampstand has branches, buds, and blossoms indicates that it is a growing entity. Since the lampstand typifies Christ, it indicates that Christ is the One who is growing. Christ grows first in Himself, signified by the stalk of the lampstand, and then also in us, signified by the branches.</p>
<h2 class="head3">d. The Incense Altar</h2>
<p>Another item of furniture in the tabernacle that typifies Christ is the incense altar (Exo. 30:1-5). The incense altar signifies Christ as the Intercessor to maintain the relationship between God and His people (Rom. 8:34; Heb. 7:25). The altar itself is a type of Christ&rsquo;s person, not a type of His prayer. The incense altar signifies Christ praying, Christ interceding. Without such an interceding Christ, the proper relationship between God and us could not exist, or could not be maintained. For the maintaining of our relationship with God, we need Christ as our Intercessor.</p>
<p>According to Exodus 30:1 and 3, the incense altar was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold. This signifies that Christ&rsquo;s humanity, signified by the acacia wood, is strong in character and high in standard to express His divinity, signified by the gold.</p>
<p>The incense altar had four horns. In biblical typology a horn signifies power. Therefore, the four horns of the incense altar signify the power of Christ&rsquo;s intercession. Christ&rsquo;s intercession is powerful toward the four corners of the earth.</p>
<p>The incense altar also had a crown of gold round about, rings of gold, and poles of acacia wood overlaid with gold. The crown of gold around the incense altar signifies the glory of Christ&rsquo;s divinity being the preserving power of His intercession. The two rings of gold as receptacles for the carrying poles signify the moving of Christ&rsquo;s intercession, and the poles of acacia wood overlaid with gold signify that Christ&rsquo;s human nature with His divine nature is the strength for the moving of His intercession. All these aspects of the interceding Christ typified by the incense altar are fulfilled in the New Testament, especially in John 17.</p>
<h2 class="head3">e. The Ark</h2>
<p>The ark of testimony is a type of Christ, the true testimony of God, who is the embodiment and expression of all that God is. The tables of the law, the Ten Commandments, were put into the ark (Exo. 25:21). This signifies that God testified by the law is embodied in Christ. As the ark was called the ark of the testimony (Exo. 25:22), so Christ is the testimony, the expression, of God.</p>
<p>As a type of Christ, the ark, which contained the tablets of the testimony, typifies Christ as the embodiment of God&rsquo;s testimony. The ark as the embodiment of God&rsquo;s testimony typifies Christ as the embodiment of God. Colossians 2:9 says that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. Because God is embodied in Christ, He is portrayed, defined, and explained by Christ. Christ is God&rsquo;s definition, His explanation.</p>
<p>The ark as a type of Christ also indicates that God&rsquo;s redeemed people can contact God and enjoy God in Christ and through Christ. The New Testament reveals that God has come in Christ so that we may contact Him, receive Him, and enjoy Him. As the ark of the testimony, Christ is for us to contact God and enjoy God.</p>
<p>The ark was made of acacia wood overlaid inside and outside with pure gold (Exo. 25:10-11). The acacia wood typifies Christ&rsquo;s humanity, strong in character and high in standard. Christ&rsquo;s humanity is the basic element, the basic substance, for Him to be God&rsquo;s testimony. Christ became the embodiment of God&rsquo;s testimony in His humanity, which is the basic substance for expressing God. The pure gold that overlaid the ark signifies Christ&rsquo;s divinity. Because the substance of gold does not change, it signifies God who is eternally unchanging.</p>
<p>Christ is one person with two natures, the human nature and the divine nature. Because He is man as well as God, He is rightly called the God-man. He is the mingling of God with man. The fact that the acacia wood was overlaid with gold both inside and outside signifies that in Christ the divine nature is mingled with the human nature. In Christ the divine nature penetrates the human nature and also rests on the human nature so that it may be expressed through the human nature. That the acacia wood was between two layers of gold indicates such a mingling. As the embodiment of God, Christ is the God-man, the mingling of God and man.</p><h2 class="head2">18. The Testimony (the Law)</h2>
<p>Exodus 25:21 says, &ldquo;In the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.&rdquo; According to Exodus 31:18, the tables of stone on which the Ten Commandments were written are called the &ldquo;two tables of testimony.&rdquo; This indicates that the law was God&rsquo;s testimony. Because the law, God&rsquo;s testimony, was placed in the ark, the ark was called the ark of testimony (Exo. 25:22; 26:33-34); and because the ark was in the tabernacle, the tabernacle was called the tabernacle of testimony (Exo. 38:21; Num. 1:50,53). The law was called the testimony because it testifies of God; it testifies what kind of God He is. In particular, the law, the Ten Commandments, testifies that God is holy and righteous and that He is love and light. In nature our God is love (1 John 4:8), and in expression He is light (1 John 1:5). He is also holy in nature and righteous in all His activities. The law testifies that He is such a God.</p>
<p>As the testimony of God, the law is a type of Christ. The real, living, full, and adequate testimony of God is Christ Himself. Christ describes God and expresses Him in a full and adequate way. Therefore, the law, the testimony, typifies Christ as God&rsquo;s living testimony. The law was given, but Christ came to be the living expression of God (John 1:17). When Christ came, the testimony of God became a living person. Wherever the Lord Jesus went, He expressed God. Whatever He did and said expressed God. For this reason He is called &ldquo;the faithful Witness&rdquo; (Rev. 1:5; 3:14). As the faithful Witness, Christ is the testimony of God, His expression. He testifies that God is holy and righteous and that He is love and light. Christ is the reality of the testimony typified by the law.</p>
<h2 class="head2">19. Aaron</h2>
<p>Aaron is a type of Christ as the High Priest (Exo. 28:3; Heb. 5:4-5). Aaron was called and established by God to be the high priest (Heb. 5:4, 1). This is even more true with Christ, who did not glorify Himself to become a High Priest but was ordained by God (Heb. 5:5), having been chosen as a man to go to God with the needs of man. Aaron, as the high priest, took care of things pertaining to God on behalf of the people. Christ is superior to him in taking care of all of our cases before God. In type, Aaron offered both gifts and sacrifices for the people and himself (Heb. 5:1, 3), but, in reality, Christ offered Himself as the sacrifice for sins. As typified by Aaron, Christ offered Himself to God for our sins (Heb. 7:27; 9:14, 26; 10:10, 12), made propitiation for our sins (Heb. 2:17), and made purification for our sins, after which He &ldquo;sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high&rdquo; (Heb. 1:3). On the cross, Christ, offering sacrifice to God for our sins, was a High Priest typified by Aaron. Therefore, this aspect of Christ&rsquo;s priesthood, the Aaronic priesthood, is mainly for the forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p>Aaron was established in honor to be the high priest only for his lifetime, for he was prevented by death from continuing. But Christ was ordained in glory to be our High Priest forever. With Him there is no preventing of death. He is glorified forever to be our High Priest.</p>
<p>As the high priest in type, Aaron bore the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on his shoulders and on his heart (Exo. 28:9-10, 12, 21, 29). Today, as the High Priest in reality, Christ is in the heavens bearing us and holding us before God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">20. All the Offerings</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament Christ is typified by all the offerings. The New Testament reveals that in His person Christ is the fulfillment of these types.</p>
<h2 class="head3">a. The Burnt Offering</h2>
<p>The burnt offering (Lev. 1:3), which was wholly for God&rsquo;s satisfaction, typifies Christ as God&rsquo;s pleasure and satisfaction. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He made God happy and satisfied Him because He always did God&rsquo;s will (John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38) and sought His glory (John 7:16-18). Whatever God wanted, Christ did. Therefore, He pleased God and satisfied Him.</p>
<p>According to Leviticus 1, the burnt offering was burned to ashes as God&rsquo;s food to satisfy Him. The Hebrew word for burnt offering actually means ascending sacrifice. When this offering was burned on the altar, it became a sweet savor ascending to God for His enjoyment. This is the reason Numbers 28:2 and 3 speak of the burnt offering as God&rsquo;s food. God&rsquo;s food, the burnt offering, satisfies Him. As the fulfillment of the type of the burnt offering, Christ is God&rsquo;s food. Christ has been &ldquo;burned&rdquo; to feed God and satisfy Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">b. The Meal Offering</h2>
<p>The meal offering (Lev. 2:1) typifies Christ in His humanity as food for God and especially for those who have fellowship with God and serve Him. In His humanity Christ is our food and constant satisfaction.</p>
<p>The meal offering was made of fine flour mingled with oil (Lev. 2:4). The fine flour, with its evenness and fineness, typifies Christ&rsquo;s perfect humanity with its balance, evenness, and fineness. The four Gospels portray the fineness of the Lord&rsquo;s behavior in His human living. The oil mingled with the fine flour signifies the divine Spirit. This mingling typifies the mingling of divinity with humanity in the Lord Jesus. The frankincense added to the meal offering (Lev. 2:15) signifies the fragrance of resurrection life. This is Christ typified by the meal offering, the mingling of humanity and divinity with the fragrant manifestation of resurrection life to be our daily nourishment and supply.</p><h2 class="head3">c. The Peace Offering</h2>
<p>The peace offering (Lev. 3:1) typifies Christ as the Peacemaker (Eph. 2:15). Apart from Christ, we cannot have peace with God or with others. Because there can be no peace in the universe without Christ, we need Him to be our peace offering. Christ has &ldquo;made peace through the blood of His cross&rdquo; (Col. 1:20). Now as the fulfillment of the type of the peace offering, Christ is our peace (Eph. 2:14) with God and with one another. Through Him and in Him we have peace with God and man. As the peace offering, Christ is sweet and satisfying. In typology, the peace offering was food for God and the serving ones. Today, in reality, we with God may enjoy Christ as the sweet, satisfying peace offering.</p>
<h2 class="head3">d. The Sin Offering</h2>
<p>The sin offering (Lev. 4:3) is a type of Christ as the One who died on the cross to deal with the sinful nature of our fallen being. As the sin offering, Christ has dealt with the sin that dwells in us (Rom. 7:20), the personified sin extensively described in chapters five through seven of Romans (5:12, 21; 6:12, 14; 7:8, 9, 11, 13, 17, 23). This sin is actually the evil nature of Satan. Because we are sinful, even sin itself, we need Christ to be our sin offering. As the reality of the type of the sin offering, Christ, who did not know sin, was &ldquo;made sin on our behalf&rdquo; by God (2 Cor. 5:21). According to Romans 8:3, God sent &ldquo;His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin&rdquo; so that He might condemn sin in the flesh. Through Christ as the sin offering, sin has been dealt with. In Him our sinful nature has been judged.</p>
<h2 class="head3">e. The Trespass Offering</h2>
<p>Christ is also typified by the trespass offering (Lev. 5:6). We are sinful and have many sins and transgressions. God can forgive our sins only through Christ as the trespass offering. On the cross Christ bore all our trespasses before God. He &ldquo;Himself carried up our sins in His body onto the tree&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:24). First Corinthians 15:3 says, &ldquo;Christ died for our sins,&rdquo; being &ldquo;once offered to bear the sins of many&rdquo; (Heb. 9:28). Therefore, as the sin offering Christ was made sin for us, but as the trespass offering He bore our sins.</p>
<h2 class="head3">f. The Wave Offering</h2>
<p>The wave offering typifies Christ as the resurrected One. Leviticus 7:30 speaks of a portion of the peace offering being &ldquo;waved for a wave offering before the Lord.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;waved&rdquo; and &ldquo;wave&rdquo; indicate movement. This typifies Christ moving in His resurrection. The resurrected Christ is &ldquo;waving&rdquo;; that is, He is living. The wave offering, then, is a type of Christ as the resurrected, living One.</p>
<h2 class="head3">g. The Heave Offering</h2>
<p>Leviticus 7:32 says, &ldquo;The right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for a heave offering.&rdquo; To heave an offering is to lift it up. The heave offering, an offering heaved up before the Lord, typifies Christ in ascension and exaltation. As the fulfillment of the type of the heave offering, Christ is the ascended, exalted, transcendent One, the One who is &ldquo;far above all&rdquo; (Eph. 1:21).</p>
<h2 class="head3">h. The Drink Offering</h2>
<p>Exodus 29:40 speaks of the drink offering. The wine of the drink offering was for God&rsquo;s satisfaction; it was poured out to God for Him to drink. In the Old Testament a drink offering was poured out on one of the basic offerings described in chapters one through seven of Leviticus. The basic offerings are types of various aspects of what Christ is to God on our behalf. The drink offering typifies Christ as the One poured out as real wine before God for His satisfaction. Christ poured out His very being unto God. Isaiah 53:12 says, He &ldquo;poured out his soul unto death.&rdquo; Thus, Christ is the heavenly, spiritual wine poured out to God for His pleasure. Furthermore, the drink offering typifies not only Christ Himself, but also the Christ who saturates us with Himself as heavenly wine until He and we become one to be poured out for God&rsquo;s enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:1-12 indicates that Christ is the fulfillment of all the offerings. He came to do the will of God (vv. 7, 9), that is, to replace the sacrifices and offerings, which were types, with Himself in His humanity as the unique sacrifice and offering for the sanctification of God&rsquo;s chosen people. As this unique offering, Christ is the reality of the burnt offering, meal offering, peace offering, sin offering, trespass offering, wave offering, heave offering, and drink offering. In His death Christ offered Himself to God as the offering that fulfills all the types of the offerings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">21. The Sabbath and the Feasts</h2>
<p>Leviticus 23:3 speaks of &ldquo;the sabbath of rest,&rdquo; and verse 4, of &ldquo;the feasts of the Lord.&rdquo; In the Old Testament the children of Israel observed seven annual feasts: the Passover, the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of firstfruit, the feast of weeks (Pentecost), the feast of trumpets, the day of atonement, and the feast of tabernacles (also called the feast of ingathering or harvest). Among these seven feasts, the three major ones were the Passover, the feast of Pentecost, and the feast of tabernacles. In Colossians 2:16 and 17 Paul says that the Sabbath and the feasts are &ldquo;a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.&rdquo; Shadows are like types or figures. The &ldquo;body,&rdquo; the substance, the reality, of these shadows is Christ. The Sabbath signifies completion and rest, and the feasts, the annual Jewish festivals, signify joy and enjoyment. As the fulfillment and the reality of the Sabbath and the feasts, Christ is our completion and rest and our joy and enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">22. The Brass Serpent</h2>
<p>Christ is also typified by the brass serpent (Num. 21:8-9; John 3:14). Because the children of Israel in the wilderness complained and were rebellious, speaking against God and against Moses, &ldquo;the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died&rdquo; (Num. 21:6). Then the people came to Moses, confessed that they had sinned, and asked him to pray that the Lord would take away the serpents. When Moses prayed for the people, the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live&rdquo; (v. 8). Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole. Then &ldquo;it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived&rdquo; (v. 9). In John 3:14 the Lord Jesus refers to that incident in Numbers 21: &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The incident in Numbers 21 was sovereignly prepared by God to reveal a particular type of Christ. The brass serpent lifted up on a pole is a type of Christ lifted up on the cross for us as the Son of Man. As descendants of Adam, we all have been &ldquo;bitten&rdquo; by the old serpent, the Devil. Therefore, we all are serpentine beings with the poison of the old serpent in our nature. In the sight of God, the entire fallen human race consists of poisonous &ldquo;serpents.&rdquo; As such serpents, we need a substitute, someone with the form of a serpent but without the poisonous element of the serpent. This substitute is Christ, who died on the cross in the form of a serpent to deal with our serpentine nature.</p>
<p>In Romans 8:3 Paul says that God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin and condemned sin in the flesh. This corresponds to the revelation in John 3:14 concerning the brass serpent. For God to send His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin means that Christ became a serpent in form, that is, a brass serpent without the serpentine poison. According to the type of the brass serpent and its fulfillment in Christ, when Christ was lifted up on the cross, He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin typified by the form of the brass serpent, but He did not have the nature of sin typified by the poisonous nature of the serpent. Paul&rsquo;s word in Romans 8:3 about God condemning sin in the flesh indicates that the old serpent has been condemned so that the problem of sin may be solved. Now whoever believes in Christ as the One who was lifted up to be condemned in our place has eternal life (John 3:15). This is the significance of the type of the brass serpent in Numbers 21:8 and 9 and its fulfillment in John 3:14.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(24)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover more aspects of Christ&rsquo;s person in the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">23. A Star out of Jacob</h2>
<p>Numbers 24:17 says, &ldquo;There shall come a Star out of Jacob.&rdquo; This Star refers to Christ. The fulfillment of this type of Christ is found in the word of the magi, learned men from the east, recorded in Matthew 2:2: &ldquo;Where is He who is born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and came to worship Him.&rdquo; The magi did not say, &ldquo;We have seen <em>a</em> star,&rdquo; or &ldquo;We have seen <em>the</em> star,&rdquo; but, &ldquo;We have seen <em>His</em> star.&rdquo; This is certainly the fulfillment of Numbers 24:17. The star spoken of in this verse was shown to these learned men; it did not appear to any of the people of Israel. Whereas the Jews had the Scriptures concerning Christ and knew where He would be born (Matt. 2:4-6), the magi saw the star of Christ. The Jews had the knowledge in letters concerning Christ, but these learned men from the east received a living vision concerning Him. Eventually the star led them to the place where Christ was (Matt. 2:9-10).</p>
<p>Although Christ is the real Sun (Mal. 4:2), He does not appear as the Sun during this age of night. Rather, He shines as a star. A star shines at night, but it indicates that day is coming. When Christ came the first time, He appeared openly as a star. But when He comes the second time, He will be the morning star (Rev. 2:28; 22:16) to His overcomers, who watch for His coming. To all others Christ will later appear as the sun.</p>
<h2 class="head2">24. The One Hanged on a Tree</h2>
<p>Deuteronomy 21:22 and 23 say, &ldquo;If a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: his body shall not remain all night upon the tree.&rdquo; This word is fulfilled in Galatians 3:13, which reveals that Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by being the One hanged on a tree. The &ldquo;tree&rdquo; refers to the cross made of wood, a Roman instrument of capital punishment. The Jewish death penalty was by stoning (Lev. 20:2, 27; 24:23; Deut. 13:10; 17:5; 21:21). Crucifixion was a heathen practice (Ezra 6:11) adopted by the Romans for the execution of slaves and heinous criminals only. When the Lord Jesus was crucified, He was hanged on a tree, in fulfillment of Deuteronomy 21:22-23.</p>
<h2 class="head2">25. The Rock</h2>
<p>We have seen that Christ is the rock with the living water, the One smitten by God on the cross so that the Spirit as living water may flow out for us to drink (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4). Now we need to see that Christ is the rock in another sense. Deuteronomy 32:4 speaks of the Rock. The Rock here is the eternal Rock (Isa. 26:4), the Triune God. This Rock is embodied in Christ as the expression of the Triune God. As such, Christ is the Rock that begot us (Deut. 32:18), that is, the begetting Rock, full of life. In Deuteronomy 32:15; 2 Samuel 22:47; and Psalm 95:1, Christ is the Rock of our salvation, and this Rock is our strength (Psa. 62:7) and our refuge (Psa. 94:22). This Rock is our hiding place, protection, covering, and safeguard. Christ is the Rock (Matt. 16:18), the embodiment and expression of the Triune God, on which we rely and on which we stand. He is the Rock of our salvation, refuge, and strength.</p>
<h2 class="head2">26. The Good Land</h2>
<p>The good land, the land of Canaan (Deut. 8:7-10), is a type of the all-inclusive Christ, the Christ who is all and in all and who is everything to us. The Passover, the manna, the tabernacle with its furniture, and all the offerings are types depicting various aspects of Christ. Only the land of Canaan is a full type, the complete and all-inclusive type, of Christ. In the Old Testament no type other than the good land shows that Christ is the all-inclusive One. Therefore, the good land is the ultimate type of Christ found in the Scriptures.</p>
<p>In the Bible the land is a figure, a symbol, of Christ. The land that came out of the death water on the third day (Gen. 1:9-10, 13) is a type of the resurrected Christ who came out of death on the third day. Many different kinds of life, including vegetable, animal, and human life, then came out of the land (Gen. 1:11-12, 24-25). This signifies that Christ is the source of all kinds of life. Everything God prepared for mankind is concentrated in the land. God&rsquo;s intention revealed in the Scriptures is that Christ should be our land. Christ as the good land, the land that came out of the death water, the land that was elevated above and surrounded by the death water, is depicted by the land of Canaan.</p>
<p>This land is the crucial focus of the Old Testament. For this reason the Lord speaks of the land again and again. He called out Abraham and told him that He would bring him into a certain land, the land of Canaan (Gen. 12:1). The center of God&rsquo;s plan, speaking according to type, is the good land with its temple and city.</p>
<p>In Colossians Paul employs the concept of the all-inclusive land. In Colossians 1:12 he speaks of &ldquo;the portion of the saints.&rdquo; This portion is the all-inclusive Christ for our enjoyment. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;portion&rdquo; in this verse can also be rendered &ldquo;lot,&rdquo; referring to an allotment. When Paul was writing the Epistle to the Colossians, he no doubt had in mind the picture of the allotting of the good land to the children of Israel (Josh. 14:1). He used the word &ldquo;portion&rdquo; with the Old Testament record of the land as the background. God gave His chosen people, the children of Israel, the good land for their inheritance for their enjoyment. In Colossians Christ is revealed as our portion, our lot. Just as the land of Canaan was everything to the children of Israel, so Christ, the reality of the type of the good land, is everything to us.</p>
<p>The good land provided whatever the children of Israel needed: water, wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, pomegranates, olive trees, animals, milk, honey, stones, iron, copper. All these items, most of which are mentioned in Deuteronomy 8:7-10, are types of Christ. He is the water that springs from valleys and hills. He is the wheat, which signifies the incarnated and crucified Christ, and the barley, which signifies the resurrected Christ. The vine typifies Christ as the sacrificing One who cheers God and man; the fig tree, the sweetness and satisfaction of Christ as our life supply; the pomegranate, the abundance and beauty of the life of Christ; the olive tree, Christ as the man filled with the Spirit and anointed with the Spirit as the oil of exultant joy; the animal life, Christ with His redeeming life; milk and honey, Christ in His richness and sweetness; stones, iron, and copper, Christ as the materials for building and fighting.</p>
<p>In Acts 26:18 Paul refers to the all-inclusive Christ as our inheritance. As the result of having our eyes opened and of being transferred from the authority of Satan to God, we not only have the forgiveness of sins, but we also receive a divine inheritance. This inheritance is the Triune God Himself with all that He has, all He has done, and all He will do for His redeemed people. This Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ (Col. 2:9) who is the portion allotted to the saints as their inheritance. The Holy Spirit, who has been given to the saints, is the foretaste, the seal, the pledge, and the guarantee of this divine inheritance (Rom. 8:23; Eph. 1:13-14), which we are sharing and enjoying today as a foretaste and will share and enjoy in full in the coming age and for eternity (1 Pet. 1:4). The good land truly is a type of the all-inclusive Christ. Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, has been given to us as our inheritance.</p><h2 class="head2">27. Joshua</h2>
<p>Christ is also the real Joshua. According to Joshua 1:1 and 2, the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying, &ldquo;Arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them.&rdquo; The name Joshua, which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah (Num. 13:16), is a Hebrew equivalent of the Greek name Jesus. Joshua, then, is a type of Christ bringing the people of God into rest. Moses brought the people out of Egypt, but Joshua brought them into rest. As indicated by Hebrews 4:8 and 9, as our Joshua, Christ brings us into the rest of the good land. Actually, the rest into which Christ, the real Joshua, brings us is Himself as the good land.</p>
<h2 class="head2">28. David</h2>
<p>Christ is not only the Root of David (Rev. 5:5), the seed of David (Rom. 1:3), and the Son of David (Matt. 1:1); He is also the real David. In keeping with the principle seen in Matthew 12, that Christ is greater than all the types, greater than all things and persons in the Old Testament that typify Him, Christ is the greater David.</p>
<p>When the Pharisees criticized the Lord&rsquo;s disciples for picking ears of grain on the Sabbath, He said, &ldquo;Have you not read what David did when he was hungry and those who were with him; how he entered into the house of God, and they ate the showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but for the priests only?&rdquo; (Matt. 12:3-4). The Lord&rsquo;s word implies that He is the real David. In ancient times David and his followers, when rejected, entered into the house of God and ate the showbread, seemingly breaking the Levitical law. The real David and His followers were also rejected and took action to eat, seemingly against the sabbatical regulation. This indicates that King David was a type of Christ, the real David. David had followers, and Christ, the real David, also had disciples as His followers. King David, God&rsquo;s anointed (1 Sam. 16:13), and his followers were rejected by the people, and the real David, God&rsquo;s Anointed (Heb. 1:9), and His followers were rejected also. Just as David and his followers were hungry, so Christ and His disciples also were hungry. Furthermore, neither David and his followers nor Christ and His followers had anything to eat, but there was the place where there was something to eat. For David it was the house of God, and for Christ it was the grainfields. All this implies that David and his followers were a type, a prefigure, of Christ and His disciples.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 12:3 and 4 also implies the dispensational change from the priesthood to the kingship. The coming of David changed the dispensation from the age of the priests to the age of the kings, in which the kings were above the priests. By the coming of Christ the dispensation was also changed, this time from the age of the law to the age of grace, in which Christ is above all. In Matthew 1:6 David is called &ldquo;the king&rdquo; because through him the kingdom with the kingship was brought in. He was the landmark of two ages, the conclusion of one age and the beginning of another age. As the real David, the greater David, Christ is such a One. As typified by David, Christ is the fighting King, who has won the victory over all enemies, who has gained the land, and who has prepared all the materials for building up the church as the temple of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">29. Solomon</h2>
<p>Solomon (1 Kings 6:1) typifies Christ as the One with wisdom to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, to build up God&rsquo;s house, the temple, and to rule over God&rsquo;s kingdom. As the real Solomon, Christ builds up the temple of God, the church, with the materials that He has gained through His victory over all the enemies.</p>
<p>In Matthew 12:42 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;The queen of the south shall be raised in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.&rdquo; Christ, as the Son of David to be the King, is greater than Solomon the king. Solomon built the temple of God and spoke the word of wisdom, and to him the Gentile queen came (1 Kings 6:2, 14; 10:1-8). This also is a type of Christ, who is building the church to be the temple of God and speaking the word of wisdom, and to Him the Gentile seekers turn.</p>
<p>While Christ builds the church, He speaks the word of wisdom. Actually, the entire New Testament is a word of wisdom spoken by Christ. In the Gospels Christ spoke in Jesus, then in the Acts and the Epistles He spoke from within Peter, Paul, John, and others. Hebrews 1:1 and 2 say, &ldquo;In many portions and in many ways, God, having spoken of old to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son.&rdquo; In the New Testament God speaks in a person, the Son. This person was first an individual but has become corporate, for Christ has been increased to be a corporate person, the Body with all the members. Through this enlarged person, Christ spoke the word of wisdom recorded in the New Testament. Therefore, the New Testament is a lengthy word of wisdom spoken by Christ as our Solomon.</p><h2 class="head2">30. The Temple</h2>
<p>Another type of Christ is the temple (1 Kings 6:2). In the Old Testament the temple was the house of God (1 Kings 6:1). As God&rsquo;s house, the temple, which was the enlargement of the tabernacle (1 Kings 6:2, 20; cf. Exo. 26:15-16, 18, 20, 22), was founded upon a foundation of stone (1 Kings 5:17; 6:37), and it was built of stone, cedar, and fir overlaid with gold (1 Kings 6:7, 9, 15-16, 18, 20-22). Stone signifies transformed humanity; cedar, humanity in resurrection; fir, humanity through death; and gold, divinity. With the temple we see the mingling of divinity with humanity through death and in resurrection and transformation. The temple built of these materials was God&rsquo;s rest; it satisfied His desire. This temple is a wonderful type of Christ.</p>
<p>In Matthew 12:6 the Lord Jesus said to the Pharisees, &ldquo;A greater than the temple is here.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s revealing to the Pharisees that He is greater than the temple was another change, a type-fulfilling change from the temple to a person who is greater than the temple. This was a change from the type to the reality. Outside the temple everything was common. But once something was brought into the temple, it was sanctified by the temple. Likewise, every day was sanctified by the temple. Every thing, every day, every matter, and everyone in the temple was holy. The temple, however, was a type, not the reality. The reality is Christ, the greater temple.</p>
<p>Throughout the New Testament the real temple of God is not a place; it is a person. When Christ became flesh, His physical body was God&rsquo;s tabernacle (John 1:14). According to John 2:19, His body was also the temple. Both the tabernacle and the temple are God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Realizing that the body of Jesus was God&rsquo;s dwelling place, Satan destroyed it on the cross through the Jews. But the Lord raised up this temple &ldquo;in three days,&rdquo; that is, in resurrection. After Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, His body, the temple (John 2:21), was reared up on a much larger scale. The body the enemy destroyed by crucifixion was merely the body of Jesus; the body raised up by the Lord in resurrection was not only His own body but also includes everyone who is joined to Him by faith (1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 2:6). This means that the resurrected temple in John 2:19-21 is Christ raised up with His members. This temple is Christ enlarged in resurrection as the house of God, the church.</p>
<p>Revelation 21:22 speaks of the ultimate consummation of the temple in the New Jerusalem: &ldquo;Its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.&rdquo; According to the Bible, the temple is the place where God dwells and also the place where His people worship Him. In eternity Christ with God will be such a temple, a temple that is both God&rsquo;s habitation and our dwelling place. For eternity we shall dwell in Christ to enjoy the Triune God, and by enjoying Him we shall worship Him and serve Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">31. Elisha</h2>
<p>In the fulfillment of the types and figures in the Old Testament, Christ is also the real Elisha (2 Kings 5:9; Luke 4:27). Elisha was more pleasant as a prophet than Elijah was. Elijah may be considered a condemning prophet, and Elisha, a blessing prophet. One of the most striking things Elisha did was to heal the death waters with salt (2 Kings 2:19-21). This healing indicates that Elisha was a sweet prophet of blessing to the people. As a prophet of condemnation, Elijah was a type of John the Baptist, who rebuked the Pharisees and Sadducees, even calling them a &ldquo;brood of vipers&rdquo; (Matt. 3:7). Just as Elisha came after Elijah and was the continuation of Elijah, so Jesus came after John the Baptist as his continuation. As the real Elisha, the Lord Jesus is a sweet and pleasant prophet, a prophet of blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">32. Jonah</h2>
<p>Jonah 1:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.&rdquo; Jonah is a type of Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection. The Lord&rsquo;s own word indicates this. When the scribes and Pharisees asked Him for a sign, He said that no sign would be given &ldquo;except the sign of Jonah the prophet&rdquo; (Matt. 12:39). Then He went on to say, &ldquo;As Jonah was in the belly of the sea monster three days and three nights, so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights&rdquo; (Matt. 12:40). &ldquo;The heart of the earth&rdquo; is called the lower parts of the earth (Eph. 4:9) and Hades (Acts 2:27), where the Lord went after His death. Hades, equal to Sheol in the Old Testament, has two sections: the section of torment and the section of comfort (Luke 16:23-26). The section of comfort is Paradise, where the Lord went with the saved thief after they died (Luke 23:43). Hence, the heart of the earth, the lower parts of the earth, Hades, and Paradise are synonymous terms, referring to the one place where the Lord stayed for three days and three nights after His death and before His resurrection.</p>
<p>In Matthew 12:41 the Lord Jesus went on to say, &ldquo;Men, Ninevites, will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.&rdquo; Christ, as the Prophet sent by God to His people (Deut. 18:15, 18), is greater than Jonah the prophet. Jonah turned from Israel to the Gentiles and was put into the belly of the great fish. After he had remained there for three days, he came out to be a sign to that generation for repentance (Jonah 1:2, 17; 3:2-10). This was a type of Christ, who would turn from Israel to the nations and would be buried in the heart of the earth for three days and then be resurrected, becoming a sign to this generation for salvation. As the One greater than Jonah, Christ in resurrection is the unique sign for today.</p>
<h2 class="head2">33. Isaiah</h2>
<p>Isaiah was a prophet of the gospel. No other prophet in the Old Testament prophesied, or spoke, the gospel as much a Isaiah did. Consider how much of the gospel is found in Isaiah 53.</p>
<p>Isaiah 8:18 indicates that Isaiah was a type of Christ: &ldquo;Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts.&rdquo; Hebrews 2:13, which quotes from this verse, indicates that Christ is the fulfillment of the type of Isaiah, the prophet of the gospel. Christ&rsquo;s children are His believers who have partaken of blood and flesh, and He also shared in the same (Heb. 2:14). Isaiah&rsquo;s children were given to him by God; Christ&rsquo;s believers were also given to Him by God the Father (John 17:2; 6:37).</p>
<h2 class="head2">34. The Shepherd</h2>
<p>Psalm 23:1 says, &ldquo;The Lord is my shepherd.&rdquo; The main thing a shepherd does is to feed the sheep. In John 10:11 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.&rdquo; As a man the Lord Jesus has the human life, and as God He has the divine life. The Lord laid down His human life to accomplish redemption for His sheep (John 10:15, 17-18) so that they may have His divine life (John 10:10), the eternal life (John 10:28), by which they may be formed into one flock under Himself as the one Shepherd. As the good Shepherd, Christ feeds His sheep with the divine life in this way and for this purpose.</p>
<p>Christ is our Shepherd, and we are His sheep. Now the Lord shepherds us in life from within. Inwardly we have Him as our Shepherd, a Shepherd of life and in life. As our Shepherd, the living Christ not only gives us life&mdash;He is life to us. The living of the Lord within us is actually His shepherding. Christ shepherds us by being life to us and by living in us.</p>
<p>Hebrews 13:20 tells us that God &ldquo;brought up from among the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep.&rdquo; The &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; here are the flock, which is the church. God raised Christ from among the dead to be the great Shepherd of the sheep in resurrection. Having been redeemed by Christ, we are now being fed by Him as our great Shepherd.</p>
<p>First Peter 5:4 says that Christ is the Chief Shepherd, the head of all the shepherds. Furthermore, 1 Peter 2:25 says that He is the Shepherd of our souls. Christ was our Redeemer in His death on the cross. Now He is our soul&rsquo;s Shepherd in the resurrection life within us and thus is able to guide us and supply us with life. As the Shepherd of our souls, He shepherds us by caring for the welfare of our inner being. In order to be our living Shepherd, it is necessary for Christ to dwell within us. Today Christ as the life-giving Spirit lives in us to be the Shepherd of our souls.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FORTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(25)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall consider further aspects of Christ&rsquo;s person in the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">35. The King of Glory</h2>
<p>Psalm 24:7-10 reveals strongly that Christ is the King of glory. The King of glory is &ldquo;the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle&rdquo; (v. 8). Psalm 24:7-10 is fulfilled in a full way in Revelation 19:11-16, which speaks of Christ as the Warrior who is &ldquo;King of kings and Lord of lords&rdquo; (v. 16).</p>
<p>As the King of glory Christ is &ldquo;Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war&rdquo; (Rev. 19:11). In faithfulness to God and the believers He defeats those who oppose God and persecute the believers. He is true in carrying out God&rsquo;s economy and in caring for those who believe in Him. He judges and fights in righteousness, His flaming eyes (v. 12) carrying out His judgment.</p>
<p>As the King of glory Christ has many diadems on His head (v. 12), His name is called &ldquo;The Word of God&rdquo; (v. 13), and a sharp sword proceeds out of His mouth (v. 15). Christ has been crowned and glorified. Because He has been crowned with the glory (Heb. 2:9) that has different aspects, He wears many diadems. His name, &ldquo;The Word of God,&rdquo; indicates that He is the definition, explanation, and expression of God, even while executing God&rsquo;s judgment upon the rebellious. The fighting of Christ is the speaking of the Word of God. As Christ fights against the enemy, He proclaims to the universe that God is sovereign, righteous, and orderly. The sword that proceeds out of His mouth is the powerful word that judges the rebellious. Christ defeats the enemy with the sharp sword, the almighty word, that proceeds out of His mouth.</p>
<p>As the King of glory Christ is the King of kings and Lord of lords, a name that is written on His garment and on His thigh. Christ&rsquo;s garment signifies His attributes, especially His righteousness in His humanity, and the thigh signifies His standing strength, His stability. His title &ldquo;King of kings and Lord of lords&rdquo; is exhibited in His righteousness and stability. This is Christ as the King of glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">36. The Fatness of God&rsquo;s House</h2>
<p>Psalm 36:8a says, &ldquo;They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house.&rdquo; In typology the fatness of the Lord&rsquo;s house refers to the rich produce of the good land. All the riches that were offered to God in the house became the fatness of His house. The fulfillment of this type is in Christ. He, with His unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8), is the reality of the fatness of God&rsquo;s house. In Old Testament times God&rsquo;s people could enjoy this fatness only in the place God had chosen for His habitation. For this reason, the psalmist declares that God&rsquo;s people were satisfied with the fatness of His house. Apart from God&rsquo;s dwelling place, the temple, the Old Testament saints did not have this enjoyment. They were bountifully, abundantly satisfied with the fatness of God&rsquo;s house. Today the rich enjoyment of Christ is ours in the house of God, the church. In the church we are satisfied with the riches of Christ, even His unsearchable riches, enjoyed, digested, and assimilated by us as the reality of the fatness of God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<h2 class="head2">37. The Fountain of Life</h2>
<p>Psalm 36:9a says, &ldquo;With thee is the fountain of life.&rdquo; Christ is the fountain of life in the house of God, the church. In God&rsquo;s house the saints partake of Christ as such a fountain.</p>
<p>Psalm 36:9a is fulfilled in John 4:14. In His conversation with the Samaritan woman the Lord Jesus indicated to her that she needed the living Son of God as the fountain to become a spring of water welling up within her. First He said, &ldquo;If you knew the gift of God&#133;you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water&rdquo; (John 4:10). God&rsquo;s gift includes both His Son and the divine life. These two are one gift, for the divine life is in the Son (1 John 5:11-12), and the Son actually is the divine life (John 14:6). The thirst in human life can only be satisfied by the One who has been given to us as eternal life. For this reason, the Lord went on to say, &ldquo;Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again&rdquo; (4:13). &ldquo;This water&rdquo; signifies the enjoyment of material and worldly things. Only one &ldquo;water&rdquo; can satisfy us for eternity&mdash;Jesus Christ. He satisfies today, tomorrow, and forever. Therefore, the Lord said, &ldquo;Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life&rdquo; (v. 14). We have received Him, and He has become a spring of water welling up within us into eternal life.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Christ is the fountain of living water; on the other hand, He is the spring. In God He is the fountain, but in us He is the spring. When He enters into us and dwells in us, He becomes a spring of water welling up into eternal life. Whenever He wells up in us we are brought into eternal life, and our thirst is quenched.</p>
<p>Psalm 36:9a is also fulfilled in Revelation 21:6: &ldquo;I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely.&rdquo; This spring is Christ Himself. In eternity and for eternity we, the sons of God, shall enjoy Christ as the spring of the water of life.</p><h2 class="head2">38. The Light in the Temple</h2>
<p>According to Psalm 36:8 and 9 and Ephesians 5:14, Christ is the light in the temple. In Psalm 36:8 and 9 we have the fatness, the pleasures, the life, and the light. When we enjoy the fatness of God&rsquo;s house and drink of the river of His pleasures, we are brought to the fountain of life, and this life becomes the light (John 1:4) in which we see light. In the Lord&rsquo;s light we see light. This is not some kind of natural light. This is Christ as the light in the temple.</p>
<p>We may enjoy Christ as light outside God&rsquo;s house, the temple, the church. But we need to go into the house of God and there enjoy Christ as the inner light. Today Christ as this inner light is in our spirit. In the church we sense that we are under the Lord&rsquo;s shining. However, this shining should not merely be outward; it should be a shining deep within our being. Actually, we are the temple, and Christ is the light in the inner chamber of this temple, our spirit. Christ is light and in our spirit we see this light.</p>
<p>As the fulfillment of Psalm 36:9b, Ephesians 5:14 says, &ldquo;Christ shall shine on you.&rdquo; Christ shines not only over us but also in us as the light of life (John 8:12).</p>
<h2 class="head2">39. The Dwelling Place of God&rsquo;s Chosen People</h2>
<p>Christ is also the dwelling place of God&rsquo;s chosen people. Psalm 90:1 says, &ldquo;Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.&rdquo; As the eternal God, Christ is our habitation. We may find in Him our everlasting home. To Him, a thousand years are but as yesterday when it is passed and as a watch in the night (v. 4). Such a One is the dwelling place of God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>First John 2:24, the fulfillment of Psalm 90:1, says, &ldquo;If that which you heard from the beginning abides in you, you will abide both in the Son and in the Father.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;abide&rdquo; means not only to remain or stay but also dwell. We may abide, dwell, in the Son with the Father, taking Him as our abode.</p>
<p>The same thought is in John 15:4, where the Lord says, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you.&rdquo; This verse speaks of a mutual abiding: we abide in the Lord, and the Lord abides in us. The Lord&rsquo;s word in John 15:4 is based on John 14:23, where we have the mutual abode made by the appearing of the Father and the Son as the Spirit to the believer who loves Him. This abode is prepared by the visitation of the Triune God. His visitation makes us His abode, and it makes Him our abode. Eventually, He and we become a mutual abode. This is the reality of Christ as the dwelling place of God&rsquo;s chosen people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">40. Wisdom</h2>
<p>Proverbs 8:1 and 12 and 9:1 speak of wisdom, the reality of which is Christ. In Matthew 11:19 the Lord Jesus, referring to Himself says, &ldquo;Wisdom has been justified by her works.&rdquo; Wisdom is Christ (1 Cor. 1:24, 30). Whatever Christ did was done by the wisdom of God, which is Himself. This wisdom was justified, vindicated, by His wise deeds.</p>
<p>In Matthew 11:19 some authorities read &ldquo;children&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;works&rdquo; (see Luke 7:35). Being children is a matter of life. We are not students of wisdom caring merely for the knowledge of wisdom. We are children of wisdom caring for the life of wisdom. Because we have the life of Christ we have the life of wisdom. As children of wisdom, the believers in Christ justify Christ and His deeds and follow Him as their wisdom.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 1:24 says that Christ is &ldquo;God&rsquo;s wisdom.&rdquo; In God&rsquo;s economy the crucified Christ is God&rsquo;s wisdom for planning and purposing.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 Paul goes on to say that Christ has become &ldquo;wisdom to us from God.&rdquo; Once we believed into Christ and God put us in Him, Christ became wisdom to us in three vital matters: righteousness for our past, sanctification for our present, and redemption for our future. The words &ldquo;to&rdquo; and &ldquo;from&rdquo; indicate a transmission to us from God. In the way of a living, on-going transmission Christ should continually become wisdom to us from God.</p>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 2:7 Christ is &ldquo;God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our glory.&rdquo; Unlike human, worldly wisdom, which is open and shallow, God&rsquo;s wisdom is hidden and mysterious. As God&rsquo;s wisdom, Christ is the hidden mystery (Col. 1:26-27) foreordained before the ages for our glory. In eternity God decided that Christ as His wisdom would be our glory. Now day by day Christ is becoming wisdom to us from God.</p><h2 class="head2">41. The Beloved (Husband)</h2>
<p>The Bible, in the most pure and holy sense, is the record of a divine romance, the romance of a universal couple&mdash; God in Christ as the Husband and His redeemed people as the wife. Often in the Old Testament the Lord refers to Himself as the Husband and to His people as His wife (Isa. 54:5; 62:5; Jer. 2:2; 3:1, 14; 31:32; Ezek. 16:8; 23:5; Hosea 2:7, 19). This divine romance is portrayed in full in Song of Songs, where the seeking one again and again speaks of her beloved, who is a type of Christ as our Beloved, our Husband. In Song of Songs 1:16 the seeker says, with a sense of appreciation, &ldquo;Behold, thou art fair, my beloved.&rdquo; In 2:3 she both appreciates and enjoys him: &ldquo;As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.&rdquo; An apple tree is not only for appreciation but also for enjoyment. She sits under his shadow enjoying rest and feeds on his sweet fruit for satisfaction. Finally, in 8:14 she urges him to come quickly: &ldquo;Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The type of the beloved in Song of Songs is fulfilled in the New Testament. Christ is revealed as our Husband, and the believers are revealed as His counterpart, as His wife. In 2 Corinthians 11:2 Paul says, &ldquo;I betrothed you to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.&rdquo; Here Paul is saying that Christ is the unique, universal Husband for us to love. He, the most lovely One, has attracted us, and we have been presented as a pure virgin to Him. Now we should love Him, treasure Him, and care only for Him, allowing no one to replace Him in our hearts. Our love for Him should be pure, and our whole being should be focused on Him, our Beloved, our Husband.</p>
<h2 class="head2">42. The Great Light</h2>
<p>Isaiah 9:2 speaks of a great light shining in darkness. Matthew 4:16, which is a quotation of this verse and its fulfillment, applies it to Christ: &ldquo;The people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death, to them light sprang up.&rdquo; When Christ departed from Jerusalem to Galilee, He was a great light shining in darkness. At His birth He was a star, but in His ministry He was a great light. One day He said, &ldquo;I have come a light into the world, that everyone who believes in Me may not remain in darkness&rdquo; (John 12:46). Christ came to this world as the shining of light, the manifestation of God as light (John 12:46; Heb. 1:3), so that men would not remain in darkness but believe in this light and thereby become sons of light (John 12:36).</p>
<p>The light in Matthew 4:16 is Christ as the light of life (John 8:12) shining in darkness. &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men&rdquo; (John 1:4). When Christ, the embodiment of the divine life, shines within us as the light of life, we are under His enlightening. Having received Him as the expression of God, we have Christ within us as our life (Col. 3:4), and this life is the light shining within us. Therefore, the divine light is the divine life in the Son operating in us. This light shines in the darkness, and the darkness cannot overcome it (John 1:5). When we follow this light, the light of life, we shall by no means walk in darkness (John 8:12).</p>
<h2 class="head2">43. The Light for the Gentiles</h2>
<p>Isaiah 42:6 says that God will give Christ for a light of the Gentiles. This sign is fulfilled in Luke 2:32 which says that God has prepared &ldquo;a light for revelation of the Gentiles.&rdquo; This was the word of the righteous and devout man Simeon, in praise to God regarding the newborn Christ. Christ is not only the glory of God&rsquo;s people Israel; He is also the light for the Gentiles, who are alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise (Eph. 2:12).</p>
<h2 class="head2">44. Horn of Salvation</h2>
<p>Luke 1:69 says, &ldquo;And raised a horn of salvation for us in the house of David His servant.&rdquo; This horn of salvation which was typified by the horn of God&rsquo;s anointed, David the king (1 Sam. 2:10; Psa. 132:17), is Jesus the Savior, who came out of the house of David (Jer. 23:5-6). A horn signifies fighting power. Hence, the horn of salvation is the fighting power of God&rsquo;s salvation in the house of David. The phrase &ldquo;the house of David&rdquo; indicates that this salvation is in the humanity of the Lord Jesus.</p><h2 class="head2">45. A Stone</h2>
<p>The Bible speaks of Christ as a stone in different aspects. Isaiah 28:16 says, &ldquo;Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation.&rdquo; As a stone Christ is solid, strong, and stable.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:4 says that Christ is &ldquo;a living stone, having been rejected by men, but with God chosen, held in honor.&rdquo; This living stone is Christ for God&rsquo;s building. As the living stone Christ makes us also living stones, transformed with His stone nature so that on Him as the foundation and cornerstone we may be built up a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5).</p>
<p>Christ is the stone &ldquo;held in honor.&rdquo; The Greek for this phrase also means precious. It denotes preciousness as recognized and held in honor. From the time of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension He has been held in honor. He is not only in glory but also on the throne at the right hand of God, in a position of honor. Because Christ is now in such an honorable position, He is precious, highly valued.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:6, quoting Isaiah 28:16, says, &ldquo;Behold, I lay in Zion a chosen stone, a cornerstone held in honor, and he who believes on Him shall by no means be put to shame.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s choosing of Christ as the living stone is of two aspects. First Christ was chosen by God in eternity past. That was God&rsquo;s initial choosing of Him. Then God chose Christ the second time in resurrection. When Christ was on the cross, apparently He was rejected by God. To the Pharisees and all the others who opposed Him, the crucifixion of Christ was a sign that God had rejected Him (Matt. 27:42-43; Luke 23:35). But on the third day Christ was resurrected, and that resurrection was a sign of God&rsquo;s choosing, a proof that God had chosen Christ to be the stone for His building. This second choosing was a confirmation of God&rsquo;s first choosing. In resurrection God confirmed the choice He made concerning Christ in eternity past.</p>
<p>The Zion spoken of in 1 Peter 2:6 is not the Zion on earth; it is the Zion in the heavens. The statement, &ldquo;Behold, I lay in Zion a chosen stone,&rdquo; refers not only to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection but also to His ascension. After God resurrected Christ, He lifted Him up to the heavens. Therefore, Christ&rsquo;s ascension is a further sign and confirmation that God has chosen Him.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:6 also says that he who believes on Christ will by no means be put to shame. Christ is trustworthy, stable, and steadfast. We can put our trust in Him and be assured that we shall never be put to shame.</p>
<h2 class="head2">46. Jehovah Our Righteousness</h2>
<p>Jeremiah 23:6 and 33:16 both speak of &ldquo;Jehovah our righteousness.&rdquo; This expression is a sign of Christ as our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30). We may incorrectly think that, as believers, we have the righteousness of Christ. But our righteousness is not the righteousness of Christ; our righteousness is Christ Himself. Christ Himself as a person, not His attribute of righteousness, has been made righteousness to us. God has made Christ, who is the embodiment of God Himself, our righteousness. Through Christ as righteousness we have been justified by God so that we may be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life (Rom. 5:18; 8:10).</p>
<p>Christ as our righteousness is signified by the robe in the parable of the loving father (Luke 15:11-32). When the prodigal son returned home, the father said, &ldquo;Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him&rdquo; (v. 22). The definite article &ldquo;the&rdquo; indicates a particular robe prepared especially for him by the father. This best robe replaced the rags (Isa. 64:6) of the returned prodigal. After the best robe was put on him, the son was covered with a splendid garment that qualified him to match his father&rsquo;s requirements and satisfy him. This robe signifies Christ as the God-satisfying righteousness to cover penitent sinners (cf. Isa. 61:10; Zech. 3:4). Christ is our righteousness in whom we are justified before God. As those who have Christ as the best robe, we have Christ as our righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">47. A Stone with Seven Eyes</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that Christ is also a stone with seven eyes. In Zechariah He is portrayed as the stone (3:9), which is the topstone (4:7), with the seven eyes of the Lord, &ldquo;which run to and fro through the whole earth&rdquo; (4:10). Zechariah 3:9 says, &ldquo;Behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.&rdquo; The reference to the engraving of the stone indicates that this stone is Christ. As the building stone, the Lord Jesus was &ldquo;engraved,&rdquo; dealt with, by God on the cross for the iniquity of God&rsquo;s people. This corresponds to John 1:29. Christ, then, is the engraved stone with seven eyes.</p>
<p>Zechariah 4:2 speaks of a lampstand with seven lamps, and verse 10, of &ldquo;those seven,&rdquo; referring to the seven lamps in verse 2. These &ldquo;seven&rdquo; are the eyes of the Lord. When we put together verses 2 and 10, we see that the seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven eyes of the Lord. Furthermore, these seven lamps are the seven eyes of the stone. This indicates that the building stone with the seven eyes is Jehovah, the Lord God Himself.</p>
<p>In Revelation 4 and 5 we have a further development of the seven eyes and the seven lamps. Revelation 4:5 says that &ldquo;seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.&rdquo; In Zechariah 3:9 and 4:2 and 10 we have the seven eyes and the seven lamps but not the seven Spirits. In Revelation 4:5 the seven lamps are developed into the seven Spirits.</p>
<p>Revelation 5:6 goes on to unveil a &ldquo;Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.&rdquo; Here, as a further development over Zechariah, the seven eyes are not only the seven eyes of the stone but also the seven eyes of the Lamb. These seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. In Zechariah 3 and 4 we see the seven eyes of the stone, the seven lamps of the lampstand, and the seven eyes of the Lord. Therefore, the Lord is the stone, and the stone is also the lampstand. These three&mdash;the Lord, the lampstand, and the stone&mdash;are one.</p>
<p>In Zechariah the seven eyes are the seven lamps. In Revelation the seven lamps are no longer just on the lampstand but are also burning before the throne. These seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God. Eventually, the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the Lamb, who is in the center of God&rsquo;s administration. Revelation 5:6 indicates that the seven lamps burning before the throne are also the seven eyes of the Lamb. This means that the seven eyes are the seven eyes of the stone, the seven eyes of the Lord, and the seven eyes of the Lamb. These seven eyes combine the stone, the Lord, and the Lamb. This indicates that the Lamb is the stone and that the stone is the Lord.</p>
<p>The stone that was rejected by the builders and that became the cornerstone (Matt. 21:42; Acts 4:11) is the very stone with the seven eyes in Zechariah 3:9. In the sight of God, when the Jewish builders rejected Christ, they rejected both the Lamb and cornerstone of God&rsquo;s building. Christ died as the Lamb, but in resurrection God made Him the cornerstone. On this stone there are seven eyes shining and burning to carry out God&rsquo;s economy. Because in Zechariah these seven eyes are on the stone and in Revelation they are on the Lamb, we may say that Christ, the Lamb and the stone, is the Lamb-stone for God&rsquo;s building. The fact that Christ, the Lamb of God, is the building stone with seven eyes reveals that the seven eyes of Christ are for God&rsquo;s building. Our Christ is the building stone with seven eyes, with the seven Spirits to infuse Himself into us in order to transform us into precious materials for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<h2 class="head2">48. The Sun</h2>
<p>In Malachi 4:2 the sun is a type of Christ: &ldquo;Unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings.&rdquo; Christ is the Sun of righteousness. In His &ldquo;wings,&rdquo; that is, in His shining, there is the healing of death. Without His shining there is death. When His shining appears, death is healed.</p>
<p>Malachi 4:2 is fulfilled in Luke 1:78: &ldquo;The rising sun from on high shall visit us.&rdquo; &ldquo;From on high&rdquo; means from God and indicates that it is in His deity that Christ is the rising sun from the heavens. In His deity Jesus Christ the Savior is the dawning sun to the dark age. His birth was the real sunrise for humanity. His coming ended the night of the Old Testament and began the day of the New Testament.</p>
<p>Luke 1:69 and 78 speak of Christ in His humanity and His deity. In His humanity Christ is the horn of salvation raised up by God in a human house, the house of David. In His deity He is the rising sun from the heavens. Therefore, Christ is both man and God. As man He is the horn of salvation; as God He is the rising sun. God&rsquo;s redemptive work for the salvation of His people was accomplished by raising up Christ in the two aspects of the horn of salvation and the rising sun.</p>
<p>Having considered forty-eight aspects of Christ&rsquo;s person in the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament, we see that, as the One with unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8), Christ is profound. He is truly everything to us for our experience and enjoyment.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FORTY-SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(26)</h1>
<p>Having covered Christ&rsquo;s person in the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies and in the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament, we come in this message to another classification concerning Christ&mdash;Christ&rsquo;s person in the parables of the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">P. IN THE PARABLES OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Winnower on the Threshing Floor</h2>
<p>In recommending Christ John the Baptist said that His &ldquo;winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into His barn, but He will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire&rdquo; (Matt. 3:12). Here Christ is presented as the Winnower on the threshing floor. Because He is such a Winnower, we all need to be serious with Him.</p>
<p>Those signified by the wheat have life within. The Lord will baptize them in the Holy Spirit (v. 11) and gather them into His &ldquo;barn&rdquo; in heaven by rapture. Those signified by the chaff, like the tares in Matthew 13:24-30, are without life. The Lord will baptize them in fire, putting them into the lake of fire. This is related to His being the Judge of the living at His throne of glory after His coming back (Matt. 25:31-46) and of the dead at the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15). Chaff in Matthew 3:12 refers to unrepentant Jews, whereas the tares in chapter thirteen refer to nominal Christians. The eternal destiny of both will be the same&mdash;perdition in the lake of fire (Matt. 13:40-42).</p>
<p>We should not be like the chaff, and we should not be tares. Rather, we should be wheat, the living children of God. In order to be children of God we need to be born anew (John 3:3), born of water and of the Spirit (John 3:5). All those who repent and believe in the Lord will be baptized by Him in the Holy Spirit that they may have eternal life. Those who do not repent and believe will be baptized by Him, the Winnower, in fire; they will be put into the lake of fire for eternal perdition. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s baptism is either for eternal life in the Holy Spirit or for eternal perdition in fire.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The Son of Man with Nowhere to Lay His Head,<br />
Unlike the Foxes and the Birds of the Heaven</h2>
<p>In Matthew 8:19 a scribe said to the Lord Jesus, &ldquo;Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.&rdquo; This scribe, who was accustomed to living comfortably, saw crowds being attracted to the Lord and wanted to follow Him out of curiosity, without counting the cost. The Lord answered Him in a way to cause him to consider the cost: &ldquo;The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man has nowhere that He may lay His head&rdquo; (v. 20). The Lord compared His situation to that of foxes and birds. Unlike foxes and birds, the Son of Man had nowhere to rest, although crowds were drawn to Him. He did not even have a resting place, as foxes and birds do. His human life was a life of suffering. At His birth there was no room in the inn (Luke 2:7). In His marvelous ministry there was likewise no place for Him to rest.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. A Physician for the Ill</h2>
<p>While the Lord Jesus was enjoying a feast with tax collectors and sinners, the Pharisees criticized and condemned Him, and they asked the disciples why their teacher ate with such people (Matt. 9:10-11). The Lord took the opportunity provided by the Pharisees&rsquo; question to give a very pleasant revelation of Himself as the Physician: &ldquo;Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill&rdquo; (v. 12). The Lord was telling the Pharisees that the tax collectors and sinners were &ldquo;patients,&rdquo; sick ones, and that to them He was not a judge but a physician, a healer. In calling people to follow Him the Lord ministered as a physician, not as a judge. The judgment of a judge is according to righteousness, whereas the healing of a physician is according to mercy and grace. Those whom the Lord made people of His heavenly kingdom were lepers (Matt. 8:2-4), paralytics (8:5-13; 9:2-8), the fever-ridden (8:14-15), the demon-possessed (8:16, 28-32), those sick of all kinds of illnesses (8:16), the despised tax collectors, and sinners (9:9-11). Had the Lord Jesus visited these pitiful people as a judge, all would have been condemned and rejected, and none would have been qualified, selected, and called to be His followers. He came to minister as a physician, to heal, recover, enliven, and save them so that they might be reconstituted to be citizens of the kingdom of the heavens. The Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 9:12 implies that the self-righteous Pharisees did not recognize their need of Him as the Physician. They regarded themselves as strong; hence, blinded by their self-righteousness, they did not know that they were ill.</p>
 <p>The Lord Jesus did not simply tell His disciples that He came not as a judge but as a physician; that would have been mere doctrine. As the Lord was feasting with those who were spiritually sick, He revealed Himself as the Physician and healed them. As the Physician He can heal only those who are sick. He came to call the sinners, the sick ones, not the righteous, the whole ones (Matt. 9:13). If we feel that we are not ill, He cannot heal us. But if we take the standing that we are sinners, we shall experience Him as our Physician. If we see that Christ is our Physician, we shall have faith in Him as the One who can heal us.</p>
<p>As our Physician Christ has healing authority. His healing is not simply a matter of power but also of authority. There is no need for Him to touch us directly in order to heal us. He needs only to speak a word, and His authority comes with His word to heal us (Matt. 8:8). Our Physician heals us with His authority.</p><h2 class="head2">4. The Bridegroom<br />
with the Sons of the Bridechamber</h2>
<p>The ministry of John the Baptist was to introduce people to Christ so that Christ might become their Redeemer, life, and all. However, some of John&rsquo;s disciples drifted away from his goal, Christ, to certain of John&rsquo;s practices and turned those practices into a new religion that frustrated people from enjoying Christ. Because these disciples of John practiced fasting, they were troubled by the feasting of Christ and His disciples and condemned them for not fasting: &ldquo;Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?&rdquo; (Matt. 9:14). The Lord answered, &ldquo;Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?&rdquo; (v. 15). Here the Lord reveals Himself as the Bridegroom, the most pleasant person, with the sons of the bridechamber.</p>
<p></P>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;sons of the bridechamber&rdquo; refers to the disciples of the Lord. In the transitory period of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry on earth His disciples were sons of the bridechamber, those who were with the Bridegroom in His chamber, gazing on Him and enjoying His presence. Later they would become the bride (John 3:29; Rev. 19:7). The Bridegroom was taken away from the sons of the bridechamber when the Lord Jesus was taken up from the disciples into heaven (Acts 1:11). After that, they fasted (Acts 13:2-3; 14:23).</p>
<p>In dealing with the self-righteous Pharisees of the old religion the Lord indicated that He is the Physician to heal the sick. In dealing with the fasting disciples of John, who had formed a new religion, He revealed Himself as the Bridegroom coming for the bride. John the Baptist had told his disciples that Christ was the Bridegroom (John 3:25-29). Now Christ reminded them of this. The Lord first healed His followers, then made them sons of the bridechamber. Eventually He would make them His bride. They should appropriate Him not only as their Physician for the recovery of life but also as their Bridegroom for a living of enjoyment in His presence. They were at a joyful wedding with Him, not at a sorrowful funeral without Him. How then could they fast and not feast before Him? The question raised by John&rsquo;s disciples seems to be one of doctrine. However, the Lord did not answer with a doctrine but with the revelation of Himself as the Bridegroom with the sons of the bridechamber.</p>
<h2 class="head2">5. The Unshrunk Cloth<br />
Not Suitable for Patching an Old Garment</h2>
<p>In Matthew 9:16 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;No one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for that which fills it up pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;unshrunk&rdquo; is <em>agnaphos,</em> formed with <em>a,</em> which means not, and <em>gnapto,</em> which means to card or comb wool; hence, to dress or full the cloth. Thus, the word means uncarded, unfulled, unfinished, unshrunk, untreated. This unshrunk cloth signifies Christ from His incarnation to His crucifixion as a piece of new cloth, untreated, unfinished, whereas the new garment in Luke 5:36 signifies Christ, after being &ldquo;treated&rdquo; in His crucifixion, as a new robe. Christ was first the unshrunk cloth for making a new garment, and then through His death and resurrection He was made a new garment to cover us as our righteousness before God that we might be justified by God and acceptable to Him (Luke 15:22; Gal. 3:27; 1 Cor. 1:30; Phil. 3:9). As unshrunk cloth Christ was indeed wonderful but not adequate to cover us. Such cloth was new but not in a suitable condition for us to wear. It required some work to be done on it, a work that was accomplished when Christ was on the cross. On the cross the Lord Jesus was treated; He was dealt with by man and even more by God. Then in resurrection He became a new garment. Before His crucifixion He was unshrunk cloth, but after His resurrection He is the new garment for us to put on.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;old garment&rdquo; in Matthew 9:16 signifies man&rsquo;s good behavior, good deeds, and religious practices by his old natural life. A patch of unshrunk cloth put on an old garment pulls away from the garment by its shrinking strength, thus making the tear worse. Putting a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment signifies trying to imitate what Christ did in His human life on earth. Today some only imitate Jesus&rsquo; human deeds to improve their behavior without believing in the crucified Jesus as their Redeemer and the resurrected Christ as their new garment to cover them as their righteousness before God. The Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 9:16 indicates that we should never try to cut a piece of His unshrunk cloth and use it to mend the &ldquo;holes&rdquo; in our garments, for His cloth is full of shrinking power, and when applied to old garments will simply cause the holes in them to become larger.</p><h2 class="head2">6. New Wine Not Able<br />
to Be Contained in the Old Wineskin</h2>
<p>In Matthew 9:17 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are destroyed.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;new&rdquo; in this verse is <em>naos,</em> which means new in time, recent, young. This new wine signifies Christ as the new life, full of vigor and cheering strength, stirring us to excitement and satisfying us. When we receive His life, it works within us to stir us up, excite us, energize us, and make us happy. As the new wine, Christ is our content, the provision for our inward thirst. He is not only the Bridegroom but also the new life to excite us inwardly for the enjoyment of Him as our Bridegroom.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said that we should not put new wine into old wineskins. Old wineskins signify religious forms, rituals, and practices, such as the fasting by the Pharisees and the disciples of John in their religion (Matt. 9:14). All religions are old wineskins. New wine put into old wineskins will burst the wineskins by its fermenting power. To put new wine into old wineskins is to put Christ as the exciting life into any kind of religion. Today some attempt to squeeze Christ into their different modes of religious ritual and formality. But we should never try to put the wine of Christ&rsquo;s life into the wineskin of old religious practices, for the wine will burst those practices. The new wine of Christ as life requires a new wineskin.</p>
<h2 class="head2">7. The Lord of the Harvest</h2>
<p>In Matthew 9:38 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Beseech the Lord of the harvest that He may thrust out workers into His harvest.&rdquo; Here Christ is revealed as the Lord of the harvest. This indicates that His kingdom is established with things of life that grow and multiply and that He is the Lord who owns this crop. We are the Lord&rsquo;s crop. Under His hand nothing is lifeless. He does not care for lifeless things but for things that are living. Everything under His care is living.</p>
<p>We all need to see a vision of the Lord Jesus as the Lord of the harvest and realize that we should beseech Him as the Lord of the harvest to thrust out workers into His harvest. Whenever we sense the need for workers, we should pray to the Lord of the harvest, calling on Him to thrust out workers into His harvest and recognizing that the harvest belongs to Him. Whenever we pray in this way we honor the Lord Jesus very much. To pray like this indicates that we have seen the vision that our Christ is the Lord of the harvest. We all need further revelation concerning this aspect of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">8. A Teacher above His Disciples,<br />
the Lord above His Slaves,<br />
and the Master of the House</h2>
<p>In Matthew 10:24-25 the Lord Jesus uses three parables to instruct the twelve apostles regarding the suffering of persecution in their going out to spread His ministry. In these parables He likens Himself to a teacher, the lord, and the master of the house, and likens the apostles to disciples, slaves, and those of the household. In suffering persecution they cannot be above Him; they must not expect a better lot. It is sufficient that, in suffering persecution, they become as He. He is their Teacher, Lord, and Master of the house, and they are His disciples, slaves, and those of His household. If the Pharisees revile Him, calling Him lord of the dunghill (Beelzebub), how much more them. This word of the Lord prepares the apostles to suffer the persecution of the Jewish leaders.</p>
<h2 class="head2">9. An Eater and Drinker<br />
in the Parable of the Playing Children</h2>
<p>In Matthew 11:16 and 17 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;To what shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the market places, who call to the others and say, We have played the flute to you, and you did not dance; we have sung a dirge, and you did not beat the breast.&rdquo; John the Baptist and Christ &ldquo;played the flute&rdquo; to preach the gospel of the kingdom, but the Judaizers &ldquo;did not dance&rdquo; for the joy of salvation. John and Christ sang &ldquo;a dirge&rdquo; to preach repentance, but the Judaizers &ldquo;did not beat the breast&rdquo; for the grief of sin. The righteousness of God required them to repent, but they would not obey. The grace of God afforded them salvation, but they would not receive it.</p>
<p>In Matthew 11:18 and 19 the Lord goes on to say, &ldquo;John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon. The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a wine drinker, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.&rdquo; John, coming to bring men to repentance (Mark 1:4) and to cause them to grieve for sin, had no taste for eating and drinking (Luke 1:15-17). But Christ, coming to bring salvation to sinners and to cause them to rejoice in it, had the joy of eating and drinking with them (Matt. 9:10-11). Because John the Baptist lived in a strange and peculiar way, not eating and drinking in the regular way, the opposers said, &ldquo;He has a demon&rdquo;&mdash;He is demon-possessed. But they called Christ a gluttonous man and a wine drinker, a friend of tax collectors and sinners. Christ is not only the Savior; He is also the friend of sinners, sympathizing with their problems and sensing their griefs.</p>
<h2 class="head2">10. The Sower in the Parables<br />
of the Sower and of the Tares</h2>
<p>In the parables of the sower and of the tares Christ is revealed as the Sower. At the beginning of the parable of the sower the Lord says, &ldquo;Behold, the sower went out to sow&rdquo; (Matt. 13:3). Then in the parable of the tares He says, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man sowing good seed in his field&rdquo; (Matt. 13:24). As verse 37 explains, &ldquo;He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.&rdquo; Thus, the sower in these parables is Christ Himself. Apparently He was a teacher and a preacher. Actually, in teaching the truth and in preaching the gospel He was a Sower, and His life was a life of sowing. For example, when the Lord Jesus healed Peter&rsquo;s mother-in-law, something out from Him, the sowing Savior, was imparted to her (Matt. 8:14-15). Likewise, as the Lord was cleansing the leper, something from Him was sown into the one cleansed (Matt. 8:1-3). As a result of the Lord&rsquo;s sowing, a great change took place in the being of both the leper and Peter&rsquo;s mother-in-law. Matthew 13 reveals that what was imparted to those with whom the Lord Jesus came into contact was the seed sown into them by Himself as the Sower.</p>
<p>The Sower is the wonderful person of the Lord Jesus, and the seed sown is also the Lord Himself, the embodiment of the Triune God, as life to produce the kingdom of God. Through incarnation Christ became the seed of life, and in His ministry He sowed this seed into others. This means that into His followers He sowed Himself as the embodiment of the Triune God. If we consider our experience, we shall realize that the seed sown by the Lord Jesus into our being is just Himself as life to make us sons of the kingdom (Matt. 13:38). As the Sower Christ has sown Himself as the seed of life into our hearts so that He may live in us, grow in us, and be expressed from within us.</p>
<p>The fact that Christ is both the Sower and the seed sown by Him indicates that He establishes the kingdom not by teaching or by outward working, but by sowing Himself as the seed of life into the believers so that the kingdom may be brought into being by the growth in life. This seed will grow, and the life in it will produce the kingdom. Eventually, the Sower, who is also the seed, will become the &ldquo;stone cut out without hands&rdquo; that will smite the nations and become &ldquo;a great mountain&rdquo; filling the whole earth (Dan. 2:34-35). This great mountain will be the kingdom set up by God, a kingdom that &ldquo;shall never be destroyed&rdquo; but &ldquo;shall stand forever&rdquo; (Dan. 2:44). This reveals that the kingdom of God is actually a person, Christ Himself. In the beginning this kingdom was the Sower sowing Himself as the seed of life. This seed will grow and develop into a mountain&mdash;the kingdom of God in the age of the millennium.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FORTY-SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(27)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall continue to consider Christ&rsquo;s person in the parables of the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">11. The Three Measures of Meal<br />
in the Parable of Leaven</h2>
<p>In Matthew 13:33 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.&rdquo; This parable reveals the matter of mixture. The three measures of meal refer to fine flour made of wheat grain, fine flour that was used in the meal offering (Lev. 2:1). Those who served God as priests fed on the fine flour of the meal offering. The meal offering was for the satisfaction not only of the priests but of God Himself. Thus, the meal offering was food for both the priests and for God. The meal offering is a type of Christ in His humanity, with the fine flour signifying the fineness and evenness of Christ&rsquo;s humanity.</p>
<p>When the Lord appeared to Abraham, Abraham told Sarah to prepare a full meal with three measures of fine flour (Gen. 18:6). Hence, in the Bible three measures of meal denote a full meal. As three measures of meal, Christ, the reality of the meal offering, is food for God and man.</p>
<p>The fact that in Matthew 13:33 three measures of meal have been leavened by the woman indicates that everything related to Christ has been leavened by this evil woman. Leaven in the Scriptures signifies evil things (1 Cor. 5:6, 8) and evil doctrines (Matt. 16:6, 11-12), and the woman signifies the apostate Catholic Church, which has mixed the teachings concerning Christ with pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters &ldquo;until the whole was leavened.&rdquo; This is absolutely against the Scripture, which strongly forbids putting leaven into the meal offering (Lev. 2:4-5, 11). The church, as the practicality of the kingdom of the heavens, should have only Christ, the unleavened fine flour, as its content.</p>
<h2 class="head2">12. The Man in the Parable<br />
of a Treasure Hidden in the Field</h2>
<p>Matthew 13:44 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and in his joy goes and sells all, whatever he has, and buys that field.&rdquo; The treasure signifies the kingdom with the true Israel, God&rsquo;s peculiar treasure (Exo. 19:5; Psa. 135:4). The field is the earth, which signifies the world created by God for His kingdom (Gen. 1:26-28). Therefore, the treasure hidden in the field signifies the kingdom hidden in the God-created world. Christ is the man who found the treasure and then hid it, and in His joy sold all and bought the field. Christ found the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 4:12 to 12:23, hid it in 12:24 to 13:43, and in His joy went to the cross in 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19; and 26:1 to 27:52 to sell all He had and buy that field&mdash;to redeem the created and lost earth&mdash;for the kingdom. Christ first found the treasure when He came out to minister, declaring, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (Matt. 4:17). When the Jews&rsquo; rejection of the Lord reached its peak. He forsook them. From that time onward, He hid the treasure. Then He went to the cross to buy not only the treasure but also the field and thereby redeem the earth created by God. He redeemed the whole earth for the sake of the treasure.</p>
<p>Christ went to the cross to redeem the God-created earth because within the earth there was the kingdom, the treasure. In order for Him to have the kingdom on earth, Christ had to redeem the earth because it had been polluted and damaged by Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s sin. The Lord sold all that He had and bought the earth; that is, He sacrificed all He had on the cross to redeem the earth for the treasure of the kingdom. No doubt this kingdom is realized in the church life, but its manifestation is related to the redeemed nation of Israel. During the millennium the earth will become the kingdom of Christ (Rev. 11:15). At that time the nation of Israel will be the center of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom.</p><h2 class="head2">13. The Merchant in the Parable of Pearl-finding</h2>
<p>In Matthew 13:45 and 46 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking fine pearls, and finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all, whatever he had, and bought it.&rdquo; The merchant in verse 45 is Christ, who was seeking the church for His kingdom. After finding it in Matthew 16:18 and 18:17, He went to the cross and sold all He had and bought it for the kingdom.</p>
<p>In Matthew 13:46 we see Christ&rsquo;s work in gaining the one pearl of great value. At the cross He sold all, whatever He had, and bought that pearl. The pearl, produced in the death waters (the world filled with death) by the living oyster (the living Christ), wounded by a little rock (the sinner) and secreting its life-juice around the wounding rock (the believer), is also the material for the building of the New Jerusalem. Because the pearl comes out of the sea, which signifies the world corrupted by Satan (Isa. 57:20; Rev. 17:15), it must refer to the church, which is constituted mainly of regenerated believers from the Gentile world and which is of great value. After wounding Christ, the living oyster, we stayed at the cross, remaining at His wound. Then His resurrection life was secreted, covering us again and again, and made us the pearl, the church, taken out of the water of death.</p>
<p>The parables in Matthew 13 reveal that the Lord Jesus came as the Sower to sow the seed and that eventually He gained the pearl. The pearl comes out of the seed. Christ is the seed, and the church is the pearl. The pearl is precious, and the price paid for it was great. The Lord Jesus paid the price, selling all that He had to buy the church. According to Acts 20:28, He purchased the church with His own blood. The Lord Jesus sowed Himself as the seed, paid the price, and eventually gained the pearl.</p>
<h2 class="head2">14. The Bread and the Crumbs<br />
in the Parable of the Children&rsquo;s Bread</h2>
<p>One day a Canaanite woman cried out to the Lord Jesus saying, &ldquo;Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is badly demon-possessed!&rdquo; (Matt. 15:22). The Lord told her that He &ldquo;was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel&rdquo; (v. 24). Then, realizing that she was not a child of Israel, she said, &ldquo;Lord, help me!&rdquo; (v. 25). The Lord answered, &ldquo;It is not good to take the children&rsquo;s bread and throw it to the dogs&rdquo; (v. 26). The &ldquo;children&rdquo; are the Jews, and the little &ldquo;dogs&rdquo; (pet dogs, house dogs) are the Gentiles. Here Christ reveals Himself as the children&rsquo;s bread. The Canaanite woman considered Him the Lord, the Son of David, a royal descendant, great and high to reign. But He unveiled Himself to her as small pieces of bread, good for food. Although the woman&rsquo;s request has nothing to do with eating, the Lord purposely referred her to the matter of eating in order to show her that she needs inward nourishing. He caused her to realize that He was bread for the feeding of the hungry children, that He was dispensing Himself to others as their inner life supply.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus referred to the Canaanite woman as a little dog, she said, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters&rsquo; table&rdquo; (v. 27). The Canaanite woman, not offended by the Lord&rsquo;s word, but rather admitting that she was a heathen dog, considered that at that time Christ, after being rejected by the children, the Jews, became &ldquo;crumbs&rdquo; under the table as a portion to the Gentiles. The holy land of Israel was the table on which Christ, the heavenly bread, came as a portion to the children of Israel. But they threw Him off the table to the &ldquo;ground,&rdquo; the Gentile country, so that He became broken crumbs as a portion to the Gentiles. What a realization this Gentile woman had concerning Christ! We also need to realize that Christ has been cast off the table by the Israelites and is now in the Gentile world, that He, the bread of life from heaven, is where the dogs are. As the crumbs under the table, the edible Christ is near to us.</p>
<p>Feeding is a matter of dispensing. The Greek word for economy, or dispensation <em>(oikonomia),</em> comes from a root that means to distribute food. In chapter fifteen of the Gospel of Matthew we see Christ dispensing Himself as bread, as nourishing food, as the element of the life supply, to satisfy the hungry ones. This indicates that God&rsquo;s economy is not a matter of outward things but of Christ coming into us as food. For this, we need to take Christ in by eating Him as bread, even as the crumbs under the table.</p><h2 class="head2">15. The Householder<br />
in the Parable of the Vineyard</h2>
<p>The parable of the householder (Matt. 20:1-16) was given by the Lord Jesus to explain His word about the first being last and the last first (19:30), a word spoken in answer to Peter&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;We have left all and followed You; what then is there for us?&rdquo; (v. 27). Matthew 20:1 and 2 say, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard. And having agreed with the workmen for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.&rdquo; The householder is Christ. The morning denotes the earliest part of the church age, when Christ came to call His disciples into the kingdom. The workmen are the disciples, and the vineyard is the kingdom. The denarius is the reward&mdash;the full enjoyment of the divine life in glory in the manifestation of the kingdom&mdash;the Lord offered Peter in His agreement with him in 19:28 and 29.</p>
<p>After &ldquo;hiring&rdquo; more workmen during various parts of the church age (Matt. 20:3, 5, 6), &ldquo;when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the workmen and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first&rdquo; (v. 8). Those hired at the eleventh hour received a denarius, and those hired first, supposing that they would receive more, also received a denarius. When they received it, they murmured against the householder. In his answer the householder said, &ldquo;I desire to give to this last one even as to you. Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is mine? Or is your eye evil because I am good?&rdquo; (vv. 14b-15). This indicates that, as the Householder, the Lord Jesus has the right to give the same thing to the latest workmen according to His own wish in the principle not of work but of grace. Here the Lord strongly indicates that His reward to His followers is not commercial but according to His desire and grace. For the disciples to gain the kingdom of the heavens they need to leave all and follow Him, but what He will give them as a reward is more than they deserve. It is not according to the principle of commerce but according to the Lord&rsquo;s good pleasure. The Lord Jesus will not give the kingdom as a commercial transaction. Therefore, we should not think that what we give up to follow Him amounts to the price that will purchase the kingdom. The Lord Jesus gives the reward as an act of goodness. The kingdom comes to us from the Lord&rsquo;s gracious giving according to His own will. This is the revelation of Christ in His grace as the Householder.</p>
<h2 class="head2">16. The Son of the Householder<br />
in the Parable of the Evil Husbandmen</h2>
<p>Christ is the son in the parable of the evil husbandmen (Matt. 21:33-46). In this parable the householder is God, the vineyard is the city of Jerusalem (Isa. 5:1), and the husbandmen are the leaders of the Israelites (Matt. 21:45). The slaves sent to receive the fruits are the Old Testament prophets who suffered persecution (Jer. 37:15; Neh. 9:26; 2 Chron. 24:21). Eventually, the householder &ldquo;sent to them his son, saying, They will respect my son. But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him and possess his inheritance&rdquo; (Matt. 21:37-38). This indicates that the Jewish leaders were jealous of Christ&rsquo;s rights and wanted to maintain their false position. Thus, &ldquo;they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him&rdquo; (v. 39). This refers to Christ&rsquo;s being killed outside the city of Jerusalem (Heb. 13:12). Thus, Christ, the Son of the Owner of Jerusalem, was rejected by the evil leaders of the Jews.</p>
<h2 class="head2">17. The Stone Rejected by the Jewish Builders<br />
in the Parable of the Evil Husbandmen</h2>
<p>In talking with the Jewish leaders concerning the vineyard, thereby indicating that He is the Son of the Owner of the vineyard, Christ eventually refers to God&rsquo;s building and to Himself as a stone: &ldquo;The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the cornerstone&rdquo; (Matt. 21:42). This stone is Christ for God&rsquo;s building (Isa. 28:16; Zech. 3:9; 1 Pet. 2:4), and the builders are the Jewish leaders, who were supposed to work on God&rsquo;s building. Here the Lord Jesus says that the stone rejected by the builders has become the cornerstone. Christ is not only the foundation stone and the topstone (Zech. 4:7), but also the cornerstone, the stone that joins the walls. As the cornerstone, Christ connects the Jews and the Gentiles. Through Christ as the cornerstone the Jewish and Gentile believers are brought together as one building for God.</p>
<p>According to Matthew 21:42 and 44, Christ is a stone to three categories of people: for the believers He is the building stone; for the rejecting Jews He is the stumbling stone; and for the Gentiles He is the smiting stone. For us, Christ, the Son of God, the Savior, the Redeemer, the One who is our life, is God&rsquo;s building stone. As the building stone, Christ is the building element, the building life. Ultimately, Christ as life within us is for God&rsquo;s building. Now for God&rsquo;s building we need to enjoy and experience Christ as the building stone, as the building life and element. Christ is not only the foundation stone that bears us up; He is also the cornerstone that holds us together. In Him and through Him we are built together.</p><h2 class="head2">18. The Son of the King<br />
in the Parable of the Marriage Feast</h2>
<p>After the Lord Jesus has spoken the parable of the evil husbandmen of the vineyard in Matthew 21:33-46, referring to the Old Testament, likened to a vineyard, with the focus on the labor under the law, He continues to speak another parable, the parable of the marriage feast in Matthew 22:1-14, referring to the New Testament, likened to a marriage feast, with the focus on the enjoyment of grace. Both the householder of the former parable and the king of the latter one are God. The son of both the householder and the king is Christ. In the former parable Christ is the Heir who inherits the Father&rsquo;s possession and becomes the cornerstone of God&rsquo;s building, joining together God&rsquo;s people of different sources. In the latter parable Christ is the Bridegroom who satisfies the Father&rsquo;s desire and becomes the pleasure of God&rsquo;s invited ones. Both the Old Testament and the New Testament are for Christ. He is the center of God&rsquo;s economy!</p>
<h2 class="head2">19. The Lightning Coming Forth<br />
from the East and Shining to the West</h2>
<p>In Matthew 24:3 the disciples asked the Lord Jesus concerning the sign of His coming and of the consummation, the end, of the age. As part of His answer, recorded in chapters twenty-four and twenty-five of Matthew, the Lord says, &ldquo;As the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be&rdquo; (24:27). The Greek word rendered &ldquo;coming&rdquo; in this verse, as in verse 3, is <em>parousia,</em> which means presence. Christ&rsquo;s coming will be His presence with His believers. This parousia will begin with His coming to the air and end with His coming to the earth. Within His <em>parousia</em>there will be the rapture of the majority of the believers to the air (1 Thes. 4:15-17), the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10), and the marriage of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-9). Matthew 24:27 indicates that Christ will be in the air for His coming to earth. As the lightning flashes from the east to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.</p>
<p>The coming <em>(parousia)</em> of Christ has two aspects: one is the secret aspect toward His watchful believers; the other is the open aspect toward the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles, The lightning in verse 27 signifies the open aspect after the great tribulation (v. 29), whereas the thief&rsquo;s coming in verse 43 signifies the secret aspect before the great tribulation. Lightning is concealed in a cloud, waiting for an opportunity to flash forth. Christ will also be clothed with a cloud (Rev. 10:1) in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear like a flash to the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">20. The Thief in the Parable of Watching</h2>
<p>In Matthew 24:43 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;If the householder knew in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.&rdquo; The &ldquo;householder&rdquo; refers to the believer and the &ldquo;house,&rdquo; to the believer&rsquo;s conduct and work that he has built up in his Christian life. A thief comes to steal precious things at an unknown time. No thief tells us in advance of his coming or steals things that are without value. Thieves come secretly to steal what is valuable, having a discerning eye for what is precious. The Lord Jesus will come secretly as a thief to those who love Him and will take them away as His treasures. Because Christ will come to steal valuable things, we should seek to be precious, worthy of being &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; by Him in His secret coming. A normal Christian is one qualified to be stolen by the Lord. Furthermore, because the time of Christ&rsquo;s secret coming is unknown, we need to be watchful. &ldquo;If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you&rdquo; (Rev. 3:3). In Matthew 24:44 the Lord tells us, &ldquo;Be ready, for the Son of Man comes in an hour that you think not.&rdquo; Hence, for the Lord&rsquo;s secret coming as a thief we need watchfulness and readiness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">21. The Master of the Faithful Slaves<br />
and of the Evil Slaves</h2>
<p>In Matthew 24:45-51 Christ is the Master of the faithful slaves and of the evil slaves. Verse 45 says, &ldquo;Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the appointed time?&rdquo; The slave here is faithful toward the Lord, who set him over His household, and prudent toward the believers. The &ldquo;household&rdquo; refers to the believers (Eph. 2:19), who are the church (1 Tim. 3:15). To &ldquo;give them food&rdquo; is to minister the Word of God with Christ as the life supply to the believers in the church. &ldquo;Blessed is that slave whom his master when he comes shall find so doing. Truly I say to you, that he will set him over all his possessions&rdquo; (Matt. 24:46-47). To be &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; is to be rewarded by Christ, the Master, with ruling authority in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. The Master will set the faithful slave &ldquo;over all his possessions&rdquo; as a reward in the manifestation of the kingdom. Here we see Christ as the Master of the faithful slaves.</p>
<p>In verses 48 through 51 Christ is presented as the Master of the evil slaves. The evil slave is a saved one, a genuine believer. As the Master, Christ would never assign duties to a false believer. That the evil slave is a saved believer is proved by the fact that he is appointed by the Lord, that he calls the Lord &ldquo;my Master,&rdquo; and that he believes that the Lord is coming. This evil slave, saying in his heart, &ldquo;My master is delaying his coming&rdquo; (v. 48), begins &ldquo;to beat his fellow slaves, and eat and drink with the drunken&rdquo; (v. 49), that is, to mistreat fellow believers and to keep company with worldly people, who are drunk with worldly things. &ldquo;The master of that slave shall come on a day when he does not expect him, and in an hour which he does not know, and shall cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth&rdquo; (vv. 50-51). For Christ, the Master of the evil slave, to &ldquo;cut him asunder,&rdquo; or cut him off, signifies His separating that slave from Himself in His coming glory. This corresponds to being &ldquo;cast out into outer darkness&rdquo; in Matthew 25:14-30. The Master will appoint the evil slave&rsquo;s portion &ldquo;with the hypocrites,&rdquo; indicating not that the slave will perish eternally but that he will be chastened dispensationally. Here we see Christ as the Master of the evil slaves.</p><h2 class="head2">22. The Bridegroom<br />
in the Parable of the Ten Virgins</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom&rdquo; (Matt. 25:1). The Bridegroom here signifies Christ as the most pleasant and attractive person (John 3:29; Matt. 9:15), and the virgins signify the believers who are looking forward to the coming of Him as the most attractive Person in the night. They are bearing His testimony as a shining lamp in their spirit (Prov. 20:27), with an extra portion of the Spirit (the oil) saturating their being (the vessel&mdash;Rom. 9:23-24), and going out of the world to meet Him. They should be ready to meet Him as the most pleasant Person by obtaining more of the saturating Spirit (buying the oil) at the cost of denying the self, renouncing the soulish life, and loving not the world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">23. The Man Going to the Foreign Country<br />
in the Parable of the Talents</h2>
<p>In the parable of the talents (Matt. 25:14-30) Christ is the &ldquo;man who, going into another country, called his own slaves and delivered to them his possessions&rdquo; (v. 14). &ldquo;Another country&rdquo; is the heavens. The &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; signify the believers in the aspect of service; in work they are purchased slaves serving Him. To His slaves Christ delivered His &ldquo;possessions,&rdquo; which include the gospel, the truth, the believers, and the church. To one slave He &ldquo;gave five talents, to another two, to another one&rdquo; (v. 15). In verse 14 the Lord gave His slaves His possessions, and in verse 15 He gave them talents.</p>
<p>Matthew 25:19 says, &ldquo;After a long time the lord of those slaves comes and settles accounts with them.&rdquo; A &ldquo;long time&rdquo; signifies the entire church age, and the coming signifies the Lord&rsquo;s coming to the air (1 Thes. 4:16). To settle accounts signifies the Lord&rsquo;s judgment at His judgment seat (2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10) in the air, where the believer&rsquo;s life, conduct, and work will be judged by the Lord for reward or punishment (1 Cor. 4:5; Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 1 Cor. 3:13-15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">24. A Patch of the New Garment<br />
Not Suitable for the Old Garment</h2>
<p>Luke 5:36 speaks of a &ldquo;new garment.&rdquo; This new garment is Christ as our righteousness to cover us outwardly. Whereas the unshrunk cloth in Matthew 9:16 signifies Christ from His incarnation to His crucifixion, the new garment in Luke 5:36 signifies the Christ who was &ldquo;treated&rdquo; in crucifixion and who became in resurrection the completed garment to cover us before God. The Lord&rsquo;s intention is to give Himself to us not as a piece of unshrunk cloth, but as a complete, finished garment that we may put on to be our righteousness so that we may be justified before God and enjoy His presence. In ourselves we are not qualified to be in God&rsquo;s presence. But when we put on Christ as the new garment, we are justified and worthy of God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>Luke 5:36 says, &ldquo;No one tears a patch from a new garment and puts it on an old garment; otherwise, he will tear the new, and also the patch from the new will not match the old.&rdquo; The &ldquo;old garment&rdquo; signifies man&rsquo;s good deeds, good behavior, and religious practices by the old natural life. A patch from a new garment is not suitable for this old garment. Instead of trying to patch the old garment, we should put on Christ as our new garment.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:27 says, &ldquo;As many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; To be baptized into Christ is to be clothed with Him. Therefore, the way to put on Christ as the new garment is to be baptized into Him. The New Testament reveals not only that after His resurrection Christ became the new garment but also that through resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ. This life-giving Spirit is the all-inclusive Christ with all that He is and all He has accomplished, and this Christ as the Spirit is the new garment for us to wear. When we were baptized into Christ as the Spirit, we put on Christ as our clothing, our covering. Hence, the new garment which we have put on is Christ Himself as the all-inclusive Spirit. Now Christ is no longer the untreated cloth; He is the finished garment that includes His incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and all the elements of His wonderful person.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FORTY-EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(28)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover more aspects of Christ&rsquo;s person in the parables of the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">25. A Moneylender with Two Debtors</h2>
<p>While the Lord Jesus was reclining at the table as a guest in the house of a Pharisee, a woman came, wet His feet with her tears, wiped His feet with her hair, kissed them, and anointed them (Luke 7:36-38). Seeing this, the Pharisee said within himself, &ldquo;This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, because she is a sinner&rdquo; (v. 39). By His divine attribute of omniscience the Lord knew what His host was saying in his heart (v. 40) and said, &ldquo;A certain moneylender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. But having nothing to repay, he graciously forgave them both&rdquo; (vv. 41-42a). The Lord&rsquo;s word reveals that He is the moneylender and that both the Pharisee and the woman were sinners, debtors to Him. In the parable the debtors had nothing to repay the moneylender, but he graciously forgave them both. This indicates that all sinners have nothing with which to repay their debt to God, their Savior. The Lord&rsquo;s word also indicates that the Savior had already forgiven both the Pharisee and the woman.</p>
<p>In verse 48 the Lord Jesus showed His tender care for the sinful one when He said, &ldquo;Your sins have been forgiven.&rdquo; The others present said among themselves, &ldquo;Who is this who even forgives sins?&rdquo; (v. 49). They did not realize that Christ, as the moneylender in the parable, is the incarnation of the forgiving God, that He is the very God, the One who has authority to forgive sins. At the conclusion of this incident, the Lord Jesus said to the woman, &ldquo;Your faith has saved you; go in peace&rdquo; (v. 50). Christ&rsquo;s divine attributes are also shown in His giving peace to the forgiven sinner. Only God can forgive sins and give peace. In Luke 7 these divine attributes are expressed through the Savior&rsquo;s human virtues, portraying Christ as the One with the highest standard of morality. As such a One He is the moneylender who forgives His debtors.</p>
<h2 class="head2">26. A Compassionate Samaritan<br />
Saving the Wounded</h2>
<p>In the parable of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37) Christ is portrayed as a compassionate Samaritan saving the wounded. Wanting to justify himself, a certain lawyer asked Jesus, &ldquo;Who is my neighbor?&rdquo; (v. 29). The Lord Jesus answered by telling of a man who was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and who fell among robbers, was stripped and beaten, and was left half dead (v. 30). The man signifies the lawyer, the robbers signify the legalistic teachers of the law, the stripping signifies the stripping by the law misused by the Judaizers, the beating signifies the killing of the law, and being left half dead signifies the Judaizers&rsquo; leaving the lawkeeper in a dead condition. After a priest and a Levite passed by, a &ldquo;certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came down to him, and observing him, was moved with compassion&rdquo; (v. 33). The Samaritan signifies the Lord Jesus, who was apparently a layman of low estate, despised and slandered as a low and mean Samaritan (John 8:48; 4:9) by the self-exalted and self-justified Pharisees. This indicates that Christ in His lost-one-seeking and sinner-saving ministry journey (Luke 19:10), came down to the place where the wounded victim of the Judaizing robbers was in his miserable and dying condition. When He saw him, He was moved with compassion in His humanity with His divinity and rendered him tender healing and saving care.</p>
<p>As the compassionate Samaritan, the Lord Jesus fully met the urgent need of the wounded one (vv. 34-35). He bound up his wounds&mdash;healing him; He poured on his wounds oil and wine&mdash;giving him the Holy Spirit and the divine life (Matt. 9:17; John 2:9); He placed him on His own beast&mdash;carrying him by lowly means in a lowly way (Zech. 9:9); He brought him to an inn&mdash;bringing him to the church; He took care of him&mdash;taking care of him through the church; He paid the inn for him&mdash;blessing the church for him; and, at His coming back, He will repay what is spent by the inn to take care of the wounded one. In all this we see Christ&rsquo;s divine attributes and human virtues. Concerning the divine attributes, we see the Spirit, the eternal life, the blessing, and the repayment. The Lord&rsquo;s human virtues revealed here include His compassion, love, sympathy, and care. Once again Christ&rsquo;s human virtues are mingled with His divine attributes to produce the highest standard of morality shown in His merciful, tender, and bountiful care for a sinner condemned under the law.</p><h2 class="head2">27. The Lord in the Parables of Watching</h2>
<p>The record of the parables of watching in Luke 12:35-48 is an allusion to the parables in Matthew 24:42&mdash;25:13. Hence, the lord in Luke 12:36 and 43 is Christ, as the householder and the bridegroom in Matthew 24:42&mdash;25:13 are. He is our Lord who will come back to be with us in a pleasant way as one from the marriage feast, and will reward us whether pleasantly or unpleasantly according to how we take care of His appointment to us as His slaves. Therefore, we need to be watching.</p>
<h2 class="head2">28. The Vinedresser<br />
in the Parable of the Unfruitful Fig Tree</h2>
<p>Christ is the vinedresser in the parable of the unfruitful fig tree (Luke 13:6-9). This parable indicates that God as the owner of the vineyard came in the Son to the Jewish people as to a fig tree (Matt. 21:19; Jer. 24:2, 5, 8) planted in God&rsquo;s promised land as the vineyard (Matt. 21:33) to seek fruit from them. He had been seeking for three years (Luke 13:7), and He did not find any. He wanted to cut them down, but the Son as the vinedresser prayed for them that God the Father would tolerate them until He died for them (dug the ground around the fig tree) and gave them fertilizer (threw on manure), hoping that they would then repent and produce fruit. Otherwise, they would be cut down. This is actually what took place. Because the Jews did not repent, even after the Lord Jesus died and resurrected and the Spirit came, the &ldquo;fig tree&rdquo; was &ldquo;cut down.&rdquo; This happened in A.D. 70 when Titus brought his Roman army to Jerusalem and destroyed the city.</p>
<h2 class="head2">29. The Man Seeking the Lost Sheep</h2>
<p>In Luke 15:3-32 the Lord Jesus spoke three parables unveiling and depicting how the divine Trinity works to bring sinners back, through the Son and by the Spirit, to the Father. The Son is mentioned first because in God&rsquo;s salvation the One who comes, practically speaking, is the Son. The Son comes to accomplish redemption, which is the first need, because redemption is the foundation of our salvation. The redemption accomplished by Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross is the base of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>In the first parable (vv. 3-7) Christ is portrayed as a man seeking the lost sheep: &ldquo;What man of you, having a hundred sheep and having lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?&rdquo; (v. 4). The wilderness signifies the world. In the sight of God the world is a wild, desolate place where it is easy to get lost. The shepherd going into the wilderness to seek the lost sheep indicates that the Son has come into the world to be with men (John 1:14). The Son came in His humanity as the Shepherd to find the sinner as a lost sheep and bring it back home. Having found the sheep, &ldquo;he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And coming into his house, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep, the one that was lost!&rdquo; (Luke 15:5-6). Here we see the Savior&rsquo;s saving strength and His saving love.</p>
<p>As the Shepherd, the Son&rsquo;s way to seek us out is to die for us. He is the good Shepherd who gives His life for the sheep (John 10:11). If He did not die for us, He would not have a way to seek us out. The work of the Shepherd is to die for us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">30. The Best Robe and the Fattened Calf in<br />
the Parable of the Father Receiving the Prodigal</h2>
<p>In the parable of the Father receiving the prodigal (Luke 15:11-32) Christ is the best robe and the fattened calf. The prodigal son returned to his father and said, &ldquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son&rdquo; (v. 21). However, while he was still speaking, the father interrupted him and said to his slaves, &ldquo;Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him&rdquo; (v. 22). The definite article &ldquo;the&rdquo; used with &ldquo;best robe&rdquo; indicates that a particular robe had been prepared for this particular purpose, and the slaves knew that this robe was the best robe. Literally the Greek word translated &ldquo;best&rdquo; means first. When the son returned to his father, he was a poor beggar dressed in rags. But after the best robe was put on him, he was covered with a splendid garment prepared especially for him. With this best robe on, he was qualified to match his father. This robe signifies Christ the Son as the God-satisfying righteousness to cover the penitent sinner (Jer. 23:6; 1 Cor. 1:30). As the best robe, Christ is our righteousness in whom we are justified before God. Hence, putting the best robe on the returned prodigal signifies justification in Christ. As those who have Christ as the best robe, we are justified by God.</p>
<p>Although the prodigal was clothed with the best robe, he was still hungry. He must have been glad to hear his father say, &ldquo;Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry&rdquo; (v. 23). The fattened calf signifies the rich Christ (Eph. 3:8) killed on the cross for the believers&rsquo; enjoyment. As we eat Christ as the fattened calf, taking Him into our being, we are filled with the divine life for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>In this parable God&rsquo;s salvation is of two aspects: the outward objective aspect signified by the best robe, and the inward subjective aspect signified by the fattened calf. Christ as our righteousness is our outward salvation; Christ as our life and life supply for our enjoyment is our inward salvation. After coming back to his father, the prodigal son enjoyed all the riches of God&rsquo;s provision in His salvation, a salvation that is not only a matter of wearing but also of eating. The best robe qualified the prodigal to match his father&rsquo;s righteousness, and the fattened calf satisfied his hunger. Today we are enjoying Christ as our outward righteousness and as our inward life and life supply. Wearing Christ as our robe, we feed on Him as the fattened calf, digesting Him and assimilating Him into the very fibers of our being. As a result, we are sustained, satisfied, and strengthened, and we experience an inward, metabolic change.</p><h2 class="head2">31. A Man of Noble Birth<br />
in the Parable of the Minas</h2>
<p>The parable of the minas (Luke 19:11-27) depicts how the saved ones should serve the Lord so that they may inherit the coming kingdom. In verse 12 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;A certain man of noble birth went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.&rdquo; This man of noble birth signifies Christ the Savior with the highest status, the status of the God-man. The Lord Jesus is the only One whose birth was noble, because it was the birth of a God-man. The word &ldquo;went&rdquo; signifies the Lord&rsquo;s going to heaven after His death and resurrection (Luke 24:51; 1 Pet. 3:22), and &ldquo;return&rdquo; signifies the Savior&rsquo;s coming back with the kingdom (Dan. 7:13-14; Rev. 11:15; 2 Tim. 4:1).</p>
<p>The man of noble birth &ldquo;called ten of his own slaves&rdquo; and &ldquo;gave them ten minas, and said to them, Do business until I come&rdquo; (v. 13). In the parable in Matthew 25:14-30 the slaves are given a varying number of talents according to their individual ability. Here the parable emphasizes the common portion given equally to each slave based upon the common salvation. However, the point of both parables is the same: the faithfulness of the slaves will determine their portion in the coming kingdom as their reward.</p>
<p>Luke 19:15 says, &ldquo;It came about that when he came back, having received the kingdom, he said that those slaves to whom he had given the money should be called to him, that he might know what they had gained doing business.&rdquo; Then the man of noble birth rewarded the slave who used the mina to gain ten minas and also the one who used the mina to gain five (vv. 16-19). But he took away the mina from the slave who had laid it away in a handkerchief and then gave it to the slave with the ten minas (vv. 20-24). The taking away of the mina signifies that the Lord&rsquo;s gift will be taken away from slothful believers in the coming kingdom. Giving the mina to the one who has ten minas signifies that the gift of faithful believers will be increased in the coming kingdom age.</p>
<p>Finally, the man of noble birth said, &ldquo;These enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me&rdquo; (v. 27). This signifies that all the unbelieving Jews, who rejected the Lord Jesus and did not want Him to reign over them (v. 14), will perish.</p>
<h2 class="head2">32. The Door to Leave the Fold,<br />
the Pasture to Feed the Sheep, and<br />
the Shepherd in the Parable of the Sheepfold</h2>
<p>In the parable of the sheepfold Christ is the door, the pasture, and the shepherd. In John 10:9 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture.&rdquo; Some misinterpret the Lord&rsquo;s word and think that He is the door to heaven. According to this understanding, if we do not have Christ, we do not have the entrance to heaven. This interpretation is mistaken. In verse 9 the Lord Jesus speaks about going in and going out. If the door is the door to heaven, this would mean that Christ is not only the door for us to go into heaven but also the door for us to go out of heaven. Surely this interpretation of Christ as the door is not correct.</p>
<p>Christ is the door of the Old Testament sheepfold. The sheepfold signifies the law, or Judaism as a religion of the law, in which the sheep, God&rsquo;s chosen people, were kept until Christ came. When the pasture is not available in the wintertime or in the night, sheep must be kept in a fold. Before the Lord Jesus came, God&rsquo;s people were in the night. Therefore, God used the law to keep His chosen people and guard them in custody and ward until Christ came. Old Testament saints such as Moses, David, and Daniel were kept in custody in the fold. Hence, the Old Testament with the law as the center was the sheepfold in which God&rsquo;s chosen people were kept as they waited for the time when they could come out of the fold and come into the pasture.</p>
<p>All the Old Testament saints entered the sheepfold through Christ. This means that Christ was the door of the Old Testament sheepfold so that God&rsquo;s chosen people could enter the fold and be preserved there. But now Christ is the door for the sheep to come out of the fold. This is the reason verse 9 speaks of going in and going out. First, God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament went into the fold. But when the Lord Jesus came, it was time for them to go out of the fold. Therefore, Christ as the door is both the entrance and the exit of the sheepfold.</p>
<p>Through the door the sheep are brought out of the fold and into the pasture. Christ is the door through which the sheep are brought out, and He is also the pasture to which they are brought. The pasture signifies Christ as the feeding place for the sheep. When the pasture is ready, there is no further need for the sheep to remain in the fold. To be kept in the fold is transitory and temporary. To be in the pasture to enjoy its riches is final and permanent. Before Christ came, the law was a ward, and to be under the law was transitory. Now, since Christ has come, all God&rsquo;s chosen people must come out of the law and come into Him to enjoy Him as their pasture (Gal. 3:23-25; 4:3-5). This should be final and permanent.</p>
<p>The pasture is a place full of tender grass; that is, the pasture is a place full of the supply of life. When the sheep are in the pasture, they do not lack food. Today our pasture is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit. In our daily Christian life we should have the sense that we are in the pasture enjoying Christ as the rich supply of life.</p>
<p>Christ is not only the door and the pasture but also the Shepherd. As the Shepherd, Christ &ldquo;calls his own sheep by name and leads them out&rdquo; (John 10:3). He is the first one out of the fold and walks before His sheep. The sheep know His voice and follow Him (v. 4). As the Shepherd Christ takes the sheep out of the fold through Himself as the door and to Himself as the pasture.</p>
<p>In John 10:10 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly,&rdquo; and in verse 11 He says, &ldquo;I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.&rdquo; In these two verses two different Greek words are used for life. In verse 10 the Greek word is <em>zoe,</em> which is the word used in the New Testament for the eternal, divine life. In verse 11 the Greek word is <em>psuche,</em> the same word for soul, which means the soulish life, the human life. As a man the Lord Jesus has the psuche life, the human life, and as God He has the zoe life, the divine life. He laid down His soul, His psuche life, His human life, to accomplish redemption for His sheep (John 10:15, 17-18) so that they may share His zoe life, His divine life, the eternal life (10:28), by which they may be formed into one flock under Himself as the one shepherd. As the good shepherd Christ feeds His sheep with the divine life in this way and for this purpose.</p>
<p>Christ is our door, our pasture, and our Shepherd. As the door He is our freedom, as the pasture He is our life supply, and as our Shepherd He is leading, guiding, and directing us in the divine life. This life is related to the door, the pasture, and the Shepherd. As long as we have Christ as life within us and we enjoy and experience Him as life, we shall have Him as the door, the pasture, and the Shepherd. If we take Him as our enjoyment under His dispensing, we shall be freed from any kind of bondage or hindrance that comes from the &ldquo;fold&rdquo; of religion, we shall feed on the riches of His life, and He will be our Shepherd, protecting us even as He feeds us.</p><h2 class="head2">33. The Vine</h2>
<p>In John 15:1 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the true vine.&rdquo; It is the Father&rsquo;s pleasure that all He is, all the riches of His nature, and all the fullness of the Godhead be the riches of this vine. The vine is thus the embodiment of the fullness of the riches of divinity and of the Godhead. As the vine, Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s operation in the universe. The entire universe is a vineyard, and centered in this vineyard is the vine, who is Christ the Son. Everything is centered in Him. God the Father is the source and the founder, and God the Son is the center. Everything that God the Father is and has is for the center, is embodied in the center, and is expressed through the center. God the Father is expressed, manifested, and glorified through the vine.</p>
<p>As the vine Christ is the embodiment and manifestation of the Godhead. &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily&rdquo; (Col. 2:9). Not only is Christ the embodiment of the Godhead, but, according to John 1:18, He is the declaration, the manifestation, of God. Therefore, the Son of God, God&rsquo;s universal vine, is His embodiment and manifestation.</p>
<p>As the vine Christ is an organism full of life, like the tree of life. Furthermore, this vine is for the propagation and multiplication of life. To propagate life is to spread life widely, and to multiply life is to reproduce life. A vine is not noted for its blossoms or its materials; rather, it is noted for its manifestation of the riches of life. When a vine is full of ripened fruit, we see the riches of life. Christ, the true vine, is not life for people to appreciate as blossoms; neither is He life to be used as material. Rather, Christ is life to bring forth life and to reproduce life. This propagation and multiplication of life is to express life for the glorification of the Father. When the life of the vine is expressed through the branches in its propagation and multiplication, the Father is glorified, because what the Father is in the riches of His life is expressed in the propagation and multiplication of the vine.</p>
<h2 class="head2">34. The Child in the Parable<br />
of a Travailing Woman</h2>
<p>Christ is the child in the parable of the travailing woman. In John 16:21 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;When a woman gives birth she has sorrow, because her hour has come; but when she brings forth the child, she no longer remembers the affliction because of the joy that a man has been born into the world.&rdquo; This woman is the whole group of the disciples, the child is Christ, and the birth is resurrection. According to Acts 13:33, the Lord Jesus was born, begotten, in resurrection to be the Son of God with respect to His humanity. The Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, therefore, was a birth.</p>
<p>Although Christ was already the only begotten Son of God, it was still necessary for Him to be born in resurrection as the firstborn Son of God. In eternity Christ was the only begotten Son of God. Then in the incarnation He was born of Mary to be the Son of Man, and in resurrection He had another birth to be the firstborn Son of God. When Christ was born of Mary, He was born as a man, and His humanity had nothing to do with His being the only begotten Son of God. In other words, the human part of Jesus was not the Son of God. Therefore, it was necessary for this human part of Him to be born into the divine sonship through resurrection. Hence, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was a new birth for Him, and the disciples were the woman travailing in this birth. After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, this &ldquo;woman&rdquo; had a newborn child&mdash;the resurrected Christ as the firstborn Son of God&mdash;and she rejoiced (John 20:20). In this sense Christ was a child born in resurrection. After His resurrection He was the &ldquo;child&rdquo; with the divine life and the human nature with both divinity glorified and humanity &ldquo;sonized.&rdquo; The disciples as the mother must have been very happy at the birth of this wonderful child.</p>
<p>We have covered thirty-four aspects of Christ&rsquo;s person portrayed in the parables of the New Testament. He is the Winnower, the Physician, and the Bridegroom; the unshrunk cloth, the new garment, the best robe, the new wine, and the fattened calf; the Sower and the Lord of the harvest; the door and the pasture; the three measures of meal and the children&rsquo;s bread; the vine, the stone, and the lightning; the Householder, the Merchant, the Thief, the Teacher, the Master, the Lord, the Moneylender, the compassionate Samaritan, the Vinedresser, the Shepherd, the man of noble birth, and so much more. Here we see, once again, the riches of Christ and His all-inclusiveness. Actually, all the positive things in the universe may be used to portray what Christ is to us.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention in His creation is to use the things of creation to illustrate the all-inclusive Christ. The entire universe came into existence for the purpose of describing Him. For example, if vines had not been created, the Lord Jesus could not have used a vine to describe Himself. If there were no foxes or birds, Christ could not have compared His situation in His ministry to that of foxes with their holes and birds with their roosts. Even the pasture was created so that the Lord could use it as an illustration of Himself. Furthermore, many different kinds of persons, even a moneylender and a thief, are used to describe Christ. Because the universe with the billions of things and persons in it was created for the purpose of describing Christ, He, in revealing Himself to His disciples, could easily find in any environment something or someone to serve as an illustration of Himself. The whole universe is a picture of Christ. If we see this, we shall realize how rich, profound, unlimited, and unsearchable Christ is. Truly He is everything to us!</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FORTY-NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST&mdash;HIS PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(29)</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover Christ&rsquo;s person in the Father&rsquo;s husbandry, in the new covenant, and in the apostles&rsquo; preaching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">Q. IN THE FATHER&rsquo;S HUSBANDRY</h2>
<p>In the Father&rsquo;s husbandry Christ is the vine. John 15:1 says, &ldquo;I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman.&rdquo; This true vine, which is Christ the Son, with its branches, which are the believers in the Son, is the organism of the Triune God in God&rsquo;s economy, the divine dispensing, to grow with His riches and express His divine life. As the organism of the Triune God, this vine is corporate and universal.</p>
<p>In John 15 God the Father is revealed as the Husbandman who is related to a husbandry, a plantation. A husbandman is the source, the originator, the founder, and the planter of a husbandry. As such, he engages in an enterprise. The universe is the enterprise of the Father. The Father has a divine plan, an eternal purpose, and He wants to fulfill the intention behind His purpose. This is what is meant by the Father&rsquo;s being the Husbandman. He is the Husbandman of the vineyard who plans to carry out a certain purpose. He is the source, the founder, the first one to accomplish certain things according to His mind and purpose.</p>
<p>It is the Father&rsquo;s pleasure that all that He is and has become the riches of Christ as the vine. All that the Father is, all that the Father has, all the riches of the Father&rsquo;s life, and all the fullness of the Godhead are in the vine, which is the embodiment of them all. The Father as the Husbandman is the source, the author, the planner, the planter, the life, the substance, the soil, the water, the air, the sunshine, and everything to the vine. Therefore, the Son as the vine is the center of God&rsquo;s economy and the embodiment of all the riches of the Father. The Father, by cultivating the Son, works Himself with all of His riches into this vine, and eventually the vine expresses the Father through its branches in a corporate way. This is the Father&rsquo;s economy in the universe.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the children of Israel were a vine in the sight of God (Psa. 80:8; cf. Isa. 5:2; Jer. 2:21; Ezek. 19:10; 15:2). But Israel failed God as the vine because they did not give Him the opportunity to express Himself through them. Eventually, the Lord Jesus came as the true vine that can fully express God. This true vine is the very embodiment of God and the full manifestation of God. What God is and what God has are embodied in this true vine and are fully expressed through this vine.</p>
<p>Christ as the true vine is the center of God&rsquo;s economy, the center of God&rsquo;s husbandry, of God&rsquo;s universal enterprise. In the Bible the universe is pictured as a vineyard, and centered in this universe is the vine, Christ. Everything that God the Father is and has is for the vine as the center, is embodied in the center, and is expressed through the center. God the Father is expressed, manifested, and glorified through the vine.</p>
<p>The vine in John 15 is the focus of the Bible. We may think of John 15 merely as a parable used by the Lord. But this chapter is not merely a parable; it is a reality that reveals the focus of God&rsquo;s intention. God is life, and life needs an organism in which to grow and express itself. God desires to grow within an organism and to have Himself expressed by means of this organism. This organism is the vine with the branches, Christ with the believers. This organism glorifies the Father by releasing and expressing His intent, content, life, and riches. In particular, the vine expresses the riches of the divine life. When the vine bears clusters of grapes, the riches of life are expressed. This expression is the glorification of the Father because the Father is the divine life. The Father is the source and substance of the vine. But without the fruit, the essence, substance, and life of the vine would be hidden and confined. The riches of the inner life of the vine are expressed in the clusters of fruit. To express the inner life of the vine in this way is to release the divine substance from within the vine. This is the glorification of the Father through Christ as the vine in the Father&rsquo;s husbandry.</p><h2 class="head1">R. IN THE NEW COVENANT</h2>
<p>Let us now go on to consider Christ&rsquo;s person in the new covenant. The new covenant, which the Lord Jesus enacted, is better than the old covenant made through Moses. In the old covenant all things were shadows, whereas in the new covenant everything is reality. Everything in the old covenant has been fulfilled and realized in the new covenant. Hence, the new covenant is a better covenant (Heb. 7:22; 8:6). In the new covenant God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Apostle</h2>
<p>In the new covenant Christ is the Apostle (Heb. 3:1), the first Apostle in the New Testament. The word &ldquo;apostle&rdquo; in Greek means a sent one, one who is sent by a higher authority. Christ was sent by God to carry out God&rsquo;s new covenant. As the Apostle Christ is the One who was sent to us from God and with God (John 6:46; 8:16). The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who sent Me is with Me&rdquo; (John 8:29). Christ, our Apostle, came to us with God to share God with us so that we may partake of His divine nature, life, and fullness.</p>
<p>As the Apostle Christ is typified by Moses, who came from God to serve the house of God. However, whereas Moses was only part of the house, Christ is the Builder of God&rsquo;s house (Heb. 3:3). He has two natures: humanity, which is good for the material for the building of God&rsquo;s house, and divinity, which is the element of the Builder. Christ was sent from God to be the Apostle to form, build, and constitute God&rsquo;s house, the church (1 Tim. 3:15), and then to take care of this house. Christ is now &ldquo;over His house, whose house we are&rdquo; (Heb. 3:6). Today in the church we enjoy Him as the Apostle in the new covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. The High Priest</h2>
<p>Hebrews 3:1 says, &ldquo;Consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus.&rdquo; In the new covenant Christ is not only the Apostle but also the High Priest. In the old covenant the high priest was a mortal man, and his ministry was a shadow of the good things to come. But the new covenant has a High Priest who is the eternal Son of God with a more excellent ministry (Heb. 8:1-13). With Him there is no preventing of death. His ministry is the ministry of the kingly and divine priesthood in heaven, ministering, by His intercession, the divine life with all its riches as our daily supply to bring us into His perfection and glorification.</p>
<p>As the High Priest, typified by Aaron, Christ has gone to God from us and with us to present us to God so that we and our case may be fully taken care of by God. As the One who came from the Father, the Sender, Christ is the Apostle, and as the One who went back to the Sender, He is the High Priest. Thus, there is traffic between God and us and between us and God. Now Christ is the High Priest executing God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>As our High Priest Christ is merciful and faithful in things pertaining to God (Heb. 2:17), He has passed through the heavens (Heb. 4:14) and is even higher than the heavens (Heb. 7:26), and He is always living to intercede for us (Heb. 7:25). Christ can be a faithful High Priest because He, as the Son of God, is actually the faithful and almighty God Himself. Christ can be a merciful High Priest because, as the Son of Man, He experienced human life with all its sufferings. Through resurrection and ascension our High Priest passed through the heavens and is now not only in heaven (Heb. 9:24) but also higher than the heavens, &ldquo;far above all the heavens&rdquo; (Eph. 4:10), to bear us in the presence of God and to care for all our needs. As our High Priest Christ undertakes our case by interceding for us. He appears before God on our behalf, praying for us that we may be brought fully into God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and into the reality of the new covenant.</p><h2 class="head2">3. The Shedder of the Better Blood</h2>
<p>Christ is the Shedder of the better blood to enact the new covenant. The new covenant required the shedding of the blood of the God-man, the shedding of the blood of Jesus, the Son of God (1 John 1:7). The efficacy of this blood is eternal, and its application has no limit either in space or in time. This is the better blood by which the new covenant was made.</p>
<p>Hebrews 9:22 says, &ldquo;Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.&rdquo; Without forgiveness of sin there is no way to fulfill the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness that by it the covenant may be enacted. But Christ&rsquo;s blood has been shed for the forgiveness of sin, and the covenant has been enacted with His blood (Matt. 26:28). We are told in Hebrews 12:24 that Christ&rsquo;s blood &ldquo;speaks better than that of Abel.&rdquo; This precious blood speaks to God for us that by it the new covenant may be enacted. Hence, it is called &ldquo;the blood of an eternal covenant&rdquo; (Heb. 13:20).</p>
<p>Hebrews 9:12 says, &ldquo;Nor through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, having found an eternal redemption.&rdquo; In the old covenant the blood of goats and calves only made atonement for the people&rsquo;s sins (Lev. 16:15-18); it did not accomplish redemption for their sins, &ldquo;for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins&rdquo; (Heb. 10:4). In Hebrew the root of the word for atonement means cover. Thus, atonement means to cover, not to take away sins. Because Christ as the Lamb of God took away the sin of the world (John 1:29) by offering Himself on the cross as the sacrifice for our sins once for all (Heb. 10:12), His blood, which He sprinkled in the heavenly tabernacle, has accomplished an eternal redemption for us, even the redemption of the transgressions under the first, the old, covenant (Heb. 9:15), which transgressions were only covered by animal blood. Hence, we have been redeemed with the precious blood of Christ (1 Pet. 1:18-19).</p>
<p>Hebrews 9:14 says, &ldquo;How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.&rdquo; The blood of Christ purifies our conscience to serve the living God. To serve the living God requires a blood-purified conscience. The living God, whom we desire to serve, always comes to our spirit (John 4:24) by touching our conscience, the leading part of our spirit. God is righteous, holy, and living. Our defiled conscience needs to be purified so that we may serve Him in a living way. In order to contact this living God we need to exercise our spirit and have a blood-purified conscience. The blood of Christ was shed for the forgiveness of sins (Matt. 26:28), and the new covenant was consummated with it (Heb. 10:29; Luke 22:20). It has accomplished eternal redemption for us (Eph. 1:7) and has purchased the church for God (Acts 20:28). It washes us from our sins (Rev. 1:5; 1 John 1:7), purifies our conscience, sanctifies us (Heb. 13:12), and speaks better things for us (Heb. 12:24). By this blood we enter the Holy of Holies (Heb. 10:19) and overcome Satan the accuser (Rev. 12:10-11). Therefore, it is precious and better than the blood of goats and bulls (Heb. 9:12-14a). We must highly value it and should not regard it common as animal blood.</p>
<p>Hebrews 12:24 says that &ldquo;the blood of sprinkling&#133; speaks better than that of Abel.&rdquo; This is the blood of the eternal covenant (Heb. 13:20), with which the new and better covenant was enacted. By this blood Christ cleansed the heavens and all things in the heavens (Heb. 9:22-24). The blood of Christ not only redeems, sanctifies, and purifies; it also speaks. It is the speaking blood, speaking better than the blood of Abel. Abel&rsquo;s blood speaks to God for accusation and vengeance (Gen. 4:10, 15), whereas Christ&rsquo;s blood speaks to God for forgiveness, justification, reconciliation, and redemption. Moreover, this precious blood speaks to God for us saying that by it, as unveiled in the book of Hebrews, the new covenant, which is eternal, has been enacted, and that in this new covenant God must give Himself and all His blessings to the believers in Christ who receive this covenant by faith.</p>
<p>Hebrews 13:20 says, &ldquo;The God of peace who brought up from among the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of an eternal covenant.&rdquo; This verse indicates that it was by the blood of the eternal covenant that God raised Christ from the dead. All that God has ordained has been covenanted to be our portion. This portion is actually God Himself with His nature, life, and attributes. The blood of Christ, therefore, brings us into God to enjoy Him as our portion.</p>
<p>The blood of the covenant is not mainly for forgiveness; it is primarily for God to be our portion. God has ordained and predestinated us to enjoy Him. This enjoyment has been covenanted to us through the new covenant enacted by the blood of Jesus Christ, the blood that brings us into all the divine blessings. Yes, the blood cleanses us from our sins. But even more important than this, the better blood of the new covenant brings us into the very God who is our portion for us to enjoy.</p><h2 class="head2">4. The Mediator</h2>
<p>In the new covenant Christ is also the Mediator. Hebrews 8:6 says, &ldquo;He is also the Mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted upon better promises.&rdquo; As the Mediator Christ goes between us and God, and in resurrection He executes the new covenant, which He bequeathed to us by His death. This better covenant was not only enacted upon better promises of a better law, the inner law of life (Heb. 8:10-12), but also was consummated with Christ&rsquo;s better sacrifices (Heb. 9:23), which have accomplished for us eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12). In the new covenant we have the forgiveness of sins and the law of life. Christ is the Mediator of this better covenant.</p>
<p>Hebrews 9:15 says, &ldquo;He is Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.&rdquo; By His death Christ consummated the new covenant. In His death He left this new covenant with us, and now in His resurrection He, as the Mediator of the new covenant, is executing what has been accomplished in the new covenant. All the promises of God have become accomplished facts in the new covenant to Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work. As the Mediator of the new covenant, Christ today in resurrection is enforcing this covenant.</p>
<p>Hebrews 12:24 also speaks of Christ as the Mediator of the new covenant. Here the Greek word for &ldquo;new,&rdquo; <em>neos,</em> means fresh, youthful in respect to age, whereas the word for new in Hebrews 8:8 and 9:15, <em>kainos,</em> means new, fresh in respect to quality. In such a new covenant Christ is our Mediator.</p>
<h2 class="head2">5. The Surety of a Better Covenant</h2>
<p>Hebrews 7:22 says, &ldquo;Jesus has become the surety of a better covenant.&rdquo; That Christ has become the Surety of a better covenant is based on the fact that He is the living and perpetual High Priest. The root of the Greek word translated &ldquo;surety&rdquo; means a limb, a member of the body. The meaning here is that a member of the body pledges itself to the body. This pledge is a guarantee. The word surety in Hebrews 7:22 means that Christ has pledged Himself to the new covenant and to all of us. He is the bondsman, the guarantee that He will do everything necessary for the fulfillment of the new covenant.</p>
<p>Regarding the new covenant, a bond has been signed by Christ. Christ signed this bond by pledging Himself to the new covenant and to all of us who are under the new covenant. Because Christ has pledged Himself in this way, there is no possibility for Him to change His mind. He must do everything for us. Thus, He is the Surety of the new covenant. This pledge, which is unlimited, depends completely on His divine priesthood. The very Christ who has pledged Himself to us is unlimited. He is the qualified, capable, and able Surety. He is always available and prevailing to fulfill whatever He has guaranteed. Therefore, the new covenant, the better covenant, cannot fail because Christ is the Surety of this covenant. Everything included in it will be fulfilled not by us but by our Surety. Christ is not only the Consummator of the new covenant; He is also the Surety, the pledge that everything in it will be fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. The Maker and the Executor<br />
of the New Testament</h2>
<p>Christ is the Maker and the Executor of the new testament (Heb. 9:16-17). In Greek the same word is used for both covenant and testament. Whether it is translated covenant or testament depends on whether the person who consummated the covenant is living or dead. If the consummator is still living, that covenant remains a covenant. But if the consummator has died, the covenant immediately becomes a testament. A covenant is an agreement containing some promises to accomplish certain things for the covenanted people, while a testament is a will containing certain accomplished things bequeathed to the inheritor. The new covenant consummated with the blood of Christ is not merely a covenant, but a testament with all the things which have been accomplished by the death of Christ bequeathed to us. The term testament is the equivalent of the modern term will. Many parents, when they know that they soon will die, make a will in which they leave various things to their children. A will only becomes effective after the death of the maker of the will. In a simple word a covenant and a testament are the same, but when the maker of the covenant is living, it is a covenant, and when he has died, it is a testament, a will.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s covenant is enacted upon God&rsquo;s promise (Heb. 8:6), which is the word He speaks. A promise is a common, ordinary word without confirmation. In the Bible, after God made His promise, He sealed it with an oath, swearing by His Godhead that His promise was confirmed. After His promise was confirmed by an oath, it immediately became the covenant sealed by God. That the promises have become a covenant means that they cannot be altered; there is no possibility of repentance or change.</p>
<p>After God made His promises in the Old Testament, confirming them by His oath (Gen. 22:16-18; Psa. 110:4), the Lord Jesus came and accomplished all that God had promised. By the Lord&rsquo;s work on earth every item of God&rsquo;s promise has become an accomplished fact. For example, in Jeremiah 31:34 God promised to forgive our sins. The Lord Jesus did this, making propitiation for our sins on the cross as the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s promise. Hence, forgiveness of sins is no longer a promise but an accomplished fact. God&rsquo;s promised covenant was consummated as the new covenant by the Lord&rsquo;s death with His blood (Heb. 9:18-23; Matt. 26:28; Luke 22:20).</p>
<p>After His death and resurrection, the Lord Jesus ascended into the heavens, leaving with us the covenant that He had accomplished by His death. When He left this covenant with us, it immediately became a testament, a new testament bequeathed to us. In this testament the accomplished facts are no longer merely facts; they have become bequests. First, we had the promises; second, the promises became the facts; and third, the facts have become bequests. Through the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection all the promises were fulfilled and became accomplished facts. Now these facts are bequests. As our High Priest in the heavens, the Lord is now the Executor of the new testament, executing what He has bequeathed.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s new testament is executed by the resurrected Christ as the Mediator, the Executor, in the heavens. Today the resurrected Christ is executing this will by interceding for us. The new testament, the will, has been validated by Christ&rsquo;s death and is being executed and enforced by Christ in His resurrection. The promise of God&rsquo;s covenant is insured by God&rsquo;s faithfulness, God&rsquo;s covenant is guaranteed by God&rsquo;s righteousness, and the new testament is enforced by Christ&rsquo;s resurrection power. As the ascended One sitting on the throne in the heavens, Christ is now executing what He has bequeathed, interceding for us to realize all the bequests contained in the new testament.</p><h2 class="head2">7. The Offerings</h2>
<p>The new covenant was consummated with better sacrifices and with the blood that speaks better things. Christ offered Himself as one sacrifice (Heb. 9:14; 10:12). This one sacrifice, viewed from its various aspects, may be considered many sacrifices. As Christ is the eternal Son of the living God incarnated to be the Son of Man who offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit, so His sacrifices are better than those of animals. The animal sacrifices were shadows which could never take away sins (Heb. 10:11), but His sacrifices are real and have put away sin once for all (Heb. 9:26).</p>
<p>None of the sacrifices offered by the Levitical priests could put away sin. Even the Old Testament predicted in Isaiah 53:10 and 12 that Christ would come to be the sacrifice for sin, that is, to replace and terminate the Levitical sacrifices. Christ, the unique sacrifice, has done this. Therefore, the book of Hebrews tells us many times that Christ has dealt with sins once for all (1:3; 2:17; 7:27; 9:26; 10:12).</p>
<p>All the sacrifices offered according to the law were a shadow of Christ. At the fullness of time, Christ came with a body of blood and flesh to replace those sacrifices of the law. In the flesh He offered Himself to God once for all to take away sins. Hebrews 10:7, 9, and 10 say that it is the will of God to take away the first, the animal sacrifices of the Old Testament, so that the second, the sacrifice of Christ of the New Testament, might be established to replace the sacrifices of the Old Testament. Therefore, in the new covenant Christ, the unique sacrifice, is the reality of all the offerings. According to the divine principle, God&rsquo;s covenant required both the blood and the offerings. Christ is both the Shedder of the better blood and also the offerings for the enacting of the new covenant and to make this covenant a will full of divine bequests.</p>
<p>Having considered Christ&rsquo;s person in the new covenant, we see that in the new covenant Christ is everything. He is the Apostle, the High Priest, the Shedder of the better blood, the Mediator, the Surety, the Maker and Executor of the new testament, and all the offerings. Through Him, the all-inclusive One, the new covenant has become a new testament with many bequests for us to enjoy and experience through the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">S. IN THE APOSTLES&rsquo; PREACHING</h2>
<p>In the apostles&rsquo; preaching Christ is the triumphant Victor. This is described in 2 Corinthians 2:14: &ldquo;Thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and manifests through us the savor of the knowledge of Him in every place.&rdquo; Here Paul uses the metaphor of a procession held in honor of the victory of a Roman general. Concerning this verse Conybeare has this to say: &ldquo;The verb here used means to lead a man as a captive in a triumphal procession; the full phrase means, to lead captive in a triumph over the enemies of Christ.&#133;God is celebrating His triumph over His enemies; Paul (who had been so great an opponent of the gospel) is a captive following in the train of the triumphal procession, yet (at the same time, by a characteristic change of metaphor) an incense-bearer, scattering incense (which was always done on these occasions) as the procession moves on.&rdquo; God always leads the apostles in such a triumphant way in their ministry. The word &ldquo;us&rdquo; refers to the conquered captives in the train of Christ&rsquo;s triumph, celebrating and participating in His triumph. The apostles are such captives; their move as captives of Christ in their ministry for Him is God&rsquo;s celebration of Christ&rsquo;s victory over His enemies. Their move and their ministry for Christ is like a triumphal procession from one place to another under God&rsquo;s leading. Paul and his co-workers were Christ&rsquo;s captives, bearing the fragrant incense of Christ for His triumphant glory. They had been conquered by Christ and had become His captives in the train of His triumph, scattering the fragrance of Christ from place to place.</p>
<p>Paul once fought against Christ, the heavenly General, but eventually he was defeated, subdued, and captured, and thereby became a captive of Christ. Saul of Tarsus fought against Christ, against God&rsquo;s economy, and against the churches. But while he was fighting, he was defeated and subdued by Christ on the way to Damascus. After Saul was captured, he was placed in Christ&rsquo;s triumphal procession as one of the captives in a train of defeated foes. This indicates that the proper ministry of the New Testament is a triumphal procession celebrating Christ&rsquo;s victory. The ministry of the New Testament is to testify of Christ as the triumphant Victor.</p></body></html>
