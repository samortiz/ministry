   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In our fellowship in this chapter, we have come to the final book of the New Testament Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the four Gospels is the Son with the Father by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the twenty-two books from Acts through Jude is the Spirit as the Son with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This Spirit is the all-inclusive, compound, processed, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the book of Revelation the all-inclusive, compound, processed, life-giving Spirit is now intensified seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The life-giving Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God is seven times intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 20:22 is the Spirit as the breath, the essential Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Acts 2 and 10 is the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1 Corinthians 12 is the manifestation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Finally, in Revelation is the life-giving Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, seven times intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The seven Spirits are the seven lamps of the lampstand Rev 4:5 and the seven eyes of the Lamb Rev 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Essentially, the Spirit is only one, but economically, He is seven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In God's economy and in His function, He becomes the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Revelation it is not a matter of the essence but a matter of the function, of the economy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Economically speaking, the Spirit is intensified sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In substance and existence God's Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God's operation, God's Spirit is sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Economically speaking, the Spirit of God in God's administration is the eyes of the administrating Son, the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is for function, not for existence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order for us to do anything we need our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the divine administration, Christ needs the Spirit to be His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without the seven Spirits, Christ does not have the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is the very focal Executor of God's economy, yet He needs the seven Spirits as His eyes to carry out God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Nicene Creed, which was formulated in A.D. 325, is not complete because it does not say anything concerning the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This creed talks about the Godhead of the Triune God, the divine Trinity, in a general way, but it does not cover anything in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Nicene Creed was made in A.D. 325, there was still disagreement as to whether Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, and Revelation should be included in the Bible or not.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, this creed was made apart from the truth contained in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was not until A.D. 397 at the council held in Carthage in the northern part of Africa that Revelation, along with the other six books, was recognized as a part of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Nicene Creed is not complete because it does not cover the book of Revelation, which is the ultimate consummation of the divine revelation.</S>
