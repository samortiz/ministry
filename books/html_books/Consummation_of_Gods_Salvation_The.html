<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in a young people&rsquo;s training in Taipei, Taiwan, from October 29 through November 5, 1972.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CONSUMMATION OF GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION&mdash;<br />
THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:4, 7, 22-23; 2:8, 15; 3:16-17, 19; 4:2-3, 22-24; 5:22, 25, 32</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE RELATED TO EPHESIANS</h2>
<p>Ephesians is regarded and treasured by every Christian who loves the Lord. Yet some have a rather basic knowledge of Ephesians, while others have a deeper understanding. For example, in chapter 1 most Christians focus on God&rsquo;s selection in verse 4 and Christ&rsquo;s redemption in verse 7, but few focus on the church as the Body of Christ in verses 22 and 23. This shows that it is possible to have two kinds of knowledge related to Ephesians, one that is basic and one that is deeper.</p>
<p>In chapter 2 many orthodox and spiritual believers like to quote the phrase <em>by grace you have been saved</em> in verses 5 and 8, and they speak also of Christ&rsquo;s death dealing with sins and the old man on the cross. But very few speak of Christ abolishing in His flesh on the cross the law of the commandments in ordinances in order to create the Jews and the Gentiles in Himself into one new man (v. 15).</p>
<p>In chapter 3 many treasure the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ in verse 19, but few speak of being strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man in verse 16. The inner man is our regenerated spirit, which contains the Lord Jesus as our life. When our spirit is strengthened, the Lord has an outlet to spread in us and possess every part of our being. Thus, He can make His home in our heart to the point that we are filled unto all the fullness of God (vv. 17, 19).</p>
<p>In chapter 4 people like to speak of the virtues of lowliness, meekness, long-suffering, bearing one another in love, and the uniting bond of peace in verses 2 and 3, but few speak of the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man in verses 22 and 24. The new man is the church, the Body of Christ, which is the corporate new man that Christ created in Himself on the cross (2:15). In order to put on the new man, we need to be renewed in the spirit of our mind (4:23). The spirit in verse 23 is the believers&rsquo; regenerated spirit that has been mingled with the indwelling Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit mingled with our human spirit as one spirit. This spirit needs to spread into our mind and saturate our mind to become the spirit of our mind. Being renewed in the spirit of our mind changes our view of people, affairs, and things. This renewing enables us to put off the old man and put on the new man to live the church life. These deeper teachings are neglected by much of Christianity.</p>
<p>In chapter 5 most people pay attention to wives being subject to their own husbands and husbands loving their wives in verses 22 and 25, but many miss the point that this chapter is focused on a great mystery, the mystery of Christ and the church in verse 32. Husbands loving their wives and wives being subject to their husbands are the more superficial aspects of chapter 5. The deeper aspect related to married life is that it is a type of Christ and the church. However, many Christians do not see this aspect.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SALVATION BEING THE BEGINNING,<br />
AND THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING THE CONSUMMATION</h2>
<p>We need both types of knowledge of Ephesians. We need both a basic and a deeper knowledge of Ephesians. We need to know God&rsquo;s selection and redemption; however, we also need to see that God selected and redeemed us so that in one Spirit we would become one Body, which is the fullness of the One who fills all in all (1:23). Christ is the One who fills all in all; He is the great One who needs the church as His fullness, His expression. We have been chosen and redeemed by God to become the fullness of Christ corporately.</p>
<p>If we truly see this vision, we will be beside ourselves, because each one of us is a part of the expression of Christ. In order to be a part of this fullness, we must be those who have been chosen, redeemed, and forgiven of our offenses. However, if we see only that we have been redeemed and forgiven of our offenses, we may not experience the Body as the fullness of Christ in reality. Many Christians have experienced Christ&rsquo;s redemption, but they have not experienced the Body as the fullness of Christ. This indicates that many have only a basic experience of Christ. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not a recovery of the teachings of selection, redemption, and the forgiveness of offenses. These truths have been recovered. What the Lord wants to recover today is the truth and experience of the Body of Christ as the fullness of Christ.</p>
<p>Ephesians speaks of a beginning and a consummation. The beginning is the salvation of God, and the consummation is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all. This fullness is expressed practically in the church life. The church life is the fullness of Christ; this is the recovery that God desires today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO BRING PEOPLE<br />
INTO THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>We have the best way to preach the gospel today. When the American brothers and sisters preach the gospel, they do not begin with the matters of sin and the world. Instead, they speak to people directly about the church, saying, &ldquo;Your life has no meaning if you do not have the church, which is the fullness of Christ. If you would turn and enter into the practical church life, you would gain Christ as your all.&rdquo; Many have been brought into the church in this way. Once people touch the church, they spontaneously experience the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness and the cleansing of His precious blood, and there is no doubt as to their being chosen and redeemed. However, when our speaking is focused only on salvation, people are saved but are not brought into the church life to become a part of the fullness of Christ in reality. This was our situation in the past. Today we need to recover the matter of bringing the chosen and redeemed into the church life to express the fullness of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THERE BEING NO ORDINANCES IN THE CHURCH<br />
BUT ONLY THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>I would like to say something regarding the matter of ordinances. We all have many ordinances, which compose our former manner of life in the old man (4:22). Only by putting off these ordinances, that is, the old man, can we put on the new man. In the church, the new man, there are no ordinances; there is only the Spirit in our spirit. The church is the Body of Christ, the expression of Christ, and the enlargement of Christ. Today Christ is the Spirit dwelling in our spirit, and He wants to be expressed from our spirit. This is the church. The enemy fears and hates the manifestation of the church in the universe.</p>
<p>Satan not only defiles and usurps man through sins and the world; he promotes religious rituals and doctrines as ordinances among the believers so that the Body of Christ, the new man that God desires, would be annulled and not come into being. Satan&rsquo;s stratagem is to bind people with ordinances; he even uses biblical knowledge to bind people. It is very sad to see someone come to a meeting merely to observe, criticize, and debate doctrines. A person who can only criticize a message as being unscriptural or a teaching as being incorrect is most pitiful. Merely having correct doctrines is of little value; the Lord wants vitality. We need to be vitalized to the uttermost in order to bring people to salvation; we need to be so vitalized that all Taipei and even the entire island of Taiwan are evangelized. Furthermore, we need to bring people into the church life in order to express the fullness of Christ. Then this country will be greatly blessed.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
BEING GOD&rsquo;S MASTERPIECE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 2</h1>
<p>Ephesians 1 shows that God chose us before the foundation of the world and redeemed us in time through the blood of His beloved Son for the ultimate purpose of our becoming the Body of Christ (vv. 4, 6-7, 22-23). The Body is the fullness of Christ, the expression of all Christ&rsquo;s riches. This is God&rsquo;s goal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DEAD IN OUR OFFENSES AND SINS</h2>
<p>Verse 1 of chapter 2 says, &ldquo;And you, though dead in your offenses and sins.&rdquo; The word <em>And</em> indicates that chapter 2 follows chapter 1. Chapter 2 shows the original condition of those who have become the Body of Christ. This original condition was one of death. In this verse being dead does not refer to death in the flesh but to the deadness of man&rsquo;s God-contacting organ&mdash;the human spirit. When our spirit was dead, there were three manifestations of this deadness.</p>
<p>First, we walked according to the age of this world (v. 2), which means that we walked according to the current, the modernity, and the fashion of this world. A person who walks according to the modern current of this age is a walking corpse. He is like a dead leaf being carried downstream by the current in a river. Whereas a little fish can swim upstream against the current because it is alive and living, a leaf can only be carried downstream because it is dead and lifeless.</p>
<p>Second, we walked according to the ruler of the authority of the air (v. 2), that is, Satan. The authority of the air refers to the spirit that is now operating in the sons of disobedience; it is the aggregate of all the evil angelic authorities, over whom Satan is the ruler. Although everyone likes to speak about freedom, no one with a deadened human spirit is actually free; he is under the control of Satan. For example, in their conscience people know that they should not gamble, smuggle, traffic in drugs, or steal, but they cannot help themselves; there is an evil power that compels them because Satan is operating within them to drive them to sin against their will.</p>
<p>Third, we conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh and did the desires of our flesh and of our thoughts (v. 3). The lusts of our flesh are the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts. The desires of the thoughts also reflect our preferences. We conducted ourselves according to our lusts and according to our preferences.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING MADE ALIVE TOGETHER AND SEATED TOGETHER<br />
IN THE HEAVENLIES IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>God chose us to be the expression of Christ, yet we were dead in our human spirit because of the fall. But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, made us alive together with Christ (vv. 4-5). We were not only sinners; we were dead persons. Sinners are in need of God&rsquo;s forgiveness; dead persons are in need of being made alive by the life-giving God. Verse 5 speaks of our being made alive &ldquo;together with Christ.&rdquo; <em>Together with</em> means not only together with Christ but also together with the saints. When the Israelites crossed the Red Sea, they crossed the Red Sea together. Even though I may have been saved for many more years than a new believer, we both were made alive together with Christ. Not only so, we were seated together in the heavenlies (v. 6). We are not waiting to go to heaven; we were seated in the heavenlies together with Christ long ago.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING GOD&rsquo;S MASTERPIECE</h2>
<p>Verse 10 says, &ldquo;We are His masterpiece.&rdquo; The word <em>masterpiece</em> is <em>poiema</em> in Greek, and it means &ldquo;something that has been made, a handiwork, or something that has been rendered as a poem.&rdquo; It denotes an outstanding work of art that expresses the maker&rsquo;s wisdom and design. We are a poem of God to express His wisdom. Now God can say to Satan, &ldquo;Do you see this group of people? Even though they were dead in offenses and sins, they now have been made alive and are seated together with Christ in the heavenlies. They are My masterpiece; they are the poem that I have written in the universe.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING RECONCILED TO GOD AND<br />
BEING FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD OF GOD</h2>
<p>Verses 11 through 18 show that we now have access through Christ in one Spirit unto the Father; we no longer are far off. According to the context, being far off refers to being far off from Christ, the commonwealth of Israel, and the covenants of God&rsquo;s promise, and it refers especially to the Gentiles and Jews being far from one another. We once were far off, apart from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But on the cross Christ abolished the enmity, the law of the commandments in ordinances, and broke down the middle wall of partition so that Jews and Gentiles could have access in one Spirit unto the Father. This implies the Trinity. As the life-giving Spirit, the Triune God enters into both Jewish and Gentile believers. In one Spirit we have become one Body, and we have been reconciled to God.</p>
<p>The reconciliation preached by Christianity today focuses primarily on reconciliation between individuals and God; it neglects the fact that reconciliation is not only an individual matter but also a corporate matter. We are reconciled in one Body to God. Verse 17 speaks of Christ coming as the Spirit to announce peace as the gospel to the Gentiles, who were far off, and to the Jews, who were near. The gospel makes both Jewish and Gentile believers citizens of the kingdom of God and members of the household of God. Today in the genuine church life there is no distinction based on race or culture; the saints&rsquo; love for one another is like the love that is inherent among blood relatives. This is indeed God&rsquo;s masterpiece and the Lord&rsquo;s victory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GROWING IN SPIRIT TO BECOME<br />
THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Today we have not only been forgiven of our sins but also made alive together with Christ and are seated together with Him in the heavenlies. Furthermore, we are no longer separated from one another, because Christ has abolished the separating ordinances on the cross. We now are one Body in Him. As the wonderful life-giving Spirit, He has entered into our spirit. Now we can live and walk in this spirit and grow in the divine life. The more this life grows, the more we are built together to become a dwelling place of God in spirit (v. 22), expressing our corporate condition.</p>
<p>Two spirits are spoken of in Ephesians 2. Verse 18 says, &ldquo;We both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.&rdquo; In this verse <em>Spirit</em> refers to the Holy Spirit. Verse 22 says that we are being built together &ldquo;into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; In this verse <em>spirit</em> refers to the regenerated human spirit, which is indwelt by the Holy Spirit. Today we do not care for religion, doctrines, teachings, ordinances, methods, and rituals but only for the two spirits. Christ died and resurrected, and He is now the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit so that we can be one Body. We need to turn to our spirit, live in our spirit, and walk and live together with Him; thus, we will grow and be built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit. This is the living out of Christ by the one new man.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ECONOMY OF THE GRACE OF GOD<br />
AND THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:1-11</h1>
<p>Ephesians 2:10 says that we are God&rsquo;s masterpiece, God&rsquo;s poem, to express His desire and wisdom. When we were far off from God and even far off from one another, God did a wonderful thing in a hidden place in the universe. This hidden place is our spirit. Through the gospel God entered into our spirit so that we not only were reconciled to Him but also gained a position of peace with one another and a condition of love for one another. Regrettably, today&rsquo;s religion involves only outward regulations and rituals; it neglects the reality that has transpired in our hidden human spirit, which involves the Holy Spirit entering into our redeemed and regenerated human spirit so that the two are mingled together to become one spirit. Today God wants to recover the experience of this reality.</p>
<p>Verses 4 and 5 say, &ldquo;God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ.&rdquo; Being made alive is like the sprouting forth of a seed, but even a plant that has sprouted needs to grow. Likewise, even though we have been made alive to become one new man with God&rsquo;s life (v. 15), this life must grow. The more this life grows, the more we are joined together with one another. Death separates man, yet life joins man. All the dry bones in the valley in Ezekiel 37 were scattered, but once God breathed on these bones and His breath entered into them, they were joined together and became alive to be an exceedingly great army (vv. 1-10). We were dead and scattered, but Christ entered into us to enliven us and to grow in us so that as the building of God we may be fitted together and grow into a holy temple in the Lord, being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit (Eph. 2:21-22). This is the poem that God is writing in the universe; this is God&rsquo;s masterpiece. In eternity God&rsquo;s poem will express His infinite wisdom and divine design.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD HAVING AN ECONOMY OF GRACE IN THE UNIVERSE</h2>
<p>Verses 1 and 2 of chapter 3 say, &ldquo;For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you, the Gentiles&mdash;if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you.&rdquo; The phrase <em>for this cause</em> indicates that the revelation Paul received in chapter 2 made him a prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of the Gentiles so that the stewardship of the grace of God would have an outlet through him. The Greek word for <em>stewardship</em> is the same word for <em>economy</em> in 1:10; hence, the stewardship of the grace of God is linked to the economy of the grace of God. In the universe God has an economy of grace; in other words, grace is the capital of God&rsquo;s economy. God&rsquo;s economy is God working Himself as grace into redeemed and regenerated believers to bring them into the reality of the Body of Christ. When the Body is manifested, God&rsquo;s masterpiece, God&rsquo;s poem, will be complete. We all are the material for His poem, and in His economy He is working in us to complete His masterpiece.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HIDDEN MYSTERY BEING REVEALED</h2>
<p>This was a mystery hidden from the generations before the apostles (3:5). Not even Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, or the prophets knew this mystery. This mystery was revealed to the apostles, especially to the apostle Paul, only in the New Testament age. Prior to the New Testament age this mystery was hidden in God, who created all things. Paul was clear that God created the heavens, the earth, all things, and even man so that Christ could gain His Body. God called Jews as well as Gentiles and put Himself into them as His called ones so that they would be made alive and become one Body in their enlivened human spirit to be built as the Body of Christ to express Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH<br />
THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The mystery hidden throughout the ages was foreordained by God in His eternal plan to be accomplished through the unsearchable riches of Christ. In other words, all that God is and has, everything in the Godhead and divinity, are in Christ. Paul said that he preached the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel (v. 8); he did not preach the doctrine of going to heaven rather than to hell. He preached the unsearchable riches of Christ, which are the riches of God in Christ as everything to us. God in Christ has become our light, love, righteousness, holiness, power, wisdom, and so forth; all these riches are inexhaustible. All human virtues, such as endurance, humility, and respect for family, are nothing but shadows; the reality is Christ. Only when a person has Christ does his endurance, humility, and respect for family become real.</p>
<p>I have been a Christian for nearly fifty years, and I have experienced prosperity and poverty, highs and lows, and honor and dishonor. I know for certain that if a man does not have Christ, he has only vanity. Only the rich Christ is the excellent treasure; only He is reality. We should experience Christ and His riches in our daily living so that in the meetings we can testify that Christ has become our life, endurance, guidance, and support rather than testifying about blessings, peace, or healings. The release of such testimonies will present the riches of Christ to others.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:10 speaks of God&rsquo;s masterpiece, and 3:9 speaks of God&rsquo;s economy. God&rsquo;s economy accomplishes God&rsquo;s masterpiece, using the riches of Christ as the capital. The more Christ&rsquo;s riches enter into us and constitute us, the more we become God&rsquo;s masterpiece. Today God&rsquo;s main desire is that we be focused on experiencing Christ practically in our living, not on outward things, including such things as saving souls, being zealous, speaking in tongues, or praying with fasting. Christ is not a doctrine or a thing; He is the Spirit to be our reality. As the Spirit, He is in our spirit to be one spirit with us (1 Cor. 6:17). We have to take Him as our life, power, and wisdom in our spirit. We need to fellowship with Him, contact Him, and be joined to Him in our spirit. Our walk should be governed not by outward regulations and restrictions but by living out the riches of Christ. When we experience Christ and enjoy His riches, we are in God&rsquo;s economy. God is operating in us so that we will become His masterpiece through our experience of the riches of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DISPLAYING THE MULTIFARIOUS WISDOM OF GOD</h2>
<p>We encourage the brothers and sisters to release their spirit in the meetings. However, it is not adequate to release our spirit if we have no content. The riches of Christ must be the content released from our spirit. We must exercise our spirit and experience the riches of Christ in our living; then in the meetings we can release our spirit to testify of the riches of Christ. In this way God will carry out His economy in us to make us His masterpiece so that the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies, including Satan and his angels, will see a display of God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom (Eph. 3:10).</p>
<p>The world-famous area in Los Angeles known as Hollywood is filled with lies devised by Satan. However, God has come, because the church has been established there. Through God&rsquo;s operation hippies, who were dead in their sins, have been enlivened by the life of God; they have been sanctified, and as members of the Body of Christ, they are being built together so that the Body of Christ can be manifested. The Lord is working His riches into them to such an extent that they are becoming a masterpiece, a poem written by the Lord. The more recklessly Satan acts, the more brilliantly God writes His poem. Regardless of Satan&rsquo;s distractions, God has a way. Even though Hollywood influences the whole world, the church in Los Angeles is influencing the whole world. Satan&rsquo;s lawless activities there only manifest God&rsquo;s economy and multifarious wisdom all the more.</p>
<p>The church that God is producing with the riches of Christ is not today&rsquo;s so-called Christianity; it is the crystallization of God&rsquo;s work in our hidden part, our spirit. We simply need to exercise our spirit and release our spirit. Then when we are at home, our home will be bright and joyous, and when we are in the meetings, we will manifest the heavenly New Jerusalem. This is the way that the Lord is taking in His recovery today. The manifestation of the church is not an accident; it is according to the eternal plan that God purposed in Christ Jesus. It is so glorious that we can participate in God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING STRENGTHENED INTO THE INNER MAN<br />
AND CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME<br />
IN OUR HEARTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:14-21</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE RICHES OF CHRIST BEING BOUNDLESS</h2>
<p>The first half of Ephesians 3 speaks of God having an economy of grace, which is to work the boundless Christ into us. The boundlessness of Christ is spoken of in verses 8, 18, and 19. In verse 8 Paul speaks of being given grace to announce &ldquo;the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.&rdquo; This shows that the riches of Christ are immeasurable. In verse 18 Paul prays that the saints would apprehend &ldquo;what the breadth and length and height and depth are.&rdquo; The breadth and length and height and depth denote the boundless dimensions of Christ. In verse 19 Paul speaks of the &ldquo;knowledge-surpassing love of Christ.&rdquo; The love of Christ is Christ Himself. Christ is immeasurable, and so is His love; hence, His love is knowledge-surpassing. These verses show that the riches of Christ are immeasurable.</p>
<p>God has an economy of grace to work the riches of Christ into us little by little. Today the churches in Taiwan have not entered fully into the experience of the riches of Christ. Although we can speak of the riches of Christ, we have not sufficiently entered into the reality of the flow of these riches. Although there is some release of the spirit among the young people, there is the need for more content in their calling and praying. This is related to a lack of the experience of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING STRENGTHENED<br />
INTO THE INNER MAN THROUGH PRAYER</h2>
<p>In the second half of chapter 3, Paul bowed his knees unto the Father (v. 14). Bowing one&rsquo;s knees to pray indicates that the subject of the prayer is great. Just as Paul prayed, we must pray before God concerning this matter today, asking for His mercy and grace so that we would daily experience the riches of Christ and increasingly touch and enjoy Him in His various rich aspects. For this we need to ask the Father to grant us, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man (v. 16).</p>
<p>What is the inner man? The inner man is our regenerated human spirit. Formerly, our spirit was merely an organ like our nose and ears, and our soul was our person. When we repented and believed into the Lord, He entered into our spirit and became our life. Now that we have the Lord&rsquo;s life, our spirit is no longer just an organ; it is a person. Our inner man is our regenerated human spirit indwelt by the Lord Jesus as life. As believers, we all have a &ldquo;dual personality&rdquo; with both an inner man and an outer man. Our soul, which lives according to our human life, constitutes our outer man; our spirit, which contains the Lord Jesus as life, constitutes our inner man.</p>
<p>The difficulty that we face in experiencing the riches of Christ is that our outer man is quite strong, whereas our inner man is weak. Our soul, including our mind, emotion, and will, is quite strong. Often we do not care for the things of the spirit or live in the spirit; instead, we act solely according to our thoughts, likes, and determinations. However, the Lord is not in our mind, emotion, or will but in our spirit. We need to forget about relying on our mind, emotion, and will, no longer caring for the things related to our outer man, and we need to be strengthened into our inner man so that our inner man would become strong.</p>
<p>A person who exercises his spirit can easily forget the faults of others and not be affected much by how others treat him. Such a one is not moved when others speak well of him, and he is not moved when others speak ill of him. The things of the soulish world do not touch him, because he lives in another realm. He is not in the mind, emotion, or will but in the spirit. When others gossip, he does not participate, but when it is time to pray and share, he participates actively. This is the issue of Paul&rsquo;s prayer for our being strengthened into the inner man. The whole church should pray that the Father would grant us to learn to live in our spirit and not in our outer man.</p>
<p>We are strengthened into the inner man when we use our spirit and exercise our spirit. Without exercise, there is deterioration. For example, if we do not use our eyes, our vision will deteriorate. Our soul is so strong because we have used only the soul for most of our life. In order for us to be strengthened into the inner man, we need to exercise our spirit. We should not call on the Lord merely in the midst of troubling circumstances. In every human situation we must turn to our spirit to contact the Lord and touch the matter with our spirit rather than with our mind. When others criticize us, we should turn to our spirit; when others praise us, we should turn to our spirit. No matter what happens, we should turn to our spirit and exercise our spirit day by day. This exercise will strengthen our spirit.</p>
<p>Brother Nee once said that if a saved person does not allow God to break his disposition before he reaches the age of fifty, there will be no way for him to be useful in the church life. In the church we must accept the breaking and dealings related to our outer man, our soul. We need to reach a point that we no longer act according to our own thoughts and feelings or meddle in others&rsquo; affairs. Then we will be in spirit, and our spirit will be strong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS</h2>
<p>When our spirit is strong, we give the Lord Jesus room in our being. The Lord Jesus is not a doctrine or a term but a true and living person. Verse 17 speaks of Christ making His home in our hearts. In this verse the terms <em>make His home</em> and <em>hearts</em> are important. If we live by our soul and do not use our spirit, the Lord will be confined to our spirit, just as a guest entering into our living room would be confined to a corner of our home if we left him so that we could do other things on our own. The Lord Jesus is confined to the spirit of many people today because they are living according to their soul. Our spirit must be strengthened so that we can live in our spirit and Christ can make His home in our hearts. Our spirit is the central part of our being, and it is surrounded by our heart. First Peter 3:4 speaks of our spirit as the &ldquo;hidden man of the heart.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus is not only in our spirit; He wants to enter into our heart, into every part of our being. God&rsquo;s economy is to work the Lord Jesus into our whole being. Our mind, emotion, and will should not be for ourselves; every part of our being should be for Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the church today is the recovery of Christ as the Spirit entering into our spirit to be our everything and to spread from our spirit into our mind, emotion, and will so that our whole being is saturated, permeated, and occupied by Him. As a result of this process, He will make His home in our hearts, and this will produce the church life. The church is not merely a group of people who meet together; the church is Christ entering into our spirit and spreading from our spirit into every part of our being. When we live by Him and let Him live in us, we are blended into one. In this oneness the church is manifested, and the church life becomes a reality.</p>
<p>We should never be content with learning outward things or believe that we are fine as long as we have some services and activities. We must live in the spirit and have rich experiences of Christ in spirit. Meanwhile, we must learn to use our spirit to contact and minister Christ. This is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ECONOMY OF GOD AND<br />
WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:16-21; 1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PAUL PRAYING THAT WE MAY HAVE<br />
A DEEP EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In the second half of Ephesians 3 Paul prays that the believers would have a deep, spiritual experience. This experience is not something ordinary or superficial; it is not an experience of so-called blessings related to joy, peace, material profit, or even spiritual profit. Paul&rsquo;s prayer is for us to practically experience the riches of Christ in our regenerated spirit. This is the deepest part of our being, the place where the Lord Jesus indwells us as life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MANY THINGS FRUSTRATING<br />
AND REPLACING GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>Many Christians, however, are influenced by their cultural background and religious environment, including the rituals and methods of traditional Christianity. Consequently, they fall into superficial and specious experiences, and it is not easy to enter into the experience that is spoken of in the second half of Ephesians 3. Over the past four thousand years of human history, many cultural concepts have developed. Among the Chinese, these concepts include self-cultivation, self-discipline, self-restraint, and the development of the bright virtue. Although these ideas are noble, they do not reflect God&rsquo;s economy. God&rsquo;s economy is not about developing a bright virtue that expresses our innate knowledge of good and our innate ability to do good; God&rsquo;s economy involves God working Himself in Christ into us.</p>
<p>Religion with its teachings and beliefs can also be a distraction from God&rsquo;s economy. Religion talks about the existence of God, so man restricts himself according to his religious beliefs of God, particularly in regard to keeping regulations and commandments related to doing good and avoiding evil. This is religion, but it is not God&rsquo;s economy. God&rsquo;s economy does not involve us merely worshipping God or teaching others about God; it involves Christ being worked into us. Although traditional Christianity speaks to people about the true God and presents the gospel of the forgiveness of sins, this gospel is still superficial and short of God&rsquo;s economy. God&rsquo;s economy is not focused on redemption but on Christ being worked into us.</p>
<p>Even in the church we may still adhere to rituals and methods without truly entering into God&rsquo;s economy. For example, we need to practice the release of our spirit, but this does not mean merely being loud in a meeting. Being loud can simply be a new method that frustrates and replaces God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT<br />
IN THE ECONOMY OF GOD</h2>
<p>We must be cautious and not be distracted by human culture, religion, Christianity, or even our own methods so that we do not deviate from God&rsquo;s economy. God&rsquo;s economy is to work the Lord Himself into us; He is a real and living Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45 says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,&rdquo; and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; Praise the Lord, as the Spirit He can enter into our spirit and make His home in our hearts.</p>
<p>It is quite interesting that the Chinese words for <em>spirit</em> and <em>electricity</em> are composed with the same radical root. Some of the spirit&rsquo;s functions are similar to that of electricity. Electricity can generate light and heat, produce power, and be used in communication. Likewise, the Lord is the Spirit today, and He is in us to generate light and heat so that we may be empowered. Moreover, as the Spirit He enables us to have fellowship with Him. God&rsquo;s economy is to work the Lord, who is the Spirit, into us.</p>
<p>Our words, thoughts, and deeds should not be according to ourselves but according to the Spirit within us. When we make a telephone call, we need to pick up the handset, wait for the sound of a connection, and then dial a number before we talk on the telephone. Similarly, before we speak to others, we should contact the Spirit, wait for a connection, and then speak according to Him. If we are not connected to the Spirit, our speaking will be according to ourselves, not the Spirit. When we exercise our spirit in this way, the Spirit will gradually enter into our mind, emotion, and will. A person who walks according to the Spirit in his spirit has a will that is both strong yet not hard and that is pliable yet not soft, and when he is in the midst of a particular situation, his thoughts and considerations are according to the spirit. He speaks according to the spirit and reacts according to the spirit. This is what the Lord desires to see worked out in our experience today. God&rsquo;s economy is not about speaking in tongues or calling loudly. Neither is it a matter of merely studying the Scriptures to understand doctrines; God&rsquo;s economy is for us to turn to our spirit and to give the Spirit room in our being so that Christ can make His home in our hearts. We need to do all things in the spirit and according to the spirit. Even in trivial matters, such as reading the newspaper, going to department stores, and putting on shoes, we need to be according to the spirit. If we have such a living, our meetings will be rich, and the church will be spiritual.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS<br />
AND BEING EXPRESSED</h2>
<p>The Lord is the living Spirit who is living in us. If we give Him room in our being, He will occupy our mind, emotion, and will little by little and gradually make His home in our hearts. Even though the Lord may have been living in us for a long period of time, has He made His home in us? Or are we still making all the decisions? We can yield to Him in every matter because He is the living Spirit. If we cooperate with Him and walk according to the Spirit, our troubles will be His troubles, and His joy will be our joy. He will bear our burden and even bear us. Furthermore, all our outward actions and expressions will originate from the shining of the Spirit within. Just as a light bulb shines with the expression of light when electricity passes through it, we will shine forth Christ and express Him when we walk according to our spirit.</p>
<p>Then our move will be His expression because we will be one with Him and He will be one with us. Then we will be able to say, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). We also will be able to say, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21). Furthermore, we will live according to our spirit and even minister life to others so that their spirit is enlivened by Christ, the living Spirit.</p>
<p>When we experience Christ in this way, the sharing in the meetings will be rich, and we will be filled unto all the fullness of God (Eph. 3:19). The riches of Christ will fill us within so that we become the fullness of God, which is the expression of God. This is God&rsquo;s economy. Although this sounds difficult, God is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us (v. 20). When we experience the riches of Christ and express and shine forth Christ from within, God will be glorified and expressed in the church and in Christ Jesus.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ISSUE OF<br />
THE ECONOMY OF THE GRACE OF GOD&mdash;<br />
THE FULLNESS OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:16-21</h1>
<p>Ephesians 3 concerns the economy of the grace of God. Verse 9 says, &ldquo;To enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things.&rdquo; Although this mystery was unveiled two thousand years ago, it has become a veiled matter once again because of the desolation and degradation of Christianity. We need to ask the Lord to open our eyes and to shine His light so that we may see this unveiled mystery. If we truly see this, our whole being will be revolutionized.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:10 speaks of our being God&rsquo;s masterpiece, a poem written by God. However, God must have an economy to write this masterpiece. Verse 8 of chapter 3 shows that God carries out this economy by announcing the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel. As a result of receiving these riches, we are filled unto all the fullness of God (v. 19). God&rsquo;s economy is to work the riches of Christ into us so that we may become the fullness of God, which is the expression of God. For this we need to be strengthened into our inner man (v. 16), which is our regenerated human spirit that is indwelt by Christ. Being strengthened into the inner man gives Christ, who is in our spirit, an outlet to enter, occupy, and make His home in the various parts of our hearts (v. 17). When Christ makes His home in our hearts, we are fully one with Christ and filled unto all the fullness of God. Only then will God be fully expressed in the church in glory (v. 21).</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ROOTED AND GROUNDED IN LOVE</h2>
<p>The second half of verse 17 says, &ldquo;That you, being rooted and grounded in love.&rdquo; This love is the love of Christ becoming our love so that we may love Him and enjoy Him. When Christ makes His home in our hearts, we are rooted and grounded in love. Being rooted is for growth, and being grounded is for building. This was Paul&rsquo;s experience. When we experience Christ as our life and everything in reality, we can touch Him as our person and spontaneously experience His love.</p>
<p>Today every believer has some appreciation for the Lord Jesus&rsquo; love in dying on the cross for us. Christianity has many hymns describing this love. The hymns speak of sinners who were saved from condemnation and judgment because of the Lord&rsquo;s love for us, which led Him to die on the cross for us. This is certainly a sweet matter, involving great love; however, this love is also largely objective. The Lord&rsquo;s act of love happened two thousand years ago and thousands of miles away. The love spoken of in chapter 3 of Ephesians is also a sweet love, but it is very subjective because it is related to the Lord Jesus being in us and living out of us. This living love is a matter for today, and it is not far away from us; it is a matter that we can experience within our own heart. Hence, when we experience Christ, He makes His home in our hearts. Christ not only wants to be our life; He wants to be our person. We can fully enjoy the fresh love of Christ moment by moment.</p>
<p>We are not belittling or neglecting the Lord Jesus&rsquo; love in dying for us, but His love related to His living in us is more intimate and sweet. He is living in us to be our person moment by moment. If a sister does not know how to be a wife, she only needs to fellowship with the Lord, and He will be the wife in her. If a brother does not know how to be a husband, he only needs to fellowship with Lord, and He will be the husband in him. When we rise up early in the morning and do not know what to do, we only need to talk with Him, and we will be clear within. When we are worried about our troubles and unable to bear the heavy burdens, we only need to come to the Lord, and He will bear them for us. When we are angry, we should come forward to the Lord, and He will say, &ldquo;If there is a need for anger, let Me be the One who is angry.&rdquo; When we rejoice, we should come forward to the Lord, and He will say, &ldquo;Let us rejoice together.&rdquo; This is the way to enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ. This kind of intimate and sweet experience far surpasses even the loving companionship between a husband and a wife.</p>
<p>As Christ makes His home in our hearts, we become rooted and grounded in His love. Then we will sense that He is the embodiment of love, the aggregate of love, and even love itself. We will sense that every part of His being is constituted with love. As a result, the Christ whom we experience from morning to evening will fill us with a love that becomes our love so that we may love Him. Being rooted causes us to grow daily, and being grounded causes us to be built up daily.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPREHENDING THE BREADTH AND LENGTH AND HEIGHT<br />
AND DEPTH OF CHRIST WITH ALL THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>When we are rooted and grounded in His love, we also are full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth of the universe are (v. 18). The immeasurable breadth and length and height and depth of the universe are the dimensions of our loving Christ. We can never exhaust what He is in our experience of Him. The more we experience Him, the more we sense His infinite richness. He is unlimited; He is the breadth and length and height and depth.</p>
<p>Once we are rooted and grounded in His love, we cannot remain individualistic; we need all the saints to apprehend the riches of Christ. The more we experience Christ and let Christ make His home in our hearts, the more we sense a need for the members, the Body. We often speak of the Body life, but the Body life cannot come through compulsion or teaching. It comes when our spirit is strengthened by receiving the riches of Christ and when we allow Christ to make His home in our hearts. This, in turn, roots us and grounds us in His love. When this is our experience, we are spontaneously joined to the brothers and sisters. It is possible to be an individualistic member in Christianity, but it is not possible to be a proper brother or a sister in the church and remain individualistic. We must be with all the saints. This is God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE LOVE OF CHRIST<br />
TO BECOME THE FULLNESS OF GOD</h2>
<p>It is possible for us to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ because deep within us there is a surpassing faculty (v. 19). Although this love is knowledge-surpassing, we can know it when we experience Christ.</p>
<p>The ultimate issue of knowing the love of Christ is being filled unto all the fullness of God (v. 19). In order to experience the unsearchable riches of Christ, we must be strengthened into the inner man so that Christ can make His home in our hearts. Then we will be rooted and grounded in His love and full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ. This results in our being filled unto all the fullness of God. God&rsquo;s economy is to impart all that God is, such as love, light, righteousness, holiness, life, and wisdom, into us so that we would be filled unto all the fullness of God.</p>
<p>The economy of the grace of God begins with the unsearchable riches of Christ and with our inner man being strengthened so that Christ can make His home in our hearts with all His riches. In this economy we are rooted and grounded in love and become full of strength to apprehend what are the breadth and length and height and depth with all the saints. When we experience and touch these vast dimensions, we come to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God. This is the economy of the grace of God and its issue in Ephesians 3.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE GROWTH IN LIFE AND<br />
THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:3-6, 11-16</h1>
<p>The ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s economy, as revealed in Ephesians, is for us to be filled unto all the fullness of God, to attain to a complete mingling of God and man so that God may be our content and we may be His expression. This is not a goal that is at all individual. God&rsquo;s filling is not for an individual expression; He desires to gain a corporate expression, which is the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s economy is to gain the Body of Christ; consequently, Ephesians 4:3 speaks of &ldquo;being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit.&rdquo; The phrase <em>the oneness of the Spirit</em> means that the Spirit is the oneness. The Triune God today is the Spirit, and He is mingled with our human spirit as one. There is a Spirit in your spirit and my spirit, and this Spirit is mingled with your spirit and my spirit. This Spirit is our oneness. Whenever we give heed to our spirit, not to our mind or our feelings, we are one.</p>
<p>The manifestation and building up of the Body of Christ are what Satan fears the most. Satan is not too concerned with people being saved, loving the Lord, or even being spiritual. His greatest fear is the manifestation of the oneness of the Spirit. This oneness is the Body, the building, and the church. Satan is put to shame when we are in oneness. Verse 3 speaks of the oneness of the Spirit, and verses 11 through 16 point out the secret of this oneness, while exposing the craftiness of Satan at the same time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PERFECTING THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>Verses 11 and 12 say, &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; Verses 13 and 14 then speak of arriving at a full-grown man and of no longer being little children. According to the context of these verses, the perfecting in verse 12 causes people to grow. A child may have ears, eyes, a mouth, a nose, and four limbs yet be only two feet tall. How can he be perfected? In order to be perfected, he does not need another hand or another eye, because he already has two hands and two eyes. His real need is to grow, and in order to grow, he needs to eat food in abundance. The more he eats, the more he will grow. In 1 Corinthians 3:2 Paul says, &ldquo;I gave you milk to drink.&rdquo; In the church life today we need more feeding than teaching. The church needs those who can perfect by feeding.</p>
<p>As the saints are perfected, they spontaneously function. A newborn babe cannot function, even though he has all four sensory organs and four limbs. Therefore, if the saints are not functioning in the church, this shows that there is a need for growth and that there is a lack of feeding. When the saints are perfected through feeding in order to grow, they are able to function, and this function results in the building up of the Body of Christ. The Body is not built up directly by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers but indirectly by the perfected saints. The Lord Jesus does not build up the church directly, and neither do the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. The church is built up by the functioning saints who have been perfected by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</p>
<p>Regrettably, this matter is completely reversed in Christianity today. Those who attend &ldquo;church services&rdquo; are &ldquo;unemployed&rdquo; and do not function at all. All the Bible study, preaching, and prayer are undertaken by a pastor. This is a degraded situation; it is the result of Satan&rsquo;s craftiness to annul the function of the saints. I am afraid that even among us some are still under the influence of this kind of pastoral system because they feel that they cannot do anything and need the help of a full-time worker. May the Lord deal with these concepts so that each of us would function. Functioning occurs gradually, just as growth occurs gradually. Almost as soon as a child is born, he can scream and cry, but when he is one or two years old, he can speak a few simple phrases. Similarly, we should be able to speak a few things after being saved, but after growing, we should be able to speak more or give a testimony. It is abnormal to not be able to speak something after being saved for fifteen or twenty years.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ARRIVING AT THE ONENESS OF THE FAITH</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:13 tells us that we need to grow until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. We need not only to have the oneness of the Spirit but also to arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. As we grow, gradually we will arrive at a oneness in which there is no dispute over doctrines but only the oneness of the faith.</p>
<p><em>The faith</em> in verse 13 refers to the things in which we believe, such as the Lord Jesus being God, His becoming flesh, and His being crucified, resurrected, and becoming the life-giving Spirit. The faith concerns the person and work of the Lord Jesus. In contrast to the faith, doctrines are related to teachings concerning lesser matters, such as whether or not sisters should wear head coverings and how a believer should be baptized. In regard to these matters, some believers have one view, and other believers have a different view. Christianity is divided among many different denominations, such as the Baptist Church and the Presbyterian Church, because of a strong emphasis on a particular doctrine. When a doctrine is elevated to the level of the faith, there is division. The faith produces oneness, but doctrines produce divisions.</p>
<p>We each received the one faith when we were saved. However, Christians often add doctrines to the faith that has been received. Most of these doctrines are received through teachings that the believers hear after being saved. When they receive these teachings and consider them equal to the faith, the result is a loss of the oneness. Although they truly believe in the Lord, the many additional teachings that they hold on to cause them to be divided from those who hold a different teaching. The believers who hold on to doctrines are like little children who hold on to their toys and fight with other children over who has the better toys. Today many childish Christians come together only to discuss and quarrel over doctrines. Just as a child drops his toys as he grows older, we must grow in order to be delivered from doctrinal disputes. We need to grow until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING CARRIED ABOUT BY WINDS OF TEACHING<br />
BUT HOLDING TO TRUTH IN LOVE</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:14 says, &ldquo;That we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.&rdquo; This verse shows that those who hold on to doctrines are like little children who are tossed by waves and carried about by winds of teaching. If someone gives a good message on foot-washing, even a message that is according to the Bible, we need to be cautious in order to not be swept away by this teaching. Those who are carried about by winds of teaching are carried away from the Lord and from the Body of Christ as well. Being carried away is manifested with division. Any concern related to the correctness of a doctrine should not outweigh the consideration over whether or not an emphasis on such a doctrine will carry us away from the Body and frustrate the building up of the Body. Whatever carries the believers away from the Body is a wind of teaching involving craftiness, which carries people about and causes them to fall into a system of error.</p>
<p>To avoid being carried away, we must hold to truth in love (v. 15). Truth is Christ. We need to say, &ldquo;Lord, I love You; I do not love doctrines. You are my truth; I do not care for doctrines.&rdquo; Then we need to grow up into Christ, who is the Head, in all things (v. 15). This again refers to the matter of growth, not to the matter of doctrines. We need to grow up into Christ in all things.</p>
<p>Even what we have spoken today should not be treated as a doctrine; we must bring this before the Lord for mutual fellowship. We need a renewed consecration to live practically in the church life as a growing member with manifested functions. Through the operation in the measure of each one part, the Body will grow and be built up (v. 16).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN,<br />
PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN, AND<br />
BEING FILLED IN SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:22-24; 5:18</h1>
<p>Ephesians 1, which presents a purpose-defining, opening word to the Epistle, reveals that the church is the Body of Christ and that this Body is the fullness and expression of Christ, the One who fills all in all (vv. 22-23).</p>
<p>Chapter 2 speaks of God making us alive together with Christ, even when we were dead in offenses and sins, so that we would be His masterpiece. In order to produce this masterpiece, all the factors of human division, the ordinances related to the living of different people, were abolished on the cross (v. 15). Furthermore, both the Jews and the Gentiles were created in Christ into one new man in order to be built up as a dwelling place of God in spirit (v. 22).</p>
<p>Chapter 3 shows the economy of the grace of God. There are eight crucial points in this chapter: first, the unsearchable riches of Christ (v. 8); second, being strengthened into the inner man (v. 16); third, Christ making His home in our hearts; fourth, being rooted and grounded in love (v. 17); fifth, being full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are (v. 18); sixth, knowing the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ; seventh, being filled unto all the fullness of God (v. 19); and eighth, the ultimate issue of God being glorified in the church and in Christ Jesus (v. 21).</p>
<p>Chapter 4 speaks of our need to keep the oneness of the Spirit. The Spirit in our spirit is the oneness. Even though there are three hundred separate light bulbs in this room, they are one in the electricity when the electrical current passes through them. The electricity is the oneness of the light bulbs, and it connects them together. Similarly, even though we are many members, we are one Body because we are mutually connected in the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:12). Hence, in order to keep the oneness of the Spirit, our focus must be on the Spirit, not on doctrines, ordinances, or rituals.</p>
<p>In order to keep the oneness, our inner man must be strengthened so that we can grow in life (Eph. 3:16). Our old man, our former manner of living, has been terminated, and now our inner man, the new man that was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality, needs to grow (4:24). In our experience, however, our former manner of living is not easily terminated. After speaking with another person for about half an hour, different opinions will come out, and if we continue to speak to one another, we will soon be in open disagreement because we each have our own preferences. In the past we were told about the cross, but most often we would simply grit our teeth because we did not know how to take up the cross. Then we heard that we should reckon ourselves dead, but the more we reckoned ourselves dead, the more we were alive to our opinions and preferences. Actually, the only way for us to keep the oneness of the Spirit is for our inner man to grow by our eating and drinking of Christ. This is what the Lord is recovering among us today. The Lord Jesus is the best nourishment, and eating Him is the only way to grow in life.</p>
<p>Hence, chapter 4 tells us that the saints are perfected by receiving the rich supply that causes them to grow. We all need to grow. As we grow, our outer man is terminated in our experience, and everything that divides us is swallowed up. Outwardly, it seems as if Christians are divided over different opinions, but actually, they are divided because of the lack of growth in life. Keeping the oneness is not a matter of everyone agreeing or having the same opinion about particular doctrines. There can never be agreement over doctrines, and our opinions will never be reconciled, because both are related to the old man. The only way to keep the oneness is to become full grown. When there is growth, the many members spontaneously function and are joined and knit together, producing not only coordination but also building. This is how the Body builds itself up in love.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN<br />
AND PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>As we grow, we put off the old man (v. 22). Our bodies grow because of a metabolic process. I have heard that the blood in a human body is replaced every one hundred twenty days through the process of metabolism. Promoting a healthy metabolic rate is the reason doctors want people to exercise and to eat healthy food. The old things in our being will be eliminated not by gritting our teeth but by eating Christ daily. The content of our meetings should involve a spiritual exercise that promotes healthy &ldquo;metabolic growth.&rdquo; In this way, new things can grow, and the old things in our being will be replaced with the newness that comes from growth in life. As the element of Christ increases, the element of our old man gradually decreases. The more we grow, the more the old man is put off; the more we grow, the more the new man is put on. Eventually, our whole being will be renewed.</p>
<p>We put off the old man by putting off our former manner of life (v. 22). The former manner of life, referring to the old man whom we live out, is a community life. Man groups together according to his nature, and he forms communities and gathers together with others. Even if a man has a wonderful experience on a mountaintop by himself, it would be difficult for him to remain on the mountain for a whole year. People need other people in order to express themselves. For example, it is difficult to express anger when there is no one who can be the object of our anger. Consequently, our former manner of life is based on our former community life among men.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of our experience, the putting off of the old man is like putting off our old social life. Everyone has a social life that is according to the preferences of his manner of life. Those who are elderly like to sit and talk with elderly companions, and those who are young like to be active and seek out entertainment. These are expressions of our former manner of life. But once we are saved, God wants us to put off our former manner of life. This is necessary in order for His life to grow.</p>
<p>As we put off the old man, we need to put on the new man (v. 24), which is the church life. The church life is the most appropriate community life. When our grouping together is appropriate, it is beneficial to society, the family, and the individual. If, however, our grouping together is inappropriate, we can be &ldquo;infected with germs&rdquo; and led astray. Superficially, the church life is a social life, but it has the strongest element of &ldquo;germ-killing salt.&rdquo; When we have fellowship in the church, all the germs from our former manner of life are eliminated through the rich supply of Christ.</p>
<p>People need entertainment and enjoyment. Good entertainment is of benefit to man, but bad entertainment fosters evil. The entertainment industry is very developed today, and unbelievers flock to places of entertainment. However, only Christians have a proper place for entertainment and enjoyment&mdash;the church life. Our meetings are not a waste of time but a meaningful use of time. Our preaching of the gospel delivers people from an abnormal social life and into the normal church life. The only proper community is the church. The older saints who love the Lord and love the church need to bring their children into the church, and the young brothers and sisters, who are busy with their studies, should not forsake the church life. Every meeting is a source of great gain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING DRUNK WITH WINE<br />
BUT BEING FILLED IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:18 says, &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine...but be filled in spirit.&rdquo; Wine represents worldly pleasures. We should not be drunk or enthralled with fashionable clothing, high-rise buildings, money, parties, and amusement. It is sufficient for us to have only what we need for our clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Too much material enjoyment quickly brings in dissoluteness. To be drunk with wine is to be filled in the body, which causes us to become dissolute. Instead of wine for our body, we need to be filled with Christ in our spirit unto the fullness of God.</p>
<p>At the end of Ephesians, the focus is still on the spirit. Salvation and growth are a matter of the spirit: from our spirit Christ makes His home in our hearts, we become the dwelling place of God in spirit, and the ultimate issue is to be filled in spirit. This is salvation, life, growth, and maturity, and this is the church life. If we all walk in this way, we will be blessed personally, and the church will be blessed. Even our society and country will be blessed.</p></body></html>
