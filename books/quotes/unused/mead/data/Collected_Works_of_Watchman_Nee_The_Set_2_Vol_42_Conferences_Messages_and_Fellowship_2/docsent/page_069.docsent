   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some may ask, "Christ was crucified two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can I be crucified with Him?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, we must realize that God never asks us to consider ourselves crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are three hundred eighteen chapters of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not a single verse in all of these chapters says that we have to view our crucifixion with Christ through the eyes of our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even the washing of our sins by the blood has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have not done anything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is the Lord who shed the blood and washed away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A man once said, "We should carry our sins to the blood and wash them clean in the blood."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But thank the Lord, we do not have to bring our sins to be washed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God washed away our sins two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once a man selected a hymn in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first line said, "I laid my sins upon Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the missionaries in that meeting wanted to sing that song, but I said I would not sing it, because I could not lay my sins upon Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then an elderly missionary said, "Jehovah is the One who laid our sins upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot lay our sins upon Him ourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, the hymn was not sung that evening.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I hope that it will never be sung again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to see that our sins are washed away by the precious blood of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have absolutely no part in this washing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suppose one of our friends prays, "Lord, please shed Your blood for me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Please wash away my sins."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God could not answer such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such a prayer would not save him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot pray a faithless prayer, and we cannot ask God to do something that He has already done.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Similarly, if we say, "God, please crucify me," God could not answer such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God does not crucify us in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to realize that we are crucified with the Lord in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is the second man; we live in Christ, we are saved in Christ, we are forgiven in Christ, and we are crucified together in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Adam was the first man, and Christ is the second man 1 Cor 15:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In heaven there is only one man, and in hell there is also only one man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In heaven there is only Christ, and in hell there is only Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everyone who is in Christ is in heaven, and everyone who is in Adam is in hell.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The whole world equals only two men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Adam was the first man, and Christ is the second man and the last man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We were all in Adam, but we have been transferred into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I was in Kaifeng, I spoke to some government officials.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One of them did not understand the meaning of being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I explained to him in the way of an illustration: "Most people believe that the Chinese race comes from Hwang-ti.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Hwang-ti fought with his enemy Tzi-you, suppose that Tzi-you had not been killed, but that Hwang-ti had been shot to death by an arrow from Tzi-you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Where would you be today?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He said, "I would not exist."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I said, "That is right.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the same way, you have died in Adam, and God has put you into Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I was in Chuenchow, a few brothers asked, "How can a man be crucified in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is Christ and we are we.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order for us to be crucified, there must be two crosses, His and ours."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I said, "Suppose a pregnant woman sits down on a bus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>She only needs to buy one ticket.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although there is a child within her womb, the child is included in the woman, and when the woman buys the ticket, the child buys it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the same way, when we are in Christ, whatever is done to Christ is done to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is no need for us to be crucified."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Someone once asked why he felt that there were times when he was in Christ and times when he was out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I told him the story of a ten-year-old child whom I once met.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The child's mother had been in Amoy over ten years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I asked the child, "Have you been to Amoy?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The child answered, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I asked again, "Really?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then he changed his tone and said, "Yes, I have visited Amoy before.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I did it in my mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I have not been there by myself, but within my mother, I have already visited that place."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Through this example, he became clear.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>DYING TO SIN IN CHRIST JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Romans 6:11 says that in Christ we are dead to sin, but living to God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This verse does not say that in ourselves we are dead to sin and living to God; we are such when we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we look back at ourselves, we will find that our old man has not died.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to say to the Lord: "I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In You I am dead."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Colossians 2:11 says, "In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This verse refers to the circumcision of Christ, which we experience in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But how can we be circumcised in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have to realize that the forgiveness of sins comes by faith, not by feeling or sight.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Similarly, our circumcision in Christ and our death in Christ are based on faith.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, Colossians 2:12 says, "Through the faith of the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are crucified with Him through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hence, we have to go to the Lord and say, "Lord, You have said that we are dead in You.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I believe that whatever Your Word says will be accomplished."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>BY FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>From the time I began to work for the Lord until 1927, I preached on the doctrine of co-crucifixion over a period of five years.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Yet I really did not know how a person is crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>One day when I was in Shanghai, the Lord enlightened me and showed me that I am in Him, and that when He died, I also died.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I saw that my death is as real as His death, because I was in Him when He died.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I saw then that I was truly crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I was upstairs at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I ran down in joy and shouted in exhilaration, "Lord, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I have been crucified with You."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I saw it, I believed it, and I received it.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>A full salvation is not one that merely washes away our sins while leaving our old man behind.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Thank God, in His full salvation, our sins are forgiven and our old man is crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Bible speaks of one kind of faith only the faith that believes that things have already been done.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>All the things that I have spoken of tonight will not do us any good if we do not have a living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Mark 11:24 says that when we believe that we have received a thing, we will have it.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Believing that a thing will happen, must happen, or hopefully will happen does not constitute genuine faith.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In our spiritual experience, there are two kinds of "having."</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>One is the "having" in faith, and the other is the "having" in experience.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>There must first be a "having" in faith before there can be a "having" in experience.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Most people seek for healing in three ways: 1 for small illnesses, they consult themselves; 2 for more serious illnesses, they consult the doctors; and 3 for very serious illnesses, they consult the preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Those who consult preachers for healing in this way have nothing to do with faith at all.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Such people hope that God will heal them, instead of believing that God has healed them.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>You only need to listen to one or two words from a person's mouth, and you can predict whether he will get better or worse.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>No prayers uttered in the way of a hope will receive any healing.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Only prayers that issue from faith will produce experience.</S>
