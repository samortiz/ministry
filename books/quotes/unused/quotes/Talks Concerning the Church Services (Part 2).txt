From the beginning of the Lord's recovery in Los Angeles until now, the church service has never been adequately built up among us
To say that the church service refers to ministering Christ for the building up of the Body is very good, but it is too spiritual
A number of saints consider the church service to be chair-arranging, cleaning the hall, ushering, and preparing the bread and the wine
Although we may say that the church service is to take care of the needy saints and care for the needs of the church, this is too general
The truth, the matter of life, and the gospel are three anchors which are basic for the building up of the church
If the church is not built up in the truth and in life, and is not preaching the gospel to gain people, there is no future
The church is not here merely for ushering, preparing the bread and the wine, cleaning, vacuuming, or chair-arranging
The student work itself has three levels including gospel preaching, feeding the new ones, and perfecting the growing ones
Even in our neighborhood there must be a children's meeting that should not be considered as the children's meeting of the church
Maybe on another afternoon two more sisters may help to take care of another children's meeting of fifteen to twenty children
One sister will not need to take care of all the meetings directly because other sisters will follow her example and have their own meetings
The truth has not been built up among us, especially the seeking after the truth, the study of the truth, and the learning of the truth
The high priest and the other priests were burdened and charged to carry out a certain part of their unique service
In Numbers 28 and 29 the children of Israel were charged by God to offer daily the continual burnt offerings morning and evening
To distribute the bread and the wine at the Lord's table is really good, but that kind of service is too minor
From this point of view we all have to admit that in our church life there is very little that could be considered as the priesthood
During the Lord's table meeting, some brothers always come forward to bless the bread and the cup and distribute them
Only the priesthood that offers real sacrifices to God is counted by God as a priestly service rendered to Him
Neither can vacuuming the carpet, ushering, or cleaning the windows be considered as a part of the priestly service
In the Old Testament, all of the small responsibilities were carried out by the Levitical service, not the priests
During the Old Testament time, there was surely the need of some service to clean the altar, prepare the wood, and so forth
If within one and a half months each one of us could gain one who is properly baptized and taken care of, that would be wonderful
If a church has about two hundred meeting together and each one gains three or four a year, this is a threefold increase
Years ago while we were there at Elden Hall in Los Angeles, we began to stress one thing-not to remain in the old religion
Although twenty-five years ago we overcame that, gradually, after a number of years we slipped back into that old religion
If all of us in the church life would use our heavenly gifts, the church would be fully revived and quite living
As New Testament priests of the gospel we can now bring this sinner who is a part of Christ to the altar and offer him to God as a sacrifice
We can bring them to the small group meetings and the church meetings to instruct them and lead them to do the same thing we do
We must all realize that a proper Christian life is a life of handling the gospel to produce the members of Christ
Those who do not have any physical children have a great deal of time to produce and care for spiritual children
We should not spend all of our time and self with our own children, but share our time, heart, energy, and ability on spiritual children
They will be raised up to speak for the Lord, that is, to prophesy for the direct building up of the Body of Christ
Some brothers can be in the meeting to give further training and remind those present how to carry out their New Testament priesthood
An effective way for this to be carried out is for the local saints to be formed into teams of three for going out
In order for the gospel teams to carry out a successful work, they must go out in a regular and consistent way
Occasionally within one school semester students may need to ask for a leave of absence or remain home due to sickness
Of course, if everyone in a church of two hundred fifty to three hundred were serving, that would be wonderful
Those who followed Gideon to fight against the Philistines defeated them and rescued the entire nation of Israel
We may even become eloquent speakers of the new way so that the saints know everything, but nearly no one is 'playing ball'
If at the present time we have no new ones under our care, we must go to visit homes to bring sinners to believe and be baptized
We should make a list of all of these friends and relatives and classify them according to what kind of persons they are
The friends and relatives that we bring to the Lord and baptize will bring us to their own relatives and classmates for us to visit
No school teacher could keep a job if he or she were unaware of the number of students in the class or ignorant of which lessons to teach
We should then do our best to bring them out of their home so that we may group them together with other Christians
Some of those who play the piano excel as pianists because they were under a strict tutor for at least ten years
As long as we are not overage, we should go out regularly and carry out these four steps exactly as the training instructs
Every time the teams come together for fellowship, some brothers will give some instructions and training prior to going out
Rather, we testify that the enjoyment of Christ issues in fruit bearing, and fruit bearing comes out of the enjoyment of Christ
In the Old Testament, the Lord condemns physical barrenness , whereas in the New Testament, He condemns spiritual barrenness
The increase in the church in Los Angeles was not an increase of local people, but it came from different cities far away
The older and more experienced co-workers among us were quite useful in the first period of the Lord's recovery
According to his disposition, one of the opposing ones prefers to give messages in the larger meetings and rarely preaches the gospel
Not only the apostles, the prophets, and the shepherd-teachers are mentioned here, but the evangelists are mentioned as well
The evangelists were given by the Head not only for preaching the gospel directly by themselves but also for perfecting the saints
Another brother may speak up and tell him that he will approach his boss to see if his company is hiring anyone at this time
Whenever the saints gather together for a group meeting, the first thing that they should take care of is fellowship
Others in the meeting who may have been baptized only two weeks earlier may have learned some truth by that time
In a larger meeting of, for example, two hundred, we can only do things in a general way and give a general word of fellowship
The fellowship, the intercession, the mutual care, the shepherding, and the teaching will all be realized in the group meeting
In a church of two hundred saints, there may be twenty groups of ten or twelve who can even do a more thorough work than the elders
In particular, the older sisters among us should pray in a definite way to become involved in their own group meeting
Not only should we see new ones coming in regularly among us, but we should also see new group meetings year after year
Our church service, then, must consist of the gospel, the truth, life, the children's work, and the student work
We must all pick up a definite burden to be the New Testament priests of the gospel to take the Lord's new way
If we do mean business with the Lord to take the God-ordained new way, we should practice it regularly and consistently
Every week the sisters should keep their vow before the Lord to separate at least two or three hours for the purpose of praying
No student can successfully finish his schooling by studying one night until midnight and not studying at all for the next few days
Another day we decide to go out visiting, but a few minutes before we go, our wife does something to make us unhappy
With many of the dear saints, their good reports and testimonies are like pieces of wood piled up, but where is the furniture?
Following this we must cherish them and nourish them by going back to hold regular meetings with them in their homes
Although at the beginning they may not understand that much, we should let them taste a little bit of what the church life is
By taking care of them in this way all year, two saints will be produced by our work and brought into the church life each year
We will train them to do the same thing as we do, that is, to go out to visit people with the gospel to have home meetings
The elders in the church must especially exercise themselves that the Lord may lead them to pick up a particular part in the church service
The elders must learn how to bring that group particularly into the new way and on the right track by the proper steps
Maybe one-third of the saints in the church actively participate in the Lord's new move, leaving two-thirds who are still not involved
We may be burdened to contact a certain saint, but we have to discern if this is the best time for us to contact him
Gradually, after one month's time we may bring one saint into our group meeting who has not been meeting in one of our small groups before
If we would just be faithful to do this, in one year one person could bring eight to ten dormant saints into the group meetings
If eighty active saints would each bring in four, then in one year's time, three hundred twenty saints will be brought into these groups
If we all hold this kind of attitude with such a proper spirit, we will succeed in our labor and service to the Lord
