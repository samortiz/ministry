   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There is another very peculiar thing.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One never sees the questions of marriage and family come into play involving the matter of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But the Gospel of Matthew says that some will not marry for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some even made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens Matt 19:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, and in order to gain a place in the kingdom, they choose to remain virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One does not see a married person being denied eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If such were the case, Peter would have been the first one to have a problem, for he had a mother-in-law Matt 8:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We see that the question of eternal life is not related to family and marriage at all, but the question of the kingdom is very much related to the family and marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is why the Bible says that those who have wives should be like those who had none.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who use the world should be as those not using it, and those who buy should be as those who do not possess 1 Cor 7:29-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This has much to do with our position in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Finally, we have to mention another difference.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the kingdom, there are different levels of rank.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even if men are able to enter into the kingdom, there is a difference in the position that they hold there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some will receive ten cities, and others will receive five Luke 19:17-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some will merely receive reward, but others will receive great reward.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some will gain a rich entrance into the kingdom 2 Pet 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some will enter the kingdom without a rich entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, there is a difference in rank in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But there is never a question of rank regarding eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eternal life is the same for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One will not receive ten years more than another.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no difference in eternal life, but there is a difference in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If one would consider a little, he will realize that in the Bible, the kingdom and eternal life are two absolutely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The condition for salvation is faith in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Other than faith, there is no other condition, for all the conditions have been met by the Son of God already.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His Son's death has met all of God's requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But to enter the kingdom of the heavens is another matter; it requires works.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today a man is saved by God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But we cannot enter the kingdom of the heavens unless our righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and the Pharisees Matt 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The righteousness in one's living and conduct must surpass that of the scribes and the Pharisees before he can enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, one sees that the question of eternal life is completely based on the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the question of the kingdom is based on man's works.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am not saying that the kingdom is better than eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But God has a place for both.</S>
