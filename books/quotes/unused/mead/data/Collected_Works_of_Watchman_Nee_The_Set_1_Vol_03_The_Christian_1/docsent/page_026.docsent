   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE CREATION AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HOLY WORKS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is the key to all truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the Bible does not have Christ, it is a dead book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without Christ, we cannot understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we examine the places in the Bible that are difficult to explain or understand with a view to Christ and put Him into them, we will receive extraordinary light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In fact, the Bible has one Man as the center; without this Man we do not know what the Bible is talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This Man is the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He Himself said, "You search the Scriptures,...and it is these that testify concerning Me" John 5:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Again He said, "In the roll of the book it is written concerning Me" Heb 10:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible is God's written Word, and Christ is God's living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The written Word is to testify the living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The living Word is to fulfill the written Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even as we read about the Lord Jesus in Matthew, we can also read about Him in Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have seen in the preceding chapter that the physical creation merely expresses the spiritual creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we want to see the procedures taken by God in His physical creation and how these correspond to Christ's work in the spiritual creation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's creating work is actually done by the Lord Jesus since "all things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being" John 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Because in Him all things were created" Col 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We want to see now how Christ in the physical creation and Christ in the spiritual creation correspond.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May we be delivered from all conjectures and only manifest the Christ of whom God has clearly written in His book.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since God uses the physical creation to signify the spiritual re-creation, it is reasonable for us to find out how these two creations correspond in the hand of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE NEED OF REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" Gen 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All of God's works are perfect; all that has passed through the hand of the Almighty is without any blemish of sin, wrinkle of oldness, or any other sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All of God's works are like Himself, beautiful and perfectly good.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The things which newly emerged from the hand of the Ruler of the universe, the unique Potter, were sparklingly fresh and glorious!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God considered this original state of mankind to be "very good."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nevertheless, good things always come with many trials, and this state did not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After learning that God created a perfect heaven and earth, we immediately heard a tragic story: "The earth became without form, and void" v. 2, Heb . The record in this verse is different when compared with the preceding one! The earth which God created changed! Between these two verses, an extraordinary catastrophe must have occurred and the beautiful earth became without form and empty.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sin came in!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The angels fell!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This section of history was so grievous that God did not want to record it directly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Mankind also sinned and fell to a low state.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Darkness was upon the face of the deep" v. 2 . This is a portrait of the fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Darkness covers the face of the deep!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Spiritually, morally, mentally, and behaviorally, darkness blinds the whole of mankind; all are born of the flesh!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The authority of darkness, which is the power of Satan, comes upon sinners in the world, depriving them of freedom and subjecting all of them to his rule.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the deep, men invent, produce, and boast of their culture and wisdom; but Satan just causes darkness to cover the face of the deep so that there is no illumination of God!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet men still say to themselves that twentieth century civilization is unprecedented!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually, it is still under the authority of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Under these circumstances, there is no hope that men can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is not indebted to man, except that He entered into a covenant with men that He had to fulfill, obligating Himself to send His Son to save the world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If He executed His judgment and caused the entire world to perish eternally, this would still be very righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, He has immense grace, a grace that is boundless, exceedingly great, and beyond man's expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He prepared salvation to save the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Just as He recovered the physical creation in six days, God also redeemed sinful humans in Christ's redemption, typified in the six days, to accomplish His spiritual creation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We want to go one step further in our meditation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What a joy to speak more of Christ and think more of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May we silently praise and worship this wonderful Savior for His wonderful work of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I.The work of the first day signifies the birth of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the first day God created light, and the light shone in the darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The face of the deep of the world was originally covered with darkness, but light came!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This was the first time light and darkness met.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There was never such a state on this earth; this was the first time light came to the dark world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Clearly this typifies the birth of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When John spoke about the birth of the Lord Jesus and the incarnation of the Word, he said, "The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it," and "This was the true light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man" John 1:5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>John clearly likened the birth of the Lord Jesus to light shining in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When Zachariah spoke about the birth of the Lord Jesus, he also said, "Because of the merciful compassions of our God, in which the rising sun will visit us from on high" Luke 1:78 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even the Lord Jesus Himself also compared His birth to the light shining into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He said, "For God did...send the Son into the world...the light has come into the world" John 3:17, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These Scripture verses testify to us that God's work on the first day, calling light to shine into darkness, typifies the Lord Jesus becoming, at a later time, the true light to come into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Light came, yet what a pity that the world would not let Him shine upon them!</S>
