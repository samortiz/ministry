   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRISTIANS BEING A PECULIAR PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The brothers and sisters in Yi-Yang were thoroughly checked out by the Communists.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They investigated them even to the bone and marrow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Their searching was in a sense sharper than the two-edged sword, but they were so surprised by our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They forced others to share everything in common because they were afraid that no one would do it, but we practice this voluntarily.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They said that the biblical practice of having everything in common was wrong, and they told the brothers and sisters in Yi-Yang that no one was allowed to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They said that such a practice would make everyone lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We practice having everything in common because we love the brothers, but they thought this was wrong because it would encourage laziness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, even though we have everything in common, we are not lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This bewilders them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The world cannot do this, but we can.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is what it means to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The world does not understand that Christians are a peculiar people, but this does not mean that we are promoting Christian socialism.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We only do this as a practice.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christian conduct is not based on a set of Christian doctrines or creeds, but is according to the life we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christian behavior has nothing to do with doctrines and teachings; it is related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The father did not embrace his prodigal son according to a set of rules.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the prodigal son returned, the father spontaneously stepped forward to kiss him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A Christian acts according to the life within him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, it is impossible for him to take the way of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1925 a British brother in the shipping business received a telegram saying that an eight-thousand-ton ocean liner would arrive in ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Another brother was visiting in his house at the time and was about to receive a check for two hundred pounds from him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The check was designated for the work of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After the visitor left, a telegram arrived and informed the shipping brother that the ship had sunk, along with all the cargo on board.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He rang a bell and asked for men to recall the visiting brother.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He told him that the ship was lost and that he had to write a new check.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He took the old check and wrote another one for five thousand pounds, saying, "Hurry up and go.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Spend this on the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The visitor thought that this brother was out of his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Having lost his ship, he should have scaled down his giving.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He should have changed the two hundred pounds to fifty pounds, but instead he changed the number, adding more zeros to the check.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When he was asked to explain his action, he said, "The sinking of the ship is an urgent heavenly telegram from God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He does not want me to accumulate any wealth on earth!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since God does not want me to manage this money, I have to spend it on the Lord while it is still in my hand."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The visiting brother took the check with tears and said, "I have never seen anyone do this before."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>DISCERNING THE SIGN OF THE LORD'S COMING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>AND ANSWERING THE CALL OF CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am saying this to you not for the purpose of fund-raising.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am saying this to let all the brothers and sisters throughout the whole world know that the day of the Lord is approaching!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to spend whatever we have on the Lord, while the money is still useful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this passage, James does not tell us the result of the capitalist-worker dispute.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That is not his point.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He tells us that the Lord is coming!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let me shout again, "The Lord is coming soon!"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Perhaps we cannot see other signs, but we can surely see this sign.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to endure.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>While the sign is still here, we have to offer up the money we have in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I truly hope that when the Lord comes back the second time, none of us will miss Him again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is bad enough to miss Him once.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is bad enough to fail once.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must not miss Him the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must not fail the second time.</S>
