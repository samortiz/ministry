   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Once I met a patient, and I asked him how he was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He said that God would heal him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I said that God would not heal him because he did not have His word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There was another nearsighted brother who needed to get corrective glasses, but someone told him that he should believe God and not get the glasses.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He thought that his faith might be bigger than that of others, so he went to pray instead.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later he was asked to preach in an evangelistic meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He thought that his eyes would be healed after his preaching, and he asked me to pray for this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I told someone that God would not heal him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He asked me why, and I said because he did not have the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His faith was not faith, but feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What he had was not actually faith, but hope.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without God's Word, how can we believe?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ's work is real.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But without the Word of God, everyone in the world will still perish.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, if we have God's Word, the whole world will not be able to overthrow our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once the Lord said to His disciples, "Let us go over to the other side" Mark 4:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord slept in the stern of the boat.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suddenly there arose a great windstorm, the waves beat into the boat, and it began to fill up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The disciples woke Him and said to Him, "We are perishing" v. 38 . The Lord arose and rebuked the wind and sea.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The wind ceased and there was a great calm.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What did the Lord say to the disciples?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord said, "Why are you cowardly in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How is it that you do not have faith?" v. 40 . Since the Lord gave the order to pass over to the other side, He took the responsibility, regardless of the wind and waves along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the Lord has spoken and we still do not have faith, we are casting His word aside.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose I give you a ten dollar bill to make change.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How do you know that it is ten dollars?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You know because it says so on the bill.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whatever God has said is so.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God says it, and it is so.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the Lord orders you to pass over to the other side, all you have to do is go.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You can speak to the wind, "Blow as much as you will," and tell the waves, "Beat as much as you can."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when the Lord says to pass over to the other side, you will surely pass over to the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you think that the Lord's word only seems to be true and is not quite true, you will sink to the bottom of the sea with the wind and waves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only the Word of God is true.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even when the environment is against you, the Word of God remains true.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You may have difficulties with your family, school, business, or even your self.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you do not believe in God's Word, it is useless for you to pray, even if you pray for several hours.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you do not pray, you will not get anything; and if you pray without believing in God's Word, you still will not get anything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you cannot believe in God's Word, you need not pray, because the prayer will be a vain effort.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you want to obtain God's grace, it is very important to lay hold of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Take care of the believing, and God will take care of the working.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a matter is put before you, you have to pray that God will give you a word concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once you have His word, you can use it to confront any difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Word of God that you have acquired is the sword of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everything mentioned regarding the armor in Ephesians 6 is defensive; only the sword of the Holy Spirit is offensive.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As long as you have the Word of God, everything will be overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as you have His Word, every hardship will pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One of my friends once spent all the money she had.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>While reading the Bible, she spoke to God, "O God, please give me a word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I do not ask that You put a thousand dollars in front of me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I only ask You to give me a word."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God reminded her of a passage in Psalm 23.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The word she got was, "My cup runs over!"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that moment she was far from running over; she was completely empty.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nevertheless, she had the Word of God, and she wrote a hymn in English, a few lines of which read:</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>With Jehovah as my Shepherd,</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is always something over!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Though we have much hardship,</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is always something over!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>With God as my Treasurer,</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is always something over!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She wrote this hymn and sent it to one of her friends.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After a while her friend wrote her a letter in return, saying, "After reading your hymn, I realize that God has really blessed you, seeing that you have so much surplus."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The friend did not realize that she was in fact penniless.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Meanwhile, was God's word in vain?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No. After a couple of days, God supplied her through other people.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we have the Word of God, we have many sources.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The raven will supply us; the brook will supply us; a widow with only a handful of meal will supply us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even without all of these, God can open a heavenly window to supply us from above.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christ's work has been accomplished, and God has said it in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Once you believe, you have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The essence of God's word is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When you believe in His word, the Holy Spirit will take the responsibility to apply the reality of this word to you.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Once you believe, the Holy Spirit will lead you into Christ and into all that He has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Christ's work is accomplished, and God has spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, if you do not believe, the Holy Spirit will have no way to apply Christ's accomplishment to you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Brothers and sisters, you are clear about what God has done in Christ, and you understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But why do you still not have it?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is because you do not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You say you have believed and wonder why you still do not have?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But I say that you have not yet believed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If you have faith, the Holy Spirit is responsible for making what you have believed a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Knowledge is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You need faith in addition to knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>How many times have we read a whole chapter of the Bible without believing in one verse?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In many things, we lack faith.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Once you have faith, the Holy Spirit applies to you what you believe.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light" Gen 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Whatever He said, He accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In this universe whatever He says, He will accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In the beginning He spoke, and the universe obeyed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Today whenever God speaks, the universe still has to obey Him because no word of God is without His power.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This power is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Whenever God speaks, the Holy Spirit accomplishes it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is the way a sinner is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Whenever a sinner believes the Word of God, the Holy Spirit immediately will give him what Christ has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Some who were addicted to opium or alcohol experienced an immediate deliverance from these things when they believed in God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The only explanation for this is that the Holy Spirit has granted them the power to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I had a classmate who was by nature very tactful; he manipulated the whole class under his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Many classmates were afraid of him.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Later he was saved, and now he is even one of my co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If one did not know his past, one could never imagine what kind of person he was before.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He is what he is today through nothing other than resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The most amazing thing in the world is for a dead person to receive the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>After one believes, the Holy Spirit will add what Christ has accomplished to him.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Perhaps while he was listening to God's Word, he said, "I believe."</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Perhaps while he was sitting in the last row, he said, "I believe."</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Or perhaps while he was walking on the street, he said, "I believe."</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When he believes, the Holy Spirit adds what Christ has accomplished to him.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Brothers and sisters, my responsibility is to share this message with you.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>It would be wonderful if you could believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If you would read to God the verse that you heard last week, "In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands" Col 2:11 , and if you would read the same verse to yourself, you would gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>You may think that you have already overcome a few times and that you are now trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>But I have to say, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Only the Word of God is trustworthy; your experience is not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>May God work among us, so that we can believe in what His Word says literally.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The more we believe in what He says, the more we gain what He says.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>May the Lord bless us.</S>
