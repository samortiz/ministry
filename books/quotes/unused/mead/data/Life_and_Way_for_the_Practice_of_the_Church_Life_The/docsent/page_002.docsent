   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE POSITION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN GOD'S ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Matt 16:15-19; Eph 5:32</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The burden of the fellowship in this book is twofold.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, we will cover the building up of the Body of Christ, and on the other hand, we will take care of the urgent need today among the Lord's children.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the subject of this book is the life and way for the church practice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I look to the Lord that He will help us see the practice of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, we have to realize that to have any kind of practice, there is the need of a certain kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you have the life, you have the practice.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you do not have the life, it is impossible for you to have any practice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After you have the life, you need the way, the method, for the practice.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The life is the power, the strength, whereas the way is the method.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to have any kind of practice, we need the life as well as the way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With the Lord's help, we will cover the life for the practice of the church and the way to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now let us read Matthew 16:15-19: "He Jesus said to them, But you, who do you say that I am?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 18, Peter means a little rock, a stone; this rock refers to Christ with the living and real knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ will build His church upon Himself as the Son of God and upon the living and real knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this portion of the Word, we have Christ, the church, Hades, and the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us also read Ephesians 5:32: "This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The great mystery is concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE HEAD AND THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before we go on to see something concerning the practice of the church, I have the burden to lay a foundation by pointing out the position of the church in God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we human beings have our economy, then surely God has His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the divine economy, the church has a tremendous position.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many times I was told that Christ is the center of the holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although I admit that this is true, I would say that the center of the Scriptures is not just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ as the center of the Bible is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Physically speaking, we all know that with the head there is the body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You cannot have just the head and forget about the body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible shows us a great man, a universal man Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This universally great man is Christ with His church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ Himself is the Head of this man, and His church is the Body of this man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, we have to realize that the center of the Scriptures is not just Christ but Christ with His Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You cannot remove the church from the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you have Christ as the Head, surely you have the church as His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is impossible for me to go somewhere with just my head and leave my body in my house.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet some people would argue by saying, "Let us talk only about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Don't talk about the church."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But it is not right to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you are going to speak about Christ, surely you have to say something about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Matthew 16 the Lord first spoke about Himself by asking His disciples who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Peter said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" v. 16 . After Peter received this revelation, this knowledge, immediately the Lord told him that He would build His church upon this rock Christ Himself with the living knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church will be built upon the living Christ with the living knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here we see the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you talk about Christ, then you have to know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you have the Head, you must have the Body.</S>
