   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE KINGDOM OF PRIESTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BECOMING THE HOUSE OF PRIESTS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the revelation of the Scripture, God's purpose is not to have only one or two persons as His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His purpose is to have all His people as His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. God Choosing the Israelites</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>to Be a Kingdom of Priests</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After the Israelites came out of Egypt, they came to Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God charged Moses to speak to the Israelites, saying, "Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation" Exo 19:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God told the Israelites that they would be a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This expression is somewhat difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why did God say that they would be a kingdom of priests?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He meant that He wanted the whole nation to be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No one in the nation would be an ordinary person; the whole kingdom would be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God chose Israel to be His people, He set this goal before them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This nation was to be different from all other nations on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the people of this nation would be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This meant that every person in the nation would have one unique occupation, the occupation of serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God delights in separating men from the earth for His service.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He delights in seeing men live solely for His affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God wants all of His children to be priests and to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God told the people of Israel when they reached Mount Sinai that He would make them a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a wonderful calling.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We call England "the kingdom of the navy," the United States, "the kingdom of gold," China, "the kingdom of manners and virtues," and India "the kingdom of philosophers."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But here is a kingdom which is called "the kingdom of priests."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everyone in this nation is a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Men, women, adults, and children are all priests.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everyone in this kingdom serves only God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Both adults and children have only one thing as their occupation offering sacrifices and serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a wonderful picture.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After God promised to establish Israel as a kingdom of priests, He told Moses to go up the mountain to receive the Ten Commandments which were written upon two tablets of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moses remained on the mountain forty days while God wrote the Ten Commandments on the stone tablets.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first commandment says, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The second says, "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image" 20:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It seems that God was dictating the commandments one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>B. The Israelites Serving the Idols</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>While Moses was up on the mountain, the people at the foot of the mountain wondered about his delay.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They said to Aaron, "Up, make us gods, which shall go before us" 32:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Aaron succumbed to their words, collected gold, and made a golden calf.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The people then worshipped the golden calf and said, "These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt" v. 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They began to worship the idol.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They indulged in great celebration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At last they had found a visible golden god for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The God that Moses taught was mysterious; one could not identify where He lived or where He could be located.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even Moses, the one who worshipped this God, was nowhere to be found.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now there was a visible golden calf which they could worship.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God had appointed them to be priests, but even before they were able to be His priests, they became priests to the golden calf.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God's desire was for them to be a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But even before they could do that, they had turned to idol worship and served the golden calf.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They established other gods and other forms of worship apart from Jehovah their God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is man's concept of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Man always tries to make his own god and worship according to his own ways.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Man likes to worship a god created by his own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He does not accept God's sovereignty in His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He does not like to acknowledge Him as the Creator.</S>
