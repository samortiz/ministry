   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the End of John s Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The degradation at the end of the apostle John s ministry took place around the A.D. 90s.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>a. Many Antichrists</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many antichrists lied, denying that Jesus is the Christ, the One anointed by God 1 John 2:18, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many False Prophets</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many false prophets, by the spirit of deception, did not confess that Christ came in the flesh 4:1-2, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many Deceivers</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many deceivers as antichrists, not confessing that Christ came in the flesh, taught beyond the teaching of Christ 2 John 7, 9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Diotrephes</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Diotrephes, who loved to be first in the church, did not receive the apostles, babbling evil words against them, and forbade those intending to receive the brothers and cast them out of the church 3 John 9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From all the foregoing we can see what kind of degradation had come in. At the end of the ministry of the three main writers of the New Testament Paul, Peter, and John there was degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because of this degradation, the life-giving Spirit, that is, the pneumatic Christ, had to be intensified sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>B. The Intensification of Christ 1.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Intensified to Be the Seven Spirits</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ as the life-giving Spirit was intensified to be the seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>a. The Center of the Divine Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Revelation 1:4 and 5 the Spirit becomes the second, the center, of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The sequence of the Divine Trinity in Matthew 28:19 is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There the Father as the source is the first, the Spirit is the last, and the Son is the center, the second.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Revelation 1:4 and 5 the sequence is changed: Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming the Father , and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This change of sequence reveals the importance of the function of the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is a sense, however, in which the sequence actually has not changed, for as the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God, Christ remains the center of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Seven Lamps</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The sevenfold intensified Spirit, as the seven Spirits, is the seven lamps burning before the throne of God 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because of the degradation, many things should be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, the lamps are mainly not for burning but for enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the lamps enlighten, they also burn.</S>
