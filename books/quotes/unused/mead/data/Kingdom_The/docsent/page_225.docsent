   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In First Corinthians</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1 Corinthians 5:1-2 more leaven is mentioned: "It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then verses 6-8: "Your glorying is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verses 11-13 continue: "But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one, no, not to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But them that are without God judgeth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must realize that the Lord will never allow this kind of wicked person to stay in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They must be put away.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a sense they must be chased away, even excommunicated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, we can see there are two kinds of persons with whom we should not fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First are the antichrists like those mentioned in 2 John, who have gone forward and do not abide in the teaching of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The antichrists do not believe that Christ is God or that Christ is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They do not believe that Christ died on the cross to accomplish redemption, was resurrected, and today is enthroned in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These are the antichrists.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not greet them, and we should not grant them hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The second are the wicked persons who are mentioned in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not allow them to remain among us unless they repent because it is an insult to the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we allow such wicked persons to remain in the church life, it will become dirty, polluted, and insulted, and we will lose the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must be alert not to receive any antichrists and not to allow any wicked persons to remain among us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church must be clear of all these dark things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Galatians</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can see the seed of leaven developed also in Galatians 1:6-9: "I marvel that you are so quickly removing from Him Who has called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel, which is not another; only there are some who trouble you and desire to pervert the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if even we or an angel out of heaven should preach to you a gospel besides that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we have said before, now also I say again, If anyone preaches to you a gospel besides that which you have received, let him be accursed."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Surely that kind of gospel which was besides the gospel that Paul preached is a kind of leaven.</S>
