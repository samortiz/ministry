   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LETTER FROM SWATOW, KWANGTUNG PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear Brother Luk:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Parts omitted.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 The meetings here have been deeply blessed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The table meeting is on the Lord's Day morning at 8:30.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are more than thirty brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the afternoon we have a gospel meeting at 3:30.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are two hundred people listening to the message.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This building is too small.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is very crowded every week.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The brothers and sisters have decided to rent a larger place after our four month rental is up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They plan to prepare four hundred seats.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the Lord is willing, it will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After nineteen people were baptized on May 8, seven more sisters obeyed the Lord and were baptized in August.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I really thank the Lord; He is the One doing a good work in Swatow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Luk, I am really in fear and trembling and do not know how to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I do not know many truths about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I cannot answer many questions about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We really need some teaching from you brothers!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Nee sent a letter to me during my turn, teaching and exhorting me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It gave me much light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This type of teaching is very precious to me, a little brother from the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many brothers here know nothing about the truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although Brother Nee has passed some teachings on to us, they were general and not detailed, so I beg you, brother, for the Lord's sake to take time out of your busy schedule to give me a letter with detailed teachings, so that we do not fall and shame the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brother Nee also wanted me to attend the next conference in Shanghai on the truth of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am very honored that for the Lord's sake the brothers have not rejected one as low as me but are willing to teach and correct me!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Truly, Brother Luk, the situation of the world being as it is, what have I to be reluctant about in giving it up?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord is coming soon.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May we faithfully serve Him in one accord according to the gift He has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May the Lord bless you all.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Tze Hang</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>October 4, 1933</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>IN CH'ANG-CH'UN, KIRIN PROVINCE, MANCHURIA</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Mr. Nee:</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I received your letter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The matter of my future has already been resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the latter part of August, the environment in the company did not allow me to continue working there.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the same time, I was clear in prayer that it was God's will that I should quit my job and serve the Lord "full-time."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>So on August 25, I gave my resignation to the manager who came to Chefoo from Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The manager wanted me to wait until the end of September before leaving, so I agreed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thank God, the matter of my responsibilities toward my family has also been resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From now on, I do not have to bear any responsibility toward my extended family, and my extended family will not bear any responsibility for me, my wife, and my children.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The day after I gave my resignation, August 26, I received a letter from Sister Yu Su-chen.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She urgently invited me to go work in Ch'ang-ch'un in Manchuria.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since I was clear about God's will, I finished settling the affairs of my company in order to free myself for Ch'ang-ch'un.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some affairs could not be settled immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I promised the company I would return to Chefoo at the end of September to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I left Chefoo on September 5 and arrived in Ch'ang-ch'un on the seventh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I stayed there for eighteen days.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord really blessed the work there.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As a result, nine brothers and sixteen sisters obeyed the Lord and were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many had been sprinkled previously in the Ch'ang-ch'un Presbyterian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Among these nine brothers, two were elders of the Ch'ang-ch'un Presbyterian Church; one is Mr. T'ien P'in Fang, the manager of Ch'ang-ch'un Ch'ien Yi East Company.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is already more than fifty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He held four positions as a board member and one as a director of the board in the Presbyterian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Furthermore, he was their treasurer.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now he has resigned from all of these positions!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He has also turned over his responsibility as the treasurer!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The other one is Mr. An K'o Pai, the elder brother of Sister An.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is in the pharmaceutical business.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He has also resigned from his position as elder.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Among the obeying sisters, two were female preachers in the Presbyterian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There were also a few brothers and sisters who were newly saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Before I went to Ch'ang-ch'un, Sister Yu had already done some work among the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At the same time, God prepared these brothers and sisters through the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At that time, what they especially the brothers needed was the light of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Once they saw the light, they obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The second Lord's Day I was there, we had the table meeting in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We broke bread together with them twice.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When I was in Ch'ang-ch'un, I received a letter sent from my manager in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the letter, he asked me to continue working until the end of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He also promised to come to Chefoo to make new arrangements so that the situation of the company could allow me to continue working.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But I am clear that if I go back to work, it will be unbelief and unfaithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, I have decided to write a letter of refusal when I get back to Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I left Ch'ang-ch'un on September 25 and returned to Chefoo on the twenty-seventh.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When I arrived home, your letter was there.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After reading it, I deeply sensed God's will in what you said in the last part.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He wanted to confirm my personal subjective view with your objective view, so I boldly wrote a letter to my manager refusing his offer.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After my return to Chefoo, I returned to the company on September 28 to finish the work of transfer to my successor.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Now I have made arrangements for almost everything.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I can finish the matter in another three or four days.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Brother Huang Tzu Hou of Nan Su Chou sent me a letter he is in Tientsin at the present inviting me to Tientsin to stay for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Lord willing, I may go there to visit our brother.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Gospel Paper has not been published yet!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>May the Lord bless this matter so that the paper can finally appear and enlighten some people in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The trip I took to Manchuria showed me all the more the desperate need for the gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Where are you now?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>How is your health?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Will there be a conference in Shanghai this year or not?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Hoping this finds you at peace!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Your respectful brother,</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>October 10, 1933</S>
