   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS MESSAGE SIXTEEN ON JOEL 7 THE HISTORY OF GOD WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE HISTORY OF GOD IN MAN Scripture Reading: Joel 1:4; 2:28-29; 3:11-21</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible is a wonderful book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because the Bible is wonderful, it is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although a great many people have read and continue to read the Bible, few know what the Bible talks about.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible has much to say about God, Christ, Israel, and many other things, but what does the Bible actually talk about?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we would answer this question, we need to study the Minor Prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE MINOR PROPHETS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Minor Prophets are a key to understanding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In our study of the Minor Prophets, we have emphasized four points: God s chastisement of Israel, God s punishment upon the nations, the manifestation of Christ, and the restoration of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through God s chastisement of Israel and His punishment upon the nations, the manifestation of Christ is brought forth, and the manifestation of Christ will bring in the restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This restoration will include not only Israel but the whole human race, the earth, and the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem will be the eternal restoration of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These four matters are revealed in the Bible, in particular in the Minor Prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE BIBLE BEING THE HISTORY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>IN TWO PORTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible may be considered the history of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we human beings have a history, not only as a race but even as individuals, then surely the unique, universal, and wonderful person of God must also have a history.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Where do we find the history of God?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God s history, the divine history, is recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s history is of two portions the history of God with man, found in the Old Testament, and the history of God in man, found in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Old Testament God s history was a history with man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the New Testament God s history is a history in man, for this history involves God s being one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the history of God in the New Testament is a divine history in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The History of God with Man</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God created man according to Himself, that is, in His image and according to His likeness Gen 1:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may say that the man created in God s image was a photograph of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a photograph of a person shows us something concerning that person himself to a certain degree, so the man created by God as a photograph of God can show forth God only to a limited extent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After God created man, He was with man, but He was still outside of man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, in the Old Testament we see God not in man or one with man but simply with man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Genesis, Exodus, the Psalms, and the entire Old Testament, God was with man but not yet in man and not yet one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Old Testament does not speak mainly concerning man; rather, it speaks mainly concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has the primary role, and man has the subordinate role.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The history in the Old Testament, therefore, is God s history, God s history with man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The History of God in Man</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God s history in the New Testament is very different.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Beginning with the first chapter of Matthew and continuing to the last chapter of Revelation, we have God coming into man and being one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The New Testament reveals that God is now in man and one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, God s history in the New Testament is the history of God in man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Incarnation Accomplishing Two Things Bringing God into Man</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Regarding the history of God in man, the incarnation of Christ accomplished two things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First, the incarnation brought God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before the incarnation, as the Old Testament reveals, God was merely with man; He was outside of man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But by incarnation God entered into man, and from that time onward the history of God was different.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whereas in the past God was with man, and His history was a history with man, now God was in man, and His history began to be a history in man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Making God One with Man</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Second, the incarnation made God one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As a result of the incarnation, there was a wonderful person a person who is the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This person, Jesus, is not only God, and He is not merely a man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is the complete God and the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Further, He is not only God in man He is God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>From this we see that the incarnation was an unprecedented event.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Prior to the incarnation, there was not such a person, a person who is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But now, as a result of the incarnation, there is a wonderful person who is the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our Involvement with the God-man</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As believers, we all have become involved with this wonderful person, this One who is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A verse which speaks of this involvement is Revelation 22:17a, which says, The Spirit and the bride say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Spirit is the consummated Triune God, and the bride is the transformed tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As this verse reveals, these two, the Spirit and the bride, will be married, joined to become one entity, one corporate person.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a strong indication that, in the New Testament, God is in man and is one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The New Jerusalem is a marvelous sign demonstrating how God is in man and is one with man.</S>
