 <h2 class="head2">An Issue of the Son<br />
as the Course of the Divine Trinity</h2>
<h2 class="head3">In His Redemption of the Father&rsquo;s<br />
Chosen and Predestinated Ones</h2>
<p>The organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ, is the issue of the Son as the course of the divine Trinity in His redemption of the Father&rsquo;s chosen and predestinated ones that they may be recovered and brought back to the headship of Christ for the eternal economy of God (Eph. 1:7-10). Man was created by God, but he fell away from God, that is, he fell away from the headship of Christ. In Christ&rsquo;s redemption, fallen mankind gets recovered and brought back to the headship of Christ for the eternal dispensation of God. The word &ldquo;dispensation&rdquo; in Greek is <em>oikonomia,</em> which is the anglicized word <em>economy.</em> In the New Testament, <em>oikonomia</em> means a kind of household arrangement, a plan. God made an arrangement in eternity past that all the things created by Him would be headed up in Christ.</p>
<p>Today we cannot see the entire universe headed up in Christ. The nations of this earth are not united, but they are in a state of division and confusion. God gave the resurrected Christ to be the Head of all things in the heavens and on the earth. God&rsquo;s plan is to bring all His created things into oneness under the headship of Christ. Today there is a spiritual warfare that is going on in the heavens. While I am speaking, I look to the Lord to cover me and shield me from the attack of His enemy. Spiritual warfare is going on in this universe between God and His enemy, Satan. On this earth division and confusion prevail. Christ died on the cross to redeem us back from a place of confusion, recovering us back to the headship of Christ.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:7-10 says: &ldquo;In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace, which He caused to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&rdquo; These verses combine redemption with dispensation. Redemption is unto a dispensation to head up all things in Christ. Christ&rsquo;s redemption of us is for the heading up of all things in Christ. As God&rsquo;s redeemed ones, we take the lead among God&rsquo;s creation to be headed up in Christ. We are redeemed, and we are under the headship of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">In His Making of His Redeemed Ones<br />
an Inheritance of God</h2>
<p>The organism of the Triune God is an issue of the Son as the course of the divine Trinity in His making of His redeemed ones an inheritance of God for God&rsquo;s satisfaction (Eph. 1:11). Christ&rsquo;s redemption not only recovers us back to His headship but also makes us God&rsquo;s inheritance for God&rsquo;s enjoyment. Christ&rsquo;s redemption is all-inclusive. On the one hand, His all-inclusive death is the redeeming death, the death that redeemed us back to God and back to the headship of Christ. On the other hand, His death is also the life-releasing death, the death for His multiplication. In the Gospel of John, Christ in His death is likened to three things. John 1 refers to Him as the Lamb of God (v. 29). He died on the cross as the Lamb of God for our redemption, for the forgiveness of our offenses. In John 3 Christ is likened to the serpent that Moses lifted up in the wilderness (v. 14). Christ died on the cross as the brass serpent (Num. 21:4-9) to judge and to destroy the source of sin and the authority of death, the Devil, Satan. In John 12 Christ was likened to a grain of wheat falling into the earth to die (v. 24). This grain of wheat is for the bringing forth of many grains, that is, for multiplication. This is the multiplying death of Christ to release His divine life and to impart His divine life into us in resurrection to make us the many grains.</p>
<p>After He imparted His divine life into us through His death plus His resurrection, He made us an inheritance to God. Now God has a particular possession in the universe. The entire universe is God&rsquo;s possession, but we are now His particular possession. We were created by Him and we were His possession, but we were not His particular possession because He had not yet imparted Himself into our being. In Christ&rsquo;s redemption God has been imparted into us, the Christ-redeemed ones, making us a particular possession for God. In Christ&rsquo;s redemption we can see the issue of the impartation, the dispensing, of the Triune God. The Triune God in the Son has been dispensed, imparted, into our being, making us an inheritance of God for God to be satisfied.</p>
