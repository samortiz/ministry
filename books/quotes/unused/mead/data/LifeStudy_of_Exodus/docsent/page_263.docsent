   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall cover a number of crucial points related to the blood of the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. THE BLOOD INDICATING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THAT ONE PARTY IS SINFUL</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>AND THAT THE OTHER PARTY</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>IS WILLING TO FORGIVE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Exodus 24:6 says of Moses that half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Hebrews 9:19, Moses sprinkled both the book itself and all the people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why was it necessary for Moses to sprinkle the book?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The book of the law was clean, but when it was brought down to the people, it became unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have very little realization of how contaminated and defiled we are, and how contagious is the evil within us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Anything we touch immediately becomes unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was the reason that even the book of the law needed the sprinkling of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The people were foolish in promising to do whatever the Lord required of them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moses, however, was not foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He did not take heed to the promise made by the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead, he sprinkled the blood on all those foolish ones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He realized that they needed the cleansing of the blood, and he sprinkled them with the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This sprinkling of the blood indicates that one party of the covenanters was sinful and needed forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It also indicates that God was willing to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hebrews 8:12 reveals God s willingness to forgive His people: For I will be propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I will by no means remember anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>NO FORGIVENESS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>WITHOUT THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hebrews 9:22 says, Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Blood was shed in Exodus 24 because of the need for the forgiveness of the people s sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The very fact that blood is mentioned indicates that the children of Israel needed forgiveness and that God was ready to forgive them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If God had not been willing to forgive the people, He could have set the sacrifices aside and put the people all to death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But blood was shed as the necessary requirement for the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE BLOOD FOR FORGIVENESS OF SIN</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>USHERING THE SINFUL PARTY OF THE COVENANT</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>INTO BETTER THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The blood for forgiveness of sins ushered the sinful party of the covenant, the children of Israel, into better things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We know this by the fact that after God s people failed to observe the law, He came in to make another covenant with them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A. A New Heart</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the new covenant God pledged to make with His people, He promised to give them a new heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ezekiel 36:26 says, A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For God to give the people a new heart means that He would change their nature.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the foot of Mount Sinai the children of Israel spoke foolishly to Moses when they promised to do whatever the Lord commanded.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God does not want His people to speak in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His intention is to change their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>B. A New Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Ezekiel 36:26 God also promises to give the people a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is to regenerate them and reconstitute them.</S>
