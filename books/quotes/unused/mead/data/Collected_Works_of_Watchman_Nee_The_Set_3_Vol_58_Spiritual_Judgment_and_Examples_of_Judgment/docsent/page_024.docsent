   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 10 Date:July 2, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER Z. Z.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Missing</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I will speak one thing concerning you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Your emotion has made you an icy and passionless person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Your natural disposition has gone through such shock in the environment that it has become passionless and cold.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You have brought this cold disposition into the work, and this has been the reason you have suffered in the work all these years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Your cold disposition has been molded by your environment and constituted into your daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What we encounter before we are saved becomes part of our constitution and growth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Moreover, this growth continues until we develop a character that is very different from our former state.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You cannot coordinate with other co-workers in the work, and your attitude is uncooperative because your emotion and character have affected your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Your spirit runs contrary to others' spirits; it does not go along with them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because of your background, you have acquired a different character.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This character spontaneously creates a problem in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It brings nothing but trouble to the church and to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I believe the Lord's hand has been on you during the past years and has done some work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have your own view concerning many things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you are with the brothers and sisters, your indifferent character insists on what it sees and will not give in. This insistence becomes stronger and stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is a good sign that God has been breaking your hard character throughout these years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This has not only exposed your weakness but has shown you that you have been responding to others according to your kind of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the only way to break your hard disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not easy for God to use any one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I hope you will improve during this end time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I hope you will not delay His work or waste His effort on you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You should not adopt a hardened stand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I say this, I do not mean that you should give up being sober or serious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am saying that the spirit of a minister of the word has to go along with the spirit of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has to observe the flow of the meeting and go along with the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If he does this, he will have the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the meeting we should not bring up any spiritual matter in an independent spirit that runs contrary to the spirit of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the meetings the brothers and sisters have their feelings, and we cannot offend their feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot take care of just our own feelings while ignoring other peoples' feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is, of course, a difference when it comes to preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not purposely try to impress others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But we should not purposely try to ignore them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not purposely try to render help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But we should not purposely try to refuse helping others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not purposely try to take care of others' feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But neither should we purposely try to ignore their feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we speak, our spirit should have only one goal in mind to edify others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we want to be a minister of the word, we must exercise love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to 1 Corinthians 13:4 this love is kind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our brother's present character is made up of three things: First, his natural disposition; second, the influence of the environment; and third, the coldness which is the result of a combination of his inherent disposition and his surrounding environment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our brother indeed needs the Lord's mercy to grant him kindness and gentleness so that his present character will undergo a severe and unrelenting breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not do something that does not produce any result.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the same way we should not suffer without producing any result.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many sisters become sick or encounter trials.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But the sickness and trials do not produce any result in them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a pity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God's work always produces results.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our brother does have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yet he has a problem with his character.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May the Lord be gracious to him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once a man is broken, he will have a tender spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A tender spirit is not the same as a weak spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Your character has been hardened by the environment, and this hardness has resulted in self-righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the reason you cannot love the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Your self-righteousness, in turn, has resulted in an independent spirit in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the reason your spirit cannot flow freely and richly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You need God's dealing to bring forth the fruit of the Spirit a spirit of kindness and love, a spirit that can mingle with other spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the only way for your spirit to become rich, and this is the only way for you to gain others.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you can take care of these three things, you will be greatly used in the ministry of the word.</S>
