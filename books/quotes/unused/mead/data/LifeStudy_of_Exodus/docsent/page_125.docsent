   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN THE HEAVENLY DIET MANNA 3 Scripture Reading: Exo 16:13b-15, 31-36; Num 11:6b-9</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous message we pointed out that manna came from heaven 16:4 , that it came with the dew 16:13b-14; Num 11:9 , and that it came in the morning 16:13b, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider a number of other characteristics of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>D. Small</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Contrary to the human concept, manna was something small 16:14b .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>People usually appreciate something that is great, and we often praise the Lord for His greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, where can you find hymns of praise for the smallness of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have looked through many hymnals, but have not found any hymns on Christ s smallness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Building materials may be very large, but food must be small enough to fit into our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The food taken in by us must be small enough to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we want to eat a large piece of meat, we need to first cut it into small pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Throughout the centuries, few of those who believe in the Lord have had an adequate appreciation of the preciousness of the Lord s smallness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many regard the four Gospels as the record of the life of a great person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually the Gospels do not emphasize Christ s greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yes, the Lord Jesus was a descendant of David, a descendant of a royal family.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, He was born in a manger, and He was raised in the home of a carpenter in a small, despised town.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that the Lord did not make a display of His greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the contrary, He preferred to be small in the eyes of man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to John 6, the crowd wanted to enthrone the Lord Jesus as a king, but He fled from such an exaltation of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The next day He returned and presented Himself as the bread of life John 6:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not want to be a king; He wanted to be food that His people may receive Him as their life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead of being great, the Lord wanted to be small in order to be food for us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From the time of Christ s ascension until now, Christian teachers have tended to stress the greatness and exaltation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, Christ still wants to be small so that we may eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The great revivals in the history of the church have not focused on Christ s smallness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the reason that such revivals usually have not lasted very long.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, the corruption in Christianity has always come in through the door of greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we would close this door, no element of corruption could enter into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In His smallness the Lord is altogether different from our natural concept of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even we in the Lord s recovery may desire to see great things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because of the desire for greatness, many of those in the Pentecostal or charismatic movement are given to boastfulness and exaggeration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For this reason, we should discount a large percentage of the reports of healings and miracles that supposedly take place in today s Pentecostalism.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some may boast that many healings took place in a particular meeting when there was not even one genuine healing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some years ago reports were circulated about a great revival that supposedly was taking place on the island of Timor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to these reports, miracles were commonplace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Claims were even made that people had been raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A former missionary who was there and is now in the Lord s recovery attended some of these revival meetings to observe what was happening.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In one meeting the leader announced that during the course of the meeting water would be changed into wine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At a certain point, this brother saw the leader take out a bottle he had hidden and pour wine from it into a container of water.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What falsehood!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Falsehoods such as this are allowed to creep in because so many Christians have the desire for greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Miracles are not food.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even a genuine miraculous healing may not be food to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Jesus wants to be our food.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is possible to be healed by the Lord without receiving Him as food.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Healings may be great and miraculous, but still not have the nature of food.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, it is possible to receive divine healing in the proper way so that through the healing the Lord becomes a supply of life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This kind of healing is not outwardly great; rather, it is small in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those things in our Christian life which do not supply life to us either are not genuine or are not normal; they are contrary to the nature of food.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to the Gospel of John, people tried to exalt the Lord Jesus, but He always fled from such exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In John 2 the Jews saw miracles performed by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, He would not commit Himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He would not trust in those who were impressed by miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In John 3 Nicodemus came to the Lord Jesus by night.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Without anything miraculous taking place, the Lord was life to this man in a very ordinary way, in a way that was calm, hidden, small, and silent.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the divine way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even we in the Lord s recovery may expect to see great things take place.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Such a desire has often opened the door to trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The desire for greatness invariably results in suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, this suffering may help to terminate the desire for greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because the Bible does not give us the dimensions of manna, we do not know how small manna was.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Both in His greatness and in His smallness, Christ is immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The detailed description given of manna in the Scriptures simply includes a word about its smallness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Manna is small in order to be taken in as food.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As the real manna, Christ is small enough for us to take in, digest, and assimilate.</S>
