   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE MINISTRY OF WATCHMAN NEE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen the revelations Watchman Nee received from the Lord and the sufferings he underwent.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After seeing something of his revelations and sufferings, we come to his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>MINISTRY ISSUING FROM</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>REVELATION PLUS SUFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ministry is the issue of revelation plus suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without revelation one cannot have ministry because he has nothing to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But though one may have revelation, if he lacks suffering, he still has no ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He may have some sort of teaching or gift, but this is not ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is a difference between teaching and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ministry is something higher and deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Gift is superficial and costs little, while ministry is weighty and costly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you have received revelation from God, He will put you into suffering in order that you may have ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From the writings of the apostle Paul, we can see that before he endured suffering, he received revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When he received the revelation, he did not immediately go out to pass it on as teaching or knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To do so would not have been ministry; it would have been a sort of teaching or an exercise of gift.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But after receiving the revelation, the Lord put him into some suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, in all his Epistles we have this sequence: first, the revelation; second, the sufferings; and third, the ministry which came out of the first two.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To receive revelation is one thing; to have that revelation wrought into our being is something else.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the process of producing a porcelain vase, a pattern for a picture is painted onto the vase.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The vase is then put into an oven, and the painting is burned onto it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By passing through the oven, the painting and the vase become one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Receiving a revelation is similar to having a picture painted upon us; but this painting must be burned into us to make the painting one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the painting is burned into the vase, no one can erase it; neither can the vase be separated from the painting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the vase is broken, the painting is broken, for they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the same with us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The only way for us to be burned is by suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No real minister of God can avoid suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The measure of life, the amount of reality, and the riches of Christ we are able to minister to others depend entirely upon two elements: how much revelation we have received and how much suffering we have undergone regarding that which has been revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When suffering is added to revelation, we have ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul said, "Therefore having this ministry..."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2 Cor 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did not say that he had a certain teaching or a gift, but a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Again he said, "I Paul became a minister" Col 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He did not say that he was made a speaker or a teacher, but a minister.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are not referring to today's "minister."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The word "minister" has been spoiled and misused in today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A minister is a person who has a real ministry, a ministry which issues from these two things revelation plus suffering.</S>
