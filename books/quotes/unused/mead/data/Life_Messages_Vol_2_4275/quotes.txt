[2]  This book is part of a three-volume set containing messages given by Brother Witness Lee during the years 1978 and 1979.
[3]  Life Messages, Volume One includes messages given during special conferences in Anaheim, San Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento, Berkeley, Boston, Washington D.C., New York City, Atlanta, Miami, Cleveland, Spokane, Moses Lake, Seattle, Vancouver, and Dallas.
[4]  CHAPTER FORTY-TWO THE VITAL POSITION OF GOD'S WORD IN HIS ECONOMY
[5]  In order to carry out His purpose, He has a way or an economy.
[6]  God's economy, that is, His way of achieving His eternal purpose, is to dispense Himself into His chosen people.
[7]  The Bible illustrates that the word of God is like a seed Matt 13:23 .
[8]  Even if you read it more than a hundred times, you will not be bored.
[9]  Then it would be good for the churches to have training meetings, a "teaching and preaching" meeting where people can hear the truths of the Bible in an atmosphere of preaching.
[10]  We have many dear friends in Christianity or in the world, and when we first came into the church we damaged many of them by sharing in a wrong way.
[11]  As you say, we do need to pray and go to the Word, but I still would like some practical help as to what to do for these whom we have damaged.
[12]  The best way to heal this situation is to pray for the ones you damaged.
[13]  The Gospel of John occupies a special place in God's revelation.
[14]  In John 4 there is the water that wells up.
[15]  If you drink this water, it will well up into eternal life.
[16]  Then we come to the last point we mentioned, that of the Lord's breathing into His disciples.
[17]  By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the Lord imparted Himself as life into them.
[18]  Besides your ten minutes in the morning, take a few more minutes at noon, and a few more in the evening.
[19]  CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR THE WIDE SCOPE OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN THE WIDE SCOPE OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN
[20]  God became a man with the intention that man might receive Him, that He might become man's life, and that man might be one to express Him.
[21]  I hope you do not have the shallow concept of the gospel that is so prevalent today.
[22]  The common teaching is that we were pitiful sinners on the way to hell but that God loved us and sent His Son to be our Redeemer.
[23]  After He had set up this pattern, Christ went through death and resurrection to become the Spirit in order that He might enter into us.
[24]  It is only as the Spirit that He can be received into us.
[25]  His fullness comes to us in two ways: by the Word and by the Spirit.
[26]  We can liken this to electricity with its two wires, the antenna and the ground wire.
[27]  The Spirit is the antenna, and the Word is the ground.
[28]  These are the two lines that convey the heavenly electricity, which is Christ Himself, the life-giving Spirit.
[29]  If you read the Gospel of John carefully, you will notice that at the beginning Christ is presented as the Word; then toward the end He becomes the Spirit 20:22 .
[30]  CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE A LIVING PERSON, NOT ANY SUBSTITUTE Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4, 14; 6:63; 14:23; 15:7; 2 Cor 3:17-18
[31]  Christ is the Head, and the church is His Body.
[32]  This is not to say that we are unethical.
[33]  If we are given too much change when we buy something, we return the extra amount.
[34]  If we visit someone, we do not step over the threshold until we are first invited in; otherwise, we would be intruding.
[35]  When we come to the Word, we need to open four layers of our being.
[36]  In the Old Testament God spoke from within the tent of meeting.
[37]  What is the perfecting work that the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are doing?
[38]  It is to perfect the saints to do the same work as they themselves are doing.
[39]  Every one of you can be all these four kinds of persons.
[40]  If you are constrained by the Lord, after praying, to say a word for Him to your mother, the Lord would say to you, "I send you as the Father sent Me. When you go to your mother, I shall be with you.
[41]  CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 4:11-12; Acts 5:42; 1 Tim 3:2; 5:11; 1 Cor 12:29; 14:31; Acts 6:1-5 SATURATED WITH THE WORD
[42]  All of us can and must be among the gifted persons listed in Ephesians 4:11.
[43]  The key to your becoming an apostle, a prophet, an evangelist, and a shepherd and teacher is the Word.
[44]  If you take very little of the Word into you, you will not be much of a gifted person.
[45]  But if your being is saturated with the living essence of God's Word, not merely with the knowledge of it, you will surely be His sent one.
[46]  How much you take the Word into you and let it mingle with your inward parts determines the extent to which you can be God's spokesman.
[47]  "And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ" Acts 5:42 .
[48]  The early saints were a teaching and preaching people.
[49]  This meeting is not only for the church, but for the whole city as well.
[50]  Every church which practices this will be a lampstand shining over the darkness.
[51]  This is not to say that you do not need the other churches and should try to go on in an independent way.
[52]  You must keep the door of fellowship open to all the churches, even while you keep the door of weakness shut to offers of "help."
[53]  CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT A HISTORY OF THE WORD OF GOD Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Tim 3:16-17; John 6:63; 2 Cor 3:6
[54]  Let us trace together the history of the Word of God.
[55]  Without the Word, all these things would exist, but they would not be understandable or available to our faculties.
[56]  He made us with a wonderful mind to understand and grasp, and then to convey to our spirit what the mind understands, that we might drink of it.
[57]  The Bible was opened some three centuries later in the hands of the Plymouth Brethren, under the leadership of J. N. Darby and others.
[58]  It was the Brethren who came to understand the Old Testament typology and prophecies.
[59]  You can be saved from these snares by the books we have made available to you.
[60]  If you use the Recovery Versions with the notes and the Life-study Messages, you will save much time and be kept on the right track.
[61]  These are not necessary when you are doing your daily reading of three chapters in the Old Testament and one in the New.
[62]  The love of God is also included in this Gospel, as we well know from 3:16: "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life."
[63]  If, however, we preach the biblical gospel, as found in John, we are surely constrained to put our trust in the Spirit.
[64]  "Lord, if You do not open people's eyes, if You as the life-giving Spirit do not work deep within their hearts, no one will follow; even I will not understand."
[65]  The gospel also includes this verse: "He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" John 7:38 .
[66]  The Lord Jesus invited all those who were thirsty to come to Him and drink v. 37 . Rivers of living water should flow from you.
[67]  How many rivers do you have flowing out of your inner being?
[68]  Every line and every word of the book of John is part of the rich gospel.
[69]  CHAPTER FIFTY LIVING BY CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 1:27; 2:16-17; 3:4, 10-11; Gal 2:20; Phil 1:21a THE HEART OF THE BIBLE
[70]  In these recent months the churches have been brought back to the Word and to prayer.
[71]  I believe also that the churches are seeking to live Christ, a life that builds up the church.
[72]  During these sixteen or so years I have been in the United States, I have sought to impress you with three basic matters.
[73]  I long for them to be wrought into your being.
[74]  In 1933 I began to make a clearance of my past.
[75]  CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE TAKING CHRIST AS LIFE Scripture Reading: Col 1:27; 2:2, 15-17; 3:4, 10-11, 16; Eph 6:16-18; John 6:63; 16:8-9 GOD'S ECONOMY
[76]  In the universe there are three parties God, man, and Satan.
[77]  In God's economy there is no place for religion, or ethical behavior, or human virtues.
[78]  He wants Christ expressed in us, not human virtues.
[79]  In Colossians 3:4 Christ is called "our life."
[80]  In the new man "there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all" v. 11 . In the new man there is no room for you or me.
[81]  CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO HOW TO ABIDE IN CHRIST Scripture Reading: John 1:12-13; 3:5-6; 4:24; 6:63; 14:17-20, 23; 15:1, 4-5, 7-8; 20:22 RECEIVING CHRIST
[82]  The Gospel of John, especially in the verses given above, answers the question of how to abide in Christ.
[83]  In 1:12-13 there is the matter of receiving Him: "But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: Who were born of God."
[84]  Our efforts to abide in Christ seemed always to end in failure.
[85]  Because of such frustration, we were compelled to spend more time in the Gospel of John.
[86]  In order to uncover the secret of abiding, which is revealed in the middle of this book, we thought we should follow the principle of studying the whole book thoroughly.
[87]  I would like to tell you the secret of abiding.
[88]  This is based upon my experience, not on the black and white pages of the Bible.
[89]  Though the term "to live by Christ" sounds familiar to us because of our having heard it so much, it is nonetheless a great matter.
[90]  When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was a person of strong character.
[91]  God did many things to make it possible for us to live Christ.
[92]  He had to create the heavens, the earth, and man.
[93]  You come home from work exhausted after an eight-hour day.
[94]  In the writings of Paul the word mystery often recurs.
[95]  In Romans 16:25-26 he says that "the mystery, which has been kept in silence in times of the ages," has now "been manifested, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the command of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations unto obedience of faith."
[96]  There is a mystery, then, hidden in times past but now, according to the command of the eternal God, made known to man.
[97]  The mystery of the universe, Paul tells us, has been hidden "from the ages" Eph 3:9 and was not made known "in other generations" 3:5 .
[98]  This means that it was hidden from eternity the ages and from the earlier generations of time.
[99]  Even earlier the Lord was talking with His disciples on one occasion and told them He would be going away.
[100]  God had no way to reach us except through Christ.
[101]  Christ as the Spirit is the reaching of God to us.
[102]  CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE THE CHURCH, THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Gal 1:15a, 16a; 2:20a; 4:19; Col 1:27; 3:4a, 11; Phil 1:20b-21a; Eph 3:17a, 19b; 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:8-11, 6, 4
[103]  Without God there is no explanation for the universe.
[104]  What God wants is a Person, not some thing.
[105]  Notice these verses in Romans 8: "And those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
[106]  But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.
[107]  But if any one has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.
[108]  And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.
[109]  But if the Spirit of Him Who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He Who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit Who indwells you."
[110]  In verse 9, however, it says that the Spirit of God dwells in you and that one must have the Spirit of Christ to be of Him.
[111]  CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX CHRIST IN THE FOUR FOCAL BOOKS Scripture Reading: Gal 1:13-16a; 2:20a; 4:19; Col 2:2, 6-9; 3:4, 11; Phil 1:19-21a; 3:7-8; Eph 3:8-11, 17a, 19b
[112]  These four books that are arranged together in our New Testament Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians are the heart of God's revelation.
[113]  They tell us that Christ and the church are the focal point of the divine revelation.
[114]  The Apostle Paul, through whom this mystery has been revealed, tells us that until the New Testament economy this mystery was hidden in God Eph 1:9 .
[115]  In his letter to the Galatians, Paul speaks of his experience of having the Son revealed to him.
[116]  Then in 2:20 he tells how he has experienced Christ living in him: "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me."
[117]  Christ was revealed to him and then was living in him.
[118]  A further development is indicated in 4:19, where he says, "My children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you."
[119]  Ephesians deals with the issue of a life which lives Christ.
[120]  This book tells us that the church is the Body of Christ and that it is the fullness of Him who fills all in all Eph 1:22-23 .
[121]  If a little piece of flesh is taken from one part of our body and grafted onto another, within a few days the graft will become part of the flesh in the new location.
[122]  He bowed his knees unto the Father, "That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God" vv.
[123]  CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN THE GOOD LAND AND THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gal 3:14; 4:6; 5:16-18, 25; 6:18; Eph 1:13, 17; 2:18-22; 3:5, 16-17a; 4:4, 23, 30; 5:18; 6:17-18a; Phil 1:19-20; 2:1; Col 3:16; 1 Cor 5:7; 10:4; Col 1:12; 2:6; 3:11; Eph 3:8
[124]  There may be a bountiful spread on the dining table, a sampling of the riches of America.
[125]  It is another matter, however, for those riches to be realized by us in our being.
[126]  The same is true with regard to our enjoyment of Christ as the good land.
[127]  "For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father" Eph 2:18 .
[128]  "Through Him" means through the Son; but until we add "in one Spirit," our access is somewhat theoretical.
[129]  Verses 21 and 22 go on to tell us that in Christ "all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in Whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit."
[130]  "And receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God" Eph 6:17 .
[131]  According to the Greek grammar, the word "which" in this verse refers to Spirit, not to sword.
[132]  In Colossians the stress is not on the Spirit but on the Word.
[133]  Colossians 3:16 says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly."
[134]  Are we enjoying Christ as the Passover, yet still in Egypt?
[135]  CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT TWO LIVES GRAFTED INTO ONE Scripture Reading: Rom 6:5, 8; 7:4; 9:21, 23-24; 11:17, 24; 12:5 THE CREATOR AND THE CREATURE
[136]  The common concept is that God is the Creator and man is the creature.
[137]  God is the Lord of the heavens and the earth.
[138]  Grafting is one picture of this union between God and us.
[139]  Another illustration is given in Romans 7, where we are considered a wife and the Lord Jesus the husband.
[140]  "So that, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you might marry another, even Him Who has been raised from among the dead, that we might bear fruit to God" v. 4 . As the wife, we had a former husband, our old man.
[141]  It was at the time we believed and were baptized.
[142]  Romans 6:3 says, "Or are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?"
[143]  When we were baptized, we were baptized into the Lord Jesus in spirit and were identified with Him.
[144]  When Paul says, "We have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death," he is saying that in the place where we were cut, we were grafted into the Lord.
[145]  Rather, we have been grafted into Him in the likeness of His death and have grown together with Him all at the same time.
[146]  CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE TWO SPIRITS JOINED AS ONE Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26a; 2:7; Zech 12:1b; John 3:6; 7:39; 14:17; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Tim 4:22a; Rom 8:2, 16, 4; 1 Thes 5:17,19; Eph 6:18 LIMITED BY OUR NATURAL CONCEPTS
[147]  When we read the Bible, it is easy for us to understand and even experience those things which fit our natural concept.
[148]  If, for example, we read about how our environment perfects us, how tribulations make us patient, we can easily accept such a thought and apply it in our living.
[149]  It is another matter, however, when we come to the matter of God and man being organically mingled, as in grafting.
[150]  We may feel we understand that we need to live such a grafted life, but when it actually comes down to our everyday experience, the truth is that we have not touched even the border of such a life.
[151]  In John 3:36 we are told: "He who believes in the Son has eternal life."
[152]  It was so that one day man might be grafted into God.
[153]  In Zechariah 12:1 the Lord is described as the One who "stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him."
[154]  Man is ready, because of his having been created with a spirit, to be joined to God.
[155]  God, now that He has been through the process we have described, is ready to be joined to man.
[156]  As soon as you confess that you need Him, He will come in. You may say only, "O Lord," very softly, and you will breathe Him in. Many can testify that something happened inside when they said "O Lord."
[157]  CHAPTER SIXTY THE TRIUNE GOD SATURATING THE TRIPARTITE MAN Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2a, 9-10, 6b, 11 SPIRIT AND LIFE
[158]  The relationship between God and man, as we have seen in the two previous messages, is a matter of life and of the spirit.
[159]  Your need is to turn on the switch, not study.
[160]  "You search the Scriptures," the Lord Jesus told the religious Jews, "and you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life" John 5:39-40 .
[161]  They spent time studying and searching the Scriptures from Genesis to Malachi, but they would not come to the One who could give them life.
[162]  John 14 clearly says that the Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son vv.
[163]  Frankly, this passage in Ephesians 5 troubled me for years.
[164]  From my experience it seemed to me that this word did not work.
[165]  If this is what God requires of us, why does He not enable us to do so?
[166]  CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE REGENERATION, SANCTIFICATION, TRANSFORMATION, CONFORMATION, AND GLORIFICATION Scripture Reading: Rom 8:15, 16; 15:16; 12:2a; 8:29, 30; 10:12; 8:4, 14
[167]  The matter of God's relationship with man is deep and mysterious.
[168]  The grafting of the divine life and the human life into one portrays the most intimate of relationships.
[169]  Do not think that God wants you to bow before Him, as though He were an idol.
[170]  He does not want you to think of Him as being on a lofty throne.
[171]  He wants to get off His throne and be in you.
[172]  Even if you live in a most humble abode, He wants to be there too, because you are there.
[173]  What He wants is that we receive Him; to drink Him is to receive Him.
[174]  In Catholicism only special "holy" people are called saints, meaning sanctified ones.
[175]  After we have been regenerated, the life of God works within us to make us different from those of the world.
[176]  As we are thus sanctified, we are changed metabolically.
[177]  The central revelation of the Bible is Christ as our life to complete God's purpose.
[178]  It is God's eternal plan to have a body of people to manifest Him.
[179]  For God to be expressed through man, He must enter into him and live within him.
[180]  This God, who thus becomes our life, is Christ, who is the Spirit.
[181]  The second commandment is for the believers: live Christ.
[182]  You may not consider that this is a serious matter.
[183]  I realized many years ago that it was a sin not to live Christ, but my sense was not very strong.
[184]  Yes, you have changed since you came into the church life.
[185]  CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE LIVE CHRIST ONLY Scripture Reading: Col 2:6, 8; Gal 5:4; John 5:39-40 THE TREE OF LIFE
[186]  Science, philosophy, religion, and law are all substitutes for Christ.
[187]  You may touch Him occasionally when you pray, and you may live Him part of the time when you are in the meetings.
[188]  Many Christians use the Bible as a substitute for Christ.
[189]  The Lord Jesus told the Jewish religionists that they searched the Scriptures but would not come to Him for life John 5:39-40 .
[190]  The Bible is a testimony to Him, but apart from Him there is no life in the letter of the Word.
[191]  The book of Colossians deals with the problems that arose in the church at Colosse over the matter of culture.
[192]  CHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:4, 6b, 14; Gal 5:25; Rev 22:14, 17; Eph 6:18; Rev 1:10a; 1 Thes 5:17, 19 THE ULTIMATE REVELATION OF THE BIBLE
[193]  After incarnation, God Himself lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years.
[194]  He then went to the cross and passed through death.
[195]  He was resurrected and became the life-giving Spirit.
[196]  Rather than imagining what might happen later, stay in fellowship with the Lord.
[197]  "Lord, You are the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.
[198]  CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE GOD'S MYSTERY AND GOD'S ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Col 2:2b, 9; Heb 1:3a; John 1:1, 14, 18; Col 1:25-27; 2 Cor 3:17; Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 GOD EXPLAINED AND EXPRESSED
[199]  If we want to know God, then, we must know Christ.
[200]  God is true and living, but He is mysterious.
[201]  The Word was in the beginning, the Word was with God, and the Word was God v. 1 . How could the Word be God? How could the Word become flesh v. 14 ? In our mentality the Word is one thing, God is something else, and the flesh is another thing.
[202]  Paul tells us that his ministry was to complete the word of God Col 1:25 .
[203]  The Old Testament foretold the coming of Christ, the Gospels presented Him to us, and the Acts spoke further of Him.
[204]  The stewardship given to Paul concerned "the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations, but now has been manifested to His saints; to whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory" vv.
[205]  In my early Christian years I loved the Lord, but I was not taught about Christ being in me.
[206]  With all my studying and instruction, however, I was never taught "this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory" Col 1:27 .
[207]  CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX HOW THE LORD BECAME THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 1:14; 7:39; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17a; Rom 8:16; Phil 1:19b; Exo 30:22-26 MISTRANSLATION DUE TO MISUNDERSTANDING
[208]  In the New Testament there is a term which has been largely overlooked by biblical scholars and ordinary readers as well.
[209]  A number of times in the original Greek the definite article is used with the word Spirit.
[210]  Accurate translation requires more than a knowledge of the two languages in question.
[211]  Finally I realized that we have a clear picture of this distinction between the Spirit and the Spirit of God in the Old Testament.
[212]  To comprehend an abstract term like the Spirit is not easy; but by means of this picture I was greatly helped.
[213]  Notice the amounts and proportions of the spices: myrrh, 500 shekels; cinnamon, 250 shekels; calamus, 250 shekels; and cassia, 500 shekels.
[214]  If we combine the middle two measures, we have three units of 500 shekels.
[215]  CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN THE LIFE SUPPLY OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 9-11; Phil 1:19b; 2 Cor 3:6b
[216]  What kind of relationship does God want us to have with Him?
[217]  Some people reject the idea of God, or at least choose to ignore Him; they want nothing to do with Him.
[218]  Others, perhaps out of fear, want to know what they should do to please Him and how they should worship Him.
[219]  It tells us that we should worship and fear God, that we should do His will, and that we should do our best to please Him.
[220]  When we study the Bible, however, instead of seeing this plain word, we see only verses like this: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might" Deut 6:5 .
[221]  We see that God is to be worshipped and feared.
[222]  We see that we must labor for Him and that we must pay the price to live for Him.
[223]  To help our understanding, the Bible uses physical things to symbolize what is spiritual.
[224]  When I was a young Christian, I loved the Lord.
[225]  From reading certain spiritual books, I learned that I had been crucified with Christ, and that this was the key to my being victorious over my weaknesses.
[226]  My little mind, however, could not figure out how I could have been crucified with Him, when He died in Israel and I was in China thousands of miles away!
[227]  CHAPTER SIXTY-EIGHT GOD'S LAMPSTAND AND HIS LAMPS Scripture Reading: Exo 25:31a, 37a; Zech 4:2; Rev 1:12b, 20b; Prov 20:27; Rev 4:5b; 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:4, 6; Eph 6:18; 1 Thes 5:17, 19 A SYMBOL OF GOD'S TESTIMONY
[228]  The testimony of God is that He enters into man to be man's life and even his disposition.
[229]  THE SHAPING OF THE LAMPSTAND Gold Added to Us
[230]  We have not only been cleansed by the precious blood; we have also been regenerated.
[231]  There is no question regarding our having the gold within us.
[232]  It is through prayer that you can be turned to your spirit.
[233]  When you pray, you pray yourself into the spirit.
[234]  Your quarreling leaves you in darkness, but after some time you calm down and begin to pray a little.
[235]  CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE THE CHURCH BECOMING THE LAMPSTAND OF GOD Scripture Reading: Exo 25:31a, 37a; Zech 4:2; Rev 1:12b, 20b; Prov 20:27; Rev 4:5b THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF GOD
[236]  The main revelation of the Bible is the relationship between God and man.
[237]  What this relationship should be also occupies very much of human thought.
[238]  When man thinks of God, he thinks in terms of worshipping, fearing, and perhaps loving Him.
[239]  God, in man's concept, is far off in the heavens, dwelling in unapproachable majesty; the best mere man can do is to offer Him worship and try to please Him.
[240]  Though the lampstand is but one, there are six branches with seven lamps.
[241]  "But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit" 2 Cor 3:18, Gk.
[242]  . To be transformed into the Lord's image is from the Lord Spirit.
[243]  CHAPTER SEVENTY THE SPIRIT GOD'S ULTIMATE EXPRESSION Scripture Reading: Zech 3:9; 4:2, 6, 10a; Rev 1:4, 20b; 4:5b; 5:6; 22:17a SEVEN GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS
[244]  The last book of the Bible opens with a vision of seven golden lampstands.
[245]  As we are told, the lampstands are seven churches Rev 1:20 .
[246]  Let us take as an example a young sister, saved two or three years ago.
[247]  How do we who are men of clay become men of gold?
[248]  As we pray, repent, and confess to the Lord, the Spirit, this intensified Spirit, fills us.
[249]  As we look at someone, we infuse what we are into him.
[250]  CHAPTER SEVENTY-ONE THE SPIRIT OF MAN Scripture Reading: Zech 12:1; Gen 2:7; Prov 20:27 AN OVERLOOKED PART OF MAN
[251]  The matter of man's spirit is a most neglected subject.
[252]  Even among Christians there is an inadequate understanding and appreciation of the human spirit.
[253]  You may be tired of hearing me speak so much about the spirit.
[254]  You may be of the opinion that this is my only topic.
[255]  What is it like to let the spirit be our central government?
[256]  CHAPTER SEVENTY-TWO THE PRACTICAL EXPRESSION OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26-27; Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14; Isa 9:6; John 14:9; Eph 4:6; John 1:1 THE TRINITY
[257]  The Spirit, we have said, is the ultimate expression of God.
[258]  Such a statement touches the doctrine of the Trinity, one of the most mysterious doctrines in the Bible and one which has caused endless debate.
[259]  The Bible does reveal to us that God is three and yet also one.
[260]  Because the doctrine of the Trinity has the aspects of both the one and the three to explain, the disputes concerning it have not been resolved even after all these centuries.
[261]  Furthermore, the truth of the Bible cannot be comprehended by man's limited mentality.
[262]  Many of you are familiar with the Nicene Creed.
[263]  Those who have tritheistic leanings even though they would not admit they do for the most part subscribe to this creed.
[264]  God intends to work Himself into us to be both our life and our nature.
[265]  In order to accomplish this intention, God created a spirit within man.
[266]  Before the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, this life-giving Spirit, who is known in the New Testament as the Spirit, "was not yet" John 7:39 .
[267]  All of you who are saved, and especially who are in the Lord's recovery, must live according to the spirit.
[268]  If you want to know what your relationship to your wife should be, you read the Bible passages that deal with that subject.
[269]  "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace" Rom 8:6 .
[270]  The second help to staying in our spirit is to set the mind on the spirit.
[271]  The Word exhorts us to walk according to spirit Rom 8:4 .
[272]  As we read its pages, especially as we pray-read it in spirit, our spirit is nourished and developed.
[273]  CHAPTER SEVENTY-FOUR THE TESTIMONY OF THE GOLDEN LAMPSTAND Scripture Reading: Exo 25:31a, 37a; Zech 4:2, 6, 10b; 3:9; Rev 1:12b, 20b; 4:5; 5:6 GOD BECOMING OUR LIFE
[274]  In its pages we are told that God created man and that man must worship, love, and fear Him.
[275]  God, we are also told, became our Savior by delivering us from our sins and from perdition.
[276]  This golden lampstand has more to it than its outward appearance.
[277]  In the New Testament we come to the final picture of the golden lampstand.
[278]  After God saves us, He begins the work of transformation within us so that we may become a golden lampstand.
[279]  Christ, who is the Head of the church, is an individual golden lampstand; the church, His body, should correspondingly form a corporate golden lampstand.
[280]  When we are with the elders or in the meetings, we are in fear and trembling lest we display the clay.
[281]  But when we go home, how do we treat our wives?
[282]  CHAPTER SEVENTY-FIVE GOD'S TWOFOLD LAMPS Scripture Reading: Zech 12:1b; Prov 20:27; John 3:6; 2 Tim 4:22a; 1 Cor 6:17; Gal 5:25; Rom 8:4, 6; Rev 1:10a GOD AND MAN BECOMING ONE
[283]  The Bible reveals that the relationship God desires to have with man is that He and man become one.
[284]  It is not simply that the two are united together.
[285]  Rather, it is a oneness in which He becomes us and we become Him.
[286]  God is revealed in the Bible in a progressive way.
[287]  The different names for Him are gradually introduced, each indicating something further about Him.
[288]  In Genesis 1:1 He is called God, and we are told that He created the heaven and the earth.
[289]  In Genesis 2 the title Jehovah is added, and we are told that "Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul" v. 7, Heb .
[290]  Man's spirit is the lamp of the Lord, searching all the inward parts Prov 20:27 .
[291]  The Spirit of God is also God's lamp Rev 4:5 ; in fact, there is a sevenfold intensity to His shining.
[292]  This is the meaning of the "seven lamps of fire which are the seven Spirits of God."
[293]  The other aspect is that of the seven Spirits.
[294]  The Spirit of God today is the seven lamps, shining on us in an intensified way.
