   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the Generation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God not only revealed to Noah His need of an ark, but He also showed him the true situation of his generation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That generation was thoroughly exposed in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was also exposed to Noah through God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do you realize that most people, including many Christians, are not clear about the generation in which we live?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mankind has been veiled, "doped," and befuddled by all their lusts and evil pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even the so-called Christian churches are "doped" with the tide of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need God to come to us and reveal the genuine situation of this evil generation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I received this revelation nearly fifty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has shown me this evil generation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Concerning God's Intention</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God not only showed Noah the evil generation, but also revealed to him His intention.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God was and still is a God of purpose, and He can never be defeated in His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Years and years ago, God showed us His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many of you have read Brother Nee's own testimony in which he says that once he had a dream, meaning a revelation, in which he saw local churches raised up throughout China.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He saw churches raised up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What he called a dream was actually a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through him, many years ago, God showed us His need of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before the Lord comes back, He needs the churches to be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Otherwise, He will have no way to return.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is today's ark?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is God's way of terminating this evil generation and bringing in a new age?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God revealed the ark to Noah, and I must testify that God has revealed to us the need for the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The proper church life is the ark God needs today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church life is needed to terminate this generation and to bring in a new age.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ever since the day we received this revelation and stood up to declare it, we have been opposed, rejected, and condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While Noah told people what God had shown him and while he was building the ark, one hundred twenty years went by.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>During that time, Noah must have experienced a great deal of mocking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>People probably said to him, "Noah, what are you doing?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Are we all wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Are you the only one who is right?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Will everything that we do be judged and only the poor ark that you are building remain?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps Noah said, "Time will tell.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just wait.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the flood does not come after ten years, then perhaps it will come after fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If it does not come after fifty years, perhaps it will come after eighty years, or a hundred years, or a hundred nineteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Wait for another period of time, and the flood will come.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then you will realize that you need the ark, but it will be too late."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I strongly feel that we are in the same situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because of our firm testimony of the church according to God's revelation, a great deal of criticism and opposition have come out against us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some even say that we are a "cult."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How could we be a cult?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Honestly speaking, we believe the Holy Word in a pure way more than others do in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are not boasting, but simply speaking the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At least we are the same as others in believing the Holy Word, but not in a leavened way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do our dear critics have the assurance in their conscience that we are heretical?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every Christian has a conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They should listen to their conscience before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Listen to your conscience, please, and to what the Lord tells you in your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have asked the brothers here in the United States to tell me how a little man from China coming to the leading nation on earth can receive so much attention.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why do they pay attention to me?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They should simply forget about this little man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now from the west coast to the east there are rumors that Witness Lee is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even in 1964 when I went to Texas, some Christians tailed me like spies, following me from one place to another.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They took down what I said in my messages and, after twisting it, put it into print.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>So for ten years this small man has received much undeserved attention.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why do so many people pay attention to such a small man?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Because this small man has brought something to this country that disturbs the enemy and threatens the kingdom of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This testimony touches the territory of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I am a small man.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, from the depths of my being and from my pure conscience, I have the full assurance that this ministry is telling God's people what is today's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>America is a country of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There is no need for a man from the Orient to come here and speak to people about Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But there is the need for the dear saints in this country to see today's revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What does the Lord want to do today?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He does not simply want to save people, cause them to please God, teach them to call on the name of the Lord, enable them to live, beget, and walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What He wants to do today is more than all this.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He needs the churches to be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>His intention is to attract His lovers and seekers and gather them together to practice the proper church life as a testimony against the enemy's kingdom of darkness and as a preparation for His return.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is His intention today.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We all need to see this and build this "ark" to be today's Noah that we may terminate this generation and usher in the new age of the kingdom.</S>
