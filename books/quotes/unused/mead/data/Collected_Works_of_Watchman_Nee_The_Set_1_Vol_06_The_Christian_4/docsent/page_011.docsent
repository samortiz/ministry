   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Do not be deceived!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although you may speak about the excellency of Christ's humanity and the loftiness of His morality, only He is excellent and only He is lofty.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He and you have no relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank and praise God!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His Son did not come into the world to be our model.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God does not want us to imitate Christ with our own efforts so that we can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He sent His Son to die for us sinners and accomplish salvation on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not need to do anything by ourselves, because He has already accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We were sinners and the punishment we deserved was death and perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the punishment we deserved and the judgment we should have received have all been borne and received by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He died as sin in our place.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His death should have been ours, but He died in our place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we do not need to be punished for our sins anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"Surely He has borne our sicknesses, / And carried our sorrows / ...But He was pierced because of our transgressions; / He was crushed because of our iniquities; / The chastening for our peace was upon Him, / And by His stripes we have been healed" Isa 53:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are all sinners Rom 3:9-20 and deserve to die Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>18:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the Lord Jesus had come only to live for us, what could have saved us from our sins and delivered us from perdition?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Praise be to God that He did not come to live, but to die to die in our place, to bear our sins, and to receive the punishment due to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since we have Him as our Substitute, we do not need to die anymore!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We now have a way to salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we merely take Jesus as a model, intending to imitate Him as a means of salvation, we will end up perishing because there is no one on earth who can be like the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one can be saved by trying to imitate the Lord Jesus Gal 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who believe on His substitutional work shall be saved!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Acts 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word of God says, "Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness" Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose we go to the next house and see the parents and children there, and we asked them: "I heard that God is going to kill your firstborn tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Is it true?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They may answer, "Yes."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then I would ask again, "Why are you not afraid?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you realize that your firstborn will die soon?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They might answer, "We are not afraid because God has established a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He told us to prepare a lamb, kill it, and put the blood in a basin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Look!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The lamb has been killed, and the blood is in the basin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We Israelites are sinners, but the lamb has died on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, we have no fear."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But, let me tell you, at midnight, the firstborn of this family will still be killed by God's righteous wrath!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you act like those of that household, you will also perish!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Consider what the fault is of this man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first household lost their firstborn because of the absence of the blood of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the second household had a live lamb, slaughtered it, and shed its blood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why then should they perish?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They had the blood, but where was the blood?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Blood in the basin cannot save a man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Unless the blood of the lamb was sprinkled upon the side posts and the upper doorpost, it could not save them from death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are too many people like the ones in this household.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am afraid that these people may even be members of a church!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You have already heard the gospel of the Lord Jesus and also know that He died on behalf of the sinners of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You have read from the Bible and newspapers about the Lord Jesus' substitutional death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You have heard it from the pulpits.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But you have not come to God devotedly to receive His Son as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You know that the death of the Lord Jesus is a substitute for sinners; but you have not accepted Him as your personal Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You know that He died for the world, but do you believe that He died as sin for you?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In your mentality you have heard and known all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But you have not exercised your heart to believe and to trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You have heard and known, but you stop right there and do not go further to seek after God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You may be tired of hearing the teaching of the cross of the Lord Jesus, but you still have not mixed your faith with the Word preached to you Heb 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You are still a man of perdition!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although you have known, you have not believed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because you have not exercised your faith to receive the Lord Jesus as your personal Savior, your knowledge cannot help you at all, and you are still a man bound for hell!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Blood that is in the basin, but unapplied to the side posts and upper doorpost, cannot save you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the heart Rom 10:10 has not believed in the Lord Jesus, what good is the knowledge of the gospel in the head?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Salvation is not for the one who knows, but for the one who believes Acts 16:31; John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, let me ask you, has the upper doorpost of your heart been sprinkled with the precious blood?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Have you received the Lord Jesus in your heart as your Savior?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I am not asking about your age or family status, nor do I inquire about your education or health.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is only one question in the world, the most important one have you been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Have you received eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do you have the precious blood sprinkled upon the upper doorpost of your heart?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the most vital question!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Please answer God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Have you been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Blood in the basin, if not applied to the side posts and upper doorpost, is unable to save men.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although you know that the Lord Jesus has died for you, you will still perish if you do not exercise faith to apply His blood on the upper doorpost of your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The night of judgment is coming soon!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The sinner-judging angels of the Lord will soon come forth!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Eternity is now before you!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Eternal life and eternal death are both eternal!!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>My dear sinners, apply the blood now!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>What are you waiting for?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>While you are reading this line, pause for a few minutes and pray, "O God, have pity on me, a sinner!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I want to believe in the Lord Jesus as my personal Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Lord, forgive all my sins."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Lord will save you.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Only come quickly!</S>
