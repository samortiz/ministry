   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>John 12 and Luke 12 make it clear that there is an aspect of death which is only for the release of life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One alone had God's life, and He had to die in order to release His life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There was life in the grain of wheat, but it had to die in order to produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The death of the first grain is not to propitiate for the other grains but to produce them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Luke 12:50 says, "I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord was pressed, squeezed, and held up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What was the way out?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"I have a baptism to be baptized with."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord had to release Himself by death so that we could receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He said He came to send fire on the earth, that is, the fire of the Holy Spirit, so that all might have His Spirit in them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is not only with us but in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is another aspect of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the eating of the Passover lamb, the blood was for God and the flesh was for the household.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The blood was not to be eaten; it was for God to see.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But under the blood we need to take the flesh to prepare for the wilderness, so that we might have the strength to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Levitical offerings the flesh was always meant for the priests and Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John 6 puts the emphasis on the flesh, not on the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of the four instances in which the flesh and the blood are spoken of together, the flesh is spoken of first.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In these four instances, "eat" is spoken of first, not "drink"; the emphasis is on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The flesh in this chapter is something positive, "And the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world" John 6:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Bread is something related to the purpose of God, whereas blood is related to the remedy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We always talk about the Lord's supper as the breaking of bread, not as the drinking of the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The bread is always put before the wine because the bread is according to the purpose of God, whereas the wine is remedial.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The flesh includes the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If there had been no blood on the door, there could have been no flesh in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord said, "So he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To "live because of Me" means to live on account of Me. Do we know anything of this? Outside of Him we have no life, we cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is always trying to strip us and put us in difficult situations so that we can learn to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some of us have a keen mind and brain, and we have never learned the lesson that we cannot understand God's Word without God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He has to strip us of our wisdom, our mental powers, our keen brain, etc. Then we can learn to live by Him and because of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to take life from Him even for our body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We live because of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord drew the parallel, by saying, "As...I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God does not give us power to be strong; rather, the Lord's life in us makes us strong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Difficulties multiply for the sole purpose of stripping us of our own resources.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we are put into hopeless situations, we ask for the situations to be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the Lord wants us to learn, "My grace is sufficient for you" 2 Cor 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our grace is not sufficient, but "My" grace is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul was always weak.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord has to bring us to a place where we say, "Lord, I simply cannot exist."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A brother once said, "The Lord is always trying to knock the bottom out from under me."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through one experience after another we learn to live by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Lord puts us into the most difficult situations, we may try to meet them, but eventually we are brought to the place where we cannot do anything about them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our attitude should be, "I cannot; therefore, I am not going to try.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I refuse to do anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Lord, You must do it for me."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this way we can learn to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is He who has done it, and as we multiply this experience, daily it becomes our life attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's life is not merely a parcel or a sum of capital.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First John 5:12 says, "He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The life is in the Son and nowhere else; it cannot be possessed apart from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we have a proper relationship to the living Lord, His life will become ours automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are people who believe that all of our salvation and holiness lie in the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some go further and believe that God will deliver us from the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There are others who feel that we must consecrate ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must have the blood, our old man must be dealt with on the cross, and we must give ourselves over to the Lord to produce in us what He wants.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our attitude should be, "Lord, I trust You to create in me whatever I need and to be whatever I need."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Faith brings Him in. Faith says, "Lord, I cannot do it; be to me whatever I need."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>First Corinthians 1:30 tells us that Christ Jesus is made unto us all that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is our patience, etc. God does not give us a dose of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Holiness is simply the Lord living His holy life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The secret is not trying but trusting.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The difference between trying and trusting is the difference between heaven and hell!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We say, "Lord, I cannot; therefore, I will not try.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I trust You to do this."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is drawing our life from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is not passivity, because it involves active cooperation and faith.</S>
