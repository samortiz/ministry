BEING FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>Following this, Paul goes on to speak in Ephesians 4 about the functions of the gifted persons. On the one hand, we all are one in the Spirit, in the Triune God, in the saving faith, and in all the matters in verses 4 through 6. On the other hand, though, the ministries of the gifted persons seem to be different. There are the apostles&rsquo; ministry, the prophets&rsquo; ministry, the evangelists&rsquo; ministry, and the ministry of the shepherds and teachers. There are at least these four categories of ministries. Nevertheless, the purpose of all the ministries is still one. All the different ministries are for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ. Consider the situation today. Do the evangelists care for the Body? Many evangelists forget about the Body and neglect the Body; they are only for evangelism. This is why there are divisions today. A prevailing evangelist with his prevailing preaching may spontaneously form a division. Likewise, a great teacher may live and work only for his teaching and not for the Body, and eventually a division may come out of his teaching. Instead of being for the building of the Body, these ministries often create divisions.</p>
<p>We should apply all these things to ourselves. If many of us go out to work for the Lord, some may be more evangelical, but others will care more for teaching. It may be that the evangelists will form something for their evangelism, and the teachers will form something for their teaching, both neglecting the building of the Body. We need to see the vision that all the different ministries are for one purpose. If someone preaches the gospel, he should not keep the result, the fruit, of his preaching in his own hand. He must keep his own hand away from the result of his preaching and let the fruits of his preaching be for the building up of the church. Likewise, regardless of how much we help people by our teaching, we should not keep the result of our teaching in our hand. We must let the fruits of our teaching be for the local church. This is not a small matter.</p>
<p>It is a shame to say that even among us there is a secret trend of certain gifted persons keeping the result of their work in their hand. This is not for the building up; rather, it is a tearing down. In order to practice the church life, we must be clear about this. In the same way, all the saints should not be for any one ministry. They must be for the church. Someone may say, &ldquo;I have received much help from this teacher. I am for him.&rdquo; However, if you are for this teacher, he should not receive you in that way. Some in Corinth said, &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; but Paul answered by saying that he was for them (1 Cor. 3:4, 21-22). We should not be for any one person or his ministry. Rather, we are for the church where we live. We should forget about any minister who does something for his own ministry.</p>
<p>However, we should not blame the gifted persons. We need to blame ourselves, the congregation. It is too easy for people to be the followers of an idol. To say, &ldquo;I am of Paul; I appreciate him&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Apollos,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Peter&rdquo; is fleshly (1 Cor. 1:12; 3:4). We must not say that we are for someone. We should say, &ldquo;I am for the church in my locality.&rdquo; If the saints are clear about this, no one will be able to create a division. If anyone tries to create a division, he will be by himself. No one will follow him. Rather, we will all go along with the local church. We may be kind to that brother and say, &ldquo;Brother, we do appreciate your ministry. Praise the Lord! However, we are not for your ministry. We are for the local church. Moreover, we believe that you also know that your ministry is for the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When people said, &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; Paul was not happy. However, today people like to hear this kind of statement. If someone would tell us, &ldquo;I am for your ministry,&rdquo; we may be very happy, but if they would say, &ldquo;I am not for your ministry; I am for the local church,&rdquo; we may be disappointed. To be this way is shameful. Nevertheless, we must blame ourselves because it is too easy for us to follow a ministry. We all have to share the responsibility of the wrongdoing. To receive a ministry is right, but we are not for the ministry, and we do not follow that ministry. We are for the local church. From now on, wherever we are, we must be only for the local church. Then no gifted person will be able to create a division among us.</p>
<p>The reason there is nearly no real practice of the church life today is simply that people are not clear about these points. On the one hand, some always keep something other than the oneness of the Spirit. On the other hand, others too easily follow certain ministries. As a result, there is no church life. These two items alone are sufficient to annul and destroy the church life. First, we should not have anything within us that divides. We must keep only one thing, the oneness of the Spirit. Second, we appreciate all the helpful ministries, but we must not be for any one of these ministries. We must be for the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING BUILT UP<br />
NOT DIRECTLY BY THE GIFTED ONES<br />
BUT BY ALL THE PERFECTED MEMBERS</h2>
<p>The gifted persons do not build up the church directly. On the one hand, the Lord told us in Matthew 16:18, &ldquo;I will build My church,&rdquo; but on the other hand, even Christ the Head does not build His church directly. The Head builds the church through the gifted persons&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Likewise, the gifted persons also should not and do not build up the church directly. Ephesians 4:11 mentions the different gifted persons. Then verse 12 tells us that all these gifted persons are not for the building up of the church directly but are for the perfecting of the saints. If you are a gifted person, you should not build up the church directly. Your responsibility is to perfect all the local brothers, who build up the church directly. What you need to do is perfect others, train them, qualify them, enrich them, empower them, and teach them. Then let them do the work of building. Your duty is not to build up the church directly. Your duty is to perfect the saints. Let the perfected saints do the building work directly.</p>
<p>This is a very important matter. Many times I do not do much in the meetings because I do not want to give the impression that the meetings are my business. They are not my business. When I come to the meetings, I come as a guest. The saints are the host, so they need to serve, and I simply enjoy. I must say this because of our background in Christianity. In the Catholic Church there are priests, in the denominations there are ministers or pastors, and among the Brethren there are responsible brothers. We may compare these different persons to styles of clothes. I may put on Western clothes today, Japanese clothes another day, and traditional Chinese clothes the next, but I am still the same person. Likewise, whether we call certain ones pastors, ministers, or responsible brothers, they are the same kind of clergy. We should not have any clergy or laity among us.</p>
<p>For the past two years we also have had leading brothers. All the leading ones in the meeting must be careful about the way they act, not giving people the impression that they are taking the lead. Here again there are two responsible parties. On one side, the leading ones may carelessly act in a way that gives people the impression that they are taking the lead. On the other side, many of the dear brothers and sisters are weak and not right in their spirit, and they also have a wrong concept, coming to the meetings in a passive way, not in an active way. However, now we need to be clear. In order to practice the church life, the gifted persons should not build up the church directly. What they must do is perfect the saints and let them build up the church directly. This is the third aspect for the practice of the church life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Practice, and Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
