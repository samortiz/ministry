<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Last Adam Becoming a Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>Paul goes on in 1 Corinthians 15 to say that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (v. 45b). In incarnation Christ became flesh for redemption (John 1:14, 29). Then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit for the impartation of life (John 10:10b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Refreshed in Our Spirit</H2><P>In 1 Corinthians 16 Paul pointed out that certain faithful ones refreshed both his spirit and the spirits of all the saints (vv. 17-18). Paul did not say that they refreshed his mind, emotion, or loving heart. He said that they refreshed his spirit. You cannot find this point anywhere else in the Bible. This is because in this book the apostle's intention is to tell us that we have to always be in the spirit. If we are not in the spirit, it is impossible for us to experience Christ and have the church life.</P><P>In 1 Corinthians Paul did not say as much about himself as he did in 2 Corinthians. Brother Watchman Nee said that 2 Corinthians may be considered as an autobiography of Paul. But still in his first Epistle you can see that he is a person behaving, acting, working, moving, and having his being in the spirit. Chapters four, five, and seven show that Paul was such a person, a person absolutely in the spirit. Then in the last chapter he said the brothers who came to him refreshed his spirit. Paul cared for his spirit first. He was a person altogether in the spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A BOOK FOR THE CHURCH</H2><P>We have to remember that 1 Corinthians is not a book for the individual believers, but a book for the church. We have to pay attention to the second verse of this book, in which Paul addresses the church of God in Corinth with all those who call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in every place. It is not and but with all those who call upon the Lord's name. If Paul had used the word and, that would mean that all the saints were standing on the same level as the church. But Paul used the word with, indicating that the saints belong to the church. If we say, "The parents came with the children," this means that the children belong to the parents. This book was written to the church with all the saints. This means that all the saints need a church with which they can be identified.</P><P>This book is full of a church concept. All that was written in it is with a church-consciousness. It was not a book written to an individual, but to the local church with all the saints. If we want to know this book, we have to be in the church. If we are not in a local church, we do not have the proper standing, qualification, or position to understand it. If we want to see a particular thing, we have to be positioned at the proper angle, and the proper angle for us to understand this book is the local church.</P>
