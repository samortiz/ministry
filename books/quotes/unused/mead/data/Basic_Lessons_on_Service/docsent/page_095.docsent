   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SELF AND THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is a difference between the self and the flesh, but most Christians do not realize this or care for this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. The Flesh Being</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>the Corrupted and Transmuted Body</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At man's fall his body was corrupted, and then it was transmuted, changed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Galatians 5 speaks of the lusts of the flesh v. 16b and of the passions of the flesh v. 24 . The lusts and the passions are the evil things of our fallen body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The flesh is the corrupted and transmuted body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the most proper definition of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>B. The Self Being the Fallen and Rebellious Soul</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The soul was created by God but it became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When it became fallen, it became rebellious toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Matthew 16:26 the Lord said, "What shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Luke 9:24-25, soul-life is replaced with himself, indicating that our soul-life, our soul, is our self.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have seen that God created a body for man, but He did not create the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The body became the flesh by being corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the same way, the soul was created by God, but the self was not.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The soul became the self by becoming fallen and rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The source of the flesh is the body, and the source of the self is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>WHEN THE FLESH DOMINATES THE SELF,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE SELF BECOMES AN EVIL PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Romans 7:18-21 Paul shows how the flesh dominates the self and how the self tries unsuccessfully to overcome the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the flesh, which is full of lusts and passions, dominates the self, the self becomes an evil person doing evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>WHEN THE SELF SUBDUES THE FLESH,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE SELF BECOMES A "GOOD" PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some people are very strong in their will or in their character, so to some extent, but not altogether, they can control their flesh with its passions and lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Matthew 19 speaks of a rich young man who considered that he was good in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He came to the Lord and asked Him what good thing he could do to inherit eternal life v. 16 . When the Lord told him to keep the commandments, he said that he had kept them v. 20 . No doubt, he was a "good" person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This shows us that when the self subdues the flesh, the self becomes a "good" person.</S>
