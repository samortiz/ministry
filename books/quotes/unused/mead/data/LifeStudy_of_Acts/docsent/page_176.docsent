   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD SOVEREIGNLY DELIVERING PAUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND TRANSFERRING HIM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord knew what was in Paul s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He also knew that Paul was faithful but was not able to help the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead of helping it, Paul was trapped in it by compromising with it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the Lord used the uproar described in 21:27 23:15 to rescue Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Jews seized him and were seeking to kill him 21:30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But a commander of the Roman cohort intervened, laid hold of him, ordered him to be bound with chains, and inquired concerning the situation 21:31-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was not the commander s intention to protect Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was simply fulfilling his duty to maintain order in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He could not allow such an uproar to continue.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, he intervened, and through his intervention Paul was rescued.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, the commander s intervention was Paul s protection from the plot of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through the intervention of the Roman commander, Paul was given the opportunity to defend himself before the rioting Jews 21:40 22:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Following that, he was bound by the Romans 22:22-29 and defended himself before the Sanhedrin 22:30 23:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because of the plot of the Jews 23:12-15 , Paul was transferred to the Roman governor in Caesarea 23:16 24:27 , where he remained in custody for quite a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Apart from God s sovereignty in using the Roman commander to protect Paul, he would have been killed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God sovereignly delivered Paul out of that threatening situation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In His sovereignty the Lord caused Paul to have a dispensational transfer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul was in favor of such a transfer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He came to Jerusalem with the positive intention and strong purpose to help the believers there to experience this dispensational transfer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, instead of helping them, he himself was eventually trapped in a situation of mixture and compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul must have been unhappy when he was in the temple with the four Nazarites, for he did not have a way out of the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul must have regretted joining those who had the Nazarite vow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He might have regretted going to the temple instead of staying in the house of Mnason with his co-workers, keeping himself away from the attention of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul, however, joined himself to the Nazarites and went with them into the temple, where he was seen by Jews from Asia and seized by them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Their intention was to kill him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Who except the Lord could help the situation?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord was sovereign and helped Paul to have a complete transfer out of the Judaic mixture in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a result of what happened in Jerusalem, Paul was taken to Caesarea and was probably kept there for two years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may infer that those two years were a profitable and an excellent time for Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What do you think Paul did during those years in Caesarea?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What did he do while he was being kept from both his work and from the trouble caused by the plotting Jews?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He may have been preparing to write the crucial books of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>While Paul was in custody in Caesarea, he might have considered putting into writing those materials that would complete his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus far, Paul had written only six of his fourteen Epistles: Romans, Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and 1 and 2 Thessalonians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although these books are basic, they are not as crucial as Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians and Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon were written, these four crucial books were written after Paul s two-year period of custody in Caesarea.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just as Paul s time in Arabia had much to do with the early part of his ministry, so the two years in Caesarea had a great deal to do with Paul s upcoming writings in the completion of his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to be impressed with the Lord s sovereignty in completing Paul s transfer from the old dispensation to the new.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Praise the Lord that such a transaction took place!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In His sovereignty and wisdom, the Lord carried out such a complete transfer with Paul, and this transfer is fully recorded in the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Having this record in our hands, we can now see a full pattern concerning the complete transfer from the Old Testament economy to God s New Testament economy.</S>
