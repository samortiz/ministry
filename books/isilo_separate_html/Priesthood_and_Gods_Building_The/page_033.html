TO THE PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>God wants man to enjoy and express Christ. This is fulfilled through Christ as our food, our inward supply, and by Christ as our garments, our outward expression. This expression is related to His dwelling place. The building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place depends upon the priesthood. The building materials of gold and precious stones that were worn by the priests signify the building materials of the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is built with gold and adorned with precious stones (Rev. 21:18-19). Similarly, on the breastplate of the priests, precious stones were enclosed in settings of gold (Exo. 28:11). The twelve precious stones enclosed in settings of gold were one item that signifies all the people of God. This shows that the priests wore the building of God and that the building of God was upon the priests. Without the priesthood, there is no building of God.</p>
<p>The priesthood is crucial because the enjoyment and expression of God depend upon the priesthood. Furthermore, the building of God as the dwelling place of God is the priesthood. From the beginning to the end of the Bible, we see that God wants to gain a priesthood. All the glorious items in the Bible are related to the priesthood. If we are willing to come forward to God, fellowship with God, live before God, and allow God to flow through us, we will enjoy the riches of Christ and express the glory of Christ as priests in a full way. In this way we will bear the testimony of the church, and the building of the church will be realized among us. We need to see that the Lord&rsquo;s purpose in the universe will be fulfilled only by a group of people who enjoy and express Christ in a genuine and full way. Such a group of people, as God&rsquo;s corporate priesthood, will uphold the church, bear the testimony of the church, and bring in the building of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BURNING THE INCENSE,<br />
LIGHTING THE LAMPS, AND SINGING&mdash;<br />
THE PRIESTLY MINISTRY</h2>
<p>Concerning the ministering of the priests in the Holy Place, Exodus 27:20-21 says, &ldquo;You shall command the children of Israel to bring to you pure oil of beaten olives for the light, to make the lamps shine continually. In the Tent of Meeting, outside the veil which is before the Testimony, Aaron and his sons shall maintain it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah; it shall be a perpetual statute to be observed throughout their generations by the children of Israel.&rdquo; Then 30:6-8 says, &ldquo;You shall put it before the veil that is over the Ark of the Testimony, before the expiation cover that is over the Testimony, where I will meet with you. And Aaron shall burn on it fragrant incense; every morning when he dresses the lamps he shall burn it. And when Aaron sets up the lamps at twilight, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations.&rdquo; These two portions show that the function of the priests also included burning incense and lighting lamps in the tabernacle.</p>
<p>Some people may think that the priests only offered sacrifices. When the children of Israel brought their oxen, goats, or firstfruits to God, for example, the priests would offer these things on their behalf to God. The process of preparing these offerings involved &ldquo;rough&rdquo; things, such as killing oxen and sheep, but the priests also attended to &ldquo;finer&rdquo; matters, such as burning incense and lighting lamps. The process of burning incense in the Holy Place was not as &ldquo;rough&rdquo; as the process of preparing the sacrifices. In the Holy Place the priests also wore a garment with bells sewn onto the hem so that if the priests walked too fast, the bells would sound out. These bells restricted them from walking in a loose way. The priests also had to light the lamps. The Bible says that the priests burned incense before God while they were lighting and dressing the lamps (vv. 7-8). They could not burn incense in darkness; they had to do it in the light, in a bright place.</p>
<p>A few portions in the New Testament speak of the significance of the priests burning incense. Luke 1:8-10 says, &ldquo;While he [Zachariah] served as priest in the order of his course before God, according to the custom of the priestly service, the lot fell to him to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And all the multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of the burning of incense.&rdquo; Please note that while Zachariah was serving God by burning the incense, people were praying outside; he was not serving by himself.</p>
<p>Revelation 5:8 says, &ldquo;The four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each having a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which bowls are the prayers of the saints.&rdquo; <em>Which bowls</em> is a translation of a relative pronoun that is in the Greek text. It literally means &ldquo;this,&rdquo; without specifying what &ldquo;this&rdquo; is. Consequently, translators of the Bible have argued over the object of this word. Some think that the pronoun refers to the incense, whereas others maintain that it refers to the bowls. According to the Bible, this pronoun should refer to the bowls of incense. The prayers of the saints are not the incense but the bowls; the incense is Christ Himself. Only the resurrected Christ is the incense. The bowls that contain the incense refer to the fact that the saints&rsquo; prayers are full of the fragrance of the resurrected Christ.</p>
<p>Verses 3 through 5 of chapter 8 say, &ldquo;Another Angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and much incense was given to Him to offer with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the Angel before God. And the Angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar and cast it to the earth; and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake.&rdquo; <em>Another Angel</em> means there was &ldquo;another Messenger,&rdquo; indicating that this messenger is different from any other angel. Many Bible scholars agree that <em>another Angel</em> refers to the Lord Jesus. The censer in this passage refers to the prayers of the saints, and the incense added to their prayers denotes that the fragrance of the resurrected Christ is added to the prayers of the saints, ascending with their prayers and being accepted by God. The result of these prayers being heard is thunders, voices, lightnings, and an earthquake. The significance of the priests burning the incense before God is the addition of the resurrected Christ as fragrance to their prayers that are offered to God.</p>
<p>In addition to burning incense and lighting lamps, the priestly service involved the joyful matter of songs. Although the Pentateuch does not speak of the priests singing, the matter of singing was added to the priestly and Levitical services during the time of David. Although David was a king, he put on the ephod, the garment worn over the priestly tunic with its priestly characteristics, when he received the Ark, and he danced (2 Sam. 6:14). He also sang before God (ch. 22). Later, when he arranged the divisions of the priests, he asked the Levites to sing before God according to the divisions. First Chronicles 6:31-33 says, &ldquo;These are they whom David set over the service of song in the house of Jehovah after the Ark was at rest. And they ministered before the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting with singing until Solomon built the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem; and they attended to their service according to their order. And these are they who attended and their sons.&rdquo; This refers to the singing service of the tribe of Levi before the tabernacle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, &ldquo;David and the leaders of the army set apart for the service some of the sons of Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun to prophesy with lyres, harps, and cymbals...And the number of them, with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Jehovah, all of whom were skillful, was two hundred eighty-eight. And they cast lots for their duties, all alike, the small as well as the great, the teacher as well as the student&rdquo; (25:1, 7-8). As a group, the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun were set apart to minister in the tribe of Levi. This portion of the Word speaks of three characteristics of this group of singers. First, the group was trained to sing to Jehovah. Whether or not some had a natural ability to sing, everyone had to be trained. This should be a great encouragement to those who think that they cannot sing. Second, the number spoken of in verse 7 is very particular, and it relates to the New Jerusalem. Two hundred eighty-eight is two times one hundred forty-four. The measure of the wall of the New Jerusalem is one hundred forty-four cubits (Rev. 21:17). One hundred forty-four is twelve times twelve. The singers were divided into twenty-four divisions with twelve in each division. This equals two hundred eighty-eight, which is exactly two times twelve times twelve. Third, everyone was divided into divisions that contained &ldquo;the small as well as the great, the teacher as well as the student.&rdquo; In these groups some were instructing, and others were learning to sing. In the church meetings there should be some teaching and some learning how to sing. First Chronicles 25:1 speaks of prophesying, and this shows that they sang the Word of God. Perhaps they turned the Word of God into hymns. The word <em>prophesying</em> in the Bible does not necessarily mean foretelling future events; it also means speaking on behalf of someone. Hence, the hymns that the Levites sang were expressions of the Word of God. Although the priests did other things, such as setting the bread of the Presence before God (Exo. 25:30), burning incense, lighting lamps, and singing were central and fine elements of the service of the priesthood.</p>
<p>Today these three elements of service apply to us as New Testament priests. Burning incense refers to prayer and fellowship with the Lord, lighting lamps refers to being enlightened by God through the reading of the Word, and singing refers to expressing God. We should not think of singing as merely a matter related to music; it is a means of expression. In Christianity singing is a matter only of choirs and music, but in the Bible it is a matter of expressing the grace in our hearts (Col. 3:16); that is, it is a matter of the Spirit flowing from our spirit to express the grace, virtues, and glory of the Lord. Singing is a speaking for God, an expressing from within of the things that we have been touched with by God.</p>
<p>If we function as priests by burning incense and lighting lamps, our situation will be full of glory, and if we remain in the Holy of Holies, touching the throne of grace and allowing living water to flow through us, we will be filled with God. This will fill us with new wine in the meetings, causing us to sing and prophesy with the utterances of God. This glorious situation will be music in God&rsquo;s ears. By praying and reading the Bible, we will be filled with God inwardly and spontaneously speak and sing. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks (Matt. 12:34); hence, singing is a spontaneous issue of burning incense and lighting lamps.</p>
<p>Regrettably, this is not the case in Christianity today. In revival meetings organized by Christian groups, hardly anyone will pray when the host asks for a volunteer, even though hundreds or thousands of people are present. For every meeting, arrangements have to be made ahead of time for a pastor to read the Bible or an elder to pray. The audience is completely silent, because no one is filled with God inwardly; consequently, they have nothing to say. They are listening with their ears, but their spirit is inactive. When they are asked to pray, they answer, &ldquo;No, no, I am not a pastor.&rdquo; This is a pitiful situation.</p>
<p>A brother once told me that he and two other brothers visited a patient in the hospital. At the end of the visit, they had some prayer together. When a friend of the patient saw them praying, he asked, &ldquo;Are you a pastor? How do you know how to pray so well?&rdquo; This shows that it is a common thought among Christians that only pastors know how to pray.</p>
<p>However, even we often come to a prayer meeting with a deflated spirit. When we are not filled with God, we do not want to speak, and everyone remains in a dry and deadened condition. If several minutes pass in silence, the responsible brothers are left with no choice but to pick a hymn. Then everyone sings the hymn with a weak voice, and after the singing, a responsible brother will offer a prayer, and then another responsible brother will stand up to announce items for prayer. Even if there is some prayer after this announcement, the Spirit is not touched. This causes the brothers to say, &ldquo;Our condition is not good because we are short of speakers. If we had someone to minister the word in our prayer meeting, it would be wonderful.&rdquo; In fact, however, our condition is related to our lack of function as priests.</p>
<p>May we be delivered from such a desolate state, knowing that the Lord&rsquo;s blood has been shed and the veil has been split. Through His blood we can enter through the veil into the Holy of Holies and touch the throne of grace (Heb. 10:19-20; 4:16). His Spirit indwells us, and we should let Him flow through us. We need to exercise to serve as a priest. We need to burn the incense before God, adding the resurrected Christ as the fragrance to our prayers and offering them to God. Moreover, every time we draw near to God, we must light the lamps by reading the Bible.</p>
<p>Every time we fellowship with God, we should be in the light, because God is light. The Bible is the word of God, and the word of God is God Himself. When we touch the word of God, we touch God Himself. Since God is light, the word of God is also light. Whenever we read the Bible in an exercised way, we are filled with light, and we can touch God through prayer. If we read the Bible and pray in this way, we will surely touch Christ, enjoy Christ, absorb Christ, and gain Christ in a full way. Then when we come to a meeting, our mouth will speak out of the abundance of our heart. We will pray, praise, give thanks, and prophesy, fulfilling our priestly service by burning the incense, lighting the lamps, and singing.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
