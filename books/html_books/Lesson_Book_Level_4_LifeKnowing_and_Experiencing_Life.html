THREE GREEK WORDS FOR LIFE</h2><p>There are three Greek words denoting the English word life. One word is zoe, denoting the divine, eternal, uncreated and indestructible life of God. Every man should have this life in his God-created spirit. The second word is psuche denoting the God-created human soulish life. The third word for life is bios which is the God-created physical life of man. A saved person has all three kinds of life, but an unsaved person only has psuche and bios.<h2 class=head1>II. ONLY THE LIFE OF GOD BEING LIFE</h2><p>Although there are three types of life for man, yet only the life of God is really life. The other two lives, the psuche and bios, are merely created life. As such, they are weak and temporal. Only the life of God is divine, eternal and indestructible. It was there before all things and will be there after all things.<p>[First John 5:12 says, &#8220;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&#8217;&#8217; John 3:36 also says, &#8220;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life.&#8217;&#8217; These two scriptures tell us that unless man has the life of God, he does not have life. This shows us that in the eyes of God, only His life is life; beside that, no other life can be counted as life. Only the life of God is divine and eternal.]<h2 class=head2>A. The Life of God Being Divine</h2><p>Only the zoe life is divine. Both the psuche and bios life are not divine. [What does divine mean? Being divine means being of God, having the nature of God, or being transcendent and distinctive from all others. Only God is God, only God has the nature of God, and only God is transcendent and distinctive; therefore, only God is divine. The life of God is God Himself (later we shall consider this point), and since it is God Himself, it naturally has the nature of God.] Therefore, only the life of God is divine. When we have this life, we have the divine person of God.<h2 class=head2>B. The Life of God Being Eternal</h2><p>This life is eternal, hence, many verses have the term eternal life (John 3:15-16). [What does eternal mean? Eternal means uncreated, without beginning or ending, existing by itself and ever, unchangeably existing. Only God is uncreated; only He is &#8220;from eternity to eternity&#8217;&#8217; (Psa. 90:2, original text), that is, without beginning or ending.]<p>[A number of times the King James Version says everlasting life instead of eternal life, but this translation misses the mark.] The word &#8220;everlasting&#8217;&#8217; may convey to people that a person&#8217;s original (fallen) life will last forever. [The word &#8220;eternal&#8217;&#8217; denotes not only the duration of time, which is everlasting, without end, but also the quality, which is absolutely perfect and complete, without any shortage or defect. Such an expression emphasizes the eternal nature of the divine life, the life of the eternal God. This life is also eternal with respect to its sphere. Therefore, the word eternal denotes three things: time, space, and quality. As to the element of time, this life will last forever. As to space, to sphere, this life is vast, unlimited. As to quality, eternal life is perfect and complete, without defect or shortage. The sphere or field of eternal life encompasses the whole universe. Eternal life is so vast that it covers the entire field of life. Whatever is in the field of life is encompassed by this eternal life.]<h2 class=head2>C. The Life of God Being Indestructible</h2><p>This life is also indestructible. This life in Christ Jesus went through thirty-three and half years of suffering and mistreatment on the earth. It went into, through and out of death, which can destroy anyone. After that, it resurrected and ascended to the highest place of the universe. It not only is indestructible, it is victorious, conquering and glorious. This life is now in us. Hallelujah!<h2 class=head1>III. WE HAVE THIS LIFE AND CAN EXPERIENCE IT EVERY DAY</h2><p>Although this life is divine and eternal, it has come to humanity in time. It came in Jesus Christ to be our life. He said in John 10:10b, &#8220;I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&#8217;&#8217; Because of our sins, He had to die for our sins in order to obtain redemption for us. Then in resurrection, He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) to give life to us who believe. From then on, we have this life in us and we may experience this life daily.<h2 class=head2>A. The Experiences of This Life</h2><p>Our first experience of this life is regeneration. When we believe in the Lord through the hearing of the gospel, the life-giving Spirit begets us and regenerates us with this life in our spirit. This is a crucial fact related to us. We must see and not forget this fact. From this point, we have a life which is divine, eternal and indestructible. We may live a Christian life according to all God demands and fulfill God&#8217;s purpose, because this life is capable. The soul-life and the sinful flesh may still give us trouble every day, yet this life is able to overcome and express God in us every day all day. We must learn to experience this life every day to cause it to grow in us until maturity.<h2 class=head2>B. The Issues of This Life</h2><p>This life does not come into us merely to be in us. It issues in a Christian life that is godly, expressing all that God is, and is victorious over sin, the world, the flesh, the self, the natural life and individualism. It also bears fruit according to John 15, that is, to dispense this life into others through the preaching of the gospel. Then the church, according to God&#8217;s purpose and standard, will be built. Ultimately it will produce the New Jerusalem, the mingling of the processed Triune God and His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed tripartite man. The New Jerusalem will be in life, full of life and expressing life for eternity. Hallelujah!<h2 class=head2>C. The Maintenance of This Life</h2><p>Since this life is so wonderful and crucial to us Christians, we must endeavor to maintain and preserve this life at all cost. We must deal with all the things that hinder us from growing in this life. We also must apply all the life practices such as calling on the Lord, reading the word, praying, pray-reading, singing, fellowshipping, etc. to enjoy this life every day from morning to evening. Then we will be strong to experience this life in our daily life, overcoming all the negative situations in school and at home, thereby becoming proper students and children. We do not need to wait until we grow up or until the Lord returns to experience this life and grow. We may grow by maintaining this life today. Thus God&#8217;s eternal purpose, the building of His church, will be fulfilled by us (Eph. 4:16b).<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>What are the three words for life and their meanings?</li><li>What is the difference between &#8220;everlasting life&#8217;&#8217; and &#8220;eternal life&#8217;&#8217;?</li><li>Why is only the life of God life?</li><li>Find one or two verses for each kind of life.</li><li>Use some verses to show how we may experience and grow in this life today.</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Recovery Version, 1 John 1:2, note 3; John 10:11, note 1; Rom. 5:17, note 1; Heb. 7:16, note 1; 1 Pet. 1:3, note 4.</li><li>The Knowledge of Life, pp. 9-10.</li><li>Life-study of Hebrews, pp. 388-390.</li><li>Life-study of First John, pp. 33-34.</li></ol><h1 class=msg>Lesson Two</h1><h1 class=msg>LIFE BEING GOD HIMSELF</h1><h2 class=head2>Scripture Reading</h2><h1 class=scripture>John 14:6; 1 Tim. 3:16; John 1:4; 10:10; Col. 3:4; John 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:2</h1><h2 class=head2>Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Life being God Himself</li><li>Life being Christ</li><li>Life being the Holy Spirit</li><li>Life being God the Father in the Son as the Spirit flowing into us</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Text</h2><h2 class=head1>I. LIFE BEING GOD HIMSELF</h2><p>As a result of regeneration we all have this life and we must thank and praise Him for giving us this life. However, we must explore further to better understand this life, so that our experience will be correct and enriched. We must see that life is not something that is merely of God or that is given by God, but that it is God Himself.<p>[In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus says that He is life. After He said this, from verse 7 to 11, He made known to the disciples that He and God are one-and when He speaks this word, it is God speaking in Him. He is God become flesh; and He is God in the flesh (John 1:1, 14; 1 Tim. 3:16). When He says He is life, it is God who says God is life. Hence His words show us that life is the very God Himself.<p>Strictly speaking, when we receive life, we receive not the life of God, but God as life. Not only did God give us His life; He Himself came to be our life. Because God Himself is life, His life is His very self.<p>Then what is life? Life is God Himself; What does it mean to have life? To have life is to have God Himself. What does it mean to live out life? To live out life is to live out God Himself. Life is not different in the least from God. If it were, then it would not be life. We should understand this clearly. It is not sufficient merely to know that we have life; we must know further that this life we have is God Himself. It is not sufficient only to know that we should live out life; we must also know that the life we should live out is God Himself.]<p>God is love. God is light. God is holy. God is righteous. When we have God as our life, we may live out God and express Him as love, light, holiness and righteousness. When we have God as our life we would not hate our enemies, rather we would love them (Matt. 5:44). We would not walk in darkness and do the hidden things of shame (2 Cor. 4:2); rather we would walk in the light as He is in the light (1 John 1:7). We would not be worldly, but rather would be holy, separated from the world and full of God&#8217;s holy nature (2 Pet. 1:4; 1 Thes. 5:23). We would not be unrighteous, but rather we would become the righteousness of God (2 Cor. 5:21). This is too marvelous. God can be life in us to live out all that God is.<h2 class=head1>II. LIFE BEING CHRIST</h2><p>God is life. This is wonderful. But how can we fallen sinners contact and receive God to be our life? God knows how. He comes to us in His Son Jesus Christ. The Bible further reveals to us that God became flesh, which is Christ (John 1:1, 14). Since Christ is God (Heb. 1:8), He has the life of God in Him (John 1:4), therefore, He is also life (1 John 5:12). He said many times that He is life (John 11:25; 14:6) and that He came to earth that we may have life (John 10:10). Therefore, we who have believed and received Him have Him as our life (Col 3:4).<p>[Just as life is God Himself, so also life is Christ. Just as having life is having God Himself, so also having life is having Christ. Just as to live out life is to live out God Himself, so also to live out life is to live out Christ. Just as life is not different in the least from God, likewise life is not different in the least from Christ. Just as a slight deviation from God is not life, likewise a slight deviation from Christ is not life. For Christ is God being life. It is through Christ and as Christ that God is manifested as life. Hence, Christ is life and life is Christ.]<p>Without Christ, we do not have God nor do we have life (Eph. 2:12; 1 John 5:12). By receiving Christ, we receive God as our life. Then all the riches of God that are in Christ become ours to enjoy every day.<h2 class=head1>III. LIFE BEING THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>After seeing that Christ, the embodiment and manifestation of God is life, we may ask where Christ is today and how can we contact Him and receive Him as life?<p>[Although Christ is life, it is difficult for Christ to give you life. Who gives life? It is the Spirit that gives life (John 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6). Christ is life, but it is the Spirit who gives us Christ as life. Without the Spirit Christ may be life, but Christ as life cannot be given to us. By being the Spirit Christ is imparted into us as life. Today, after being processed, the very Christ is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Never forget that Christ is the very God, Jehovah the Savior, God with us. Christ is God. This Christ, after being processed, is now the life-giving Spirit. We have to enjoy Him in His fullness as such a Spirit.<p>After the Lord Jesus said He was life in John 14:6, He made known to His disciples not only that He and God are one (vv. 7-11), but also that the Holy Spirit and He are also one (vv. 16-20). In verses 16 and 17 the Lord referred to the Holy Spirit as &#8220;He,&#8221; but in verse 18, He changed the pronoun from &#8220;He&#8217;&#8217; to &#8220;I.&#8221; By changing the &#8220;He&#8217;&#8217; to &#8220;I&#8217;&#8217; the Lord was saying that &#8220;He&#8217;&#8217; is &#8220;I.&#8221; This reveals that the Holy Spirit He spoke of in verses 16 and 17 is He Himself. From verses 7 to 11 He showed us that He is the embodiment of God-He is in God, and God is in Him. Hence, His being life means that God is life. From verses 16 to 20, He further revealed that the Holy Spirit is His embodiment, His other form; and when His physical presence leaves us, this Spirit of reality who is Himself as another comforter comes into us and abides with us. This Spirit living in us and abiding with us is just He Himself living in us as our life that we may live. These two passages therefore show us that it is by God being in Him and Him being the Holy Spirit that He is life. God is in Him as life, and He is the Holy Spirit as life.]<p>First Corinthians 15:45 says, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&#8217;&#8217; The last Adam is the Lord Jesus who was crucified to end the fallen adamic race. In His resurrection, He became a life-giving Spirit; therefore, all that Christ has received from the Father is now in the Spirit. This Spirit is called the Spirit of life in Romans 8:2. As the Spirit of life He is able to free us from the law of sin and death. He is also life in our spirit, may be life in our mind, and is able to give life to our mortal body (Rom. 8:10, 6,11).<p>[The way to have life is the Spirit. The way to be saved in His life is the Spirit. The way to reign in life is the Spirit. The way to walk in newness of life is the Spirit. The way to be sanctified in life is the Spirit. The Spirit is the way. Life belongs to the Spirit, and the Spirit is of life. These two are actually one. We can never separate life from the Spirit, nor the Spirit from life. The Lord Jesus Himself said, &#8220;The words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are life&#8217;&#8217; (John 6:63). In this word the Lord Jesus connects the Spirit and life. If we have the Spirit, we have life; if we do not have the Spirit, we do not have life. If we walk in the Spirit, we walk in life, but if we do not walk in the spirit, we do not walk in the newness of life. Thus, the way to experience the divine, eternal, uncreated life is the Spirit.]<h2 class=head1>IV. LIFE BEING GOD THE FATHER IN THE SON AS THE SPIRIT FLOWING INTO US</h2><p>[In summary, life is the Triune God. But to us, life is not the Triune God in heaven, but the Triune God flowing out. This flowing out of the Triune God means that His content, which is Himself, first flowed out through Christ; then it flowed out as the Spirit to be received by us as life. Thus when we touch God in Christ as the Spirit, we touch life, for life is God in Christ as the Spirit.]<p>The Father is the source of life. The Son is the course of life. The Spirit is the flow of life. Life is the Father in the Son as the Spirit flowing into us to be our life and life supply. Life is this processed Triune God flowing into us with all His divine riches, all that He has accomplished, passed through, obtained, and attained, to deal with all the negative things in us and to fill us up with Himself. Eventually, this life as the processed Triune God flows out of us to express God in our daily living, to bear fruit through the gospel, and to build up the church, the Body of Christ, consummating into the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>When a person receives God&#8217;s life, what is it that he received?</li><li>Why is the Holy Spirit called the Spirit of life?</li><li>Find one or two more verses that reveal the Spirit is life.</li><li>Find one or two more verses that show Christ as our life.</li><li>Try to describe how life being God the Father in the Son as the Spirit is flowing into us.</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Recovery Version, 1 John 1:5, note 3; 1 John 1:7, note 4.</li><li>The Knowledge of Life, pp. 14-17.</li><li>Life-study of Romans, pp. 177, 169.</li></ol>w<h1 class=msg>Lesson Three</h1><h1 class=msg>THREE LIVES AND FOUR LAWS</h1><h2 class=head2>Scripture Reading</h2><h1 class=scripture>Gen. 2:7; Rom. 5:12, 19; John 3:15; Rom. 8:3; 7:15-16, 22, 24; 8:2, 4, 6, 13</h1><h2 class=head2>Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Man having three lives	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The created life of man in the soul</li>	<li>The evil life of Satan in the flesh</li>	<li>The divine eternal life of God in the Spirit</li>	</ol></li><li>Four laws related to man	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The law of God outside of man</li>	<li>The law of good in our mind</li>	<li>The law of sin in our flesh</li>	<li>The law of the Spirit of life in our spirit</li>	</ol></li><li>Our experience of the three lives and the four laws</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Text</h2><h2 class=head1>I. MAN HAVING THREE LIVES</h2><p>In order to learn more about the divine life and its experiences, we must understand the three lives in man. Man is very complex. Animals only have one life, but we have three. This is strong proof that man is not an animal. Man has three parts-body, soul and spirit. Each of these three parts has a corresponding life.<h2 class=head2>A. The Created Life of Man in the Soul</h2><p>The life in man&#8217;s soul is the created human life. It was put into man during man&#8217;s creation by God. [When God formed man of the dust of the ground, He breathed into him the breath of life, and &#8220;man became a living soul&#8217;&#8217; (Gen. 2:7). This means that the human life obtained through creation is in man&#8217;s soul.]<p>There are three parts to the soul. The mind is the organ for thinking. The emotion is the organ for love and hatred. The will is the organ for making decisions. The soul is created by God to express God.<h2 class=head2>B. The Evil Life of Satan in the Flesh</h2><p>God&#8217;s intention in creating man is for man to express Him. In order to do so, God must enter into man&#8217;s spirit to be his life. God&#8217;s life is signified by the tree of life (Gen. 2:9). Before man received God into his spirit, man was deceived by Satan to receive his evil life into his body (Gen. 3:1-6). Satan&#8217;s life is signified by the tree of knowledge of good and evil (Gen.2:9).<p>[On that day, Adam, deceived as he was by Satan, ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Henceforth, Satan&#8217;s life entered into man, causing him to become corrupted. Thus, besides his own original created life, man also obtained the fallen life of Satan.<p>After Adam sinned and fell, man not only offended God in behavior, which resulted in a sinful situation, but, worse still, he was poisoned by Satan in life, which caused his life to become defiled and corrupted.]<p>Romans 5:12 tells us that &#8220;through one man [Adam] sin [the evil life of Satan] entered into the world.&#8217;&#8217; Men were then constituted sinners (Rom. 5:19). Man now sins because he is a sinner and is fully under the condemnation of God (Rom. 5:16).<h2 class=head2>C. The Divine Eternal Life of God in the Spirit</h2><p>Praise the Lord, not all is lost. Though man&#8217;s condition seems so dismal, God is wise and mighty to save. God in the Son became flesh, a genuine man (John 1:1, 14; Heb. 2:14a), and His name was called Jesus (Matt. 1:21). He lived a perfect human life without sin (Heb. 4:15). Then He went to the cross to die for our sins (1 Cor. 15:3) and to crucify the evil life of Satan in us on the cross (John 3:14; Heb. 2:14b). Now, we who have believed, have received this divine eternal life into our spirit (John 3:15).<p>Through Adam&#8217;s sinful act in the garden of Eden, we all were injected with the evil life of Satan into our flesh. But through the righteous act of Christ, we who believed are unto justification of life (Rom. 5:18). We are no more unto condemnation, but unto life. Though we were spoiled by Satan&#8217;s evil life, now we are saved in the divine eternal life of God (Rom. 5:10b).<p>[Thank the Lord, today we who are saved not only have the lives of man and the devil, but also the life of God. Just as Satan, through his corruption, injected his life into us and caused us to be united with him, gained by him, and possessed of all the evils of his nature; so also God, through His deliverance, puts His life into us and causes us to be united with Him, gained by Him, and possessed of all the divine goodness of His nature. Therefore, just as the crucial point of the fall was life, so also the crucial point of salvation is life.]<p>We are more complicated than the unbelievers, because they only have two lives, but we have three-man&#8217;s, Satan&#8217;s and God&#8217;s. We are like a miniature garden of Eden, because we have the same three things in us. We must choose to enjoy and live by the divine eternal life of God in our spirit all the time and must not choose to live by the evil life of Satan in our flesh. Every time we choose to live by the divine eternal life, we will experience life and grow in life. Young brothers and sisters, choose life.<h2 class=head1>II. FOUR LAWS RELATED TO MAN</h2><p>We are more complex than we ever expected. Besides the three lives we Christians have, there are four laws related to us. [Each of the three lives within us who are saved has a law. Therefore there are not only three lives within us, but also three laws which belong to the three lives. Besides these, there is the law of God outside of us. Therefore, within and without us, there are all together four laws. This is revealed to us in Romans 7 and 8.] Other than the law of God which is outside of us, the three laws within us are not regulations, but operating principles and the automatic function of the various lives.<h2 class=head2>A. The Law of God Outside of Man</h2><p>[The law of God, written on stone tables, was given by God to men through Moses during Old Testament times. Hence it is outside of us. The law of God is composed of the statutes of God, and its nature is holy, righteous, and good. This law, being outside of us, enables us to know what God condemns and what He justifies; it requires us to reject what God condemns and do what God justifies in order to comply with God&#8217;s holy, righteous, and good statutes.] Although the law of God is good, it has no power to help us to be good, because it was weakened by the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3). It is by the law that we can know what God is and what God wants, yet we cannot fulfill it.<h2 class=head2>B. The Law of Good in Our Mind</h2><p>[The law of good in our mind, derived from our created, human life of good, contains the good human nature and exactly fits the nature of the law of God outside of us. This law creates in us, that is, in our mind, the desire to do good. Especially when the law of God outside of us requires us to be good, this law of good in us gives us the inclination toward doing good.]<p>The law of good wills to practice according to the law of God (Rom. 7:15), agrees with the law of God (Rom. 7:16) and delights in the law of God (Rom. 7:22). However, when the law of good tries to do good, the law of sin in the flesh rises up against it (Rom. 7:11, 23). It is, therefore, powerless to do good according to the demands of the law of God.<h2 class=head2>C. The Law of Sin in Our Flesh</h2><p>[The law of sin in the members is derived from the fallen and evil life of Satan. We have said before that due to Adam&#8217;s fall through sinning-eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil-Satan&#8217;s life entered into man. Within this life of Satan there is contained a law of evil, that is, the law of sin in the members. Since the life of Satan is evil, the law which is derived from his life naturally causes man to sin and do evil.]<p>This law is stronger than the law of good in our mind. Despite our trying very hard, we cannot fulfill God&#8217;s law (Rom. 7:17-23). We need to be saved and freed from the bondage of the law of sin (Rom. 7:24).<h2 class=head2>D. The Law of the Spirit of Life in Our Spirit</h2><p>Praise the Lord, He came that we might have life (John 10:10). By His life we are saved (Rom. 5:10b). &#8220;The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death&#8217;&#8217; (Rom. 8:2). [The law of the Spirit of life is derived from the Spirit of life which is in our spirit and from the uncreated divine life of God. When we received the Lord and were saved, the Spirit of God together with the life of God entered into our spirit and mingled with our spirit to become the Spirit of life. In this life of the Spirit of life, there is contained a law which is the law of the Spirit of life, or the law of life.]<h2 class=head1>III. OUR EXPERIENCE OF THE THREE LIVES AND THE FOUR LAWS</h2><p>After we have believed in the Lord and received His life into our spirit, we have the strongest life with the strongest law in the universe. This life is divine, eternal and indestructible. It is without shortage or defects. Although the law of good in our mind may be overcome by the law of sin in our flesh, we can set our mind on the spirit and have life and peace (Rom. 8:6). And, &#8220;by the Spirit&#8217;&#8217; we can &#8220;put to death the practices of the body&#8217;&#8217; (Rom. 8:13). Hallelujah! We do not have to be weak Christians any more. &#8220;There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus&#8217;&#8217; (Rom. 8:1). Every day, from morning to evening, we may be filled with the Spirit and live by the Spirit to overcome the evil life of Satan in our flesh. This is to have &#8220;the righteous requirement of the law...be fulfilled in us&#8217;&#8217; (Rom. 8:4). Praise the Lord!

THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p>Although we have talked about the law of life in the last lesson, we must spend more time on this subject, because the law of life is crucial to our experience of life. Without a clear understanding of the law of life, we may try to be a good Christian without the power of life, or we may do nothing and wait for God to do everything for us.<h2 class=head2>A. The Definition of the Law of Life</h2><p>The term &#8220;the law of the Spirit of life&#8217;&#8217; in Romans 8:2 is used only once in the Bible. Nevertheless, it is revealed in other verses such as Hebrews 8:10; 10:16; Jeremiah 31:33; Ezekiel 36:25-28. The law of life in us began at regeneration. Regeneration is the receiving of God&#8217;s life into our spirit. This life has the law of life.<p>[A law is a natural regulation, a constant and unchanging rule. A law of life is the natural characteristic, the innate, automatic function of a certain kind of life, and the higher a life is, the higher is its law. The law of the divine life is then the natural characteristic, the innate, automatic function of the life of God, and since the life of God is the highest, its law is the highest. This highest law of life is the function, the working, of the divine life. This function and working are innate, spontaneous, natural, and automatic.<p>With any kind of life, whether it be vegetable, animal, human, or divine, there is a function. Anything that does not have a function must not be life. Consider the example of a peach tree: its function is to blossom and to bring forth peaches. Likewise, a dog has the function of barking, and a cat has the function of catching mice. Every life has an automatic and innate function, and this innate function is the law of that life. Bringing forth peaches is the law of the peach tree. There is no need for a farmer to teach a peach tree, saying, &#8220;Little peach tree, you must know my desire is that you produce peaches. I don&#8217;t want anything else.&#8217;&#8217; If that peach tree could talk, it would say, &#8220;Sir, go home and rest. You don&#8217;t need to teach me. Don&#8217;t you know that in my peach-tree life there is the peach-bearing law? There is a law in my peach-tree life that keeps me from bringing forth any other kind of fruit. It causes me to bring forth peaches, just the fruit that you desire.&#8217;&#8217; In like manner, a cat catches mice because in its life is the mouse-catching law, and a dog barks because in its life is the barking law. What is the law of life? It is the innate, automatic function of the divine life. The divine life is living, active, and aggressive. This life is always acting, and whenever it acts it functions according to the automatic law of life.]<p>We must remember this life is a person-the Triune God, so is this law. [The law of the Spirit of life is just the Triune God working, operating, moving, and anointing within us. He is the law.]<h2 class=head2>B. The Function of the Law of Life</h2><p>The law of life is not there to regulate us from within, telling us what to do and what not to do. Rather, its main function is to free us from the law of sin and death (Rom. 8:2) and to conform us to the image of Christ (Rom. 8:29) so we may express all that God is in our daily living. As we are daily captured by the law of sin, we need to be set free, saved. Before we became a Christian, we had no way to free ourselves. The harder we tried not to sin, the more the law of sin was activated. As Christians, the law of life frees us from the law of sin as we activate our spirit. Dealing with the negative things is one aspect of the function of the law of life. On the positive side, the law of life shapes us, that is, conforms us to the image of Christ, who is the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15). As we turn to our spirit every day, the Spirit transforms us in our being. We might have been rebellious towards our parents before, but, Christ is not rebellious toward His Father (Phil. 2:8). As we realize that we are rebellious, we must repent to the Lord to be forgiven. Then we should continue to pray and stay in our spirit. The law of life spontaneously will work in us, bringing all the elements of Christ into us. One such element is submission. By this work we are transformed into His image.<h2 class=head2>C. God&#8217;s Desire is Accomplished by the Law of Life</h2><p>The law of life is a wonderful gift that we have received from God our Father. It will work out in us all that God wants to accomplish.<p>[God is not only our God but also our Father. Hence, He desires to be our God in the law of life. We are not only God&#8217;s creatures but also His children. Hence, He desires us to be His people in the law of life. God does not desire only to be our God according to the outward law of letter; He desires to be our Father according to the inward law of life. Nothing of the keeping of the outward law of letter can satisfy God&#8217;s desire. He can only be pleased by our living according to the inward law of life. And He does not desire to have us only as His creatures without His life but also as His children with His life. Hence, He wants us to be His people in the law of life, living not according to the outward law of letter but according to the inward law of life. Both His relationship to us and ours to Him should be a relationship maintained in the law of life. With the law of letter there was nothing but death. With the law of life there is no death but life. Only life can satisfy the divine desire.]<p>Praise the Lord that we have had a new birth, a divine birth. In this new birth there are no weak points. There is only the divine life with the divine nature and the divine law which shapes us and conforms us to the image of Christ. However, this shaping requires the growth in life, for the law of life only functions as life grows. The law of life does not regulate us from sin, because it is not in the realm of sin; it is in the realm of the divine life where there is no sin, world, flesh, or self. As life grows, its law works, not mainly to regulate or correct us, but to shape us, to conform us to the image of the Firstborn Son of God. Eventually, through the function of the law of life, we all shall become the mature sons of God, and God will have His universal, corporate expression.<h2 class=head1>II. THE LIGHT OF LIFE</h2><p>John 1:4 tells us, &#8220;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&#8217;&#8217; And in John 8:12 Jesus said, &#8220;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but have the light of life.&#8217;&#8217; We see that light is very much related to life.<h2 class=head2>A. Life is from Light</h2><p>[The whole Bible reveals that life comes from the shining of light. When light enters, life follows. Where light is, there life is. The amount of life is in direct proportion to the amount of light. Genesis chapters 1 and 2 say that before God began His recovery work, the entire earth was void and dark, which means that it was filled with death, for darkness is the symbol of death. Therefore the first step of God&#8217;s work was to command that there be light. When light came, it destroyed the death which belongs to darkness and began to bring in life. Thus, life follows light, and life begins from light.<p>There is a line in the whole Bible which continuously speaks of life and light together. Where light is, there is life. This is a great principle in the Bible. Psalm 36:9 says, &#8220;With thee is the fountain of life; in thy light shall we see light.&#8217;&#8217; This also clearly speaks of the relationship between life and light. Life always follows light, and only light can bring forth life.]<h2 class=head2>B. Light is in the Word of God</h2><p>[Since life rests with light, with what then does light rest? From the Bible we see that light rests with the Word of God. This is also a great principle in the Bible. Psalm 119:105 says, &#8220;Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.&#8217;&#8217; And verse 130 says, &#8220;The opening of thy words giveth light.&#8217;&#8217; These verses show us that light rests indeed with the Word of God. Therefore if we want to obtain light, we must obtain the Word of God. Whenever we obtain the Word of God, we obtain light. The reason we do not have light is that we lack the Word of God.<p>The Word of God we speak of here does not refer to the written word in the Bible, but to the word the Holy Spirit speaks to us from within. The Bible is God&#8217;s written Word; this is certainly correct. But such a Word, composed of mere fixed letters, does not have the power of shining light and cannot be light to us. However, when the Holy Spirit reveals anew the word of the Bible, opening and quickening it to us, the Word then has the power of shining light and can be our light.]<h2 class=head2>C. Light is the Inner Sense of Life</h2><p>In the old creation God commanded the light to shine outwardly, but in the new creation, God Himself has shined into our hearts (2 Cor. 4:6). When we talk about light, we are not talking about the light outside of us, but we are speaking of God as light shining inside of us. This light actually is the sense of life.<p>What we are in our self is different from what He is. He loves, while we hate. He is holy, while we are worldly. He is righteous, while we are unrighteous. He exposes us for what we are, which is not what He is. This is the inner sense of life. For example, you may say something to criticize or joke about your brother. The Lord did not say it, but the law of sin in your flesh made you say it. Right away, you may feel that was wrong. That sensation is light, the inner sense of life. What do you do now? All you have to do is to say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus, forgive me. That was not You speaking. Fill me up with Yourself.&#8217;&#8217; As you are praying according to the light, the Lord forgives you, cleanses you and grows in you so that you are more conformed to the image of Christ. <h2 class=head2>D. The Way to be Enlightened</h2><p>Firstly, we must want the shining. Since God is already in us, He is always shining. If we do not want the shining, we ignore it or argue with it, but as we accept and receive the shining, we are enlightened.<p>Secondly, we should be open to the Lord and turn to Him. Second Corinthians 3:16 says, &#8220;Whenever it (our heart) shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&#8217;&#8217; As we call on the Lord, pray or read His word, we are turning to Him, and we will definitely have His shining. If our heart is distracted by other things, we enter into darkness and we may do things against the Lord and not express Him.<p>Thirdly, we should not argue with the light. The more we argue, the more we stay in darkness, and the feeling of death pervades. If the Lord shows you that you argued with your mother, do not say that she was too much. Just confess by agreeing with the light. Then the Lord will forgive you and grow in you. <p>If we learn to experience life by the light, that we will grow up into Christ in all things, and God will be expressed through us.<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Can you give a short definition of the law of life?</li><li>Please explain the functions of the law of life.</li><li>What is the function of light?</li><li>Can you find additional verses that talk about life and light?</li><li>How can we experience life by the light?

To be regenerated is to receive the life of God into our spirit. We must grow in life daily until we are fully matured in life. Because this matter is a daily life-long process, we must focus our full attention on this crucial point. First, we must see what people mistakenly assume to be the growth of life. Second, we need to discern the true meaning of the growth of life. Third, we need to see how to grow in life.<h2 class=head1>I. WHAT IS NOT THE GROWTH OF LIFE?</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Improvement of Behavior</h2><p>Though we need much improvement, improvement of behavior may not be of life. [The improvement of behavior means the changing of a person&#8217;s behavior from bad to good, from evil to virtuous. For example, a man formerly was very proud; now he is humble. He often used to hate others; now he loves others. He was habitually quick-tempered and easily angered; now his temperament has become slow, and he is no longer quick-tempered. All these can be considered the improvement of behavior. When a man&#8217;s behavior is thus improved, is this the growth of life? No!] Why? [Just as evil is not life, so also is good not life. Thus in the Bible, good and evil are not two trees, but one tree; life is another tree, being something of another world, another kingdom (Gen. 2:9). Thus a man, by his own determination and effort, can improve considerably in behavior and yet still be very immature and weak in the life of God. This is because his improvement is entirely apart from life; it is of his own work and not of life. Besides, what he has improved is not the result of his growth in life. Therefore, growth of life is not the improvement of behavior.] Nearly all religions, ethical teachings, as well as psychiatrists try to help people to improve their behavior. Only Christ comes into us to be our life.<h2 class=head2>B. The Increase in Knowledge</h2><p>Though we need to know more about the Lord through His word, yet knowledge may not be life. [Though the increase of a believer&#8217;s spiritual knowledge through hearing more messages, knowing more truths, understanding more of the Bible, and comprehending more spiritual terms, etc., is a kind of growth, yet it is not growth of life. The increase of such knowledge only causes his mind to become improved and more thoroughly versed and his head to have more comprehension or more ability to comprehend. It is not that the Holy Spirit has given greater revelation within him or that life has gained more ground within him so that he has growth in the real knowledge and experience of Christ as life. The increase of such knowledge alone simply causes men to be puffed up (1 Cor. 8:1). It is nothing before God (1 Cor. 13:2) and has no value in life. Thus, growth of life is not the increase of knowledge.]<h2 class=head1>II. WHAT IS THE GROWTH OF LIFE?</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Increase of the Element of God</h2><p>[The increase of the element of God means that more of God Himself is blended into us, is gained by us, and has become our element. We have said that life is God Himself, and to experience life is to experience God; therefore, the growth of life is the increase of the element of God in us, until all that is of the Godhead is completely formed in us that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God (Eph. 3:19).]<h2 class=head2>B. The Increase of the Stature of Christ</h2><p>[While life is God Himself, God being our life is Christ; therefore the Bible says that Christ is our life. We can say that when we are regenerated, it is Christ being born again within us to be our life. But when we first receive it, this life is still very young and immature, which means that the stature of Christ within us is very small. When we love Christ, seek Christ, and allow Christ to live in us more and thereby gain us, the stature of Christ gradually increases within us. This is the growth of life. Since this life is Christ who lives in us, the growth of this life is therefore the increase of the stature of Christ within us.]<h2 class=head2>C. The Expanding of the Ground of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>[We have also mentioned that life not only is God, but it is Christ, and it is also the Holy Spirit. We may say that to experience life is to experience the Holy Spirit; therefore, to grow in life also means to allow the Holy Spirit to gain more ground within us. When we pursue more urgently the working of the Holy Spirit within us and give diligence in obeying the teaching of the Holy Spirit within us as the anointing, the Holy Spirit can then expand His ground extensively; thus life within us will grow to a great extent. Therefore, the growth of life means also that the ground of the Holy Spirit has expanded within us.]<h2 class=head2>D. The Decrease of the Human Element</h2><p>[The above three points reveal that if in a believer the element of God is increased, the stature of Christ is increased and the ground of the Holy Spirit is expanded, his life then has grown. All these points speak from God&#8217;s side. Now we shall speak from our side. Firstly, the growth of life is the decrease of the human element. The decrease of the human element is the decrease of Adam, the old creation, in man, which also means the decrease of the savor of man and in the increase of the savor of God. If a believer has really grown in life, his speech, actions, living or working must all impart the sense that they are not according to himself, but according to God; not of his own intelligence, but by the grace of God; therefore, they do not carry the savor of man, but more the savor of God, which also means that the human element has decreased and the element of God has increased. Thus, the growth of life is not only the increase of the element of God, but also the decrease of the element of man.]<h2 class=head1>III. THE WAY TO GROW IN LIFE</h2><p>After seeing that growth of life is the increase of God and the decrease of ourselves in us, we must find out how to grow in life. It is not hard. It only requires us to practice every day. Mainly, we need to be filled with the spirit every day all day by calling on the Lord, praying, repenting and confessing to the Lord, reading and pray-reading the word, speaking and singing hymns, thanking and praising the Lord for everything, fellowshipping with the saints, preaching the gospel, and prophesying in the meetings. Then we need to live by the Spirit, stay in the fellowship of life and obey the teaching of the anointing at home, in school, and when we are with our friends. Lastly, we need to flee all negative things and by the Spirit overcome all hindrances to life such as the old manner of living, sins, youthful lust, corruption, ungodliness, the world, lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life, the flesh, the self, opinions, criticism, murmuring, reasonings, the soul-life, individualism, and divisiveness.<p>In conclusion, the way to grow in life is to be filled with the Spirit every day, live by the Spirit all the day to overcome all the hindrances of life.<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>What is the growth of life?</li><li>Explain the difference between the growth of life and self improvement.</li><li>When we baptize people, what should we help them realize?</li><li>What should we experience as a normal outcome of prayer and reading the Bible and spiritual books?</li><li>What is the way to be filled with the Lord?</li><li>Give several illustrations used in the Bible to show how we grow in life.</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>The Knowledge of Life, pp. 171-179.</li></ol><h1 class=msg>Lesson Six</h1><h1 class=msg>EXPERIENCE OF LIFE</h1><h2 class=head2>Scripture Reading</h2><h1 class=scripture>Phil. 2:12-16; Rom 8:9-11; 13, 26; Jer. 17:9; 13:23; John 3:3-6, 16:8; 1:12-13; 2 Cor. 15:17; 1 Cor. 6:17</h1><h2 class=head2>Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>What is the experience of life?	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To experience God</li>	<li>To experience Christ</li>	<li>To experience the Spirit</li>	</ol></li><li>The first experience of life-regeneration	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Why regeneration is necessary?</li>	<li>What is regeneration?</li>	<li>How can we be regenerated?</li>	<li>The results of regeneration</li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class=head2>Text</h2><h2 class=head1>I. WHAT IS THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE?</h2><p>Now that we have some basic knowledge of life, we need to go on to find out how to experience life. Everything in the Bible concerning life is for us to experience today. We must find out what life is and learn to experience it. If you lack experience according to the word, go back and study the word, then pray to experience life. The Lord will grant us every experience of life if we seek to experience it.<h2 class=head2>A. To Experience God</h2><p>We need to ask ourselves first, what is the experience of life? [We have seen that life is God Himself. God Himself flowing into us, being received and experienced by us, is life. An experience which results from God passing through man and man passing through Him is considered an experience of life. For example: in our prayer we meet God, become enlightened, see our own fault, and deal with it before God. It is not that we detect our own fault, but rather, when we draw near to God, we are inwardly met by God, and thereby we see our own fault. God is light; hence when we meet Him, we see our fault in His light. We naturally confess to God and ask for the cleansing of the Lord&#8217;s blood. As a consequence, God passes through us, and we also pass through God. Such experience causes us to experience God; therefore, it is the experience of life.<p>All experiences of life are from God and are His working within us; therefore they can cause us to touch God and experience Him. Hence, any such experience of God will show forth life (Phil. 2:13-16).]<h2 class=head2>B. To Experience Christ</h2><p>[Christ is God&#8217;s manifestation and embodiment; He is God becoming our experience. Therefore, all our experience of God is the experience of Christ and is in Christ. <p>To experience Christ is to let Christ live both within us and out from us; to take Christ as life and thus to live by Christ. To experience Christ means that all our living and actions are Christ Himself living out and acting out from us.]<h2 class=head2>C. To Experience the Spirit</h2><p>[As Christ is the embodiment of God, so the Holy Spirit is the embodiment of Christ. God as life is in Christ, and Christ as life is the Holy Spirit. We experience God in Christ, and we experience Christ as the Holy Spirit. Thus, as the experience of life is the experience of God and Christ, so also is it the experience of the Holy Spirit. <p>It is this Holy Spirit of life who causes us to experience the indwelling of Christ, and it is this Holy Spirit of life who causes us to experience the resurrection power of God in Christ (Rom. 8:9-11). It is this Holy Spirit of life who leads us to put to death the evil deeds of the body, and it is this Holy Spirit of life who prays in us (Rom. 8:13, 26). All our experiences of life, whether deep or shallow, are produced by the Holy Spirit; therefore they are all experiences of this Holy Spirit of life.]<h2 class=head1>II. THE FIRST EXPERIENCE OF LIFE-REGENERATION</h2><p>[We have seen what life is, and we have seen what the experience of life is. Now we come to see the first experience of life, which is regeneration. Regeneration is the first step of our experience of God&#8217;s life; therefore it is our first experience of God&#8217;s life. This experience is very fundamental and extremely important. We shall use several points to look into it. First let us see:]<h2 class=head2>A. Why Regeneration is Necessary</h2><p>[Why do we have to be regenerated? There are two reasons which make it necessary. First, speaking from the lower aspect, regeneration is necessary because our life has been corrupted and become evil (Jer. 17:9; Rom. 7:18), and it cannot be changed from evil to good (Jer. 13:23). This is the reason we usually give for regeneration. Because our life (1) is corrupt and wicked, and (2) cannot be improved, therefore we need to be regenerated. All the sages of the past and present have advocated the doctrine of self-improvement in order to improve man. But God&#8217;s salvation does not correct or improve man, but regenerates man, since our human life is already corrupted and cannot be made good by improvement. This is the first reason we must be regenerated.<p>Second, speaking from the higher aspect, there is another reason we need to be regenerated. When we were created, we obtained only created life; we did not obtain God&#8217;s uncreated life. God&#8217;s purpose for us human beings is that we may obtain His uncreated life and be transformed into His image to be like Him, as He is. Therefore, even if our human life had not been corrupted, we would still need to be regenerated.<p>God&#8217;s purpose in creating man is not only to obtain a good man, but even more to have a GOD-man, one who has God&#8217;s life and nature and is just like God. If God desired man to be only a good man, and man had not fallen and been corrupted, he would not need to be regenerated. But God&#8217;s desire is not that man should be only a good man, but, much more, a GOD-man, one who is the same as He is. Therefore, even a good man must be regenerated.<p>Do not take this second reason lightly. This is a very significant matter. Oh, the purpose of regeneration is that we may have God&#8217;s life and be like God! It is needless to say that we are corrupted and evil and cannot be improved; but even if we were absolutely good or could be improved to become perfect, we would still need to be regenerated in order to possess God&#8217;s life.]<h2 class=head2>B. What is Regeneration?</h2><p>[According to the Scripture, to be regenerated is to be born of the Spirit (John 3:3-6). Originally our spirit was dead, but at the time we believed, God&#8217;s Spirit came to touch our spirit; thus our spirit obtained God&#8217;s life and was made alive. It is in this way that God&#8217;s Spirit gave birth to us, apart from our first, natural birth. In brief, to be regenerated is to be born once again, to be born of God (John 1:13), or, apart from our original human life to obtain God&#8217;s life.<p>To be regenerated means to be born again. Why do we use the term &#8220;born again&#8217;&#8217;? Originally we were born of our parents; but now we are born once more, this time of God; hence, this experience is called being born again. Being born of our parents caused us to obtain human life, whereas being born of God causes us to have God&#8217;s life. Therefore, we who have been regenerated have God&#8217;s life in addition to the human life.] Thus, a Christian is not one who is born in a Christian family, nor one who lives in a so-called &#8220;Christian country,&#8217;&#8217; but one who is regenerated by the life of God in his spirit.<h2 class=head2>C. How Can We be Regenerated?</h2><p>[How can a man be regenerated? In brief, God&#8217;s Spirit enters into man&#8217;s spirit and puts God&#8217;s life into it; thus man becomes regenerated.<p>How can God&#8217;s Spirit enter into man&#8217;s spirit? When man hears the gospel or reads the word of the Scripture, God&#8217;s Spirit works in him and causes him to feel that he has sinned and is corrupted; hence, he is reproved for sin and righteousness and judgement (John 16:8). When man sees himself as a sinner, recognizes his corruption, and is willing to repent, then God&#8217;s Spirit causes him to see that the Lord Jesus is his Savior, and that He died on the cross to shed His blood for the remission of sin. At this moment, he automatically believes in the Lord and receives Him as his Savior. Once he receives the Lord as his Savior, God&#8217;s Spirit enters into his spirit and puts God&#8217;s life in it, causing him to be regenerated.<p>So, speaking from the standpoint of the Spirit of God, it is God&#8217;s Spirit entering into our spirit to put God&#8217;s life in it which causes us to be regenerated. From our standpoint it is because of our repenting, believing and accepting the Lord Jesus as our Savior that we become regenerated, which means that in addition to our original life we obtain the life of God.]<h2 class=head2>D. The Results of Regeneration</h2><p>[The results or accomplishments of regeneration may be briefly categorized into three items:<p>1) Regeneration causes men to become the children of God. Since regeneration means to be born of God, it automatically causes men to become the children of God (John 1:12, 13) and have the relationship of life with God.<p>2) Regeneration causes men to become a new creation. A new creation is that which has the elements of God within it. When something has God&#8217;s elements within it, it is a new creation. In the old creation, there is no element of God. We human beings originally do not have any of God&#8217;s elements; therefore we are the old creation. It is not until God&#8217;s element is added into us that we become the new creation. Regeneration causes us to have God&#8217;s life and His very element, thereby making us a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17). This new creation is the crystallization of God being mingled with man, and it is the most wonderful thing in the universe: it has both the human and divine elements, it is both man and God, and it is like both man and God. <p>3) Regeneration causes men to be united with God as one. It not only causes man to obtain God&#8217;s life and His elements, but also to be united with God as one. By regeneration, God the Spirit enters into man&#8217;s spirit, causing man to be joined with Him as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). This is God causing man to have the deepest relationship with Himself, to become one with Himself.<p>In conclusion, when the Holy Spirit, by our believing in the Lord Jesus, puts God&#8217;s life into our spirit and causes us to be born of God, to become God&#8217;s children, and in the new creation to be united with God as one, this is regeneration.]<p>Since we have been regenerated, we must go on to experience the life of God that came into us every day until we are fully matured in this life.<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>What is the definition of an experience of life?

THE SENSE OF LIFE</h2><p>Every kind of life has sense. After a baby is born, immediately, he has the senses of human life. Although his senses may not be strong, nevertheless, he begins to have and is developing these senses such as feeling, hearing, seeing, etc.<p>After we are regenerated, we also have the sense of the divine life. We call that the sense of life. This sense is just the sense of the spirit. By this sense we know that we are saved. The experience of life has much to do with knowing the sense, developing the sense and living by the sense of life.<h2 class=head2>A. The Scriptural Basis</h2><p>[Although the Bible does not mention explicitly the sense of life, yet it actually speaks of the matter. Romans 8:6 says, &#8220;For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&#8217;&#8217; This verse speaks to us very clearly concerning the sense of life, for the peace mentioned here is clearly a matter of consciousness. This peace does not refer to the outward environment, but the inward condition; therefore, it is definitely a matter of feeling. Since the peace mentioned here is a matter of feeling, the death and life mentioned here are also a matter of feeling.]<p>The sense of death is due to our minding the flesh, while the sense of life and peace is due to our minding the spirit. When we live in the spirit, follow the spirit, and mind the spirit, we feel strong and satisfied within; at the same time we also feel lively, bright, comfortable, and at ease. For example, if the Holy Spirit gives you a feeling, and you mind and obey it, you will feel strong and satisfied within; at the same time you will feel lively, bright, comfortable, and at ease. Thus, you will have the feeling of life and peace, because you mind the spirit.<p>[The second place in the Scripture concerning the matter of the sense of life is in Ephesians 4:19, which says that the Gentiles &#8220;having ceased from feeling have given themselves over to lewdness to work all uncleanness in unbridled greedy lust.&#8217;&#8217; This tells us that the reason the people in the world commit sin and do wickedness at will is that they have forsaken all feelings. When a man sins and does wickedness, we cannot say that he has no feeling, but at least we can say that he has laid aside his feelings. The more one commits sin and does wickedness, the more he must lay aside the inner consciousness. Therefore, an evil, wicked man is void of feelings, whereas a good and kind person is rich in feeling.<p>Now, whose inner sense is stronger, the Christian&#8217;s or the Gentile&#8217;s? We must answer that our feelings are much stronger, because, in addition to the feelings they have, we have the feelings of life within us, which they do not have. Therefore, if we sin and commit wickedness, we must have laid aside our feelings even more severely than they. For this very reason, the Scripture exhorts us not to cast aside all feelings as do the Gentiles. The Scripture thus beseeches us that we might take care of our inner sense. This of course emphasizes heeding the inner sense of life.<p>Furthermore, almost all the Epistles of the apostles have words of blessing and greeting in which grace and peace are mentioned. Grace is God gained by us, and peace is the feeling of having gained God. God gained by us to become our life and for us to enjoy is grace. This grace within us results in peace; it causes us to have a feeling of peacefulness within. When the apostles wished that the people might have peace, it means that they wished the people might have the peace of the inner sense, or peace within. The inner sense of peace is the sense of life. Therefore, when they expressed their wish that the people might have the feeling of peace within, they wanted them to pay attention to the inner sense of life.]<h2 class=head2>B. The Source of the Sense of Life</h2><p>[Where does the sense of life we are speaking of come from? From what is it produced? It is produced from the things we have gained through regeneration-the life of God, the law of life, the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God. The life of God, the law of life, the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God cause us to have a feeling within, and this feeling is what we call the sense of life.<p>Every life has its feelings. Furthermore, the stronger the life is, the keener its feelings are. The life of God is the strongest life; therefore, when this life is in us it causes us not merely to have feelings, but to have strong feelings.<p>The Holy Spirit as ointment is anointing and moving in us; Christ is living in us with activity; and God is working in us. All three are in us with activity and action. They are not quiet and motionless; therefore, they all cause us to have feelings.]<h2 class=head2>C. The Function of the Sense of Life</h2><p>[What then is the function or use of this sense of life? The function or use of the sense of life is to let us know continuously where we are living. Are we living in the natural life or in the life of the Spirit? Are we living in the flesh or in the spirit? This is what the sense of life makes known to us continuously, and it is for this that we have the sense of life. Therefore the sense of life in us guides and proves us. If we follow the sense of life, we follow the guidance God gives us, and at the same time, we receive a verification of where we are living.<p>The sense of death makes known to us that we are not living in the spirit but in the flesh. The sense of death includes weakness, emptiness, depression, darkness and pain. Once we have such feelings, it means the sense of life in us is making known that we are already not right, that we are already not living in the spirit, but in the flesh.]<p>The sense of life [gives us the feeling of life and peace, or, in other words, it makes us feel strong, satisfied, lively, bright and comfortable. Whenever we feel strong, satisfied, lively, bright and comfortable within, we have inward proof that we are right before God and that we are living in the spirit. Life and peace are the positive feelings which the sense of life gives us within, thus proving that our condition in life is normal.]<p>What do we do when we have the sense of death? All we need to do is to repent (turn back) to the Lord by calling on His name. We also need to confess (agree with) to Him. Then He will forgive us and His blood will cleanse us. The end result will be the sense of life and peace. God provided us the sense of life in order for us to experience life easily. How good and easy it is to experience life according to the sense of life.<h2 class=head1>II. THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</h2><p>[Closely related to the sense of life is the fellowship of life. So let us now see the fellowship of life.]<h2 class=head2>A. The Source of the Fellowship of Life</h2><p>[Where does the fellowship of life come from? First John 1:2-3 says, &#8220;We (the apostles)...report to you (the believers) the eternal life...that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed the fellowship which is ours is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.&#8217;&#8217; These verses show that the apostles preached unto us &#8220;the eternal life&#8217;&#8217; so that we may have &#8220;fellowship.&#8217;&#8217; The eternal life is the life of God, and the life of God entering into us enables us to have fellowship. Since this fellowship comes out of the life of God, it is the fellowship of life. The life of God, therefore, is the source of the fellowship of life.]<h2 class=head2>B. The Medium of the Fellowship of Life</h2><p>[The life of God rests in the Holy Spirit of God, and it is through the Holy Spirit of God that the life of God enters into us and lives in us. Therefore, the fellowship brought to us by the life of God, though derived from the life of God, comes by means of the Holy Spirit of God. Hence, the Bible also calls this fellowship &#8220;the fellowship of the Holy Spirit&#8217;&#8217; (2 Cor. 13:14). Therefore, if we desire to have fellowship of life, we must not only have the life of God, but also live in the Holy Spirit of God. The life of God is the source of the fellowship of life, and the Holy Spirit of God is the medium of the fellowship of life.]<h2 class=head2>C. The Meaning of the Fellowship of Life</h2><p>Fellowship [means joint participation, common participation. It is the issue of the eternal life, and is actually the flow of the eternal life within all the believers who have received and possess the divine life. It is carried on by the Spirit in our regenerated spirit. Hence, it is called &#8220;the fellowship of the Holy Spirit&#8217;&#8217; (2 Cor. 13:14) and &#8220;fellowship of (our) spirit&#8217;&#8217; (Phil. 2:1). It is in this fellowship of the eternal life that we the believers participate in all the Father and the Son are and have done for us; that is, we enjoy the love of the Father and the grace of the Son by virtue of the fellowship of the Spirit (2 Cor. 13:14).]<p>This life [flowed out from God, and flowed into thousands of saints, including us. This flowing life is from God; it passes through God, and it passes through thousands of saints, including us. Thus it causes us to have fellowship with God and with thousands of saints.]<p>Another [meaning of the fellowship of life is the flowing of life. This flowing of life is not separated from life; rather it is the fellowship of the flowing of life itself. This fellowship of the flowing of life requires that we continuously walk and live by following it and yielding to it. Whenever we do not follow it or yield to it, it stops flowing. Thus the fellowship between us and God is severed, and the fellowship between us and the saints is also gone.<p>In 1 John 1:6 John says, &#8220;If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth.&#8217;&#8217; To have fellowship with God is to have an intimate and living contact with Him in the flow of the divine life according to the Spirit&#8217;s anointing in our spirit (2:27). This keeps us in the participation and enjoyment of the divine light and divine love.]<h2 class=head2>D. We Must Maintain the Fellowship of Life</h2><p>[It is very important for us to realize that the believers&#8217; relationship in life with God is unbreakable. However, their fellowship with Him is breakable. The former is unconditional; the latter is conditional. Once we have been regenerated, we are children of God, and we have a relationship in life with our Father. Our relationship with God is based on life and has been settled once for all. Therefore, the life relationship with God has no conditions and is unbreakable. But our fellowship with God has certain conditions, it is breakable, and it may fluctuate.] Therefore, we must pay much attention to maintain the fellowship of life. Whenever we feel that the fellowship is broken, we must repent and confess to restore this fellowship.<h2 class=head2>E. The Function of the Fellowship of Life</h2><p>[What is the function or use of the fellowship of life? It is to inwardly supply us with all that is in the life of God or all that is in God. All the fullness in God is supplied to us through the fellowship of life. The more we allow the flowing of life to flow in us, the more we are inwardly supplied with the fullness of God. Such supply of the fellowship of life is like the circulating of the blood as the supply of the body and like the flowing of electricity as the supply of the lights.<p>The sense of life proves whether we are living in God or not. And the fellowship of life continuously supplies us with the things of life. Whenever your supply of life is cut off, it means that your fellowship of life is interrupted. If we continuously live in the fellowship of life, our supply of life will come continuously and unceasingly.] This type of supply helps us to live a normal Christian life.<h2 class=head2>F. A Cycle of Life</h2><p>In 1 John 1:1-7 we see [a cycle in our spiritual life formed of four crucial things-the eternal life, the fellowship of the eternal life, the divine light, and the blood of Jesus the Son of God. Eternal life issues in the fellowship of the divine life, the fellowship of eternal life brings in the divine light, and the divine light increases the need of the blood of Jesus the Son of God] so that we may have more eternal life. The more we have of eternal life, the more of its fellowship it brings to us. The more fellowship of the divine life we enjoy, the more divine light we receive. [The more divine light we receive, the more we participate in the cleansing of the blood of Jesus. Such a cycle brings us onward in the growth of the divine life until we reach its maturity.] Thus, we see that we have all that we need to experience life, to grow in life and to mature in life.

Between the time we are regenerated till the time we are matured, we will face many situations that we may not be happy about. If we are not clear about consecration and are not consecrated, then we may not be able to finish the course like the apostle Paul (2 Tim. 4:7-8). When we are supposed to run the race, we may run away from situations instead of experiencing life to grow. Therefore, we must be properly consecrated in order to go on and grow properly.<p>[In a normal condition these two experiences, salvation and consecration, are closely related. A saved person should be a consecrated person. Once a person is saved, he should consecrate himself to the Lord. To be saved without being consecrated is a very abnormal condition. Our gospel work must be done strongly to such an extent that people will immediately consecrate themselves as soon as they are saved.]<h2 class=head1>I. THE BASIS OF CONSECRATION</h2><p>[On what basis must we consecrate ourselves to God? On what basis does God require us to consecrate ourselves to Him? We need to have a basis for whatever we do. For example, when we move into a house and live in it, it is because we have paid a price and rented or bought it. This renting or purchasing is the basis upon which we live there. Our God is one who is most legal and one who acts most reasonably. All His doings are legal and have a basis. He cannot obtain something in the universe without paying a price, and He also cannot demand something from us without a basis. When God, therefore, demands that we consecrate ourselves to Him, it cannot be without a basis. In this matter, He has a very solid basis, that is, His purchase. He has already bought us. He can, therefore, demand that we consecrate ourselves to Him.<p>First Corinthians 6:20 says, &#8220;You were bought with a price.&#8217;&#8217; Our consecration is based on this purchase of God. God has bought us with none other than the precious blood shed by His beloved Son on the cross (1 Pet. 1:19). God used this precious blood as the price to buy us, that we may belong to Him. Galatians 4:5 says, &#8220;That he might redeem them that were under the law.&#8217;&#8217; Because we became sinners, we fell under God&#8217;s law and were kept and retained by this law. If God, therefore, wanted to release us from under His righteous law, He must pay the full price to satisfy the demand of His law. This price is the precious blood shed by His Son. Formerly we belonged to the law, but now we belong to God. The right of ownership over us has been transferred from the law to the hand of God. It is on the basis of this transfer of right that God demands that we consecrate ourselves to Him.]<p>If we are clear about the right of ownership, we would consecrate ourselves to God immediately and continuously. We will never dare to think, speak or do things that are not of the divine life. We will refresh our consecration every morning and every day. It does not depend on our mood, it is based upon the fact of God&#8217;s purchase. [Each time something occurs that causes us to argue with God, we must bow before Him and say, &#8220;Lord, I am the slave You bought. My right of ownership has been purchased by You. I here and now declare Your right. Even in this matter I will let You be the Lord and decide for me.&#8217;&#8217; Every time we depart from the position of consecration, we should feel that we are in a state of rebellion similar to that of Onesimus, the slave who fled from his master, Philemon.]<p>Many of us may still be runaway slaves. We must repent to the Lord right now and consecrate ourselves to Him again or for the first time. When we do this, right away we will experience life and grow.<h2 class=head1>II. THE MOTIVE OF CONSECRATION-GOD&#8217;S LOVE</h2><p>[The motive of consecration refers to one&#8217;s heart in consecration. In order to have a good consecration, we not only need to realize its basis; we also need to have a motive. If the things which God purchased were inanimate objects, such as a chair or a garment, He could proceed directly to use them as He pleases. But what God has redeemed today are living persons, each with a mind, an affection, and a will. Although God wants to have us, we may not be happy to let Him have us. Although God has the legal right and basis to possess us, we may not have the heart to let Him do so. Therefore, when God desires us to consecrate ourselves to Him, He must move our heart. He must give us the motive of love that we might be willing to consecrate ourselves to Him.<p>Second Corinthians 5:14-15 says, &#8220;For the love of Christ constrains us (constrains in the original has the meaning of the rushing of waters)...and He died for all, that they that live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again.&#8217;&#8217; In other words, these verses tell us that the dying love of Christ is like the rushing of great waters toward us, impelling us to consecrate ourselves to God and to live for Him beyond our own control.]<p>In Revelation chapter two, Jesus said that the church in Ephesus had left her first love. She needed to repent. Are we crazily in love with Jesus? Do we love Him first and best? O Lord Jesus. If we also have left our first love, we need to turn to the One who loves us first. How we need to repent and love only Him<p>[When we touch the love of God and see that He truly is lovely, we will then consecrate ourselves to Him.] Without that touch of His love upon us, consecration is a bitter thing; in fact, it is hardly a possibility. The security of our consecration depends upon its basis; but the vitality and sweetness of our consecration depends on its motive power, that is, the love of God.<h2 class=head1>III. THE MEANING OF CONSECRATION-TO BE A SACRIFICE</h2><p>[What then is consecration? What is the meaning of consecration? Romans 12:1 says, &#8220;I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice.&#8217;&#8217; This verse shows us that the meaning of consecration is to be a &#8220;sacrifice.&#8217;&#8217; What is a &#8220;sacrifice&#8217;&#8217;? The Scripture shows us that whenever a thing is set apart from its original position and usage and is laid on God&#8217;s altar, specifically for Him, this thing is then a sacrifice.] A cow was used for plowing; now, after being sacrificed, it is burnt to be a sweet savor to God. It becomes God&#8217;s food to satisfy Him (Lev. 3:5, 11).<p>[Since the meaning of consecration is to offer ourselves to God as a living sacrifice for God&#8217;s satisfaction, we should ask ourselves this question: Since our consecration, how much of our actual living and actual experiences have proved that we have indeed laid ourselves on the altar to be a sacrifice for God? Are we indeed willing to be God&#8217;s food that He might be satisfied? True consecration is never compelled by God; it is of our voluntary will. God takes nothing by force; everything is offered up by men willingly. Likewise, our consecration today must be made out of our voluntary will; it is we who willingly lie on the altar and dare not move off. Others may move about freely, but we dare not act in a casual way. Others may calculate and choose between the sweet and the bitter, but when we encounter a difficulty, we dare not consider escape. Others can reason and argue with God; we dare not say even one sentence. Others can evade God&#8217;s will and avoid being bound and limited; we would rather be restricted by His will and willing to be imprisoned in His hand. All this, because we have already offered ourselves to God and have been laid on the altar. We are already a consecrated people. We should be able to say continually to God, &#8220;O God, I have no choice; I have already consecrated myself to You; I am in Your hand.&#8217;&#8217;] Then, we may continually experience life and grow in life.<h2 class=head1>IV. THE PURPOSE OF CONSECRATION-TO WORK FOR GOD</h2><p>[Since the meaning of consecration is to become a sacrifice, the thing offered is something which is entirely for God. The purpose of consecration, therefore, is to be used by God, to work for God. But in order that we may work for God, we must first let God work. Only those who have first let God work can work for God. We can only work for God to the extent that we allow God to work.<p>When the bullocks and rams were killed and offered to God as burnt-offerings, it was first necessary for God to do His thorough work upon them, that is, to consume them by fire, if they were to be pleasing and acceptable to Him. If the sacrifices were not consumed by fire, they would be raw and foul-smelling and could never be acceptable or pleasing to God. Our consecration today is just like that. We have already offered ourselves, yet if we do not allow God to work first, but go out to work for Him and serve Him directly, that work and that service will be raw, untempered, and foul-smelling. It can never be accepted by God, let alone satisfy Him.]<p>Therefore, we must consecrate ourselves to be worked on by God. Then His life will flow and grow within us, thus, making us ready to work for His eternal purpose.<h2 class=head1>V. THE RESULT OF CONSECRATION-TO ABANDON OUR FUTURE</h2><p>A truly consecrated man is a man who has cut his ties with the world and binds himself to God. To him, his all is God, his hope is in God, his future is God. He lives every day to contact God, to enjoy God, to be filled up with God and to overflow with God. He is sorrowful when God&#8217;s desires are not met. He is happy when God&#8217;s desires are met. He is just involved with God. His own thoughts, desires and choices are put aside for God&#8217;s. Because he always and only knows that his place is on the altar, his future is to be ashes in God.<p>[This giving up of the future is not a reluctant act after something has already occurred to wreck your future hopes; it is a willing surrender before such an event. It is not waiting till you have lost or failed in your business and then giving up. It is not waiting till you lose your job, till you cannot enter college, or till you fail to obtain a Ph.D. degree, and then give up. It is not this. When we speak of giving up the future, we mean that when a profitable business opportunity awaits you, when an excellent job awaits you, or when a Ph.D. degree awaits you, you willingly give it all up for the Lord&#8217;s sake. This is truly called the giving up of the future. Even if the entire glory of Egypt is placed before you, you can say to it, &#8220;Good-bye, I must go to Canaan.&#8217;&#8217;]<p>It does not mean that we should not do our duty as human beings on the earth. Yet, we should not be distracted and bound by all the earthly things. We should study hard and get the highest degree. We should do our job well to be advanced. But our future is God only, not a degree or a promotion. Whenever we find that our heart loves many things other than God Himself, we know that we need to be re-consecrated, to be ashes for God again.<h2 class=head1>CONCLUSION</h2><p>[When we first consecrate ourselves, our experience is similar to an embryo in the mother&#8217;s womb-one cannot distinguish the ear, the eye, the mouth, and the nose. As we grow in life, however, these five points related to the experience of consecration gradually become formed in us. Then we really have a feeling that we have been bought by God and that all our rights are in His hand. We become a prisoner of His love because His love has pierced our hearts. We become a sacrifice indeed, laid on the altar for God&#8217;s enjoyment and satisfaction. We will be those who have been thoroughly worked over by God and are then able to work for Him. Our future will truly be as a handful of ashes. All our ways of escape outside of God&#8217;s will shall have been cut off; God only will be our future and our way. At that time the experience of our consecration will indeed have become matured. May we all, by the grace of the Lord, pursue and go on together.]<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>What is our consecration equal to?

We have been saved and regenerated. The law of life and the light of life are in us. We have the sense of life and have been brought into the fellowship of life. We see that we have been purchased by and for God, and we have consecrated ourselves for God&#8217;s satisfaction because of His love. It seems as though we have all we need and have done everything there is to do. However, there is much more to our Christian life. We may have everything already, but now is the time to experience these things item by item, to grow in life and to mature in life.<p>In this lesson, we will learn how to preserve our whole being, spirit and soul and body, so that we may be a person of life. [Through the fall our body has been ruined, our soul has been contaminated, and our spirit has been deadened. In God&#8217;s full salvation, our entire being is saved and made complete and perfect. For this, God is preserving our spirit from any deadening element (Heb. 9:14), our soul from remaining natural and old (Matt. 16:24-26), and our body from the ruin of sin (1 Thes. 4:4; Rom. 6:6). Such a preservation by God and His thorough sanctification sustain us to live a holy life unto maturity that we may meet the Lord in His parousia] (second coming).<h2 class=head1>I. PRESERVING OUR SPIRIT FOR LIFE</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Exercising Our Spirit to Contact God</h2><p>[Our spirit is composed of three parts: the conscience, the fellowship, and the intuition. Our spirit is mainly for us to fellowship with God. When we have fellowship with God, we contact Him. This contact with God spontaneously gives us a sense of God, a consciousness of God. Intuition denotes the direct sense and consciousness that came from God. Through this intuition we can know whether we are right or wrong. If we are wrong, we shall be condemned by our conscience. But if we are right, we shall be justified by our conscience. Our conscience, therefore, either accuses and condemns or excuses and justifies. The way to preserve our spirit is first to exercise it to have fellowship with God. If we fail to exercise our spirit in this way, we shall leave it in a deadened situation.<p>Whenever we Christians come together in a church meeting, we need to function. We need to pray, praise, or give a word of testimony. This is to exercise our spirit and not allow it to remain dormant or in a deadened condition. But sorry to say, many saints do not preserve their spirit by exercising it in this way. Instead, they allow their spirit to remain dormant. It seems that they leave their spirit in a tomb.] Is your spirit in a tomb right now? O Lord Jesus! First Corinthians 12:3 says, &#8220;No one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.&#8217;&#8217; Call on the Lord to exercise your spirit to come alive.<h2 class=head2>B. Keeping Our Spirit Living</h2><p>The apostle Paul said, [&#8220;Always rejoice; unceasingly pray; in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. Do not quench the Spirit&#8217;&#8217; (1 Thes. 5:16-19). To rejoice, to pray, and to give thanks is to exercise our spirit. When we exercise our spirit in this way, we cause it to be living. Exercising the spirit to keep it living is the first way to preserve it.<p>Because of the fall, our spirit has been deadened. Our spirit, therefore, must overcome the problem of deadness. The spirit of an unbeliever is absolutely dead. Most of those around you at school, at work, or in your neighborhood are utterly dead in their spirit. Have you been sanctified, separated, from a spirit-deadening situation?] We should struggle to save ourselves from that kind of situation by exercising our spirit. &#8220;Praise the Lord, call upon His name, declare His doings among the people, make mention that His name is exalted&#8217;&#8217; (Isa. 12:4). By doing that, we [pull our spirit out of death and cooperate with the operation of the Triune God in sanctifying us. He wants to separate all of us from those whose spirits are deadened. Because we have been regenerated, we need to be different. We need to show that our spirit is living, that it is not deadened. Thus, our spirit should rejoice, pray, and give thanks to the Lord.]<h2 class=head2>C. Keeping Our Spirit from Defilement</h2><p>[Another way to preserve our spirit is found in 2 Corinthians 7:1. In this verse Paul says, &#8220;Having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.&#8217;&#8217; This verse indicates that we should abstain from all defilement of both flesh and spirit. We need to stay away from anything that contaminates our spirit. This is the reason we should keep our eyes from looking at evil things, such as defiling pictures. Such pictures defile not only our eyes; they also defile our spirit. As a result, you will not be able to pray unless you first ask the Lord to cleanse you from all defilement.]<h2 class=head2>D. Dealing with Our Conscience to Stay Living</h2><p>Though we may try to preserve our spirit, we may often become deadened or defiled. Our conscience, the most evident part of our spirit, will have some uneasy feelings. These feelings indicate to us that we have a problem with God, that the fellowship of life is cut off. We may even try to exercise our spirit, yet, we still would not have any release. In order to restore the fellowship to enjoy life again, we must deal with our conscience until it is void of offense (Acts 24:16). The way to deal with the conscience is to repent and confess (1 John 1:7-9), until the fellowship of life with the issue of peace is restored.<p>[These feelings of the conscience can be divided into three categories: first is the feeling toward sin. If we sin before God or before man, the conscience will immediately have the feeling of condemnation. The second category is the feeling toward the world. If we love other matters or are occupied with anything outside of God, the conscience will also give us a feeling of condemnation.] The third category is the feeling [concerning anything apart from sin and the world. There are certain matters that are neither sinful nor of the world, yet they cause our conscience to lose the feeling of peace. For example, looseness and inaccuracy in our daily living are not sin nor of the world, yet our conscience is disturbed by them. If someone scatters clothing and other articles around, leaving the room in a state of disorder, his conscience will rebuke him.]<p>[The three categories of the feelings of the conscience are the result of our offenses-we have either offended God or sinned against man in our intention, motive, word, and action. Therefore, these feelings can be considered as feelings of offense. The feeling of offense itself is a serious damage to our spiritual condition. When one&#8217;s conscience has this feeling of offense, his fellowship with God is hindered and thus his entire spiritual condition is lowered. Therefore, whenever a Christian has the feeling of offense in his conscience, he must immediately go before the Lord to confess his sin according to this feeling and claim the cleansing of His precious blood. Sometimes there is also the need to go before man and deal with the matter. Then the feeling of offense will vanish, and the conscience will be void of offense. Therefore, dealing with the conscience, on the one hand, is to cause our conscience to become keen and rich in feeling, and, on the other hand to cause our conscience to be secure, at peace, and void of offense.<p>The blood of the Lord is our only weapon to overcome Satan&#8217;s accusation and attack. Revelation 12:10-11 tells us that Satan accuses us day and night before God, but that we can overcome him by the blood of the Lamb. First John 1:7, 9 tells us that if we confess our sins, God will forgive our sins, and the blood of the Lord will cleanse us from all unrighteousness.]<p>Therefore, every time we confess according to the feeling of the conscience, we should be freed from condemnation. We should have the sensation of life and peace. If the condemnation lingers on, we simply declare to Satan that he must leave us, because God has already forgiven us according to His word. Hallelujah! God is righteous and just, He forgives and cleanses as soon as we confess. As we are saying &#8220;O Lord, forgive me,&#8217;&#8217; He has already forgiven us.<p>After we are saved, the feeling of the conscience increases as the life grows. To the extent our life grows, the feeling of our conscience increases. The more we advance in the growth of life, the richer and keener will be the feeling of our conscience. The growth of life affects the feeling of our conscience, and the feeling of our conscience aids the growth of life. These two, in a mutual cause and effect relationship, forward us onward in the path of life.<h2 class=head1>II. CLEARING THE ARTERIES OF OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL HEART</h2><p>[Our psychological heart has three main arteries. These arteries, which are also the three parts of the soul, are the mind, the will, and the emotion. It is important to know how in a practical way to have these arteries unclogged. The way to unclog the three main arteries of our psychological heart is to make a thorough confession to the Lord. From experience I have learned that we need to stay with the Lord for a period of time to confess our defects, failures, defeats, mistakes, wrongdoings, and sins.]<h2 class=head2>A. Concerning the Mind</h2><p>[We may begin by confessing all the sinfulness and uncleanness that is in our mind, in our thinking. The artery of our mind can be compared to a ditch that is clogged with dirt and needs to be dug out so that water can flow through it. By confessing our thoughts one by one, we shall remove the blockage from this artery. As we are making confession in this way, we may confess to the Lord how natural our understanding is concerning many matters.] We may understand the Lord, the church, the saints, and our parents according to our natural concepts and not according to the Spirit and the word of God. We need to confess to the Lord and say, &#8220;Lord, forgive me. Although I love You, my understanding of many matters are still natural. Deliver me.&#8217;&#8217; [This is an illustration of the kind of confession we need to make concerning our mind.]<h2 class=head2>B. Concerning the Will</h2><p>[What then, about our will? If we go to the Lord concerning our will, He will expose it in a thorough and detailed way. It may seem as if we are being examined under a divine microscope, for one by one there will be brought to light all the germs in our will. In particular, we shall realize that we are very rebellious, that we do not know what it means to be submissive to the Lord. One by one, we need to confess the germs of rebellion in our will. The Lord may show you that, a few years ago, you were wrong in a particular matter. Then He may go on to show you how you were wrong with a certain brother or a certain sister. Each time you will need to confess. You should thank the Lord that you are under His light, under His exposure. By confessing all that the Lord exposes in our will, we unclog the artery of our will.]<h2 class=head2>C. Concerning the Emotion</h2><p>[The artery of the emotion also needs to be unclogged. When we realize how serious is the problem we have with our emotion, we may be deeply sorrowful. We may despair and feel utterly ashamed of the condition of our emotion. We shall realize that in many cases we hate what we should love, and love what we should hate. When we come into the light of the sanctuary, we shall see that the most ugly aspect of our being is our emotion, for we do not use it properly. Both our joyfulness and our sorrow may be altogether natural. As the Lord exposes us, we may feel ashamed of the way we have expressed joy and sorrow, for that expression often was natural, fleshly, even fleshy. No wonder our psychological heart does not function normally.<p>If we take the time necessary to unclog the three main arteries of our psychological heart, we shall have the sense that our entire being has become living. Our mind, will, and emotion will all be in a very healthy condition. All the &#8220;dirt&#8217;&#8217; in these &#8220;ditches&#8217;&#8217; will then be dug away.]<h2 class=head1>III. PRESERVING OUR BODY</h2><p>[If we would preserve our body, we should live a life that never follows the old man, that never follows our soul. Romans 6:6 says, &#8220;Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him that the body of sin might be made of none effect, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves.&#8217;&#8217; If we do not follow the old man, the body of sin will be made of none effect. This means that the body of sin will lose its job and become unemployed. But if we live according to the soul, we shall use our body to serve the old man. Therefore, to preserve our body first requires that we do not live according to our soul.<p>Second, to preserve our body requires that we not present any member of our body to anything that is sinful. For example, we should keep our eyes away from evil pictures and our ears from unclean things. Many things that are broadcast over the radio are defiling. A number of saints have testified that they cannot bear to listen to certain talk among those at school or at work because that talk is so evil. Many people of the world are able to speak concerning sinful things without any sense of shame. Thus, we need to keep our body from seeing and hearing things that will contaminate and ruin it. This is to preserve our body in sanctification.<p>Paul illustrates the importance of preserving our body in this way by giving in chapter four (of First Thessalonians) the charge to abstain from fornication. To abstain from fornication is to preserve our vessel, our body, in sanctification and honor. Therefore, in order to preserve our body, we should not present our members to anything sinful.]<p>[Today&#8217;s world is full of contamination and defilement. This makes it very difficult for us to preserve our body. Wherever we go there are defiling elements.] Young people should not try or even go near anything that defiles. If you flee (2 Tim. 2:22) from contamination, then you can grow in life with others who call on the Lord. As long as we are living on this earth, we need to preserve our body.<p>In conclusion, we must preserve our spirit, soul and body by exercising our spirit, confessing our sinfulness and shortcomings, and by staying away from anything that defiles. In this way, we may experience life and grow in life, rather than be stunted in our growth. May the Lord be merciful to us to remind us daily to preserve our whole being for life.<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>What are the three parts of our spirit?</li><li>What is the main function of our spirit?</li><li>Have you ever been condemned by your conscience?

This lesson is related to all the dealings we experience on the negative side and the building up on the positive side. [Therefore, our obedience to the anointing is the secret of our growth in life. If we desire to follow the Lord in the way of life, we should have a thorough knowledge and experience of this lesson.]<h2 class=head1>I. THE MEANING OF THE ANOINTING</h2><p>[What is the meaning of the anointing? We can understand this by the term itself and by its origin in the Bible. Firstly, let us look at the meaning of the term itself. The anointing of 1 John 2:27 in the original Greek is not a noun, but a verb pertaining to a certain kind of motion. It is not an ointment in a quiescent state, inactive and motionless, but it is an ointment in a state of motion and activity, involving the movement of anointing. Then what does the anointing refer to?] All Bible students agree that the anointing refers to the moving of the Holy Spirit, and that the ointment in the Old Testament is a type of the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head2>A. The Holy Spirit</h2><p>Who is the Holy Spirit? Many people misunderstand the Holy Spirit as a power or a thing given by God to do supernatural or sometimes spooky things. No. The Holy Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. The eternal God is embodied in the eternal Word (John 1:1). This eternal Word is God who became flesh and was called Christ Jesus (John 1:14). This complete God as a genuine man lived a perfect human life (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15). He went to the cross to remove all the negative things in the universe (Heb. 2:14) and to release His life to all His chosen and redeemed people (John 12:24). In resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), that is, the Holy Spirit. Therefore when we talk about the Holy Spirit, we are talking about the Triune God-Father, Son and Spirit-who went through a process to consummate in the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>B. The Old Testament Type</h2><p>This Holy Spirit is typified by the compound ointment in the Old Testament. Exodus 30:23-25 describes how the compound ointment is made. This ointment is made of four spices-myrrh, cinnamon, calamus and cassia-added to a hin of olive oil. Myrrh is a sweet spice used for burials, so it typifies the Lord&#8217;s sweet death. Cinnamon has certain healing properties, thus it typifies the effectiveness of His death. Calamus is a reed which grows out of muddy places high into the air, therefore, it must signify the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. Cassia, the last spice, repels insects and especially snakes. It reminds us of the power of His resurrection.<p>Since the compound ointment in the Old Testament typifies the Holy Spirit, we may call the Spirit, the compound Spirit. With this compound Spirit, we have the Lord&#8217;s sweet death for us. The effectiveness of His death always kills all the negative elements inside our being (Rom. 8:13). This Spirit also brings to us His resurrection with the life and its power. By this resurrection power we may overcome all our enemies, especially Satan, the snake. Hallelujah! Not only that, the Spirit also brings into us all that God is-love, light, holiness, righteousness, etc.-and all that God has, obtained and attained. What a wonderful Spirit is dwelling in us.<h2 class=head2>C. The Moving of the Holy Spirit to Sanctify Us</h2><p>Since the Spirit is a living person, He is always moving. This is why in 1 John chapter two, He is not merely called the ointment, but the anointing. We are unholy naturally. He is Holy. He always moves within us to sanctify us, that is, to separate us from the common worldly things, so that we may be filled with the holy nature of God. He kills everything in us that is not of God and for God. Then He adds to us all that God is. Therefore, to follow the teaching of the anointing is crucial to our experience and growth of life.<h2 class=head1>II. THE ANOINTING AND THE PURPOSE OF SALVATION</h2><p>The central purpose of God&#8217;s salvation is to work Himself into human beings and be mingled with them as one. Likewise, the function of the anointing is to anoint God into us, so that we may be mingled with God as one. Therefore, practically speaking, the purpose of God&#8217;s salvation is achieved through the anointing. If there is no anointing, the purpose of God&#8217;s salvation can never be fulfilled. The anointing is thus a significant factor in the entire salvation of God.<p>When the Triune God came into us as the Holy Spirit, He became mingled with us. Thus, the purpose of His salvation-the mingling of God and man-is accomplished in us in a practical way.<p>However, the work of God to mingle Himself with man is not an instantaneous process. Since we were regenerated and the Holy Spirit entered into us, this mingling has been going on continuously. Throughout the entire lifetime of a Christian, all the work of the Holy Spirit upon him is to fulfill the work of mingling God with man.<p>How does the Holy Spirit work this mingling into us? He does it by anointing us as the ointment. We have said that the moving of the Holy Spirit means the anointing. He is not motionless within us, but is ever-moving and ever-active. This movement and action is a kind of anointing, which anoints more and more of God into us. Hence, the more the Holy Spirit anoints us, the more God can mingle with us.<h2 class=head1>III. THE ANOINTING AND THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</h2><p>[There is a very close relationship between the anointing and the fellowship of life. The fellowship of life is the flowing of life, the flowing together of God and all those possessing His life. The anointing is the mingling of God with all those belonging to Him. The purpose of the flowing of life is to flow God into us, while the purpose of the anointing is to anoint God into us. These two are two aspects of one thing; they are very closely related and difficult to separate.<p>Let us now see why the anointing and the fellowship of life are two aspects of the same thing. We know that God is life, and God is the Spirit. Concerning God as life, He flows in us unceasingly-this is the fellowship of life. Concerning God as the Spirit, He moves in us continually-this is the anointing. However, life and the Spirit are inseparable, for the Spirit includes life, and life is in the Spirit. Life is the content of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reality of life. These two are the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), which is two-in-one and indivisible. Therefore, the fellowship of life and the anointing are also inseparable, being two aspects of one thing.]<h2 class=head1>IV. THE ANOINTING AND THE APPLYING OF THE BLOOD</h2><p>[A very close relationship also exists between the anointing and applying the blood. The purpose of the anointing is to anoint God into us, that we may have fellowship with God and be mingled and united with God.] When speaking of maintaining the fellowship, the New Testament brings up the matters of sprinkling the blood and applying the ointment. The sprinkling of the blood is to cleanse away all that should not be there. The anointing of the ointment is to anoint us with the elements of God, even with God Himself. It is just like someone painting furniture. As a result of the painting action, the paint is applied to the furniture. The Spirit coming to man is God coming to man. And by the Spirit moving and anointing in man, God is wrought into man.<p>Therefore, on the negative side, the blood cleanses away all the things that we should not have. On the positive side, the ointment anoints us with what we should have. What we should not have are the sins, and what we should have is God Himself. By the continual cleansing and anointing of the blood and the ointment, we maintain our union with the Lord always.<p>[The more we apply the blood and allow it to wash us continually, the more we will experience the anointing and feel the living presence and moving of God; thus, we will have fellowship with God. Therefore, the anointing and the applying of the blood are also inseparable.]<h2 class=head1>V. KNOWING THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Anointing</h2><p>[The teaching of the anointing comes from the anointing and is the natural result of our being anointed. When the anointing is moving within us, on the one hand, it anoints God into us, and on the other hand, it reveals God&#8217;s mind to us. Therefore, the teaching of the anointing has two aspects: first, through the anointing we gain more of God Himself, more of God&#8217;s components; second, through the teaching we know His mind and live in Him.<p>Of these two aspects, to have God Himself is primary, and to know God&#8217;s mind is secondary. Furthermore, to have God Himself always comes first, and then to know His mind. Each time we experience the anointing within us, we gain firstly more of God Himself, more of God&#8217;s components; this, then, produces a result-it causes us to know what God wants us to do. It is impossible to know His will without having Himself. Therefore, the teaching of the anointing is a subordinate function of the anointing.]<h2 class=head2>B. The Understanding of the Mind</h2><p>[Although the teaching of the anointing comes from the anointing these two occupy different parts in our being. The anointing is in our spirit, whereas the teaching of the anointing is in our mind. Why is the anointing in our spirit? Because the Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit; therefore, the anointing which emanates from the moving of the Holy Spirit is definitely in our spirit. When our spirit is motivated by the Holy Spirit, we become conscious of it. Such a consciousness is the feeling of the anointing. At this time, provided that our mind has been taught, we are able to interpret this feeling from our spirit. We can understand its meaning and thus obtain the teaching which emanates from the anointing. Therefore, the teaching of the anointing is in our mind and is entirely a matter of the comprehension of our mind. Therefore, if we desire to follow the teaching of the anointing, we should have not only a keen feeling in our spirit, but also an experienced and spiritual mind. Such a mind includes the renewing of the mind, the exercising of our comprehension in spiritual matters, and the collecting of spiritual knowledge. These require that we love the Lord more, seek spiritual experiences, live in fellowship, study the Bible, read spiritual books and listen to messages. Through these, our mind will receive spiritual unveiling and become enriched in knowledge; thus, it will be able to comprehend the meaning of the anointing in our spirit. Consequently, we will realize the teaching of the anointing.]<p>Without a thorough knowledge of the Word, you will be unable to understand much of what the anointing teaches. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery, every saint must be built up with the full knowledge of the Bible. Gradually your ability to understand and interpret spiritual things will develop. This will give the anointing the means to speak to you.<h2 class=head2>C. The Feeling of the Conscience</h2><p>[We have said that the normal feeling of the conscience is derived from the Holy Spirit, who is in our spirit, and passes through our mind to enlighten us. This enlightenment is also a kind of anointing of the Holy Spirit as the ointment. Therefore, the feeling of the conscience and the teaching of the anointing are both derived from the feeling of the anointing. The anointing, after having passed through the intuition of the spirit and having been understood by the mind, becomes the teaching of the anointing. However, the anointing, having passed through the conscience and being understood by the mind, becomes the feeling of the conscience; this, then, is their relatedness. <p>There are, however, differences between the teaching of the anointing and the feeling of the conscience. First, the conscience is an organ to differentiate right from wrong. The feeling of the conscience which is derived from the anointing is also limited to right and wrong, good and evil. But the teaching of the anointing, which comes by way of the anointing and is sensed directly in our spirit, is related in scope to God Himself. It surpasses right and wrong and touches directly the will of God Himself. If we only care for the feeling of the conscience, we can only be a faultless Christian. We must go beyond this to live in the teaching of the anointing; then we can touch the mind of God and live in God.]<h2 class=head1>VI. OBEDIENCE TO THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING</h2><p>[Concerning the teaching of the anointing, the Holy Spirit attends to the anointing, and we take care of the obedience. If there is no obedience, it is difficult to have the experience of this lesson.]<h2 class=head2>A. Walking According to the Spirit</h2><p>[If we desire to have the experience of walking according to the spirit, we need to know what is the teaching of the anointing and what is the feeling derived from the inward moving of the Holy Spirit. We need to know and live in the apprehension of this feeling. It is only in this feeling that we are able to walk according to the spirit. To follow the Lord means to follow the Spirit, which, specifically speaking, means to obey the teaching of the anointing. We are not following an objective, external Lord, but One who is subjective and lives in us. The shining of His face and the manifestation of Himself is the anointing; whereas the will He reveals in the light of His face is the teaching of the anointing. If we obey this teaching, we are obeying the Lord. If we follow this teaching, we are following the Lord.]<h2 class=head2>B. Living in Fellowship</h2><p>[As life is in the Holy Spirit, so the fellowship of life is through the moving or anointing of the Holy Spirit. Each anointing of the ointment anoints the Lord into us and also anoints us into the Lord; thus, it creates a flow of life between the Lord and us. Therefore, when we experience the anointing, there also is the fellowship of life.<p>If our fellowship with the Lord is limited only to our time of private prayer or morning watch, it is still very shallow. We need to live in fellowship every moment and be in close contact with the Lord, even while we are the busiest; then our fellowship will be deep. In order to live in fellowship, we must live in the anointing and always sense the anointing. This living in the anointing is obeying the teaching of the anointing. If we obey the teaching of the anointing constantly, we can constantly experience the anointing and live in fellowship. Otherwise, we cannot experience the anointing and abide in fellowship.]<h2 class=head2>C. Living in the Presence of God</h2><p>[According to the truth, God has ever been with us since the day we were saved. His presence has never departed from us, and we can never lose it. This presence is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit within us is God&#8217;s presence. Therefore, this presence is not a condition or a matter, but a Person. This Person is the Holy Spirit, whose being in us is the presence of God. From the day we are saved, this presence is never lost.<p>However, according to our experience, we are not always conscious of His presence. Sometimes, it seems that His presence has disappeared and we have lost the light of His face. It all depends upon the anointing. Without the anointing, the presence of God cannot be made real within us, and we cannot feel the light from His face. With the anointing, the reality of His presence and sense of the light from His face follow. Therefore, by the anointing we can experience the presence of God in a practical way.]<h2 class=head2>D. The Result</h2><p>[Since the anointing is vital to God&#8217;s presence, we need to obey the teaching so we can experience more of the anointing. Then we can live at all times and in all places in the presence of God, living in the light of His face and touching His presence moment by moment. At this time we can enter into the reality of the hymn which says:<p class=hbody>We have passed the riven veil, Here the glories never fail; We are living in the presence 	    of the King!<p>When man passes through the veil of the flesh and lives in the presence of God, he enters into the Holy of Holies and lives in the spirit, having fellowship face to face with God. It is at this time that our spiritual experience reaches its peak.<p>In conclusion, the key to all our spiritual life is the anointing. We should continually touch the anointing and obey its teaching. When we live in the teaching of the anointing, we are walking according to the spirit, living in the fellowship of the Lord and in God&#8217;s presence. If once we lose the teaching of the anointing, the leading of the Holy Spirit is absent, our fellowship with the Lord ceases, and the light in God&#8217;s face is lost; consequently, we have no way to live in His presence. Therefore, the teaching of the anointing is truly the center of all spiritual experience and is also a very wonderful part of God&#8217;s salvation. May we pay more attention to it and experience it more!]<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>What is the meaning of the word &#8220;anointing&#8217;&#8217;?</li><li>Describe the process through which the Spirit was formed.</li><li>Name the ingredients of the ointment in Exodus 30 and tell what each represents.</li><li>What is the central purpose of God&#8217;s salvation?

THE NEED TO BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>In the past ten lessons, we have shared with you some basic knowledge concerning life and some basic experiences of life for the growth of life. You must have noticed one common factor-the Spirit. The only life, the real life is zoe, which is divine, eternal, and indestructible. Without the Spirit, we do not have zoe. God is life, yet without the Spirit, the unapproachable God cannot be our life. Christ is life, yet without the Spirit, the Christ on the throne in heaven cannot be our life. Without the Spirit, God cannot flow into us to be our life. Without the Spirit, we do not have life in our human spirit. Without the Spirit, we do not have the law of life in us; thus, we cannot be freed from the law of sin and death. Without the Spirit, we have no light and will live in darkness. Without the Spirit to increase the elements of God in us, we will never have the growth of life. Even the beginning of our Christian life-regeneration-is the entering in of the Spirit into our human spirit. The sense of the Spirit is our sense of life. The flowing of the Spirit in us is the fellowship of life. Though we may be clear that we need to be consecrated to the Lord who has purchased us, the motive of our consecration-love-is poured out through the Spirit (Rom. 5:5). The power we need to preserve our whole being is the Spirit.<p>Therefore, we must be filled with the Holy Spirit every day, all the day, from the time we are regenerated to the time of our rapture, in the days of our youth and in our old age. Whether we are up or down, in or out, hopeful or hopeless, happy or sad, we need to be filled with the Spirit. Being filled with the Spirit affords us the power, the strength, and the authority to overcome every hindrance to life. Being filled with the Spirit is basic to our Christian life, is normal in our daily life, is necessary to our experience of life, and is crucial to our growth of life. It is a miracle that man may be filled with God, yet it is so normal for a Christian to be filled with God. It is as normal as regeneration. Being filled with the Spirit therefore is a miraculous normality. It is fully needed and required for us to go on.<h2 class=head1>II. WHO IS THE HOLY SPIRIT?</h2><p>The Holy Spirit is the Triune God who went through a process. Why did God go through a process? Because He has a plan, an economy. [It is according to His economy that God administrates this plan. The first step He took was creation. When the man He had created became fallen, He took the second step, the step of redemption. This redemptive work of God has to do with the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In eternity, the Father arranged, designed, and intended everything according to His plan. In time, at the fullness of time, the Son came to become a man, putting on man&#8217;s flesh, having man&#8217;s likeness and man&#8217;s nature, and lived among men for thirty-three and a half years. In His human body, with a human form and with the human nature, He Himself worked, preached, performed miracles, and brought His disciples to live and move together with Him for three and a half years. Then He went to the cross, being willing to enter into death to experience death. According to the flesh, He entered into the tomb; according to the spirit and the soul, He entered into Hades and remained there for a period of three days. In Hades He displayed Himself for all the principalities of death to see, proving that He is one who cannot be held by death, but has overcome death and is resurrected. He went into death by Himself; in the same way, He came out of death by Himself. Once He came out of death and entered into resurrection, He was transfigured from the likeness of the flesh to the likeness of the Spirit. Therefore, in resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This life-giving Spirit is the ultimately consummated Triune God.]<h2 class=head1>III. THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Essential Aspect for Life</h2><p>The Spirit has two aspects-the essential and the economical aspects. Essential means pertaining to the essence, necessary to the constitution and existence, hence, of life and being. The essential aspect is that the Spirit would come into us, bringing us the divine essence to be our life and life supply. By this aspect we may live and have our being in God to express God. Man was made by God to have God&#8217;s life and to express God. This aspect of the Spirit fulfills that intention.<h2 class=head2>B. The Economical Aspect for Power</h2><p>Economical means pertaining to the economy, necessary to the out-working of God&#8217;s household administration, hence, of power and work. The economical aspect is that the Spirit would clothe us with power so that we do God&#8217;s work of preaching the gospel, shepherding the young ones, perfecting the saints, and building up the church. Man was redeemed and regenerated to become partners of Christ in building up His church according to God&#8217;s economy. This aspect of the Spirit fulfills that requirement.<h2 class=head1>IV. THE INWARD FILLING OF THE SPIRIT FOR LIFE</h2><p>In John 14:16-17 Jesus said, &#8220;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter...even the Spirit of reality...shall be in you.&#8217;&#8217; In John 16:7, He said further, &#8220;If I go I will send Him (the Comforter) to you.&#8217;&#8217; Before the Lord&#8217;s death, He promised the troubled disciples that He needed to go to the cross in order for the Spirit of reality to be sent. The Spirit of reality was to be in the disciples to bring to them all the divine realities of the Father and the Son. This was fulfilled on the day of resurrection according to John 20:19-22, &#8220;When therefore it was evening on that day, the first day of the week...Jesus came and stood in the midst...He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.&#8217;&#8217; By the breathing in, the disciples received the Spirit of reality into them for life and life supply, since the Spirit is also the life-giving Spirit.<p>In Acts, the disciples continued to experience the inward filling. Acts 13:52 says, &#8220;And the disciples were made full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.&#8217;&#8217; The Greek word used here is pleroo meaning filling inwardly to fullness. With the inward filling, we have joy as one of the fruits of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22-23).<h2 class=head1>V. THE OUTWARD FILLING OF THE SPIRIT FOR POWER</h2><p>In Luke 24:49 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you...until you are clothed with power from on high.&#8217;&#8217; In Acts 1:4-8 He also said, &#8220;Wait for the promise of the Father...you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you.&#8217;&#8217; He talked about the promised Spirit of power after His resurrection, before His ascension. Although the disciples had already received the Holy Spirit to be their life and life supply, they still needed the power of the Holy Spirit to work for God. In order to preach the gospel, they needed to bind the devil and loose the sinners, they needed boldness, and they needed various manifestations of gifts. Therefore, they must wait for the clothing of power by the baptism of the Holy Spirit.<p>This was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost according to Acts:2:1-4, &#8220;And when the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled...they were all filled with the Holy Spirit.&#8217;&#8217; The Greek word used here for &#8220;filled&#8217;&#8217; is pletho meaning filling outwardly. They were empowered by the outward filling. Right after that, they went out to preach the gospel with boldness and power. We all need this type of experience in our daily church life.<h2 class=head1>VI. THE WAY TO BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>How can we be filled with the Holy Spirit? According to the incorrect concepts of many Christians today, to be filled by the Spirit is very special and hard to obtain. They think that you need to pray and ask the Father to grant you this special experience. They may fast and pray for days. Sometimes, when they do not believe they have received it, they may pretend to have it and do things they claim are manifestations of the Spirit, such as speaking in tongues, rolling on the floor, crying and shouting loudly, etc.<p>Firstly, we must understand that we have already received the Spirit on the day of our regeneration as seen in Acts 2:38, &#8220;Repent and be baptized, each one of you, upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.&#8217;&#8217; 1 Cor. 12:13 also tells us that we have been baptized in one Spirit. Therefore, after we are regenerated, we do not need to ask the Father to give us the Spirit that we have already received.<p>How can we be filled?<p>We can be filled by calling. Calling on the name of the Lord is the easiest and the fastest way to be filled by the Spirit. First Corinthians 12:3 says, &#8220;No one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.&#8217;&#8217; When we call on the Lord, we are in the Spirit. The more you call, the more you get the Spirit. The Spirit is like the air. Calling is like breathing. The more you call, the more you get filled. Call until you are filled. The Lord is rich to all those who call upon Him. He will save us from ourselves when we call upon Him (Rom. 10:12-13). Call everyday; call all the day.<p>We can be filled by repenting and confessing. We may have sins that are not confessed. We may have been rebellious to our father, criticized saints in the church, taken things from friends, used abusive words to hurt one another, lusted after things in department stores, had some &#8220;boy-girl&#8217;&#8217; relationships, and done many other similar things. As a result, our conscience became offended; the arteries of our heart became clogged; our body became defiled, and our fellowship with God was cut off. How then can we be filled with the Spirit? O Lord Jesus! Save us! If we would call on the Lord and pray to turn our hearts back to the Lord and confess our sins as He exposes us, the automatic result would be the filling of the Holy Spirit. This is to exercise our spirit.<p>We can be filled by praying in one accord. This may be our greatest lack. The first time in church history that the disciples were baptized with the Holy Spirit was in Acts one and two, after they had prayed together in one accord for ten days. Since then, any time we would pray together in one accord, the Spirit would be poured upon us.<p>We can be filled by believing. We need to believe the word that when we repent and confess, He will forgive and cleanse, and we will receive the Spirit and have the fellowship (flowing of the Spirit) restored (Acts 2:38; 1 John 1:7-9).<p>We can be filled by speaking. Speaking is a way to be filled and is a result of being filled with the Spirit (Eph. 5:18b-19a; Acts 2:38; 4:31). After repenting and confessing, we must exercise our faith and speak. Speak to the Lord, yourself, the devil, others, even your cat, dog, and table. Speak to anybody and anything. You will find that the more you speak this way, the more you will be filled with the Spirit, and the more you will have faith and boldness. The more you go to preach the gospel, the more you will experience the outward filling of the Spirit. You will go with the love of God, the authority of Christ, and the power of the Holy Spirit. Many will be saved through you and will be baptized by you. You will be doing the work of God for His economy by the power of the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>VII. THE MANIFESTATIONS OF BEING FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>What are the manifestations of being filled with the Holy Spirit? Or, how do we know that we have been filled with the Holy Spirit? [Since the Holy Spirit in us is the Spirit of life, and since our being filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit is for the maturity in life, the manifestation of being filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit must be an abundant, overflowing expression of life, flowing as rivers of living water out of our inner being] (John 7:38-39). Galatians 5:22-23 tells us that we also have love, joy, peace, etc., as our various inward conditions and virtues. According to Acts 4:31 we have boldness, power, and authority to speak the word of God in preaching the gospel and to prophesy in the meetings. The Bible mentions more than twenty items of the manifestations of being filled with the Holy Spirit.<p>Do you have some of these manifestations? We must exercise our spirit by confessing, turning our heart to Him, consecrating ourselves to Him, believing that we can be filled, speaking the word of God with boldness, and staying in the spirit by calling on His name and praying without ceasing. Because without the filling of the Spirit, all that we learn become mere doctrines, and all the dealings in the next few lessons will become religious rituals or asceticism. But with the filling of the Spirit, all that the Bible has revealed to us will become ours to enjoy today. All the dealings will result in more filling of the Spirit and experiences of life resulting in the growth of life. Dear brothers and sisters, it is easy to be filled, and we must practice to be filled every day, all the day, until we are raptured by Him. Hallelujah! What a Christian life!<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Why must we be filled with the Spirit?</li><li>What are the two aspects of the Spirit?</li><li>How are we benefitted by being filled with the Spirit essentially?</li><li>How can you experience the outward filling of the Spirit?</li><li>Share an experience of the outward filling of the Spirit.</li><li>Make a list of verses for each aspect of the Spirit&#8217;s filling.</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Words of Training for the New Way, pp. 85-86.</li><li>Life Lessons, pp. 133, 142.</li></ol><h1 class=msg>Lesson Twelve</h1><h1 class=msg>CLEARANCE OF THE PAST</h1><h2 class=head2>Scripture Reading</h2><h1 class=scripture>2 Cor. 5:17; Luke 19:1-10; Acts 19:18-19; Rom. 8:5-6</h1><h2 class=head2>Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Scriptural basis</li><li>The object of the clearance of the past	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Unrighteous matters</li>	<li>Improper matters</li>	<li>Evil and unclean matters</li>	<li>Old ways of living</li>	</ol></li><li>The basis of the clearance of the past</li><li>The degree of ending the past</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Text</h2><p>In the next few lessons we want to see the things that hinder our growth in life. If by the Spirit, we deal with these things, we will experience more life and growth. On the one hand, the sense of life in us tells us about these things. On the other hand, we need the word and the messages to help us get clear. Whether we become aware of them by the inward sense or the outward word, our dealing with them is the experience of life. The result will be a feeling of life and peace and growth in the divine life. We should have this experience day by day. The first thing we should do is to clear up our past with our old way of living.<h2 class=head1>I. SCRIPTURAL BASIS</h2><p>[There is no clear teaching in the Scripture concerning the clearance of the past, but there are two very good examples: one is found in Luke 19:1-10-the story of Zacchaeus&#8217;s dealing with the past after his salvation; the other is in Acts 19:18-19-the account of the Ephesians&#8217; clearance of the past after their being saved.<p>In Luke 19 we are told that as soon as Zacchaeus was saved, he immediately felt that he had extorted others in the past and was thus unrighteous; he also felt that he was a money lover with a stingy manner of living. He said therefore to the Lord that if he had taken anything from any man by false accusation, he would willingly restore him fourfold. Furthermore, he was willing to give half his goods to the poor. This was his clearance of the past. In Acts 19 we are told that many of the Ephesian saints, having been saved through Paul&#8217;s leading, came to confess their deeds, many of them willingly bringing their books of charms and burning them before the people.<p>The price of the books burned was fifty thousand pieces of silver. Since each piece of silver approximated a day&#8217;s wage, we can see that these books were worth a great deal of money.] This was their clearance of the past.<h2 class=head1>II. THE OBJECT OF THE CLEARANCE OF THE PAST</h2><p>[What are the things of the past that need to be cleared away after we are saved? What are the objects which must be ended and cleared up? Altogether there are four categories: 1) unrighteous matters, 2) improper matters, 3) evil and unclean matters, 4) old ways of living. After we have been saved, there needs to be a clearing up and conclusion of these matters.] Sometimes we may do these things after we have been saved. The same principle applies in both cases.<h2 class=head2>A. Unrighteous Matters</h2><p>[ Unrighteous means unjust, illegal. All we have obtained in the past by unjust, illegal means, such as stealing, swindling, taking by force, encroaching upon others&#8217; properties, keeping things that have been lost by others, not returning things that were borrowed long ago, and all illegitimate relations with others and unjust dealings toward others-all these unrighteous matters-are things we should clear up.]<h2 class=head2>B. Improper Matters</h2><p>[Improper and unrighteous are close in meaning, and yet they are different. Unrighteous means that the method by which a certain thing is obtained, or the relationship of a certain matter, is unjust or illegal. Improper means that the very nature of a certain thing or matter is improper or indecent. For instance, things used in gambling and drinking can be bought and obtained by legal means; but these things are used for gambling and drinking. Since both gambling and drinking are improper and indecent, the very nature of these things is also improper and indecent. Furthermore, neither smoking nor reading obscene novels can be said to be unrighteous, but surely they are immoral and improper. All these improper matters are also things we should put to an end.]<h2 class=head2>C. Evil and Unclean Matters</h2><p>[Evil and unclean matters are things related to idols, such as graven or portrait idols, clothing with the image of the dragon; writings of worldly religions; unclean things, such as books on horoscope, charms, etc.; also evil and unclean things, such as worshiping idols, worshiping ancestors, divining, fortune-telling, etc. These are hated by God even more than the things in the first two categories, and they are certainly intolerable to the life within us, which is holy and clean. Therefore, even more so must these things be thoroughly put to an end.]<h2 class=head2>D. Old Ways of Living</h2><p>[Old ways of living refer to our entire old manner of living before we were saved. After we are saved, we should not only put an end to all unrighteous, improper, and evil and unclean matters, but we must also put an end to our whole former manner of living and have a new beginning.<p>How then should we regard the ending of the old human living and beginning of the new? We are not saying that after a person is regenerated he should change his present occupation-stop going to school, close his business, ignore caring for his family-and go out preaching. The ending of the old human living means that after a person is regenerated, he may continue in his original profession, provided that it is proper, but the taste within him is changed, his mood is changed, and his feeling is changed. No matter what a person does before he is regenerated, his taste, his mood, and his feeling are all toward the world, all desiring to accomplish something in the world. The more he works, the more he relishes his work and the deeper he enters into it. But after regeneration, when God&#8217;s life enters into him, that taste within him becomes tasteless, that mood is changed, and his feeling is also changed. He even has a different taste for eating, clothing, and other daily necessities. In this sense, his old way of living is ended, and his old life comes to a conclusion.]<p>A good number of our young people may have been saved when they were very young; therefore, they may not have experienced many of the things unsaved people do. Yet, the old way of living is always lurking about us, waiting for an opportunity to bring us under its influence in the guise of peer pressure, such as: joking to hurt one another&#8217;s feelings, using foul abusive language, slang words, talk and behavior concerning boy-girl relationships, trendy clothing, music that stirs up the flesh, looking down on students with good grades, rebellious attitudes towards people in authority, etc. We must be watchful in order to remain unaffected by the worldly people&#8217;s old way of living. We must develop a new way of living, a way in spirit.<p>[This ending of the old way of living is a preliminary experience of a Christian, yet it has a deep effect upon his future walk with the Lord. When our old way of living comes to an end, our ambition and interest in the world are changed, our estimation and point of view toward men and all matters are also changed, and our purpose in life is different than before. Thus we can escape from all anxieties, leave all our burdens behind, and run the race in the way of the Lord.]<h2 class=head1>III. THE BASIS OF THE CLEARANCE OF THE PAST</h2><p>[The clearance of the past is not based on the demand of outward regulations, but on the sense of life within. Although we have previously pointed out four matters which must necessarily be ended, yet these only enable us to recognize principles. They are not rules which demand that we put an end to such matters. When we are practicing the clearing of the past, what needs to be ended really depends on the sense of life within. Therefore, the sense of life within is the basis for our clearance of the past.<p>We know that all the religions of the world are built on their various religious codes. Their followers live and behave according to these rules. But the Lord&#8217;s salvation is not like that. The salvation of the Lord, through the regeneration of the Holy Spirit, gives us a new life. Since we have such a new life, we can now live and behave in the presence of God through the sense of this new life. This is the principle of all our living as Christians. Our clearance of the past is also based on this principle. When a person is regenerated and obtains God&#8217;s life, this life moves within him, causing him to sense that in his past there have been many unrighteous, improper, and perverted matters, and that all these matters and even his entire old way of living are altogether incompatible with his present Christian state. Thus, he proceeds with his clearance of the past in accordance with these inner feelings.<p>The examples both of Zacchaeus and the Ephesian Christians clearing their past have also shown us that neither the Lord Jesus nor the apostle Paul clearly taught anything in regard to the clearance of the past; they did not give any rules demanding what one must do to end his past. The &#8220;ending&#8217;&#8217; of Zacchaeus and the Ephesian Christians was such that, when the salvation of the Lord came upon them and the life of the Lord entered into them, they had a feeling toward the unrighteous and unclean things of the past and toward their old way of living; therefore, they put it all to an end. Their &#8220;ending&#8217;&#8217; proves that this matter is not based on external regulations and teachings, but on the sense of life within.<p>Since the ending of the past is based on the sense of life within, we must continue to lay hold of this principle when we are leading others to end the past. Never establish for them any outward rules, teaching them that they ought to end this or that, but seek to stir the sense of life within and point them to that. We need first to cause others to know that the life of God is within them and lead them to know the sense of this life. Then, secondly, with the help of the ministry of the Word, spiritual literature, and the testimonies of other saints regarding their clearance of the past, cause them also to have some feeling or deeper feeling regarding what needs to be terminated in their own past. Once this feeling has begun and has been deepened within them, we can lead them to clear up their past according to their own feeling. This manner of clearance is in accord with the principle of the Lord&#8217;s salvation and can help others to truly grow in life.]<h2 class=head1>IV. THE DEGREE OF ENDING THE PAST</h2><p>[How far should we go in putting an end to the things of the past? To what degree should we proceed? The degree is expressed in Romans 8:6 as &#8220;life and peace.&#8217;&#8217;<p>We have already seen that the ending of the past is based on the sense of life within. This sense of life within is a feeling given to us through the inner anointing of the Holy Spirit. Since the ending of our past is based on the sense of life within us, the procedure is the same as that mentioned in Romans 8:5-6, namely, following the Spirit, or minding the Spirit. The result, therefore, will naturally be the same-&#8220;life and peace.&#8217;&#8217; Thus, life and peace are the degree to which we are required to clear up the past.]<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>What are the four categories of the clearance of the past?</li><li>What is the basis of the clearance of the past?

The more we are being dealt with, the more God&#8217;s life grows in us. The more God&#8217;s life grows in us, the more we are being dealt with. These two cannot be separated; they are two aspects of the same matter. Therefore, the dealings constitute an extremely important position in our experience of life. We can say that this is a major portion of experience in life.]<p>[Among all the difficulties which need to be dealt with, sins are the crudest, the most defiling, and the most evident. After having consecrated ourselves, the first thing we need to deal with is sins. Dealing with sins is the first lesson in our experience of dealings.]<h2 class=head1>I. THE SCRIPTURAL BASIS</h2><p>[The following references give the scriptural basis for dealing with sins:<p>Matthew 5:23-26: &#8220;Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has anything against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go away; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Be well disposed quickly with your opponent, while you are with him in the way, lest the opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. Truly I say to you, you shall by no means come out from there until you have paid the last quadrans.&#8217;&#8217; Here, &#8220;reconciled&#8217;&#8217; and &#8220;be well disposed quickly with&#8217;&#8217; refer to dealings concerning our relationships with others.<p>First John 1:9: &#8220;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&#8217;&#8217; Here &#8220;confess&#8217;&#8217; is again a kind of dealing.<p>Proverbs 28:13: &#8220;He that covers his transgressions shall not prosper; but whoso confesses and forsakes them shall obtain mercy.&#8217;&#8217; Here &#8220;confesses&#8217;&#8217; and &#8220;forsakes&#8217;&#8217; speak also of a dealing.<p>We see from the above scriptures how we are to deal with sins: towards men, we must be reconciled with them and agree with them; towards God, we must confess our sins; and concerning sin, we must forsake it. These kinds of settlement of sin are what we mean by dealing with sins.]<h2 class=head1>II. THE OBJECT OF OUR DEALING WITH SINS</h2><p>[The object of our dealing with sins is the sins themselves. There are two aspects with regard to sin: the nature of sin within and the action of sin without. The nature of sin within us is in the singular form; the action of sin without is in the plural form. The singular form of sin is the life of Satan within us, with which we have no way of dealing-the more we deal with it, the more alive it becomes. The dealing with sins of which we are speaking is our dealing with the sins which we commit outwardly, the sins in our actions.]<h2 class=head1>III. THE BASIS OF DEALING WITH SINS</h2><p>[Our object in dealing with sins includes all the sins we have committed. In carrying it out, however, God does not require us to deal with all the sins at once, but to deal with all those that we are conscious of while in fellowship with Him. We do not mean to say that we must deal with all the sins that we have actually committed, but only with those we are conscious of while in fellowship with God. The basis, therefore, of dealing with our sins is the consciousness we have while in fellowship with God.<p>We can leave undealt with for the time being the sins of which we are not aware, until such time as we do become aware of them in fellowship with God. Practically speaking, dealing with sins is not an ordinance of the law, but a requirement of fellowship.] Once our fellowship with God is hindered due to unconfessed sins, then our experience and growth of life become abnormal. Therefore, we must confess our sins as soon as the Lord exposes them in our fellowship with Him. Then we will have life and peace all the time.<h2 class=head1>IV. THE LIMIT OF OUR DEALINGS WITH SINS</h2><p>[The limit of our dealing with sins is similar to that of our clearance of the past. It is life and peace. When we deal with sins, we should do it until we have life and peace within. If we follow our consciousness in dealing with sins, we will feel inwardly satisfied, strengthened, refreshed, and quickened; we will also feel joyful, restful, comfortable, and secure. Our spirit will be strong and living, and our fellowship with the Lord will be free and without hindrance. Our prayers will be releasing and with authority, and our utterance will be bold and powerful. All these senses and experiences are the conditions of life and peace. This is the limit of our dealing with sins, and this also is the result of our dealing with sins. What we have said before about dealing with sins thoroughly implies that we deal with sins to such a state of life and peace.]<h2 class=head1>V. THE PRACTICE OF DEALING WITH SINS</h2><p>[How should we deal with the actual committing of sin? If we have offended God, we must deal with it before God and ask His forgiveness. If we have sinned against man, we should deal with it before man by asking man&#8217;s forgiveness. If our act of sinning against man involves only a moral matter, we have only to confess this and apologize before man. If it also involves a loss of money and profits, then we should pay accordingly the amount we owe. This act of apologizing and reimbursing applies not only to sins committed after we are saved; we must also deal with all those sins committed before we were saved; we must deal with them one by one before man according to the inner consciousness. This dealing with sins before man is the major part of this matter of dealing with sins, and we should take heed to practice it.<p>Every sinful act of ours, when become known to others, whether it causes damage to them or not, results in a discordant condition between us. For instance: if we abuse or curse another person, we have on one hand a record of sin before God, and we have made on the other hand a bad impression upon the one we have cursed and also upon any others who were present. Thus, it is difficult for us all to live together in harmony as before. Therefore, if, after being enlightened, we become conscious of this, we have on the one hand to confess it to God and ask His forgiveness, and on the other hand to go to the persons concerned-the one who was cursed and any others who were present-to apologize and also to deal with what we have said. By doing this, the bad impression we have given them will be eradicated, and we can live together as formerly. The dispelling of a discordant situation is in relation to man, but the possession of a clean conscience, void of offense, is in relation to ourselves. <p>If the sin we have committed involves material things or the gain of others, we should make restitution. When we restore what we have taken, we should pay according to the original value and add a little more to compensate for the loss. In the Old Testament, in Leviticus 5, it is stated that one fifth should be added. In the New Testament we have the example of Zacchaeus (Luke 19) restoring fourfold to those whom he had cheated. These are not laws or regulations, but principles and examples to show us that whenever we make restitution, we should add something to the original value.]<h2 class=head1>VI. DEALING WITH SINS AND LIFE</h2><p>[Since dealing with sins has such a close relationship with our spiritual life, we should endeavor to experience this lesson continuously. Although this experience is not a deep one, yet no one can be so spiritual as to say that they have no need to deal with sins. It is difficult to graduate from this lesson. We should not only ask ourselves, therefore, if we have ever had these experiences, but we should also ask ourselves if we are now living in such an experience. We not only have to wash our face, but we need to wash it every day. If we washed our face three years ago and have not washed it since, it must be a dreadful looking face! In the same manner, unless we are free from committing sins every day, we need to deal with sins daily.]<p>We should keep a short account with the Lord concerning sins. When He exposes, we confess (agree), He forgives and cleanses, fellowship is restored, we receive life, we get filled with the Spirit, then we grow in life. It is so wonderful. Why argue with Him? In this way we get all that God is. His element will increase in us and our human element will decrease. What a way to grow in life! What a full salvation! Praise the Lord!<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>What is the difference between sin and sins?</li><li>What is the basis of our dealing with sins?</li><li>To what extent should we deal with sins?</li><li>When does God forgive our sins?</li><li>List five verses that show a practical dealing of our sins.</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>The Experience of Life, pp. 48-64.</li></ol><h1 class=msg>Lesson Fourteen</h1><h1 class=msg>DEALING WITH THE WORLD</h1><h2 class=head2>Scripture Reading</h2><h1 class=scripture>1 John 5:4; Gen. 2:9; 4:14, 16, 20-22; James 4:4; 1 John 2:15-16; 1 Pet. 3:20-21; 1 Cor. 10:1-2; Rom. 8:6</h1><h2 class=head2>Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The difference between sin and the world</li><li>The formation of the world	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Man&#8217;s need</li>	<li>A godless civilization</li>	<li>Satan&#8217;s system</li>	</ol></li><li>The definition of the world</li><li>The contents of the satanic system</li><li>Delivered from the world through baptism</li><li>The objects of dealing with the world</li><li>The basis of dealing with the world</li><li>The extent of dealing with the world</li><li>The practice of dealing with the world	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Not loving the world</li>	<li>The regenerated spirit overcoming the world</li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class=head2>Text</h2><p>Knowing and dealing with the world is very important in the initial experience of our Christian life; therefore, we shall study it carefully.<h2 class=head1>I. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SIN AND THE WORLD</h2><p>The contamination of sin and of the world differ. [The contamination of sin is savage, rough and ugly, while the contamination of the world is cultured and refined, often appearing beautiful in the sight of man. The contamination of sin is like a splash of mud or black ink on a white shirt. But the contamination of the world is like a colorful pattern printed on the white shirt.] [The world appears better than sin, but when related to purity, both are contaminating and require dealing. The damage caused by sin and the world upon man differ greatly: sin contaminates man, whereas the world both contaminates and possesses man. It is far more serious for man&#8217;s life to be possessed by the world than to be contaminated by sin.]<p>[Sin is the primitive, superficial, and initial step of the fall. The world is the final, serious and last step of the fall. Many people stress only victory over sin, but the Bible stresses even more the overcoming of the world (1 John 5:4). We need even more to overcome the world. If we desire to grow in life and be gained by the Lord, we must make an effort to deal with the world that enslaves us.]<h2 class=head1>II. THE FORMATION OF THE WORLD</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Man&#8217;s Need</h2><p>The Bible [divides man&#8217;s needs into three main categories: provision, protection, and pleasure. In order to maintain his existence, he needs not only the various provisions, such as clothing, food, etc., but also a means of defense to protect himself from being hurt and a form of amusement for his happiness. Therefore, the entire need for human living is included in these three all-embracing categories.<p>Prior to the fall, God was responsible for providing for these three needs of man. First, before man was created, God had made provision for all necessities of human life. When Adam was in the garden of Eden, various kinds of fruit and vegetables, water, air, sunshine, and a place for shelter were provided.<p>Second, protection or defense was also God&#8217;s responsibility in the beginning. Today, man needs self-protection and self-defense, but in the beginning God Himself was his defense and protection. When man is under God&#8217;s care, he can escape any attack or danger.<p>Third, pleasure was also God&#8217;s responsibility. Some people think that amusement is sinful, but this concept is wrong. Happiness is essential to human life and is found in amusement. &#8220;And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food&#8217;&#8217; (Gen. 2:9). All the trees in the garden of Eden not only bore fruit for food, but were also pleasing and enjoyable to the eye, making one happy. God not only prepared this happy environment; at the same time He Himself was the joy of man. If man has God as his enjoyment, then man&#8217;s joy is fulfilled.<p>In the beginning these three great needs-supply, defense and amusement-were planned and prepared for by God.]<h2 class=head2>B. A Godless Civilization</h2><p>[Man fell by committing sin and was expelled from the garden of Eden! His relationship with God became abnormal. But God prepared a covering of skins for man&#8217;s redemption, enabling him to remain in His presence. As yet, man had not lost God. However, during Cain&#8217;s lifetime man fell deeper into sin. Cain said to God, &#8220;Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid&#8217;&#8217; (Gen. 4:14). &#8220;And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah&#8217;&#8217; (v. 16). Thus man left God&#8217;s presence completely and lost God.<p>When he lost God, man naturally lost God&#8217;s provision, protection, and pleasure. When man lost God&#8217;s care for his livelihood, he first experienced fear; he feared the lack of supply, defense, and happiness. In other words, he feared poverty, danger, and boredom with life. Therefore, in order to meet the necessities of life and survive, man used his own strength and devised means of supply, defense, and amusement. From this time, man created a godless civilization.<p>Genesis 4 clearly reveals this to us. After the fall of Cain, out of his descendants were produced the founders of man&#8217;s own supply for these three great needs of life. These were the three sons of Lamech. Jabal was the father of tent-dwellers and cattlemen. Tents and cattle are for the supply of man&#8217;s living and therefore belong to the category of provision. Another son, Jubal, was the father of all that handle the harp and organ. Playing harp and organ is for pleasure; thus it belongs to the category of amusement. The third son, Tubalcain, was the instructor of every artificer in brass and iron instruments. These instruments were formed for the purpose of defense, thus referring to the category of protection. Since these three important inventions originated at that time, humanity found no need of God. Man found within himself the answer to the need of supply, defense, and amusement. This was the civilization produced after the human race lost God-a godless life created by men.]<h2 class=head2>C. Satan&#8217;s System</h2><p>[When mankind lived a godless life, Satan immediately disguised himself and utilized these avenues as a means to possess man. He caused man to employ his entire effort to seek food and clothing for self-nurture, to invent instruments for self-defense and to design various forms of amusements for self-enjoyment.]<p>[In the beginning, these various forms of occupations involving man&#8217;s livelihood seemed rather trivial, scattered and unsystematized. Later, Satan organized these into a more tangible and systematized world, thus entangling mankind in a tighter web.]<p>[Therefore, the formation of the world has five steps. First, man lost God. Second, he developed fear and was desperate concerning his needs. Third, he created a godless life. Fourth, Satan disguised himself and utilized man&#8217;s needs. Fifth, Satan organized man&#8217;s own supply for his needs into a system. At the completion of these five steps the world was finally formed.]<h2 class=head1>III. THE DEFINITION OF THE WORLD</h2><p>First John 2:15 says, &#8220;Do not love the world, neither the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.&#8217;&#8217; The Greek word for world, kosmos, has more than one meaning. [In Matthew 25:34; John 17:5; Acts 17:24; Ephesians 1:4; and Revelation 13:8, it denotes the material universe as a system created by God. In John 1:29; 3:16; and Romans 5:12, it denotes the fallen human race corrupted and usurped by Satan as components for his evil world system. In 1 Peter 3:3 it denotes adorning, ornament. Here, as in John 15:19; 17:14; and James 4:4, it denotes an order, a set form, an orderly arrangement, hence, an ordered system (set up by Satan, the adversary of God), not the earth. God created man to live on the earth for the fulfillment of His purpose. But His enemy Satan, in order to usurp the God-created man, has formed an anti-God world system on this earth by systematizing men with religion, culture, education, industry, commerce, entertainment, etc., through men&#8217;s fallen nature in their lusts, pleasures, pursuits, and even in their indulgence in living necessities, such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation.]<h2 class=head1>IV. THE CONTENTS OF THE SATANIC SYSTEM</h2><p>[We have seen that the world in 1 John 2:15 denotes an evil, satanic, anti-God system that is constituted of the things created by God. Satan has used these things to form his system. However, these things are not the contents of the satanic world system.] What, then are the contents of the satanic system?<p>[First John 2:16 says, &#8220;Because all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.&#8217;&#8217;<p>The contents of this system are the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life. The lust of the flesh is the passionate desire of the body; the lust of the eyes is the passionate desire of the soul through the eyes; the vainglory of life is the empty pride, boast, confidence, assurance, and display of material things of the present life.]<p>[We may use owning a car as an illustration of the difference between something used by Satan to form his system and the actual contents of this system. How can a car be utilized by the enemy of God to form his evil system? The car itself is not a problem and is not the content of Satan&#8217;s system. The problem is with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and, in particular, with the vainglory of the present life. If it were not for man&#8217;s vainglory, a car would not become a problem. However, many people like to buy an expensive car in order to make a display. In their case, the car they drive is used for vainglory. In this country a car is a necessity. The problem, therefore, is not with the car itself; the problem is with the lust of the eyes and the pride of life. When you consider a certain kind of car, you may desire to have it. Some may think about a certain car day and night. The car is not wrong-the persons are wrong. The problem is not with the car they need; the problem is with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life.]<h2 class=head1>V. DELIVERED FROM THE WORLD THROUGH BAPTISM</h2><p>[Through baptism we are delivered from the world by water. Noah&#8217;s family was saved through the flood which destroyed the world and thus was delivered from the corrupted world. The Israelites were saved through the water of the Red Sea which drowned the Egyptian army, and they were thus delivered from the Egyptian world which ruled over them. Baptism is foreshadowed by these two incidents of passing through the waters of death (1 Pet. 3:20-21; 1 Cor. 10:1-2). Baptism by immersion delivers us from the world. Therefore, when a believer is baptized, he has passed through both the flood and the Red Sea. His ascent from the water denotes his separation from the world.]<h2 class=head1>VI. THE OBJECTS OF DEALING WITH THE WORLD</h2><p>[The world in our daily living consists of people, activities, and things which usurp the place of God in us. Therefore, these objects are the aim of our dealings.<p>How do we know what objects are usurping us, and what is the standard of measurement? First, we need to see whether these objects exceed the necessities of our life. We can say that anything that goes beyond our daily necessities is taking the place of God and possessing us; thus, it needs to be dealt with. Our existence depends upon certain people, activities, and things, such as parents, husband, wife, family, clothes, food, housing, transportation, occupation, etc. These are the necessities for our existence. If these necessities contribute to our purpose of living for God, they are not our world. But should these people, activities, or things exceed our daily necessities, they then become our world. For example: clothing as a necessity is not worldly, but if one pays too much attention to apparel and ornaments, or squanders money in order to comply with present-day fashions, he has already exceeded the scope of his daily necessities. Consequently, these excesses have become his world. Another example: glasses to correct defective eyesight are not worldly. But some wear glasses to be fashionable; this then is not their necessity, but the world they love.<p>What is the standard that regulates our daily necessities in regard to people, activities, and things? In the Bible there is no uniform or specific standard governing these matters.] [Therefore, the standard of our living necessities must be determined by ourselves through prayer and seeking the mind of God. We cannot measure our standard according to that of others nor demand that they agree with our views and feelings. Furthermore, our own dealings before God should also be according to the standard of our daily living before God. We should neither go beyond nor fall short.]<p>[From the divine viewpoint there is a certain measuring rule regarding the world. This rule is God Himself. As we measure sin by the law of God, so we measure the world by God Himself. The standard of dealing with the world is based upon God. If God is absent, we cannot sense what the world is. God and the world are forever in opposition to each other. Wherever there is the world, there God is not; where there is God, there the world is not.]<h2 class=head1>VII. THE BASIS OF DEALING WITH THE WORLD</h2><p>[The basis of our dealing with the world is the same as dealing with sin. It is based upon the sense of life obtained during fellowship. God has never asked an individual to separate himself in a moment&#8217;s time from all unholiness and all things which usurp him. God wants man to deal with the things which he feels are unholy and usurping. Practically speaking, there may be one hundred unholy things in us, but during our fellowship we become conscious, perhaps, of only ten. Therefore, God holds us responsible for only these ten. Temporarily, we are not responsible for the remaining ninety. Not until we have attained to a greater degree of fellowship in life do we become conscious of the remaining objects and deal with them.]<p>[There are two factors which greatly influence our inner feeling toward the world: our love for God and our spiritual growth in life. We have said that God is the standard for dealing with the world. If we are far from God, we are not conscious of our worldliness. But once we draw nigh to God, we discover many worldly matters in us. Only those who love God desire to draw nigh unto God. Therefore, if we desire to deal with the world, we should first love God.]<p>[Our inner feeling towards the world also depends upon our spiritual growth. The more we advance in the spiritual life and knowledge of God, the deeper we will be in knowing the world. This knowledge of the world is the inner feeling we have toward the world and forms the basis of dealing with the world. The degree of our spiritual growth is always in proportion to the degree of our dealing with the world.]<h2 class=head1>VIII. THE EXTENT OF DEALING WITH THE WORLD</h2><p>[The extent to which we deal with the world is &#8220;life and peace&#8217;&#8217; (Rom. 8:6). Whenever we deal with the world which we are conscious of, we should deal with it until we have peace and life within. Since these dealings are based upon the feelings of life which are derived from fellowship, they are experiences of life. Dealing with the world causes us to experience life and sense the freshness, brightness, satisfaction, strength, joy and peace of life. In other words, we should deal with the world to the extent that we have life and peace.]<h2 class=head1>IX. THE PRACTICE OF DEALING WITH THE WORLD</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Not Loving the World</h2><p>[In 1 John 2:15 John charges us not to love the world or the things in the world. He tells us that if we love the world, the love of the Father is not in us. Not loving such a world is the ground for overcoming the evil one. Loving it just a little gives the evil one the ground to defeat us and occupy us. Whenever we open ourselves to the world, to Satan&#8217;s anti-God system, we lose the battle against him.]<h2 class=head2>B. The Regenerated Spirit Overcoming the World</h2><p>[According to 1 John 5:4, everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world.] In this verse &#8220;everything&#8217;&#8217; refers to the human spirit. [Therefore, it is the regenerated human spirit that overcomes the world. Regarding overcoming the world, we should not trust in our own ability or effort. Our spirit is well able to overcome Satan and the world, the evil system. But in ourselves we cannot overcome the world. When we exercise our spirit, stay in our spirit, and walk by our spirit, we shall see that our spirit has the life ability to overcome all negative things. This is why we need to exercise our spirit to have fellowship with the Lord and pray concerning the enjoyment of the Lord. We also need to exercise our spirit to call on the Lord&#8217;s name and to pray-read the Word. This exercise stirs up the ability in our spirit to overcome the world.<p>It is the divine life in our spirit that has the ability to overcome the evil, satanic world. We are surrounded by temptations. What can overcome them? The divine life in our spirit can overcome temptation. We all need to see that our spirit is mingled with the divine life and is the organ that can overcome the world.]<p>We are created by God, redeemed by Christ and regenerated by the Spirit, therefore, we are for God alone. We belong to God. We need to be occupied by Him alone. Anything of the world that occupies us must be dealt with. We experience life as we are dealing with the world. We grow in life after we have dealt with the world.

We need to see further how to experience life in a deeper way-dealing with the flesh and the self. Most people on the earth are not Christians. America is reportedly a Christian country; about half of the people say that they are Christians. Yet, most of them are not even regenerated, that is, having received the life of God. Of those who have been regenerated, many are still living in sin. The more mature Christians stay away from sin, yet very few are not possessed by the world. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery, Christians talk about dealing with the flesh and the self. This is a much deeper aspect of the experience of life. This short lesson cannot cover these two topics adequately. We will only get a basic understanding at this point. You must read The Experience of Life to get more details.<h2 class=head1>I. THE DEFINITION OF THE FLESH</h2><p>[We can find at least three definitions in the Bible of the flesh:]<h2 class=head2>A. The Corrupted Body</h2><p>[The first definition of the flesh in the Bible is our corrupted body. The body is the body created by God; flesh is something corrupted. God did not create a flesh; He only created a body. But Satan came into the members of this body. Romans 7:23 tells us clearly that the law of sin is in the members of our body. When Adam ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, that fruit entered into the members of his body. So the body is created by God, but sin as a personified matter, Satan himself, entered into man, into his body. Since then man&#8217;s body created by God became corrupted and ruined. That corrupted and ruined body is the flesh.]<h2 class=head2>B. The Whole Fallen Man</h2><p>[The flesh does not refer merely to man&#8217;s fallen and corrupted body. Rather, it refers to the totality of man&#8217;s fallen being. The flesh is therefore the uttermost expression of the fallen tripartite man. Hence, the flesh in this sense includes man&#8217;s body, soul, and spirit. If you consider the works of the flesh listed in Galatians 5:19-21, you will find that some, such as fornication, uncleanness, sensuality, and drunkenness, are related to the lust of the corrupted body; others, such as enmities, strife, angers, and divisions, are related to the fallen soul; and still others, idolatry and sorcery, are related to the deadened spirit. This proves that the three parts of our fallen being are involved with the evil flesh. Therefore, in Galatians the flesh denotes the whole of man&#8217;s fallen being. The flesh is not just a part of man&#8217;s fallen being; it includes the totality of the fallen tripartite man.]<h2 class=head2>C. The Good Aspect of Man</h2><p>[Usually when we mention the flesh, we think that the flesh is corrupt and wicked, just as mentioned in Galatians 5:19-21. But the Bible shows us that the flesh has not only an evil aspect, but also a good aspect. The good flesh desires to do good and to worship and serve God. Paul in Philippians 3:3-6 indicated that there were some who worshipped God in the flesh and boasted in their flesh. The flesh there undoubtedly refers to flesh in its good aspect, for by it man worships God and through it man boasts.<p>Why is there a good aspect of man or of the flesh? Because although we are the people who fell deeply, we still have some good element which was originally created by God. Therefore, we often want to do good and serve God. But, after all, man or the flesh in its good aspect is weak and powerless, not being able to do either. In the sight of God, we, the fallen men, controlled by the flesh, wholly became flesh. Anything which originates in us, whether good or bad, is of the flesh and does not please God. Therefore, not only our temper, hatred, or anything against God which originates in us are of the flesh, but the gentleness, love, and even the service to God which originates in us are also of the flesh. Whatever originates in us, whether good or bad, is of the flesh. We have to know the flesh to such an extent; then we have really touched the meaning of the flesh.]<h2 class=head1>II. THE POSITION OF THE FLESH BEFORE GOD</h2><p>[What is the position of the flesh before God? What is God&#8217;s attitude toward the flesh? This matter is clearly mentioned in many places in the Bible; however, we can only point out here the most important passages.]<h2 class=head2>A. God Cannot Mingle with the Flesh</h2><p>[Exodus 30:31-32: &#8220;Upon the flesh of man shall it (the holy anointing oil) not be poured.&#8217;&#8217; The holy anointing oil typifies the Holy Spirit, which is God Himself. Therefore, the declaration that the holy anointing oil must not be poured upon man&#8217;s flesh means that God cannot mingle or unite with the flesh.]<h2 class=head2>B. God and the Flesh Cannot Exist Together</h2><p>[Exodus 17:14, 16: &#8220;Jehovah said unto Moses...I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven... Jehovah has sworn: Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.&#8217;&#8217;] [The Israelites as the descendants of Jacob typify the chosen, regenerated part within us, that is the new man in our spirit belonging to Christ. The Amalekites as the descendants of Esau typify the fallen natural part within us, that is the old man in the flesh belonging to Adam. Esau and Jacob were twins, but their descendants, the Amalekites and the Israelites, were mutual enemies; they could not stand together. Likewise, our fleshly old man is very close to our spiritual new man; the two are also mutual enemies and cannot stand together. The fact that God would have war with Amalek shows us how God hates the flesh and desires to exterminate it. If the flesh is not exterminated and there is no dealing with it, our spiritual life will have no way to grow. The two can never compromise or co-exist.]<h2 class=head2>C. God is Determined to Remove the Flesh</h2><p>[In the Old Testament God did one specific thing to express His attitude toward the flesh-He established circumcision. The first man whom God commanded to perform the act of circumcision was Abraham (Gen. 17). God promised Abraham that his descendants would be as the stars in the heavens and as the sands of the sea. But as God delayed in the fulfillment of His promise, Abraham took Hagar as his wife and bore Ishmael. Thus, he used the strength of his flesh to fulfill God&#8217;s promise. God was not pleased with him, and for thirteen years God hid Himself. Then, when Abraham was ninety-nine years old, God appeared again to him (Gen. 16:15; 17:1). At this appearance God commanded Abraham and all that belonged to him to be circumcised. This means God desired that the flesh be removed so that henceforth they would not serve God in the flesh.]<h2 class=head2>D. The Bible&#8217;s Conclusion of the Flesh</h2><p>[Romans 8:8: &#8220;They that are in the flesh cannot please God.&#8217;&#8217; The Bible has spoken much about the flesh, and at this point it concludes that the flesh cannot please God. If man belongs to the flesh, minds the flesh, and lives by the flesh, whatever he does, either good or bad, cannot please God.] How about you? Do you want to please God? If you do, you must live in the spirit and deal with the flesh.<h2 class=head1>III. DEALING WITH THE FLESH</h2><p>[Whatever belongs to our being, because it is flesh, needs to be dealt with. But how do we deal with the flesh? We will discuss this in two aspects: the objective fact and the subjective experience.]<h2 class=head2>A. The Objective Fact</h2><p>[The objective fact in dealing with the flesh is completely related to Christ. Galatians 2:20 says, &#8220;I have been crucified with Christ.&#8217;&#8217; Again, Romans 6:6 says, &#8220;Our old man has been crucified with him.&#8217;&#8217; These two passages clearly show us that when Christ was nailed to the cross, we were crucified with Him. Our fleshly being has been dealt with on the cross of Christ.] [The fact that we have been crucified with Christ is the basis of our dealing with the flesh. If we had never been crucified with Christ, none of us could deal with the flesh. Therefore, our dealing with the flesh is to bring forth in experience the fact that we have died with Christ.]<h2 class=head2>B. The Subjective Experience-By the Spirit</h2><p>Galatians 5:24 says, &#8220;But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts.&#8217;&#8217; Romans 8:13 says, &#8220;For if you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.&#8217;&#8217; Although objectively, we have been crucified, like all spiritual realities, we must experience it in the spirit. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of reality. He is able to make all the objective facts real to us every day. If we realize that we are lusting after something or someone, immediately, we need to call on the Lord and pray, &#8220;Lord forgive me. That was the lust of the flesh. That does not please You. You want to remove that, and so do I. Lord, I turn to You right now. Free me from my flesh.&#8217;&#8217; If you pray like this, you are exercising your spirit to crucify the flesh and to put it to death. It is simple and effective. We should not say, &#8220;Wait until I grow in life, then the flesh will be put to death automatically by the Spirit.&#8217;&#8217; No. The way to grow in life is to exercise our spirit to put the flesh to death.<h2 class=head1>IV. THE DEFINITION OF SELF</h2><p>After seeing the matter of dealing with the flesh, we must go on to see that our self also needs to be dealt with. This is a deeper dealing to cause us to grow higher in life. Remember, growth in life is the increase of God in us and the decrease of ourselves. To deal with the self is to decrease ourselves.<h2 class=head2>A. Self is the Soul Life</h2><p>What is self? [Simply, self is the soul life with the emphasis on human thoughts and human opinions. We can discover this from the Bible, where self is clearly mentioned.]<p>In Matthew 16:21-25 Jesus spoke about His going to the cross and being raised on the third day. That was to accomplish redemption and to build up the church according to God&#8217;s will. But Peter had a different opinion, and after voicing it, the Lord rebuked him and said, &#8220;Get behind Me, Satan!&#8217;&#8217; Jesus continued to say, &#8220;If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me...whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.&#8217;&#8217; To the Lord, the self is just the soul-life, the expression of the self is opinion, which is an expression of Satan. Peter was concerned for the Lord&#8217;s safety. But in his concern, he did not care for God&#8217;s will; rather, he allowed Satan to be expressed. Therefore, the Lord rebuked him as Satan.<h2 class=head2>B. The Damage of Self</h2><p>[A person who is full of self always brings many difficulties into the church. The reason for so many divisions in Christianity today is not only the sinfulness and worldliness of man, but more so the self of man.] Throughout history, the church has not been as damaged by persecution or other things as it has been damaged by the self. Martin Luther once said that although he was afraid of the pope, he was more afraid of the stronger pope, the self, within his own heart. Nothing damages and frustrates the building up of the church more than the self. The self is the embodiment of the soul, which is expressed through the mind. Thus, the self, the soul, and the mind are three-in-one. Behind these three is Satan, who manipulates the self in order to damage the church life. We all need to heed this word for ourselves.<p>If we are not saved, we would be in sin. If we do not love the Lord, we would be in the world. When we love the Lord and we care for His church, we may express opinions to damage it. It does not mean that we should not say anything in the church. We need to pray to be in spirit. Then we should not insist on our own view, but should always speak in the fear of the Lord and be willing to be adjusted.<h2 class=head1>V. DEALING WITH SELF</h2><p>[How is self dealt with? In other words, how should we deal with self? The Bible only says that our old man has been crucified with Christ. The Bible never says specifically that our self has been crucified with the Lord. In spite of this, the way to deal with self is still the cross, just as the way to deal with the flesh is the cross. In considering this matter, we will divide it into the objective fact and the subjective experience.]<h2 class=head2>A. The Objective Fact</h2><p>[The objective fact in dealing with self, just as in dealing with the flesh, rests in Christ; that is, our old man has been crucified with Him. This is because self is part of the expression of the old man. With God, the problem of the old man has already been solved; thus self, which is of the old man, has also been solved. Therefore, on the objective side, the only fact is that our old man has been crucified.]<h2 class=head2>B. The Subjective Experience</h2><p>[The subjective experience in dealing with the self, just as in dealing with the flesh, is through the Holy Spirit. If we have seen the fact that our old man has been crucified, then in our daily living, whenever we discover the expressing of our own ideas or opinions, we must let the Holy Spirit work the death of the cross upon these ideas and opinions to put them to death.]<h2 class=head2>C. Bearing the Cross</h2><p>[Today, in fallen Christianity, many truths have been misunderstood. The truth of bearing the cross is a case in point. Many people misinterpret the bearing of the cross as suffering. This is a wrong concept, a concept which we have inherited from Roman Catholicism. We should realize that the emphasis of the cross is not suffering, but death. When a person goes to the cross, the main thing is to go there not to suffer, but to die. When we mention execution by shooting today, we understand that that means death. Likewise, in the time of the Lord Jesus, whenever the cross was mentioned, man&#8217;s understanding of it was death.]<p>If we experience suffering, that means we are not bearing the cross. Remember that in the compound ointment there is myrrh, which signifies the sweetness of the death of Christ. As we exercise our spirit to put our self on the cross, we should not experience suffering, rather, we should be enjoying His sweet death which is effective to kill our self. Along with this, we should also have His resurrection power operating in us to enable us to follow Him.<h2 class=head1>VI. APPLYING THE EXPERIENCE OF DEALING WITH SELF</h2><h2 class=head2>A. In the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>[The applying of the experience of dealing with self is firstly in the fellowship in the Holy Spirit. Though we understand the crucifying of the old man and know that our opinions are the expression of self, yet if we do not live in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, it is but an empty doctrine and does not afford any practical experience. If we do not live in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit and yet try to deal with self, such exercise is exactly like the strenuous efforts practiced by the Buddhists, Hindus, and Chinese moralists; it is not a spiritual experience. Only the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth, the Spirit of reality.] [Therefore, if we desire to live continuously in the experience of dealing with self, the basic requirement is to live in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.]<h2 class=head2>B. Letting the Holy Spirit Execute the Crucifixion of Christ upon Us</h2><p>[If we live in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit and touch the Holy Spirit, then we must allow the Holy Spirit to execute the crucifixion of Christ upon all our living and actions. This allowing is our cooperation with the Holy Spirit. When we allow the Holy Spirit to perform His work in us, it means that we are cooperating with Him. In this way it is on one hand that we apply the crucifixion of Christ through the Holy Spirit, and on the other hand that we let the Holy Spirit execute Christ&#8217;s crucifixion in us. On one hand it is our doing, and on the other hand it is the working of the Holy Spirit-it is impossible to separate one from the other in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. At this time we are living in Romans 8, in the law of the Spirit of life; we are putting to death all the expressions of the old man through the Holy Spirit.<p>If one who loves God has a pliable will, and he is willing to cooperate with the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit will bring him deeper and deeper into the cross and put his self thoroughly to death.] Through these experiences, the life of God will grow in us. The element of God will increase and our human element will decrease.<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Give the three definitions of the flesh in the Bible.</li><li>Briefly state God&#8217;s attitude toward the flesh.</li><li>Upon which fact do we base our dealings with the flesh?</li><li>What do we have that enables us to execute the cross of Christ upon our flesh?</li><li>Use Matthew 16 to show that the self is equal to the soul life.</li><li>How does Matthew 16 reveal the relationship between self, opinion and Satan?</li><li>What has been the most damaging element to the building up of the church through the ages?</li><li>What is the proper understanding of the truth of bearing the cross?

NATURAL CONSTITUTION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Definition</h2><p>Dealing with the natural constitution is a deeper dealing. You may ask, &#8220;What is the natural constitution?&#8217;&#8217; [&#8220;Constitution&#8217;&#8217; as used here means &#8220;the aggregate of man&#8217;s physical and mental powers.&#8217;&#8217; In the Bible there is no such term as the natural constitution, and it is seldom mentioned among Christians; yet in our experience there is such a thing. It is an outstanding characteristic of the soulish man and a prominent expression of the living out of the old man which has to do with human ability, capability, wisdom, cleverness, schemes, and skills.]<p>Jacob, in the Old Testament, was a good example. [He was able, resourceful, full of schemes, and very capable and skillful; he was truly one who was exceedingly strong in the natural constitution.<p>Jacob&#8217;s natural constitution was expressed even before his birth. In his mother&#8217;s womb he took hold of Esau&#8217;s heel, striving to come out first. When he grew up, he cleverly schemed to gain a position of advantage. He used intrigue and cheated Esau of the birthright. Then by a clever device he obtained the blessing of the first-born from his father. When he left home, in his wanderings, God appeared to him at Bethel and promised to bless him; then also he applied his skill and bargained with God. He said, &#8220;If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father&#8217;s house in peace, and Jehovah will be my God, then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God&#8217;s house; and of all that thou shall give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee&#8217;&#8217; (Gen. 28:20-22). God had promised to bless him without any terms, nevertheless, he bargained with God on certain conditions. This only proves how smart and clever he was!<p>The reason Jacob was so scheming is that he was so strong in the natural constitution. Therefore, throughout his whole life, God especially dealt with his natural constitution. The afflictions, sufferings, and troubles which beset him were for the breaking of his natural constitution. The crisis in his life occurred when God touched the hollow of his thigh at Penuel. Finally, in Genesis 35, God asked him to go to Bethel and there make an altar unto God, who had appeared unto him when he fled from the face of his brother. From thence Jacob ceased all his scheming, and his natural man fell before God. All his ability, schemes, cleverness, and capability evidently disappeared and ceased. His whole being had changed completely.]<h2 class=head2>B. Dealing with the Natural Constitution</h2><p>[Flesh, self, and the natural constitution-all three-are the expressions of the old man. Therefore, the principle in dealing with them is the same: on one hand we have the objective fact, and on the other hand we need the subjective experience. The objective fact is that Christ has already crucified our old man, while the subjective experience is the applying of the death of Christ through the Holy Spirit to ourselves. If we apply it to the flesh, it is the dealing with the flesh; if we apply it to our opinion, it is the dealing with self; and if we apply it to our ability and capability, it is the dealing with the natural constitution.]<p>Do not say that you do not need to study anymore, because God wants to deal with our natural abilities. Though God does want to deal with our natural abilities, we still need to be educated and be well trained in every area of our human life. You may ask why. God wants vessels to contain Him, to express Him, to serve Him, and to build up His church together with Him. If you cannot read, how can He show you His revelation through His word? If you cannot write, you would not be able to write a gospel tract. We need to be highly educated, as high as we can attain.<p>[Acts 7:22 says, &#8220;Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.&#8217;&#8217; Under God&#8217;s sovereignty, Moses learned all the Egyptian wisdom while staying in the royal palace as the son of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter. Through his Egyptian education, he became highly cultured and received the highest learning of the world.] [Do not think that God will use your strength or energy for the fulfillment of His purpose. In order to be used by God, we need to have a heart for Him and His interests, but our natural strength must be set aside.] [God took the first forty years of Moses&#8217; life to build up a man who was strong in the natural life, and then He took another forty years to strip this man of all his natural ability.] This is the way God perfected Moses.<p>The same principle holds true for us. We need to endeavor to learn all that is useful, yet knowing that God will deal with our natural abilities and then use us. Young people should aspire to get the best grades and the highest degree, yet not hold on to nor depend on such things.<h2 class=head1>II. INDIVIDUALISM</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Definition</h2><p>God&#8217;s intention is not only to have many individual sons, but to also have a Body for Christ. Individually, we may grow in life and express the Lord in our daily living, yet that is not the fullness of Christ. Ephesians 1:22-23 says, &#8220;The church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&#8217;&#8217; Individual Christians are not the fullness of Christ, the church is the fullness of Christ. Ephesians 3:18-19 says, &#8220;May be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,...that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&#8217;&#8217; Again, individually we cannot apprehend the dimensions of Christ nor are we able to be all the fullness of God, but corporately we can. On one hand the Lord died for us individually, on the other hand He died for the Body (Eph. 5:25b). Many Christians like to say that Jesus is our personal Savior. That is correct, but not complete, because He is called the Savior of the Body (Eph. 5:23b). He did not just save us as individuals, but as members of the Body for the Body.<p>When Adam took in the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil he became independent of God. The Bible also tells us that men became independent of one another. This nature of independence is ingrained in us, causing us to be individualistic. When we read the Bible, we want to read it our way. If others would not take our way, we would go and read it by ourselves or not read it at all. In serving the Lord it is the same. Today, many Christians are serving the Lord, yet they serve the Lord independently. Why? It is due to our individualism. Because of individualism, the Body of Christ cannot be built. We need to be saved from individualism for the Body of Christ. Only life can save us from our individualism.<h2 class=head2>B. Dealing with Individualism</h2><p>Since individualism is a result of the fall and is part of the old man, the way to deal with it is the same as mentioned in the previous few points. The reason most Christians do not deal with it is because they do not see the Body of Christ and do not see the evil of individualism. We need to pray that the Lord will reveal to us the Body and expose our individualistic thoughts, speech, and actions. As soon as we become aware of any trait of individualism, we must pray, &#8220;O Lord Jesus, forgive my independent ways. I am too individualistic. Lord, I repent. Cleanse me and fill me with Your Spirit. I want to be built up with others to be Your Body to express Your fullness.&#8217;&#8217; As you are praying this way, you are dealing with your individualism. You are being cleansed, being filled with the Spirit, and growing in life. Whenever His light shines on you, do not argue, but repent, confess, and pray. The Spirit will operate to work on your individualism.<p>[When we are exposed, the Lord has the opportunity to live in us. Therefore, do not blame the church. Furthermore, do not blame the Lord. Instead, you should say, &#8220;Lord, how I thank You for this situation. I love the church, not because it is perfect, but because it exposes me. Lord, lay me on the altar and deal with my mind, emotion, and will so that You can live in me.&#8217;&#8217; As the Lord lives in us, He saves us. His saving life works only as He has the opportunity to live in us. Then the divine life will save us from being individualistic. As we are saved in His life, we become the Body and members one of another. May the Lord have mercy upon us that we may see our need to be saved in His life from individualism for the building up of the Body.]<h2 class=head1>III. DIVISIVENESS</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Definition</h2><p>[In our natural makeup there is an element of divisiveness. Before we were saved, we probably did not realize that such an element existed within our being, that in our natural life there is the tendency to be divisive. Divisiveness is worse than naturalness or individualism. If someone is individualistic, he prefers to be left alone. He does not want others to bother him or to interfere with him. He simply wants to be whatever he is. But to be divisive is to cause division in an active way. In contrast to those who are individualistic, the divisive ones are aggressive to form parties. They contact the saints with the aim of dividing them. They may even travel from place to place with the intention of causing division.]<h2 class=head2>B. Divisiveness Damages the Body of Christ</h2><p>One of Satan&#8217;s main strategies against the Body of Christ is division. Consider what would happen if your hand was divided from your arm, your feet were divided from your legs, and your limbs were divided from your torso. What type of body would you have? You would be dead. The same principle can be applied to the Body of Christ. All the members receive the life supply from the head, Christ, directly, and through the members indirectly by the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, we, as the members of the Body of Christ, should endeavor to maintain the fellowship in oneness and not be divided. Then the Body will be built up in love (Eph. 4:16). The Lord Jesus said in Matthew 16:18, &#8220;I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.&#8217;&#8217; When we are built up, we are strong and victorious. When we are divided, we are weak and defeated.<p>Have you ever been divisive? Have you ever spoken anything against another saint? Have you ever had divisive thoughts? Even listening to divisive talk is divisive. Have you ever heard someone speaking against an elder or against the ministry that brought you the New Testament economy? We must reject and flee from such speaking. If we have done it ourselves, we need to repent to the Lord and to the ones to whom we have spoken in such a way. If we have thought about, but not verbalized such things, then repentance to the Lord is sufficient. If we have heard others speak this way, we must repent to the Lord and tell the speaker that neither the Lord nor you agree with such divisive talk. We must deal with any division in us thoroughly so that we may be full-grown in Christ, and be built up into the Body of Christ to be the fullness of God.<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>What do we mean by &#8220;natural constitution&#8217;&#8217;?</li><li>Why must God break down our &#8220;natural constitution&#8217;&#8217;?</li><li>What is the cause of our individualism?</li><li>What is the difference between individualism and divisiveness?</li><li>Have you been divisive toward your parents or any other saints?</li><li>Give names of Bible characters who were divisive or who had a strong natural constitution.</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>The Experience of Life, pp. 245, 253.</li><li>Life-study of Exodus, pp. 29-31.</li><li>Life-study of Romans, pp. 481-483.</li></ol><h1 class=msg>Lesson Seventeen</h1><h1 class=msg>TWO KINDS OF FRUIT OUT OF THE DIVINE LIFE</h1><h2 class=head2>Scripture Reading</h2><h1 class=scripture>Gen. 1:26; 2:8-9; Rev. 2:7; 22:1-2; 2 Pet. 1:1, 3, 8-11; Gal. 5:16, 22-23; John 15:5, 16</h1><h2 class=head2>Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Life bears fruit</li><li>The fruit of Christian virtues</li><li>The fruit of saved persons regenerated with the divine life</li><li>Bearing two kinds of fruit for a rich entrance into the coming kingdom</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Text</h2><h2 class=head1>I. LIFE BEARS FRUIT</h2><p>If you have seen the points from the previous lessons and practice accordingly, you will have much experience of life and growth in life. Many people claim to be in life. Are they really in life? Are they experiencing life every day? Are they full-grown in life? How can you tell if you and others are people of life? We do not want to see you deceived by anyone, especially yourself in this matter.<p>Every life bears fruits or results. If you plant an apple tree, apples will be produced. A pear tree will bear pears. Every life brings forth fruit by its life power according to its life shape. What about the life of God? According to the first sixteen lessons, the life of God is God Himself. It is divine, eternal, and indestructible. It is the highest and most wonderful life in the universe. It must bear divine, eternal, indestructible, the highest, and the most wonderful fruit. Is this your case?<p>In this lesson [we want to see the truth of the two kinds of fruit out of the divine life. According to the revelation of the Scriptures, there is a divine principle set up by God as His design, as His economy. This design is that God wants to dispense Himself into us human beings to live in us as our life. This divine life is a producing life, producing two kinds of fruit. God&#8217;s intention for man is revealed in the first two chapters of Genesis. God created man according to His image with the intention that man could be His vessel to contain and express Him (1:26). God Himself wanted to be man&#8217;s contents. He brought man to the tree of life in Genesis 2 because He had the desire to be within man as man&#8217;s life (vv. 8-9). This unique tree of life, which was seen at the beginning of the Bible, is also seen at its conclusion in Revelation 22. It signifies God Himself as life to us.]<p>[In Revelation 2:7 the Lord said, &#8220;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.&#8217;&#8217; According to the entire book of Revelation, the paradise of God in 2:7 is the New Jerusalem (3:12; 21:2, 10; 22:1-2, 14, 19), of which the church is a foretaste today. The paradise of God is today&#8217;s church and tomorrow&#8217;s New Jerusalem. Today we are the church, and in the future the church will be the New Jerusalem. Today&#8217;s church life is God&#8217;s paradise. In the church life, we have some taste that we are in the paradise of God. At times we may be arguing or speaking corrupt things. But while we are meeting together, singing, praising, and praying, we have the feeling that we are in paradise. Sometimes in the church meetings we are in a kind of ecstasy. When I look at the faces of the saints in a meeting, nearly every face is smiling. This is because we are happy in the paradise of God. This world is a terrible place. Even many of the unbelievers agree with this. In today&#8217;s human society, one does not have the taste of paradise; instead, one may have the taste of hell. But when we are in the church life, we are in paradise. The paradise of God is located in the local churches! To be in the church life is to live a life in paradise. Eventually the consummation of the church life in the age to come and in eternity will be the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem is the tree of life growing in the river of water of life for our eating and drinking. That will be our enjoyment in eternity. Even today we have the privilege of eating the tree of life and of &#8220;drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry&#8217;&#8217; (see Hymns, #322). In the church life, we are in the paradise of God enjoying Christ as the tree of life.<p>Today, Christ as the embodiment of God is our tree of life, and this tree of life is growing in us. The Lord Jesus told a parable of a sower going out to sow the seed (Mark 4:1-20). He is both the sower and the seed of life. He sows Himself as the seed of life into us, the earth. We are the earth that grows Christ. On the day we were regenerated, Christ was sown into our being. Our very being is the earth that contains Christ and grows Christ. We have received the divine life, and this very productive divine life is growing within us. We have to grow Christ.]<h2 class=head1>II. THE FRUIT OF CHRISTIAN VIRTUES</h2><p>[According to the Bible and according to our experience, this life produces two categories of fruit. Second Peter 1 and Galatians 5 show the first category. The first category of fruit is the category of Christian virtues. Second Peter tells us that we all have been &#8220;allotted like precious faith&#8217;&#8217; (1:1).] [God has allotted Himself to be our portion within us as our faith. Then if we are diligent to supply virtue to faith, knowledge to virtue, self-control to knowledge, endurance to self-control, godliness to endurance, and brotherly love to godliness, we will reach God Himself as the very substance of the divine love. The issue of faith as the seed of life growing within us to its full development is that God and we become one entity. Divinity is mingled with humanity to constitute us into God-men.<p>All of these virtues in 2 Peter 1 are a kind of fruit (2 Pet. 1:8). If we express these virtues day after day, this means that we are very fruitful. Day after day in our daily walk we should bear such fruit. Otherwise, people will not be able to see faith, virtue, knowledge, self-control, endurance, godliness, brotherly love, or the divine love in us. Then we will be barren, unfruitful, in these virtues. If we live by taking Christ as our life, we will bear the fruit of Christian virtues day after day. The virtues in 2 Peter 1 are actually God&#8217;s attributes. God is faith, God is love, and God is all of our Christian virtues. God&#8217;s attributes, or characteristics, become our supply in different aspects. When these divine attributes are expressed through us and by us in our daily walk, they become our virtues. These Christian virtues have been filled up with God&#8217;s attributes. The divine attributes expressed in our human virtues are the Christian virtues, which are the fruit in our character.<p>Galatians 5 is another portion of the Word that tells us about this kind of fruit. Verse 16 says that we have to walk by the Spirit so that we will not fulfill the lust of the flesh. The Spirit and the flesh are fighting against each other all day long. If we walk by the Spirit, we will bear the fruit of the Spirit, such as love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, and self-control (vv. 22-23). The fruit of the Spirit is also the divine virtues.<p>In Galatians 5 Paul talked from another angle about the same thing as Peter did. In 2 Peter the divine power, the life power, has given us all things relating to life and godliness (1:3). This divine power is just God Himself, the divine Being, the divine life. Every kind of life has its own power. God is divine, and His life is divine. He is almighty and all-powerful, and He is now within us as our life. Paul did not mention anything about the power of the divine life in Galatians 5, but he referred us to the very Holy Spirit. He said that it is by the Spirit that we can produce the fruit of Christian virtues.<p>On the one hand, the divine life as power gives us the energy to carry out all the beauties of the divine life, the virtues. On the other hand, it is the Holy Spirit by whom we can bear all the spiritual fruit. Actually, the Holy Spirit is the divine power. The Holy Spirit refers to a Person. The divine power is a kind of energy. The Person is the energy. We have to walk by the Holy Spirit as a Person. When we walk by this Person, He becomes our energy, the divine power. When we eat a good breakfast, this breakfast becomes the energy within us to energize us during the day, giving us the strength to do things. We Christians have a divine energy within us that energizes us all day long. This energy is actually a Person, the very Triune God consummated to be the all-inclusive Spirit within us. By this Person we can live a life full of virtues, which are the fruit that we bear every day.]<h2 class=head1>III. THE FRUIT OF SAVED PERSONS REGENERATED WITH THE DIVINE LIFE</h2><p>[If we are such fruit-bearing believers in the Christian virtues, the second category of fruit will be borne by us. This second category of fruit is mentioned in John 15. The Lord said that He is the vine tree and we are the branches (v. 5). The branches of the vine tree do not merely bear the fruit of the Christian virtues. The fruit borne by the branches in John 15 denotes the saved persons regenerated with the divine life through the dispensing of the branches (v. 16b). This is proved by the requirement that the bearer of this fruit should &#8220;go forth&#8217;&#8217; (v. 16a). To bear ethical and moral virtues as fruit does not require us to go forth. But to bear the fruit of persons regenerated through our dispensing of the divine life requires us to go forth to contact and reach people. We Christians should bear both the fruit of virtues and the fruit of regenerated persons.<p>If a fruit tree in an orchard does not bear any fruit, the farmer will want to cut it down. There is no beauty in a fruit tree that does not bear fruit. How would a branch of a vine look without any grapes on it? A branch with clusters of grapes on it looks beautiful. We need to bear not only the fruit of virtues as the beauties of the divine life but also the fruit of solid persons.<p>If you are not a person that bears the first category of fruit, the fruit of virtues, you will not be prevailing in the gospel regardless of what way you use. Your preaching can only be prevailing when you bear the fruit of virtues. You must be a person that lives by the divine power within you, walking by and with a Holy Person, the Holy Spirit. You must be a person living by Christ as your life and walking with the Holy Spirit as your companion to bear much fruit of virtues. Then when you speak Christ in the preaching of the gospel, the second category of fruit will be there, the fruit of persons. If you live in the flesh and the natural life during the day, you will be a &#8220;flat tire&#8217;&#8217; in the evening and will not have the standing before God&#8217;s enemy to preach the gospel. If you are a Christian that lives by Christ and walks with the Spirit, you will be full of virtues, full of beauties. Then when you go to touch sinners, all the demons will be afraid of you. This is why the gospel in the mouths of the apostles was prevailing. The word of the apostles was weighty. The same word spoken by us may be light and vain. Thus, we have to be persons bearing the fruit of the Christian virtues, which are the very expression of the divine attributes. Then we are qualified and empowered to speak Christ. The word out of our mouths will be a power to save people. The preaching of the gospel depends upon the person rather than the way. If you are not the right person, it does not matter what way you take. That way will be empty.]<h2 class=head1>IV. BEARING TWO KINDS OF FRUIT FOR A RICH ENTRANCE INTO THE COMING KINGDOM</h2><p>[We all need to rise up to have a new start. We need to forget the past, look to the Lord, and tell Him, &#8220;Lord, I am here. I want to have a new start. I want to forget about everything in the past, even the past history of my Christian life and church life. Lord, I realize that You are the divine power within me, energizing me all day long. Lord, as the Spirit You are my companion living with me. I want to live by You and to walk with You. I want to forget about everything related to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, involving matters of right or wrong and yes or no. I want to have a clean, purified, and absolutely new start with You.&#8217;&#8217; We need such a divine beginning. In simplicity we should take Christ as our divine power, energizing within us, and take Him as the life-giving Spirit, the very companion with whom we should walk all day. Then we will bear the fruit of virtues, expressing the divine attributes to be empowered, energized, and qualified to speak Christ as the gospel to others. Our speaking will be powerful and weighty. Week after week we will see the fruit of solid persons added to the fruit of our virtues. We will bear not only the fruit of the attributes of God as our virtues but also the fruit of saved, solid persons added to our virtues. We will be full of fruit in two categories: the category of virtues and the category of solid persons. We need the fruit in these two categories to afford us a rich, bountiful entrance into the coming kingdom. Many students in a school graduate, but only a few graduate with a prize or a reward. If we are faithful to bear these two kinds of fruit in this age, we will have a new church life, and we will enjoy the Lord as our reward in the coming kingdom age.]<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Life is active and living.

LIFE ISSUES IN THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>The second issue of life is the Body of Christ. When we first believed, we received the life of God into our spirit. On the one hand, we became the sons of God (John 1:12). On the other hand, we became the members of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:27). As the sons of God individually, we need to grow up in life and bear the two categories of fruit in our daily living. As the members of the Body of Christ, we need to be constituted with Christ as our life and be built up in oneness so that corporately, we may become the fullness of God. Therefore, the Body of Christ, the church, is not an organization of people, but an organism, a body of life. Without these two issues, there is no proof of our experience and growth of life. These two issues become the manifestation of the amount of life that is in us.<p>Young people must be clear about this. Many say that they enjoy the Lord, or that they have grown in the Lord, yet what outward proof do we have to substantiate their claim? Our proof is with the two issues of life. How is their daily living? Is it just like the people of the world, or is it like Christ? Is their character still loose, or has it gone through transformation? Are their friends and relatives getting saved or are they still barren? Is there a building up with the saints through fellowship and prayer, or is there murmuring, reasoning, complaining, and even divisive talk? It is not what one says, but whether one&#8217;s living bears the two issues of life. We can tell the tree by its fruit (Matt. 7:17-18). Evil trees bear evil fruit. Good trees bear good fruit. A person living in himself cannot bear fruit of life. Only a person of life bears fruit of life.<h2 class=head1>II. THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING AN ORGANISM NOT AN ORGANIZATION</h2><p>The Body of Christ, the church, is not an organization but an organism, an issue of the dispensing of the Triune God into us as life. [Not many of the Christians throughout the generations have entered into this realization. We may think that the church is just a collection, or a gathering, of all the believers as a kind of collective entity which can be considered as an organization. This is absolutely wrong. The concept of the church being an organization has led the Christians throughout the centuries into confusion, misunderstanding, and a deceived condition. Our burden today is to point out, according to the pure, divine revelation in the New Testament and especially in the book of Ephesians, that the issue of the dispensing of the divine Trinity is the church as an organism, the Body of Christ.]<p>[A wooden stand is organized with pieces of wood, but a living person with a body is something organic. A robot is an organization of lifeless material, but a living person is an organism. The church should be an organism not an organization. The teaching of Ignatius in the second century gave the ground for organization to come into the church.] [Today&#8217;s Christianity is under the influence of this concept of hierarchy and has been corrupted by it. The teaching, practice, and concept of hierarchy has led many Christians away from the church as an organism to an organization.]<p>[Every aspect of the church must be organic because the church is the issue of the living Trinity. The Bible tells us that the embodiment of God, Christ, is life. Christ told us in the Gospel of John that He is the life (John 14:6). Christ is not something organizational. As the embodiment of the Triune God, He is the totality of the divine, eternal life. The totality of life, the living Triune God, issues in one thing-the Body of Christ. Since the Triune God is the totality of life, the Body of Christ is altogether a matter of life. We should put anything that is not of life under our feet. We do not like hierarchy because it is altogether a matter of organization and has nothing to do with the organic Body of Christ.]<p>Because we are the Body of Christ, we can never be independent of one another. Independence shows a lack of life. [In God&#8217;s economy and in the Body of Christ, independence is a devilish word. We Christians should never be independent. We should not be independent of God or of one another. We cannot go on in the Christian life if we isolate ourselves from one another.] All the local churches, all the saints, all the elders, and all the workers should never be independent of one another. The life of God in all of us maintains this oneness. Any independence and division represents a lack of life, is not of life, and is not a part of the organic Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>III. THE WAY TO BUILD UP  THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>A. By the Gospel</h2><p>The first thing we must do to build up the Body of Christ is to preach the gospel. One of the definitions of life is: God the Father in the Son as the Spirit flowing into us, through us, and out of us. Therefore, before the Lord was crucified, He charged His disciples to bear fruit (John 15:16), and after His resurrection, He commissioned His disciples to go and disciple all the nations (Matt. 28:19). As we enjoy life, experience life, and grow in life, there must be the issue of the gospel. The gospel preaching will result in more members of the Body of Christ. There are so many unsaved people living in our city, but how many are in the church? The number in the church is so small compared to all the people around us. How many students are in your school, and how many are in the church? We must preach the gospel to our friends, our relatives, and our neighbors so that they may be brought into the Lord and into His Body. Without the preaching of the gospel, nobody would be saved. Without people getting saved, there would not be many members. Therefore, we must first preach the gospel to bring sinners to repentance, resulting in more members for the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head2>B. By the Growth of Life</h2><p>These newly saved members and we must grow in life for the Body of Christ (1 Pet. 2:2). Since the Body is not an organization, mere numbers mean nothing. We must have more members enjoying life, experiencing life, growing in life, filled up with life, and constituted with life. Growth in numbers coupled with growth in life is necessary. Therefore, we must grow by practicing all the points in the foregoing lessons and help the new ones to do the same. The main practices are: 1) call on the Lord and pray to maintain a strong regenerated spirit; 2) pray-read, read, study, and memorize the Word of God to be equipped with the truth; 3) live by the sense of life within our spirit every day; 4) be filled with the Spirit every day all the day by confessing and dealing with all hindrances; 5) preach the gospel; and 6) attend meetings in homes, in small groups, and with the whole church to prophesy and to testify. By these practices, you and your new ones will grow in life to be proper members of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head2>C. By Keeping the Oneness of the Spirit</h2><p>Ephesians 4:3 says, &#8220;Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.&#8217;&#8217; Without oneness, there is no way to build up the Body of Christ; therefore, we all must be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit. This oneness is of the Spirit. We have the Spirit and we have the oneness of the Spirit. The oneness of the Spirit is not something we have to pray for, rather, we must exercise our spirit to keep it. Sometimes we may want to say something against the decisions made by the elders, talk back to our parents, or gossip about a brother or sister in the church. These things divide the Body. We must turn to our spirit and drop these things so that we may keep the oneness of the Spirit. This is the way to build up the church. Negative talk tears down; the Spirit builds up. A person not living in spirit is not in oneness. A person of life is always in spirit and in oneness.<h2 class=head2>D. By Perfecting the Saints</h2><p>Ephesians 4:11-12a says, &#8220;And He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints.&#8217;&#8217; There are certain ones in the Body of Christ that are gifts to the Body. They have special functions, that is, to perfect the saints. Perfecting means nourishing, training, and enabling. When a baby is born, it may have all the innate capabilities to play the piano, yet without training, it will never play well. Training is needed for human beings to do things proficiently. In the same way, every Christian is regenerated with the divine, eternal, and indestructible life. Yet this life needs training in order to build up the Body of Christ. It needs training to preach the gospel, nourish others, teach the truth, speak forth God and build up the Body of Christ. Are you trained? We all need to be trained by the gifted ones in order for us to build up the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head2>E. By the Functions of the Perfected Saints</h2><p>All the saints are needed to build up the Body of Christ. Although there are special gifted ones in the Body, these gifted ones do not build up the Body directly. They can only build up the Body indirectly by perfecting the saints. The perfected saints must function according to the extent they have been perfected to build up the Body of Christ. Do you know how to pray? If you do, you need to pray to build up the Body. Do you know how to preach the gospel? If you do not, you must be trained, because we all must preach the gospel. If you know how to preach the gospel, then you must function by preaching. Whatever you do not know, you must learn. Whatever you know, you must function accordingly. By your functioning, the Body will be built.<p>If you want the Body to be built faster, you should perfect others based on what you have been perfected in. For example, if you have been trained in gospel preaching, you can in turn train younger ones to preach. You then become a small evangelist, a small gift to the Body. If you were trained in pray-reading, you may train a new one to pray-read; then you become a small shepherding teacher. If you have learned to compose a prophecy during the week and to prophesy in the Lord&#8217;s day meeting, then you may help a shy one to learn to prophesy by showing him or her how you pray, read, see light, then write a prophecy and prophesy in the meeting. Those that are helped by you will become perfected ones, functioning to build up the Body of Christ. The more the saints are perfected and the more they function, the sooner the Body of Christ will be built. If you perfect others as well as function to build up the Body, then you are a small apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd and teacher. When you grow up in life both spiritually and physically, you will become a full-grown apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd and teacher.<p>In summary, the issues of life are the fruit of virtues, the fruit of saved persons, and the building up of the Body of Christ in oneness.<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Tell us what the second issue of the life of God is.

REIGNING IN LIFE</h2><p>Another issue of life that we can experience in this age is reigning in life. [Simply speaking, to reign is to exercise authority for God-to rule all things and in particular to deal with His enemy. We have repeatedly mentioned in the past that in the creation of man God has a two-fold intent and desire. On one hand, God wants man to possess His image that he may express God Himself. On the other hand, God wants man to represent Him with His authority in order to deal with His enemy. Therefore, when God created man, on one hand, He created him in His image and likeness that man might be like Him. On the other hand, God caused man to &#8220;have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth&#8217;&#8217; (Gen. 1:26). This means that God gave man authority that he might reign for Him.]<p>[Therefore, from the point of view of authority, reigning is the final goal of God&#8217;s salvation. It is the summit of our spiritual experience. As for God, had He not saved us to the extent that we could reign for Him in the heavenly realm, the goal of His salvation would not have been considered fully accomplished. Furthermore, although this matter of reigning will not be completely realized until the coming of the kingdom and in eternity, yet today God wants us to have a beginning on earth. As for us, if any Christian has not yet reached the degree of reigning for God, he is not yet up to standard. A Christian who is up to standard has not only been delivered from sin, has overcome the world, has had his flesh dealt with and his natural constitution broken, has been filled with the Holy Spirit, and is sitting in the heavenly realm, but even more he is reigning with Christ in all things. Whether in God&#8217;s work, in the church, at home, or in any encounter in his environment, he can reign and rule over that which God wants him to rule. There must be such people gained by God that through them the authority of God can be executed and the kingdom of God can come upon the earth.]<p>Many times, when we see the evil situations in our school, in our neighborhood, in our city, in our country, and in the world, we may be sad, yet we do not think that anything can be done. This is not true. God has given us the authority to rule over the earth. We must exercise this authority. If we are still living in ourselves rather than in the life of God, we cannot even rule over ourselves. Our spirit will be dull and weak. But when we experience life and grow every day, our spirit will be so strong. In such a state, we would pray against all the negative things that are happening around us. We would bind the enemy in our schools. He is the one who is destroying so many young people through, drugs, alcohol, violence, boy-girl relationships (fornication), rebellion, laziness, and worldliness. Then we would pray to free our friends from these degrading, sinful, and evil things so that they may be saved through baptism into the Body of Christ. We cannot stand idle and watch them perish. We must exercise our God-given authority to rule over every situation, beginning today. This is the third issue of life.<h2 class=head1>II. THE KINGDOM REWARD</h2><p>After we have experienced life and grow in life, resulting in the issues of fruit-bearing, building up of the Body of Christ, and reigning in life, we have made ourselves ready for the Lord&#8217;s return. In His timing, He will then come back to begin the millennial kingdom. All those that have fully matured in life and served Him faithfully in building and reigning will receive a reward. All those who are not matured and are unfaithful in serving the Lord will be punished. The reward is glorious and the punishment is grievous. The reward is the early enjoyment of the New Jerusalem. It includes the out-resurrection from among the dead (Phil. 3:11), the transfiguration of the body of humiliation to the body of His glory (Phil 3:21), the marriage feast (Matt. 25:10), ruling over many things, the joy of the Lord (Matt. 25:21, 23), having the authority over the nations (Rev. 2:26), and reigning with Christ a thousand years (Rev. 20:4). The punishment includes not having all the above items, not being known by the Lord (Matt. 25:12), being cast into the outer darkness with weeping and gnashing of teeth (Matt. 25:30), and his work being consumed, suffering loss, though being saved yet as through fire (1 Cor. 3:15). The reward was originally the common portion of all the believers; however, due to the degradation of Christians, the millennial kingdom became a reward to those who are faithful to God&#8217;s eternal purpose and have overcome all degradation to be full-grown in life. Therefore, as young Christians, we must aspire to receive the kingdom reward by being normal Christians, experiencing life every day to grow in life until we reach maturity, bearing fruits of virtue, bearing fruits of people, building up the Body of Christ, and reigning in life for God. Then at the Lord&#8217;s return, we will get the reward (Rev. 22:12).<h2 class=head1>III. THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is the final issue of life. It is the ultimate consummation of the divine, eternal, indestructible life growing in all God&#8217;s chosen, redeemed, and regenerated people. It is the mingling of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man. It is not a physical city as many suppose. It is a spiritual city. It is the full growth of the church, the Body of Christ, the bride of Christ (Rev. 21:2; Eph. 5:25-27). &#8220;And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone, clear as crystal&#8217;&#8217; (Rev. 21:10-11). &#8220;And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb&#8217;&#8217; (Rev. 21:23). &#8220;And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month, and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations&#8217;&#8217; (Rev. 22:1-2). The throne of God and of the Lamb is on the top and in the center of the city. Out of it flows the Spirit as the river of water of life in the middle of the golden street. &#8220;And night shall be no more; and they have no need of the light of a lamp and the light of the sun, for the Lord God shall illumine them; and they shall reign forever and ever&#8217;&#8217; (Rev. 22:5).<h2 class=head2>A. A City of Life</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city Of life. It has a river of water of life and the tree of life. It is not of knowledge. The tree of knowledge is gone. Only the tree of life is there growing in the middle of the river of water of life. It is absolutely a city of zoe.<h2 class=head2>B. A City under God&#8217;s Authority</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city under God&#8217;s authority. The throne of God and of the Lamb is on the top and in the middle of the city. A throne represents the authority of the one who sits on it. The throne of God and of the Lamb represents the authority of the Triune God. There is no rebellion in the New Jerusalem because everyone is in full subjection to the Triune God.<h2 class=head2>C. A City of Fellowship</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city of fellowship. Fellowship is the Spirit flowing. Wherever the Spirit flows, there is fellowship. The river of the water of life out of the throne of God is the flowing of the Spirit. The river is the fellowship of the Spirit bringing us God and the Lamb, the Father and the Son.<h2 class=head2>D. A City of Light</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city of light. God is the light and the Lamb is the lamp. The Triune God shines in this city. Everyone in this city lives and walks by the light of life from God. It exposes, leads, and guides. There is no darkness in this city.<h2 class=head2>E. A City of Fruit-bearing</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city of fruit-bearing. The tree of life bears twelve fruits. The tree of life is a very fruitful tree. It bears not only one fruit but twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month. This indicates life in abundance.<h2 class=head2>F. A City of Oneness</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city of oneness. Although there are twelve gates, there is only one street, one river, one tree, one throne, and one nature-gold (the divine nature). People of different nations, tribes, and tongues from all four corners of the earth come into the city, and find only oneness there. All their backgrounds, cultures, and differences are forsaken for the oneness. There is no division, no confusion, and no separation. There is only oneness.<h2 class=head2>G. A City of Blessing</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city of blessing. In the New Jerusalem is the three-fold blessing of the Triune God. We enjoy the creating God, the redeeming Lamb and the regenerating Spirit.<h2 class=head2>H. A City of Transformed Men</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city of transformed men. Man was made of clay. After regeneration and transformation, man becomes precious stone, as a jasper stone, clear as crystal. Originally man was opaque; here man is clear as crystal, due to the transformation of the Spirit through His fellowship.<h2 class=head2>I. A City of the Expression of God</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city of the expression of God. Revelation 4:3 tells us that the One sitting on the throne has the appearance of jasper. The wall of the New Jerusalem also has the appearance of a jasper stone. The people of God have grown in life to full maturity; therefore, they have the expression of God.<h2 class=head2>J. A City of the Dominion of God</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a city of the dominion of God. Not only is God reigning on His throne, all the people of God are reigning in life.<p>The New Jerusalem is the fulfillment of God&#8217;s eternal purpose accomplished through God&#8217;s economy. Through the dispensing of the processed Triune God as life into His chosen, created, fallen, redeemed, and regenerated people, they became mingled with Him and transformed to have His same image. They, together in oneness, express all that He is in life and reign with Him and for Him over the whole universe for eternity. Amen! Hallelujah! This is the ultimate consummation of the experience of life and growth of life. We rejoice that this is our eternal destiny!<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>What is God&#8217;s two-fold intention in creating man?</li><li>As Christians, what is the standard we need to reach?

It is not enough just to know about life and know about how to experience life, we also need to know how to maintain the life that is in us.<h2 class=head1>I. THE NEED TO HAVE A STRONG SPIRIT</h2><p>The first thing needed to maintain the life that is in us is to have a strong spirit. When we were saved, our spirit was regenerated by the Holy Spirit of God. We have received God into us to be our life. Our dead spirit became alive. Hallelujah! From that point on, we need to maintain a strong spirit in order to maintain a healthy life level. Many Christians do not take care of their spirits. Their spirits have become like &#8220;flat tires,&#8217;&#8217; having no sense of life nor direction from the anointing. They sin and do things of the world without any shame because their spirits are too weak. Right after we are saved, we must exercise our spirit every day to keep it strong.<h2 class=head1>II. CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2><p>Calling on the name of the Lord is the easiest, the fastest, and the best way to exercise our spirit, to touch our spirit, and to maintain a strong spirit. We began our Christian life by calling, &#8220;And it shall be that everyone, whoever calls on the name of the Lord, shall be saved&#8217;&#8217; (Acts 2:21). &#8220;And now, why do you delay? Rise up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name&#8217;&#8217; (Acts 22:16). May we continually call upon His name every day to be saved (Rom. 10:13).<h2 class=head2>A. Calling in the Old Testament</h2><p>[Calling on the Lord began in the third generation of the human race with Enosh, the son of Seth (Gen. 4:26). The history of calling on the Lord&#8217;s name continued throughout the Bible with Abraham (Gen. 12:8), Isaac (Gen. 26:25), Moses (Deut. 4:7), Job (Job 12:4), Jabez (1 Chron. 4:10), Samson (Judg. 16:28), Samuel (1 Sam. 12:18), David (2 Sam. 22:4), Jonah (Jonah 1:6), Elijah (1 Kings 18:24), and Jeremiah (Lam. 3:55). Not only did the Old Testament saints call on the Lord, they even prophesied that others would call on His name (Joel 2:32; Zeph. 3:9; Zech. 13:9). Although many are familiar with Joel&#8217;s prophecy regarding the Holy Spirit, not many have paid attention to the fact that receiving the outpoured Holy Spirit requires our calling on the name of the Lord. On the one hand, Joel prophesied that God would pour out His Spirit; on the other hand, he prophesied that people would call on the name of the Lord. This prophecy was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:17a, 21). God&#8217;s outpouring needs the cooperation of our calling on Him.]<h2 class=head2>B. Practiced by New Testament Believers</h2><p>[Calling on the name of the Lord was practiced by the New Testament believers beginning on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:21). While Stephen was being stoned to death, he was calling on the name of the Lord (Acts 7:59). The New Testament believers practiced calling on the Lord (Acts 9:14; 22:16; 1 Cor. 1:2; 2 Tim. 2:22). Saul of Tarsus received authority from the chief priests to bind all that called on the name of the Lord (Acts 9:14). This indicated that all the early saints were Jesus-callers. Their calling on the name of the Lord was a sign, a mark, that they were Christians. If we become those who call on the name of the Lord, our calling will mark us out as Christians.<p>Paul the apostle stressed the matter of calling when he wrote the book of Romans. He said, &#8220;For there is no difference between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him. For, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&#8217;&#8217; (Rom 10:12-13). Paul also spoke of calling on the Lord in 1 Corinthians when he wrote the words, &#8220;with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours&#8217;&#8217; (1 Cor. 1:2). Furthermore, in 2 Timothy he told Timothy to pursue spiritual things with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart (2 Tim. 2:22). By all of these verses we can see that in the first century the Christians practiced calling on the name of the Lord very much. Therefore, throughout the Old Testament as well as in the early days of the Christian age, the saints called on the Lord&#8217;s name. How regrettable that it has been neglected by most Christians for so long a time. We believe that today the Lord wants to recover calling on His name and to have us practice it so that we may enjoy the riches of His life.]<h2 class=head2>C. The Purpose of Calling</h2><p>[Why do we need to call on the name of the Lord? Men need to call on the name of the Lord in order to be saved (Rom. 10:13). The way of praying quietly does help people to be saved, but not so richly. The way of calling loudly helps people to be saved in a richer and more thorough way. Thus, we need to encourage people to open themselves and to call on the name of the Lord Jesus. Psalm 116 tells us that we may partake of the Lord&#8217;s salvation by calling on Him: &#8220;I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord&#8217;&#8217; (v. 13). In this one Psalm, calling on the Lord is mentioned four times (vv. 2,4,13,17). As we have seen earlier, the way to draw water out of the wells of salvation is to call upon the name of the Lord (Isa. 12:2-4). Many Christians have never called upon the Lord. If you have never called, even shouted before the Lord, it is doubtful that you have enjoyed the Lord in a rich way. &#8220;Call upon His name...Cry out and shout...&#8217;&#8217; (Isa. 12:4, 6). Try shouting before Him. If you have never shouted about what the Lord is to you, try it. The more you shout, &#8220;O Lord Jesus, You are so good to me!&#8217;&#8217; the more you will be released from your self and filled with the Lord. Thousands of saints have been released and enriched through calling on the name of the Lord.]<p>At this time, it may be good for you to stop reading and call on the name of the Lord out loud for at least five minutes to experience that the Lord is rich to those who call. You will strengthen your spirit this way.<h2 class=head2>D. The Way to Call</h2><p>[How should we call on the Lord? We must call on Him out of a pure heart (2 Tim. 2:22). Our heart, which is the source of our calling, must be pure, seeking nothing except the Lord Himself. Also, we must call with a pure lip (Zeph. 3:9). We need to watch our speech, for nothing contaminates our lips more than loose talk. If our lips are impure due to loose talk, it will be difficult for us to call on the Lord. Along with a pure heart and pure lips, we need to have an open mouth (Psa. 81:10). We need to open our mouth wide to call on the Lord. Furthermore, we need to call on the Lord corporately. Second Timothy 2:22 says, &#8220;Flee also youthful lusts: but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&#8217;&#8217; We need to come together for the purpose of calling on the name of the Lord. Psalm 88:9 says, &#8220;Lord, I have called daily upon thee.&#8217;&#8217; Hence, we should call daily upon His name. Furthermore, Psalm 116:2 says,&#8217;&#8217;... therefore will I call upon Him as long as I live.&#8217;&#8217; As long as we live, we should call on the name of the Lord.]<h2 class=head2>E. The Need of Practice</h2><p>[Calling on the name of the Lord is not merely a doctrine. It is very practical. We need to practice it daily and hourly. We should never stop our spiritual breathing. We hope that many more of the Lord&#8217;s people, especially new believers, will begin the practice of calling on the Lord. Today, many Christians have found that they can know Him, that they can be brought into the power of His resurrection, that they can experience His spontaneous salvation, and that they can walk in oneness with Him by calling on His name. In any situation, at any time, call &#8220;Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!&#8217;&#8217; If you practice calling on His name, you will see that it is a wonderful way to enjoy the Lord&#8217;s riches.] By this enjoyable practice our spirit will be strengthened for us to experience life every day. Thus, growth in life will be the result.<h2 class=head1>III. PRAYING TO CONTACT, TO ENJOY, AND TO FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</h2><p>Praying will make our spirit strong because through prayer we contact God, we enjoy God, and we have fellowship with God. [The real significance of prayer is to contact God in our spirit and to absorb God Himself. Prayer is the contact of the human spirit with the Spirit of God, during which man inhales God into himself. Therefore, the emphasis of prayer lies not in asking God for things but in contacting and absorbing God.] First Thessalonians 5:17 says, &#8220;Unceasingly pray.&#8217;&#8217; Prayer is like breathing heavenly air. When a man stops breathing, he dies physically. Likewise, when we stop breathing the spiritual air, our spirit becomes deadened. We need to breathe the Spirit to keep our spirit alive and healthy. Calling is a form of short prayer. We should always mingle our prayer with calling.<p>Most of the time we prefer to talk or do something else rather than pray; therefore, our spirit is usually not so strong. We need to pray to contact our living God. Because He is living and He is the life-giving Spirit, whenever we pray we receive life and our spirit is strengthened from within. This will dispel any feeling of death in us. If we feel dark, depressed, oppressed, and confused, we need to pray. Prayer will cause us to enjoy life. The sense of life will lift us out of our horrible pit. This type of prayer will keep us in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Sometimes, while we are praying to enjoy the Lord, He may expose our past sins. We must confess these sins to maintain our fellowship with Him (1 John 1:7-9). Therefore, we must pray all the time to live the proper Christian life, to experience the divine, eternal, and indestructible life in our spirit. Now is a good time to pray for five minutes to enjoy the Lord and to absorb God into our being.<h2 class=head1>IV. PRAYING TO EXERCISE GOD&#8217;S AUTHORITY FOR GOD&#8217;S ETERNAL PURPOSE</h2><p>Our prayer to contact God, to enjoy God, and to fellowship with God will issue in prayers for God&#8217;s eternal purpose. As you are enjoying God in prayer, the Lord may remind you that a friend of yours is still not saved and his eternal destiny is the lake of fire. You should pray for his salvation by asking the Lord to prepare his heart to hear the gospel. You also may pray that the Lord will bind the enemy so that your friend may be freed to receive God&#8217;s salvation. After your prayer, you need to go and preach the gospel to him. You need to continue to pray for him on the way to visit him and while you are preaching to him. If he is not open, then pray for him again and go visit him again. This is to exercise the authority the Lord gave the church to bind and to loose (Matt. 18:18-19). Sometimes it is better to pray with your partners in this way. The Lord likes to answer this type of prayer (John 15:16). Many of us may have experience concerning this type of prayer. We still need more practice. By praying this way, our spirit will be strengthened and God&#8217;s economy will be carried out by us. Calling on the name of the Lord and prayer are excellent ways to grow in life.<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>What are the two simplest ways of maintaining our fellowship with God?</li><li>When was the first occurrence of calling in the Bible?</li><li>Itemize the benefits we receive from calling; use a verse for each item.</li><li>What is the real meaning of prayer?</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Calling on the Name of the Lord, pp. 2-12.</li><li>Life Lessons, p. 26.</li></ol><h1 class=msg>Lesson Twenty-One</h1><h1 class=msg>BEING ENRICHED WITH THE WORD BY PRAY-READING, READING, STUDYING, AND MEMORIZING</h1><h2 class=head2>Scripture Reading</h2><h1 class=scripture>John 1:1, 14; 6:63; 1 Pet. 1:23; 2:2; Matt. 4:4; Jer. 15:16; Job 23:12b; Eph. 6:17-18a; Col. 3:16; Eccl. 12:1; Psa. 119:11</h1><h2 class=head2>Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The importance of the Word of God to the believers</li><li>The essence of the Word of God-being life to the believers</li><li>The function of the Word of God-giving life to the believers	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Causing men to be regenerated</li>	<li>Being the believers&#8217; spiritual milk</li>	<li>Being the believers&#8217; bread of life</li>	</ol></li><li>Using our spirit and our mental faculty to receive the Spirit and life from the Word of God	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>By pray-reading</li>	<li>By reading</li>	<li>By studying</li>	<li>By memorizing</li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class=head2>Text</h2><h2 class=head1>I. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WORD OF GOD TO THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>[After we are saved, in order to have spiritual growth, we must know the Bible. For two thousand years Christians have acknowledged one thing, that no one can know the Lord well without knowing the Bible.<p>The spiritual inheritance which God has given to us includes, on the one hand, the invisible Holy Spirit and, on the other hand, the visible holy Bible. On the one hand, the Spirit is within us; on the other hand, the Scripture is outside of us. A proper Christian must be balanced in these two sides. If we only have the Holy Spirit within but do not have the Scripture without, we will make mistakes easily. If we only have the Scripture without, but do not have the Holy Spirit within, we will become dead, without vitality or livingness.<p>A Christian is like a train which needs motivating power within and tracks without. Having these two aspects-the inward and the outward-coordinating together, the train can move, even move very well. This is exactly true of the Holy Spirit within us and the Holy Scriptures outside of us. If you are filled with the Holy Spirit within and you also know the Bible without, then, as a Christian, you are living and stable, and you are also active and accurate. You are a Christian who is living and stable as well as active and accurate.]<h2 class=head1>II. THE ESSENCE OF THE WORD OF GOD- BEING LIFE TO THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>[Most Christians know that the Bible is the Word of God. But many do not know the very essence of the holy word in the Bible. Anything that is solid always has an element and an essence. We need to consider what the essence of the word of the Lord is. The holy word that has been spoken by God through the generations is the very embodiment of the Triune God. This is based on John 1:1 and 14. Verse 1 tells us definitely that the Word, the holy Word, is God. The word that has been spoken through the generations is God Himself essentially. The Word is God Himself, not in person but in essence. This simply means that God is altogether embodied in the Word. God is Spirit, and a spirit is mysterious and invisible. But the Word is something in black and white. It is visible and solid. Thus, the Word is the embodiment of the mysterious and invisible God. Although God is invisible and mysterious, the Word is not. The solid and visible Word embodies God. The Word defines, explains, and expresses God.]<p>[In Chapter one of the gospel of John, we are told that the Word was God Himself embodied to be Jesus. When Jesus speaks the word, whatever He speaks is spirit and life. The Lord Jesus said in John 6:63, &#8220;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.&#8217;&#8217; The Word today is the Spirit and the life.] [If we contact the Bible only with our mind, the Bible will be only the letter to us. But whenever we contact any part of the Bible with our spirit, that part of the Bible becomes spirit and life to us.]<h2 class=head1>III. THE FUNCTION OF THE WORD OF GOD-GIVING LIFE TO THE BELIEVERS</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Causing Men to be Regenerated</h2><p>[The first practical function of the Bible in us is to cause us to be regenerated (1 Pet. 1:23). The Bible is the Word of the living God, and it contains the life of the living God. When we receive the word of the Scriptures into us by faith, it comes into us like a seed of life, sowing God&#8217;s life into us; thus, we have God&#8217;s life and are regenerated.]<h2 class=head2>B. Being the Believers&#8217; Spiritual Milk</h2><p>[When we first get saved, we do not have a strong enough comprehension concerning spiritual things. Some portions of the Scriptures are like milk that can nourish us and make us grow in our spiritual life (1 Pet. 2:2). Hence, a newly regenerated believer must long for the word of the Bible, like newborn babes longing for the guileless milk of the word. Otherwise, his spiritual life cannot grow, and he will continue to be one who is an infant in Christ (1 Cor. 3:1-2).]<h2 class=head2>C. Being the Believers&#8217; Bread of Life</h2><p>[The word of the Scriptures is also our spiritual bread of life (Matt. 4:4). Just as our physical life needs nourishment, so also our spiritual life needs nourishment. The nourishment of our spiritual life can only be supplied by the word of the Bible. In order to be living and strong before God, we cannot depend on bread alone, but on every word, that is, the word of the Bible, that proceeds out through the mouth of God. We must take the word of God as food and eat it (Jer. 15:16), even regarding the word of the Bible as more important than our food (Job 23:12b). Otherwise, our spiritual life cannot grow. We must practice to have our faculties exercised in apprehending the word of the Bible so that we may be able to understand the words that are hard to interpret; that is, like those who are mature, we can eat the solid food (Heb. 5:13-14). Otherwise, our spiritual life cannot be strong.]<h2 class=head1>IV. USING OUR SPIRIT AND OUR MENTAL FACULTY TO RECEIVE THE SPIRIT AND LIFE FROM THE WORD OF GOD</h2><p>First Peter 2:2 tells us that we may grow by the guileless milk of the word. The term &#8220;of the word&#8217;&#8217; in Greek is logikos. [This word, in Romans 12:1 translated reasonable, is derived from the noun logos-the word; hence, of the word; having the sense of pertaining to the mind (in contrast with the body), to the rational faculties; hence, rational, logical, reasonable. The milk of the word is not milk for the body, but milk for the soul, the inner being. It is conveyed in the Word of God to nourish our inner man through the understanding of our rational mind, and is assimilated by our mental faculties.] [Although the nourishing milk of the word is for the soul through the mind, it eventually nourishes our spirit, making us not soulish but spiritual, suitable for building up a spiritual house for God.]<p>[The Lord indicated that for giving life, He would become the Spirit. Then He said that the words He speaks are spirit and life. This shows that His spoken words are the embodiment of the life-giving Spirit. He is now the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and the Spirit is embodied in His words. When we receive His words by exercising our spirit, we get the Spirit who is life.] [The Scripture is the embodiment of God as the Spirit. The Spirit is therefore the very essence, the substance, of the Scripture, just as phosphorus is the essential substance in matches. We must strike the Spirit of the Scripture with our spirit to catch the divine fire.]<h2 class=head2>A. By Pray-reading</h2><p>Pray-reading is the best way to receive the Spirit and life from the Word of God. When you read the Word of God, do not read only with your mind. You also must use your spirit by calling and praying. Ephesians 6:17 and 18a says, &#8220;And receive...the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit.&#8217;&#8217; When you read the Word of God, some word may touch you; immediately turn that into prayer. Suppose you are reading the above verses. You may pray, &#8220;O Lord, I am here to receive the sword of the Spirit. O Lord Jesus, You are the Spirit; I want to receive You. The Spirit is the word of God, Lord. As I am pray-reading your word, I am receiving Your Spirit. Hallelujah! I am praying in my spirit to receive You through Your word.&#8217;&#8217; If you would pray like this, you will be energized by the Spirit and life, and you will be burning in your spirit by the divine fire.<h2 class=head2>B. By Reading</h2><p>We need to read the Bible from cover to cover. Decide before the Lord how much you want to read every day. If you read three chapters from the Old Testament and one chapter from the New Testament every day, it will take you about one year to finish the Bible. If you read one chapter from the New Testament every day, it will take you about nine months to finish the New Testament. You need to set up your goal for Bible-reading and carry it out accordingly. As you are reading through, pray with the verses that touch you, write down what you see, then tell people around you what you wrote down. Tell your parents, your siblings, your partners, your serving ones, and your friends.<h2 class=head2>C. By Studying</h2><p>You also need to use your mind in studying the Word of God. You must let the word of Christ fill your mind and let it dwell in you richly (Col. 3:16). When you study, you must think; as you think, you must pray and enjoy. This practice will help us receive the milk of the word for our mental faculties and will nourish our spirit. You may study a book in the Bible, such as John or Romans, with the help of the footnotes and the references in the Recovery Version, as well as the corresponding life-study messages. Thank the Lord, we have the Recovery Version and the life-study messages for every book of the New Testament. You may study any book in the New Testament with the aid of so many helpful publications. You may study the lesson books for the junior high and high school students. You may study the Life Lessons and Truth Lessons. There are many ways for you to study. Fellowship with your parents, serving ones, and elders concerning how you may study the Word of God.<h2 class=head2>D. By Memorizing</h2><p>We also need to memorize the Word of God. This may be overlooked by most saints. Memorizing the Word of God is very helpful. Have you ever experienced a lack of the Word of God in your preaching of the gospel? You may not know what to say when preaching to a friend. If you memorize a verse a day, in three years, you will have about one thousand verses memorized. You will not have to worry about what to say or where to find the verses you want to quote. Young people should definitely memorize verses. What you memorize in your youth may never be forgotten. You can use the verses for the rest of your life. Your mind becomes cluttered with too many things when you get older. Ecclesiastes 12:1 says, &#8220;Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth.&#8217;&#8217; One of the best ways to remember the Lord is to memorize His word. Psalm 119:11 says, &#8220;Your word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against You.&#8217;&#8217; What you keep in your heart (mainly your mind) will help to keep you from sin and will help to form you according to God&#8217;s desire.<p>In conclusion, we must use our spirit and our mind to contact the Word of God daily to receive the Spirit and life that we may be enriched. Then we may have a strong spirit to experience life and to grow in life until we reach maturity.<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Why is it so important for us as Christians to know the Bible?</li><li>What is the essence of the Word of God?</li><li>How does the Word become Spirit and life in us?

BEING CHANNELS OF LIFE</h2><p>After our regenerated spirit is strengthened by calling on the name of the Lord and by praying to contact God, to enjoy God, to fellowship with God, and to absorb God, as well as to bind the devil and loose people and situations for God&#8217;s economy; after we are enriched and equipped with the Word by means of pray-reading, reading, studying, and memorizing, we have to learn to speak the word of Christ in spirit. In previous lessons we have seen that life is God the Father in Christ Jesus the Son as the Spirit flowing into, through, and out of us. By calling, praying, and handling the word we receive God as life into our being. By speaking the word of Christ, we allow God to flow through us and out of us to be life to others. We are channels of life for God&#8217;s economy. In Acts 5:20 we are charged to go &#8220;and speak to the people all the words of this life.&#8217;&#8217; On the receiving side, we need to be open to receive the Lord through His Word; on the dispensing side, we need to speak to dispense the Lord in our speaking. To bear fruit of people is to receive the life supply from the Lord through abiding in Him and to dispense the life through speaking the gospel to our friends. If we do not speak, we will stagnate like the dead sea. Therefore, in John 15, after the Lord charged His disciples to bear fruit, He warned them that they would be cut off from the enjoyment of life if they did not abide in Him and did not bear fruit (vv. 2, 6). We must be faithful enjoyers of God as our life and dispensers of God as life to others around us.<h2 class=head1>II. LIVING ORGANS TO SPEAK CHRIST</h2><p>God created wonderful living organs for us to speak to dispense God as life to others. [God created us with vocal chords, a tongue, lips, and teeth that we may be filled with Christ who is the Word of God. When we are filled with Christ as the Word of God, we speak. We speak Christ in a language such as Chinese, English, Greek, or Hebrew, not in nonsensical utterances. We speak Christ in our mother tongue. We speak Christ in our borrowed tongue. All the denotations of our speaking concentrate on one Person, Christ.] We should not use our God-created organs to speak nonsensical speech such as foolish talking, coarse jesting, and foul abusive language (Eph. 5:4; Col. 3:8). Ephesians 4:29 says, &#8220;Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for needful building up, that it may give grace to those who hear.&#8217;&#8217; We should use our speaking ability to speak the words of Christ to minister life to people that they may be built up into the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>III. SPEAKING FOR THE DISPENSING OF LIFE</h2><p>For you to be filled in spirit with the Word [is not only for your nourishment, it is for you to dispense. It is for you to generate. Every human being is made by God to propagate, to generate. Therefore, everybody has to bring forth children! Now we all have to learn how to generate, how to dispense, how to impart into others what we have received into our being. This is to reproduce, this is to generate, this is to bring forth new Christians by speaking. Therefore, speaking is generating, speaking is imparting, speaking is dispensing.]<h2 class=head1>IV. SPEAKING IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>[In 1 Corinthians chapter twelve, Paul refers to the matter of speaking in the meetings. In verse 2 he reminds the Corinthians, &#8220;You know that when you were of the nations, you were led away to dumb idols, however you were led.&#8217;&#8217; The worship of dumb idols had made them a dumb people. Because the object of their worship was a dumb idol, their worshipping made them a dumb people. But now the Corinthian brothers were different. They were not worshipping the dumb idols any more. They were worshipping the living God, who is the speaking God. This speaking God is just the speaking Spirit, who is the Spirit of God, who is also the Holy Spirit. Therefore, in verse 3 Paul says, &#8220;No one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.&#8217;&#8217;]<p>Because of our background, the tradition of Christianity, and our old habits, we do not speak for Christ. We may speak many other things, but we do not have the habit of speaking the word of Christ in the Holy Spirit. We are all like the dumb idols who have mouths but cannot speak. We need a break-through. We need to repent to the Lord, exercise our spirit, and boldly speak forth the word of Christ we have received. This is the way to be in the Holy Spirit. Because He is living and speaking, whenever we speak His word, His Spirit fills us within (Eph. 5:18-19), and we are in the Holy Spirit. Inward filling is essential for life. Being in the Holy Spirit implies that we are clothed economically with the Holy Spirit of power for God&#8217;s economy. Therefore, when we speak the word of Christ, we have the authority and power to overcome the evil one.<h2 class=head1>V. SPEAKING BY THE SPIRIT OF FAITH</h2><p>Second Corinthians 4:13 says, &#8220;Having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke; we also believe, therefore also we speak.&#8217;&#8217; [Speaking by the spirit of faith in our practical life is a great, crucial point. This very particular expression is used only once in the entire Bible. The spirit of faith is a mingling of the Holy Spirit with our spirit. The phrase &#8220;spirit of faith&#8217;&#8217; places the spirit in apposition to faith. Faith is of the spirit. Therefore, the spirit of faith is faith. Our faith is just the mingled spirit. Furthermore, faith comes from hearing and hearing comes from the preaching of the Word (Rom. 10:14, 17). This is why we must get into the Word. The more we get into the Word, the more we will have faith, and this faith is the spirit. Now by such a spirit you may speak the Word which is the source of your faith. Here is a cycle. The Word produces faith, faith is the spirit, and by this spirit you speak the Word. Your speaking will become the source of faith in others. The faith in them then becomes the spirit by which they speak.]<p>As we are speaking to our friends, we must exercise our spirit of faith to impart faith, which is the spirit, which is life imparted into our friends. They may not have faith in the beginning of the conversation. But by hearing the word of Christ from your wonderful mouth, faith is generated in them. Romans chapter ten tells us that this kind of speaking puts the word of faith into your friends&#8217; mouths and hearts. Therefore, we do not have to worry about whether our friends believe or not. We speak by the spirit of faith to impart the believing ability, faith, into them. Their response to our speaking in the spirit of faith is their faith Their salvation does not depend on them, but it depends on our speaking.<h2 class=head1>VI. SPEAKING AT EVERY TIME AND IN EVERY PLACE TO EVERY PERSON</h2><p>Since our God is a living God, He is a speaking God. He speaks all the time, because He has a lot to say. The more we are in spirit and are enriched with the Word of God, the more we want to speak. Actually, we need to speak at every time and in every place to every person. All the time we have is for us to speak Christ. From morning to evening, we can speak Christ and we should speak Christ. Every place is for speaking Christ. We are not restricted to the meeting hall. We can speak in the meetings as well as on the way to and from the meetings, at home, in school, on the way to and from school, in the parks, etc. Every place is our meeting and speaking place. We can and should speak to every person we see every day. Every person needs to hear the word of Christ. Speak to your parents as well as your brothers and sisters. Your speaking to them becomes a fellowship of the Triune God. You need to speak to your unbelieving friends so that they may receive the gospel of God. All the speaking will minister Christ as life to the hearers, will cause you to enjoy Him as life, and to grow in life.<h2 class=head1>VII. SPEAKING IN THE MEETINGS</h2><p>[We all have to desperately endeavor to build up a habit of speaking in any meeting (1 Cor. 14:26, 4-5, 12, 31). We must be desperate to build up a habit to speak. This habit has to be built up universally in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. We do not have such a habit due to the background of Christianity, and our function has been killed because of this background. Many Chinese people do not speak English well because they did not have the habit of speaking English when they grew up, and they still do not have this habit. I did not pick up the habit of speaking English until I began to minister the word in the United States in 1962. It was hard for me to acquire this habit, but for my grandchildren it was easy because they grew up in an English-speaking environment. If we learn to build up a habit of speaking in any meeting, our children, the new ones, will spontaneously become speaking ones. The new ones will follow the trend and the atmosphere in the meeting. They will pick up the habit of speaking easily. We must endeavor to do this because it is not just for ourselves but for the benefit of the Lord&#8217;s recovery.]<p>You may say that you do not know what to say in the meetings. That is easy to overcome. You simply pray-read some verses every morning, and read or study the Bible every day. Write down what you see in the verses or what you enjoyed the most. You may write a few words, a sentence, or a short paragraph on what impressed you. On Saturday, you can write a composition according to the notes you wrote during the week. In the Lord&#8217;s day morning meeting, you will be prepared to speak with some rich content. Then you speak your composition with the spirit of faith boldly to the saints to minister life in the meeting. Never speak in a monotone without the exercise of the spirit. By speaking in the Holy Spirit this way, the church will be built up.<p>We, the children of God, must be like our Father, the speaking One. We should speak the word of Christ all the time, speaking everywhere and to everybody. Thus, we will experience life, grow in life, and dispense life to others. The end results will be the bearing of fruit and the building up of the church.<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Why did God create us with speaking organs?

LOVING THE LORD</h2><p>In this lesson we want to fellowship about having a normal daily Christian life that is in spirit and expresses Christ. The first and most important thing in a normal Christian life is loving the Lord. [If we love the Lord, we surely will be filled with Him. Whatever fills us within will come out of us. The overflow comes from the infilling. When we love the Lord, He will fill us.] Revelation chapters two and three contain seven epistles to seven churches in Asia. The first item of degradation was the loss of the first love by the Church in Ephesus (Rev. 2:4). They did many good works, but losing their first love could cause them to lose the church status if they would not repent (Rev. 2:5). Due to the loss of their first love, the churches became lukewarm, and the Lord wanted to vomit them out of His mouth (Rev. 3:14-16). Therefore, the first thing we must do is to repent by praying, &#8220;O Lord, forgive me for not loving you first, for not loving you supremely, and for not loving you hotly. Lord, I still love so many things in the world. I even love myself. O Lord, forgive me, cleanse me with Your precious blood. Lord, I want to declare to You and to the whole universe that I love You now. I love You more than anything else in the world. I do not love myself. I love only You. Fill me with your Spirit. Amen!&#8217;&#8217; If you would pray this way, you will start to love the Lord again. Your first love will be restored and you will be filled with His Spirit.<h2 class=head1>II. BEING REVIVED EVERY MORNING</h2><p>Our Christian life begins anew every day in the morning. We [must enjoy the Lord in the Word every day early in the morning to have a new start of each day (Psa. 119:147-148). According to God&#8217;s principle in His creation, He ordained to have a new year, a new month or a new moon, and a new day. Within every year we can have three hundred sixty-five new starts. If we failed for three hundred sixty-four days, we still have one more opportunity to have a successful day. We may have failed today, but thank the Lord tomorrow is still here waiting for us. Tomorrow morning we will have another chance to have a new start. Within every twenty-four hours, there is a new chance for us to have a new start and be renewed.]<p>[To have a new start is not hard. It is so easy.] Have your Bible and your clothes by your bed the night before. [Just rise up a little earlier and say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus. O Lord Jesus.&#8217;&#8217; You do not need to shout loudly to bother others. Just say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus.&#8217;&#8217; To say this makes a big difference. Sometimes I forgot to call on the Lord immediately after I woke up. That became a big loss to me. As soon as I realized this I said, &#8220;Lord Jesus, forgive me for forgetting You.&#8217;&#8217;]<p>[Then we need to pray-read a short portion of the Word, anywhere from two to four verses.] We may have our own verses or use the verses provided by the church. [We can enjoy the Lord with His Word and in His Word through pray-reading. We should do this every day in the morning to have a good, new start. We can speak the Word to ourselves, to the Lord, and even to the angels. We can speak the word to our pets and even to our furniture. When we speak the word in such a way, we will be the first ones nourished by our speaking.] It is helpful to write down in a few words what you have enjoyed. [We do not need to spend a long time to enjoy the Lord in the Word early in the morning. Ten to fifteen minutes is sufficient to get nourished and have a good start of a new day. We need to practice this.]<p>We call this a &#8220;morning revival.&#8217;&#8217; The word revival is not in the Bible. But the principle is found in 2 Timothy 1:6a, which says, &#8220;For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God which is in you.&#8217;&#8217; Many times we cool down. Especially during the night, our spirit is not so burning. Romans 12:11 says that we should be &#8220;burning in spirit.&#8217;&#8217; The Lord in Revelation 3:15-16 warns us against being lukewarm. Rather, we should be hot. Therefore, every morning we must start with a &#8220;morning revival&#8217;&#8217; by fanning our spirit into flame so that we may be burning in spirit and hotly in love with the Lord. Without this new beginning every morning, we cannot have a proper Christian life during the day.<h2 class=head1>III. LIVING A VICTORIOUS LIFE EVERY DAY</h2><p>Then we need to live a victorious life to overcome sin, to overcome the world, to overcome ourselves, to overcome our flesh, to overcome our disobedience to our parents, and even to overcome our quarreling with our siblings. After you have a wonderful time being revived in the morning, do not stop there. Continue to live in spirit. When you see your parents and siblings, do not murmur or quarrel; fellowship with them what you see in the word and what light you receive from the Lord. If they say anything that may offend you, call on the Lord inwardly and even thank the Lord for the situation. By this way you will live a victorious life.<h2 class=head1>IV. ABIDING IN THE FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LORD DAILY AND HOURLY</h2><p>[We also must abide in the fellowship with the Lord daily and hourly (1 John 1:6; 2 Cor. 13:14). Even the angels should be able to testify that we are in the fellowship with the Lord. We should not be away from Him but present in His fellowship. There should be no absence in our fellowship with the Lord. Daily and even hourly we need to be such persons. If I were not such a person, it would be hard for me to speak in the Lord&#8217;s ministry. My speaking depends upon my continual and present fellowship with the Lord. Why can we not speak in the meetings? Maybe we have been absent from the Lord&#8217;s fellowship for three days because we had a quarrel with our] sibling or our friend. [Because of this quarrel, we have been put away from the Lord&#8217;s fellowship. If we are going to speak for the Lord, we have to recover our fellowship with Him by confessing our sin and by making an apology to our] sibling or our friend. [We must remain, abide, in the constant and continual fellowship with the Lord. This is a strong demand.]<h2 class=head1>V. BEING A PRAYING PERSON</h2><p>[We must also be praying persons. We should pray unceasingly all the day long. This means that we have to call on His name. We need to call, &#8220;O Lord.&#8217;&#8217; Do not think that such a short calling means nothing. It means a lot. While we are] in school or doing house chores at home, [we can call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus.&#8217;&#8217; Such a short calling means a lot to our Christian life. By calling on the name of the Lord, we can pray unceasingly.] For us to live a normal Christian life we must be praying persons.<h2 class=head1>VI. WALKING BY AND ACCORDING TO OUR MINGLED SPIRIT</h2><p>[We also must learn to walk by and according to our spirit mingled with the Spirit (Gal. 5:16; Rom. 8:4). Praise the Lord that we have a spirit and that our spirit is mingled with the divine Spirit! What a provision! Our God has created us with a spirit and has even regenerated our spirit. Immediately after regenerating us, He stays with us as the Spirit to be one with us and even to mingle Himself with us as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Now we have such a mingled spirit. After having a good start in the morning, we should continue to walk, to live, to do everything by this mingled spirit and with this mingled spirit all day long. We must learn to practice this.]<p>Many young people cannot avoid having problems with their siblings. Very few can avoid these problems because they are so close, and they know each other so well. [They feel that they do not need to be careful, so there are always chances for them to get into the self or the flesh. These chances are snares and traps to get you. Many times, Satan would send your] sibling [to tempt you. He or she may say a hard word to you or give you a long face. But at that time we have to learn how to walk, how to behave, how to have our being and living by the Spirit. Do not talk to your] sibling [by yourself. Talk to your] sibling [with the mingled spirit. This is the way that you can always be ready to speak] Christ everywhere.<h2 class=head1>VII. LIVING CHRIST FOR HIS MAGNIFICATION</h2><p>[We must live Christ for His magnification by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and this bountiful supply is right within us (Phil. 1:19-21; Gal. 2:20). The Lord has given us a wonderful provision. First, we have His Word in our hand. Second, we have the Holy Spirit, who is the bountiful Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, living in us, in our spirit, which has been regenerated and strengthened. We have such a provision, and we can live Christ by this divine provision. If we are such persons, we will surely have something to speak when we come to the meeting.<p>What kind of Christian do you want to be? Do you want to be a cold, dumb, dormant, dying, lukewarm, defeated, and backsliding one? Or do you want to be a Christian who loves the Lord and who is living, refreshing, and active. Why is Christianity not powerful? It is because most of the Christians in the denominations have been stripped of their riches. They have been annulled and even choked to death. This is why they need a religious service in which one person speaks to them. But in the Lord&#8217;s recovery it should be different. The Lord desires to recover a meeting with all the members speaking to function. But this depends upon our Christian walk. We must love the Lord.] [We must enjoy the Lord in the Word early in the morning to have a new start of each day.] [We must live a victorious life. We must abide in the fellowship with the Lord daily and hourly, and we must be praying persons. We must walk and have our being by and according to the mingled spirit, and we must live Christ. If we are such persons day after day and throughout each day, we will be ready to speak in the meetings. Something of Christ will always be bubbling out of us. The Spirit will become a flow out from our innermost being to flow out all the riches of Christ by the Spirit (John 7:37-39).]<p>This is a normal Christian life according to the divine, eternal, and indestructible life. We should not have a living less than this. This is normal. This is our standard. This will cause us to experience life and grow in life.

HAVING PARTNERS IN CHRIST</h2><p>We need to have a normal Christian life as well as a normal church life. Individually, we need to grow in life; corporately, we need to be built up in life. We need a normal daily life for the church life. A normal church life helps us to have a normal Christian life. One of the first things we need in the church life is to have partners, companions. All the believers are partners of Christ to carry out God&#8217;s economy (Heb. 1:9; 3:14). The apostle Paul also had partners such as Silas, Timothy, Titus, Philemon, and many others (Acts 15:40; Rom. 16:21; 2 Cor. 8:23; Philem. 17). Practically speaking, it is good for us to have one or two saints in our age group to be our partners. We can call on the Lord and help one another to flee youthful lusts together (2 Tim. 2:22). We can stir up one another to love the Lord and study the word together. We can pray for our friends and go to preach to them together. It is so good to have partners in Christ to experience life and grow together. Our partners make the church life more real and more dear to us.<h2 class=head1>II. PREACHING CHRIST TO BEGET MEMBERS FOR THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>[The gospel is Christ, who is the very embodiment of the processed Triune God, reaching us as the consummated Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God for our enjoyment.] [My intention is to impress you that in the universe and today on this earth there is something called the gospel which we are reminded and commanded to live for. The Lord commanded us to live for this gospel uniquely. What are we living on this earth for? Do we live for our profession or for our job to make a lot of money? What is man living for? Poor human society has so much activity but no goal. Do we have a goal? Our goal is the gospel, and our gospel is the Triune God processed to be the very Spirit within us as our salvation, as our life, as our life supply, and as our all-inclusive enjoyment. What a wonder and what a dory to live uniquely for such a gospel. I have been living uniquely for this gospel for over fifty years. Hallelujah for this! It is worth it!]<p>The preaching of the gospel is the carrying out of God&#8217;s economy in life. Many of our friends, neighbors, and relatives around us have never heard the gospel and are not saved. Their destiny is eternal perdition, without God, without hope. We must allow the life in us to flow into them through the preaching of the gospel. Make a name list of your friends, neighbors, and relatives. If you do not have enough friends, make more friends at school. Pray with your partners and by yourself for the ones you are burdened for. Your prayer will bind the devil who is holding them captive and will loose them for the Body of Christ (Matt. 18:19). Then go with the authority of Christ (Matt. 28:18), and preach to them the gospel, the good news. You may use the booklet, The Mystery of Human Life, or other appropriate literature. If they would not believe, do not argue, just continue to pray for them. If they respond to what you are saying by smiling, they are the sons of peace (Luke 10:6). They have received faith through hearing your preaching (Rom. 10:17). Then you should lead them to repent, call, pray, and believe. After they pray they are ready to be baptized into the Triune God immediately (Acts 2:38; 8:36-38; 16:33; 22:16; Matt. 28:19). We must practice this every week.<h2 class=head1>III. NOURISHING THE NEW ONES IN CHRIST</h2><p>After they have believed and are baptized, they are saved (Mark 16:16), and have been born of God (John 1:12) to be members of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:12-13). Since they are regenerated through the living and abiding word (1 Pet. 1:23), they are as babes needing to be fed with the milk of the word that they may grow (1 Pet. 2:2).<p>Firstly, we have to use verses such as John 3:5-6; 4:23-24; and 1 Corinthians 6:17 to show them that the Holy Spirit has entered their spirit to give it life, and that these two spirits have been mingled into one spirit. From now on, they must strengthen their mingled, regenerated spirit by calling on the name of the Lord (1 Cor. 12:3) and by praying (Eph. 6:18). Secondly, we must use verses such as John 6:63, 2 Timothy 3:16, 1 Peter 2:2, and Matthew 4:4 to show them that the Word of God is Spirit and life to be the supply to their regenerated spirit as spiritual air, water, and food. They need to pray-read and read the Word of God every day to be filled with the Spirit and grow in life. Thirdly, We must use verses such as Romans 8:6 and Galatians 5:16 to show them that we have a sense of life within us that is of the mingled regenerated spirit. From now on they need to live and walk by the sense of life within them. This sense of life is the sense of the mingled regenerated spirit. We sense life and peace whenever we are doing things according to the spirit. We sense death whenever we are doing things according to the flesh.<p>These three points are the three foundation stones of the Christian life. The new ones must be clear about them and practice them to be established in their faith. There are many other points you may use to help your new ones. Chapter nineteen of The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ will render you further help.<h2 class=head1>IV. PERFECTING THE YOUNGER ONES TO FUNCTION</h2><p>After the new ones become more established in the faith, you need to perfect them further. You must teach them everything you have learned (Matt. 28:20; 2 Tim. 2:2). You must cause them to be just like you: loving the Lord, having morning revival, living a victorious life, etc. As you sow Christ into them as a seed of life (John 12:24), they will grow up to love the Lord just like you. If you have kept your first love toward the Lord, they will have the first love toward the Lord. If you are living uniquely for the gospel, they will live uniquely for the gospel. If you help your friends receive salvation, they also can help their friends receive salvation. Whatever you are in life, they will be. Whatever you are perfected in, they will be perfected by you in the same things (Eph. 4:11-12). The apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 11:1, &#8220;Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.&#8217;&#8217; You can say the same thing to your new ones. If to you to live is Christ (Phil. 1:21a), then to them to live will also be Christ. This is too wonderful! You will be a little apostle, a little evangelist, a little prophet, a little shepherd and teacher. If you would do this for ten years, you will surely experience much life and you will grow in life. After ten years, you may become a mature apostle, evangelist, prophet, shepherd and teacher.<h2 class=head1>V. BUILDING UP THE BODY THROUGH PROPHESYING IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h2><p>The final step is to prophesy and help your new ones to prophesy in the church meeting so that you may build up the church, the Body of Christ. First Corinthians 14:4b says, &#8220;He who prophesies builds up the church.&#8217;&#8217; [Prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 is not predicting but speaking for the Lord, speaking forth the Lord, and speaking the Lord into others, ministering (dispensing) the Lord to others. What a precious and valuable thing it is to minister, to dispense Christ into others. We need to learn to speak Christ, dispensing Him into others.]<p>[First Corinthians reveals that we need to enjoy Christ as everything. What we enjoy will have an issue. The enjoyment of Christ firstly issues in the growth in life to produce materials for the building up of the church (3:6, 9-14).] [The enjoyment of Christ also issues in the development of gifts for functioning to build up the Body of Christ, prophesying being the excelling gift (1 Cor. 14:1, 12, 39a). To build up anything you need firstly the materials and secondly the skill, the functioning. Thus, the enjoyment of Christ issues not only in the growth in life but also in the development of gifts for functioning.] [Dispensing Christ by speaking Him, prophesying, is the top development of the gifts as an issue of enjoying Him.]<p>Whenever we call on the Lord and pray-read the word, we must have some enjoyment of Christ and some experiences of life. We should write down these revelations and experiences. On Saturday, we should use these notes to compose a prophecy. We also should help our new ones to do the same. On the Lord&#8217;s day, when the whole church comes together, you and your new ones will have a revelation or a testimony (1 Cor. 14:26). Then you and your new ones should prophesy or testify according to what you have composed concerning the Lord (Psa. 45:1). When you speak for the Lord this way you will build up the church, the Body of Christ. You will tear down the degraded system of clergy-laity, which the Lord hates (Rev. 2:6), to build up the church directly (Eph. 4:12). In this way, the prophecy (foretelling) of the Lord, &#8220;I will build My church&#8217;&#8217; (Matt. 16:18), will be partially fulfilled by you.<p>If you and all the saints in the churches will rise up to experience life, to grow in life, to deal with all the hindrances by repenting and confessing, to maintain a strong spirit by calling and praying, to be enriched with the Word of God by pray-reading, reading, studying, and memorizing, to speak Christ every day in every place to every person, to live a normal Christian daily life, and to have a normal church life, then the Body of Christ will be built, the Lord will return, you will enter into the millennial kingdom as a reward, and finally, you will be the New Jerusalem for eternity. Hallelujah! This is the final issue of life. We all have to praise the Lord that He is the eternal, divine, and indestructible life in us to produce such wonderful results.
