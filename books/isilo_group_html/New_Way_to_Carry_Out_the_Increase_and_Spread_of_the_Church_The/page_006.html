<h2 class="head1">KNOCKING ON DOORS TO GAIN HOMES</h2>
<p>Previously we have seen the way to visit people by knocking on their doors. To knock on people&rsquo;s doors is not the end; that is just the initiation, the beginning. According to our past study and experience, if you would knock on people&rsquo;s doors in this way, you will not be altogether rejected. Some doors will not be open to you, and some people will reject you. However, those in a good percentage of the homes will open up their doors and will welcome you. This will give us a very good chance to get into the homes, to not only gain individual persons but to gain homes. Do not forget that to knock on people&rsquo;s doors is not simply to gain individual persons but to gain home after home. Our stress is on the home. The home is our unit, our goal. We are going out to gain homes because a home always involves a lot of persons. If you could get a home, you could get a good number of persons through that home. We have to take the home as our goal for our going out to knock on doors.</p>
<p>Throughout the years we have been hearing that it was too hard to get people, to bring people in. It was hard because we took the wrong way. You cannot drive a car onto the roof. We have been trying to drive the car of the recovery onto the roof for many years. That was the wrong way. Now we would not go out to get people for our meetings but bring the meetings to them. The home which you gain may have only three persons, but after a number of weeks their relatives, in-laws, and friends will come in. Do not forget that when you go to knock on people&rsquo;s doors, it is to get a home. Do not be satisfied just to get one person. That is not so promising. One person could be easily lost, but a home cannot. Remember well that your going out is to get homes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING AN APPOINTMENT IN THE FIRST CONTACT<br />
FOR FOLLOWING MEETINGS</h2>
<p>In your first contact you must grasp the time and seize the opportunity to make an appointment for the next meeting. What will you do in all the following meetings? This is the burden of this chapter. From the second time you go to visit them you must begin to do one wonderful thing, that is, to set up a meeting in their home. This is why we need training. We are getting ourselves prepared to knock on doors. When the doors are opened to us, we will go in to start a meeting. From now on the church meeting will go out to be in other people&rsquo;s homes. I hope that when people open their doors to you and you go in, you would not be persons so dear and precious yet unable to do anything. It is not sufficient to simply go in and say, &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; What you can do depends on whether or not you would be trained. Formerly we considered that only the elders and the co-workers needed to learn these things. This is why in October of 1984, I had a big burden to change our entire practice, to tear down the clergy-laity system. All the saints need to learn how to set up meetings in the homes of the new contacts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO USE THE RECOVERY VERSION<br />
AND OUR PUBLICATIONS</h2>
<p>To set up meetings in the homes of the new contacts we must first learn to use the Recovery Version and our publications. Whether you use the Recovery Version first or the other publications first depends upon the present situation and atmosphere. When you go to a home the second time, do not speak with your own words. You must learn to speak what is printed on our pages. Most people respect the words printed in books. Whatever you speak may not be that valuable. Whatever is printed surely is something better than the word out of our mouth because it has been thoroughly considered. Everyone on this earth knows that the Bible is the highest book, regardless of whether they are believers or unbelievers. When you present people the Recovery Version of the New Testament, read one verse to them with one of the notes. Do not read it carelessly; you have to read it meaningfully. For this you have to prepare yourself in using the Recovery Version. You have to spend time to read the text with the notes day by day. You must be trained in knowing and using the Recovery Version.</p>
<p>Recently some sisters were singing in their house. Across the street an elderly lady heard the singing and came to see them. She was happy because she also was a seeking Christian. One of the sisters read note 3<sup>2</sup> in Matthew 1 concerning the five women in the genealogy of Christ. This note attracted that seeking Christian and stirred up her desire to get a copy of the Recovery Version for herself. The five women were Tamar (v. 3), Rahab (v. 5), Ruth (v. 5), Bathsheba (v. 6), and Mary (v. 16). Tamar was the daughter-in-law of Judah, who begot sons by her. The second woman was Rahab, a prostitute. A prostitute became one of the ancestors of Christ. You must learn to know all these verses with wonderful notes such as these, which are very attractive to the seeking ones.</p>
<p>Recently, two brothers had the burden to go door-to-door to introduce the Recovery Version to people. After two doors they met a woman who had begun to doubt the inerrancy of the Word due to the three missing generations in Matthew 1. These brothers showed her note 8<sup>1</sup> of Matthew 1 which deals with this problem. Students of the Bible have debated about this for many years. They had no answers as to why the three generations in 1 Chronicles 3:11-12 were omitted from the genealogy in Matthew 1. After reading this note, she was convinced that the Bible was really inspired by God. As a result of these brothers reading this note to this seeker, she bought two Recovery Versions and her entire home was gained by the Lord.</p>
<p>When you are received into a home through some questions and a short talk, you may realize that these ones are Christians. Then you have to use the Recovery Version. Just as in fighting, you must know how to use the proper weapons. Even carpenters in their carpentry know how to use their tools&mdash;sometimes they have to use an axe and at other times they have to use a hammer or a saw. You all have to learn how to use the Bible the Lord has put into our hands. Become familiar with the text of the Bible and with the notes in the Recovery Version that help to open up the Bible.</p>
<p>You also need to know the contents of the small booklets, especially the booklet entitled <em>The Mystery of Human Life.</em> You do not need to use the entire book. Use only one of the four keys in this booklet that unlock the mystery of human life. When you talk to a particular person, you may have the realization that the last key would be very good for him. Simply use that one key and open the door with it. We also have many rainbow booklets, all selected from the Life-study Messages on the New Testament books. We should also take these booklets with us when we go to others&rsquo; homes.</p>
<p>We have to realize that we are here living to the Lord (Rom. 14:8; 2 Cor. 5:15). We should bear the burden to go out to spread the truth with the gospel. We have to know the truth. The truth is in the Bible, yet the Bible is a book that needs expounding. Luke 24:13-35 is a good illustration of this. There the Lord Jesus met the two disciples going to Emmaus and &ldquo;interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself&rdquo; (v. 27). They did not know how to understand these things until the Lord Jesus opened their understanding to know all the verses concerning Himself in the Old Testament (vv. 31-32). Likewise, in Acts 8:26-39 the eunuch from Ethiopia was reading Isaiah 53 but did not know what it meant until Philip explained to him what was there.</p>
<p>The holy Word needs to be expounded. In 1936 I wrote a booklet on Christ&rsquo;s genealogy after I spent about eleven years to study it. The consummation of my labor on the genealogy is in the notes on the first seventeen verses of Matthew 1. Many Bible students would rather skip over this portion of the Word, but these notes bring us into its real significance. We all need to study the Word. Thank the Lord that through the notes to the Recovery Version and through the Life-study Messages the New Testament has been expounded. The notes and the Life-studies open up the Bible to us. The &ldquo;mine has been opened,&rdquo; but there is the need of more digging to gain the truth.</p>
<p>We should also spend some time on the rainbow booklets. It is better to pass out what you have read. Then you will know what is there and how to use it. Therefore, when you go to a home the second time, the first thing you must be able to do is to show them some interesting and attractive portions from the Recovery Version and our publications. Pick a paragraph or a page and open it to the one with whom you are speaking. Either he or you will read or you may read together in a very close and intimate way. Do not read too much. The notes on the genealogy of Christ are quite long; most of the saints just use one paragraph or point. The sisters I mentioned used the point on the five women, and the brother used the paragraph on the three missing generations. This is good enough.</p>
<p>When you set up meetings in the homes, do not keep the meeting too long. It is better if it is thirty minutes or at the most forty-five minutes, but never over one hour. Use one paragraph from <em>The Mystery of Human Life,</em> the rainbow booklets, or some other Life-study Messages. You will see the result and the response. Then grasp their response to &ldquo;close the deal.&rdquo; You may close the deal to get one person baptized, because that person may have received the help from your reading or from his reading with you. You may close the deal with a prayer, with an appreciation of the Lord Jesus, or with the knowledge of God&rsquo;s salvation. It all depends upon what you have read. All the saints should learn this and practice this. Then your going out would never be in vain; it will be so productive all the time.</p>
<p>Do not think that because a certain one was baptized by you that you may go on right away to tell him something else. As long as he was baptized that is good enough. Do not go further. Leave the other things for the future. Each time just do one thing. Do not be greedy to accomplish more than one item. You will have a regular, weekly meeting, and you will come back again. When you come back, you can continue. Do not do many things at one time. Remember that it is very crucial and effective to use the Recovery Version and all our publications.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The New Way to Carry Out the Increase and Spread of the Church &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
