TO IMPART GIFTS TO THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The work of the Holy Spirit outside the believer is not just to come upon the believer to empower him but also to give him spiritual inspiration and gifts. These two steps, the coming upon and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, include all the work of the Holy Spirit outside the believer. These two steps of the work of the Holy Spirit outside of the believer are related. The Holy Spirit coming upon the believer is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on him, often resulting in his receiving spiritual inspiration and spiritual gifts. Although the coming and outpouring of the Holy Spirit does not always cause the believer to receive spiritual gifts, a believer must have the Holy Spirit come upon him and must have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in order to receive spiritual inspiration, and hence, spiritual gifts. Such spiritual gifts always come from the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;There are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 12:4-11).</p>
<p>Spiritual gifts are spiritual abilities and skills, enabling the believer to do spiritual things and to manifest spiritual functions. Whether these gifts are healing, working wonders, prophesying, tongues, or other gifts, they are the abilities and skills of the Holy Spirit that enable a believer to do spiritual work and fulfill God&rsquo;s plan. Although there are distinctions and different measures of gifts, these spiritual abilities and skills come from the inspiration of the same Holy Spirit: &ldquo;The one and the same Spirit operates all these things, distributing to each one respectively even as He purposes&rdquo; (v. 11).</p>
<p>The work of the Holy Spirit outside the believer not only empowers the believer to work for the Lord but also gives gifts to him, enabling him to do God&rsquo;s work. Just as the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s coming upon the believers through His outpouring causes believers to be empowered, so also His inspiration on believers through His outward moving causes them to be gifted. Power is a matter of strength, whereas gifts are a matter of skill. A believer can carry out an intense spiritual work for the Lord in order to serve God only when power is combined with gift and gift is added to power.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for what is profitable&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 12:7).</p>
<p>The manifestation of gifts in the believers through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit causes the believers to work for God and accomplish God&rsquo;s great plan. These gifts are also given to every believer for what is profitable. All the gifts given through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit enable the believer to do things for God so that all may profit. Any gift of inspiration that does not profit others is questionable.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Say, Jesus is Lord...in the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 12:3).</p>
<p>The inspiration of the Holy Spirit is given for what is profitable and also causes one to say, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord.&rdquo; The outpouring of the Holy Spirit proves that the Lord Jesus has been made both Lord and Christ by God (Acts 2:33-36). Thus, the goal of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s inspiration is not merely to profit others but also to exalt the Lord Jesus, causing the believers to confess that Jesus is Lord. All inspirations that do not produce a confession that Jesus is Lord are not of the Holy Spirit but of evil spirits. All who are inspired by the Holy Spirit will say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the four steps of the work that the Holy Spirit accomplishes on the believers, two are inward and two are outward. Regeneration and indwelling occur in the believers, whereas outward filling and inspiration occur outside the believers. Regeneration and indwelling are for the spiritual life of the believers so that they may have both a beginning and a maturity in their spiritual life. Outward filling and inspiration are for the spiritual work of the believers so that they may possess both power and gifts for spiritual work.</p>
<p>A healthy, normal Christian who is up to the standard has balanced and adequate experiences of these four aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit. He has the regenerating and indwelling Spirit within so that he may have a rich and matured life. He also has the filling and inspiring Spirit without so that he may do a strong spiritual work. We should not think that because we have regeneration and indwelling within, we have no need of filling and inspiration without. Even more, we must not confuse outward filling and inspiration with inward regeneration and indwelling. These four aspects of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s work should not be mixed or substituted for each other. We should have His regenerating and indwelling inwardly as well as His filling and inspiring outwardly.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
