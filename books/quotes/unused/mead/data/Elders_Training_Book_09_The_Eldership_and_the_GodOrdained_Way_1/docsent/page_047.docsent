   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SERVING THE CHURCH ORGANICALLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is only when the church has degraded and deviated from the line of life, that organization is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the elders take the lead in an organizational way, this indicates that the church has degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the elders live in the spirit by life to nourish, cherish, and shepherd the church, they are not organizational but organic.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a local church is organic, all the serving ones serve organically.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A brother who is a deacon may say that he serves merely because he was appointed and has no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we ask another brother why he serves, he may say, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord is within me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He leads me and burdens me to love Him, and I like to serve the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not care whether I was appointed to be a deacon or not.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even if the church did not appoint me, I would still like to serve more."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This brother's service is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be in the realm of organization is to be in degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The wrong teaching about the apostles keeping their hands off the church after their appointing of the elders is a degradation into organization.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Nee appointed the elders in Shanghai and he still remained there to help the church and the other churches until he was imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There was no argument in the Lord's recovery organizationally because we practiced the church administration organically, altogether in life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the elders should nourish, cherish, and shepherd the church, but they still need the gifts, such as the apostles, prophets, and evangelists, to come periodically to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What if the elders in a certain locality reject an apostle?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To merely assert his position as an apostle in an outward way would be organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He must deal with them and help them in an organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He may express his attitude in the following way: "I have appointed you as elders.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even if you now reject me, I still love you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I still love the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I will still speak the word of God to you and do my best to help the church and heal you."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to come out of all the human, worldly, and organizational ways of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For over sixty-six years, starting with Brother Nee, we have followed the Bible organically.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why we say that the elders should not control the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have the burden to help the elders shepherd the church, nourish the church, and cherish the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will just do our best to minister the word and to help the churches.</S>
