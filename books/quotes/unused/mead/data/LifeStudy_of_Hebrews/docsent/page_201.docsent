   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>White</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The manna in the wilderness was white Exo 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that it was clean and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No earthly food is as white as manna.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Manna is the purest food.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more we feast on Christ, eating of Him as our manna, the more we are whitened.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are not only cleansed and purified; we are whitened.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be white means to be absolutely without stain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we feed on Christ, all our stains are eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although we may be good in certain respects, we are not white.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although we may be loving, our love is not white; it is colored.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our humility is also colored.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In fact, none of our human attributes is white; every one of them is colored.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the more we take in Christ as our life supply, the more our color will be reduced and the whiter we shall become.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>An excellent Chinese food is sea cucumber.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But because it is black in color, the American brothers are unwilling to eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although I have tried my best to convince them to eat it, they are all afraid of its black appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Manna, on the contrary, is white and does not frighten anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, it gives us the feeling of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eaten as Bread, Cakes, and Wafers</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The manna was eaten as bread Exo 16:15 , as cakes Num 11:8 , and as wafers Exo 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As our manna, Christ has different aspects and nourishes us in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we eat Him as our manna, sometimes He tastes like bread and at other times He tastes like a cake or like a wafer which is thin and easy to eat and digest.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Like a Coriander Seed</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The manna was also like coriander seed Exo 16:31; Num 11:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This food is a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we eat Christ, He comes into us as a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The coriander seed, unlike corn, is very tiny.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A seed is something of life which brings the life element into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As such a seed, Christ will grow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With the Taste of Honey</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Exodus 16:31 we are told that the taste of manna was like wafers made with honey.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Honey is sweet and is the produce of two lives, the animal life and the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Honey is the mingling of these two lives.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The honey bees which produce honey receive the supply from flowers, from the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As our manna, Christ has this element of the mingling of the animal life with the vegetable life which becomes our sweet nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the Taste of Fresh Oil</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Numbers 11:8 says of the manna that the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Oil typifies the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we eat Christ as our manna, we taste the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The oil here is the fresh oil.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit we taste when we enjoy Christ as manna is always fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As our manna, Christ tastes like fresh oil and has the flavor and nourishment of honey.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With the Appearance of Bdellium</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the original Hebrew, Numbers 11:7 says, The manna was as coriander seed, and the eye thereof as the eye of bdellium.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is difficult for anyone to translate this verse properly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The King James Version says that the color was as the color of bdellium.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Bdellium is a pearl produced by the resin from a tree and is very much like the pearl produced by an oyster.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The color of manna is the color of bdellium.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Other versions use the word appearance instead of color.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, the Hebrew word here is eye.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Manna has an eye, for its appearance is like that of an eye.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A pearl somewhat resembles an eye.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you examine a pearl, you will see that it is like an eyeball.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>An eyeball has the appearance of pearl, and this appearance is its color.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In other words, the appearance and color of bdellium are like an eye.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we eat the manna, we eat many eyes, and all these eyes get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As the manna, Christ resembles an eye.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The more we eat of Christ, the more eyes we shall have.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The four living creatures in Revelation 4:6 are full of eyes before and behind.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At the front and at the rear, within and without, they are full of eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you go to a greenhouse, you will see that none of the walls is opaque; every side is transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>An eye means transparency.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>With the exception of our eyes, which are transparent, our whole body is opaque.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we do not have Christ, we do not have any eyes, and we are absolutely opaque.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we were saved, we began to be transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now the more we enjoy Christ, the more transparent we become.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whenever we are with a brother who truly enjoys Christ, we can sense that he is transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Standing before him is like being in a transparent greenhouse.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, anyone who is not in the enjoyment of the Lord is altogether opaque.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If you are with four such persons, you will feel like you are in a dungeon surrounded by opaque walls.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But if you are surrounded by several brothers who love the Lord and feed on Him, you will sense that everything is transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As the manna, Christ is transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we eat Him, we eat eyeballs and we become transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This transparency will eventually become our appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we enjoy Christ day after day, eating Him as the eyeball, we shall have the appearance of Christ, the appearance of an eyeball, and this appearance will become our color.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>By eating Christ, we are colored with the transparency of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In this way, transparency becomes our appearance and color.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Not Legal</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Finally, as the manna, Christ is not legal.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Numbers 11:8 says, The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Christ can be ground, beaten in a mortar, or baked in pans.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He is not legal.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Nearly every Christian, however, is legal.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If you experience Christ in a certain way, you make that a legal way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But Christ would say, To you, I am ground.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But others prefer to beat Me. I feel quite good when I am beaten in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Still others bake Me and put Me into an oven.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I also feel good about this.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Why are you so narrow and legal?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>What a wonderful record we find in the Bible regarding the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we are asked what it is, we must simply say that it is manna.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It comes with the dew and is like the frost on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It is small, round, white, and like a coriander seed.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It can he eaten as bread, cake, and wafers, it has the taste of honey and fresh oil, and its appearance is like an eyeball.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Although we might have read Exodus 16 and Numbers 11 many times, we probably have never noticed all these aspects of the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We need to eat more eyeballs that we may have the transparent sight.</S>
