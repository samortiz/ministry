   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MATERIAL FOR THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 3:12 tells us that the working material of some people is gold, silver, and precious stones, while the working material of other people is wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The day will come and reveal everything by fire; the fire will prove of what sort is each one's work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We know that wood, grass, and stubble do not remain once they are burned.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But gold, silver, and precious stones are things that cannot be burned away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Gold signifies something of God; it is the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Silver signifies redemption; it is the work of the Lord on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The precious stones signify the work of the Holy Spirit, which is the Holy Spirit's constitution of the life of God in man through revelation, blending God and man into one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is our subjective experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The precious stones are compounds.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to be compounded together, there is the need of intense heat.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After this, there is still need of a carving work by the hand of the craftsmen before we can have some shining precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is how God constitutes Himself in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, God uses the environment to burn the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the other hand, they must pass through God's carving hand, which removes what He does not approve of and retains what He does approve of through the revelation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only then will they shine and glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who have become precious stones, who are both human and divine, are the masterpieces of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These are the ones in whom God can trust.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First Corinthians 7:25-40 is clearly Paul's own words because he said clearly that he did not have the Lord's command.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet at the end he said that he had the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For a period of time, Madam Guyon found that as soon as she set her mind on something within herself, it was accomplished around her.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is because her mind had become the mind of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although the words of these ones issue from themselves, God honors their words.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is not afraid of joining Himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They have lost themselves in God as a drop of water has lost itself in the ocean; the water and the ocean have become inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These are precious stones; they are the consummation of the work of the Holy Spirit and the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should humble ourselves before the Lord and allow Him to work on us, to constitute the life of Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only then will we be able to help others, and only then will they know the constitution of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the work of precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now let us consider the work of the Holy Spirit in man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Beginning of the Work Pentecost</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At Pentecost, the Holy Spirit the Worker descended and began His work on earth, convicting men of sin and turning them to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He continues His work by living within the believers, enabling them to grow in spiritual stature and to mature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Place of the Work the Spirit of Man</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Holy Spirit abides in man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This spirit is the place from which He works; it is the center of His operation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All spiritual work begins in man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The work of the Holy Spirit is twofold: the direct work and the indirect work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The direct work of the Holy Spirit is to reveal God's desire in man's spirit, then to enlighten man's soul so that his mind will understand, and finally to direct the body to execute God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The indirect work of the Holy Spirit is God's speaking to man through all kinds of circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At times He uses the Bible, and at other times He uses angels, persons, things, or events.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, He spoke to Brother Lawrence through the barren trees in winter and convinced him of God's resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our wise God speaks to man in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet one thing is certain: The word spoken must be transmitted into man's spirit before it will have any genuine effect on his spiritual life.</S>
