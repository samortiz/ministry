<h2 class="head1">SALVATION IN CHRIST</h2><h2 class="head2">The Principle Being the Same in Christ as in Adam</h2><p>God's salvation works the same way as the free gift that Adam gave to us in making us sinners. God's salvation in Christ is the same in principle as our being sinners in Adam. When we are in Adam, there is no need for us to do anything to inherit his sinful nature and power. When we are in Christ, there is no need for us to make up our mind, do anything, or come up with anything to receive salvation. As long as we are in Christ, God's salvation comes to us unconditionally, freely, and unreservedly. As long as we are in Christ, everything of Christ becomes ours. There is no need for us to exert any strength or to think or make up our mind to do anything. The situation is exactly the same as when we were in Adam. This is grace. I sin because the life of Adam is in me. In the same way, I am good, righteous, and holy because I am in Christ and the life of Christ is in me. There is no need for me to exert any strength of my own. Only one condition is crucial&mdash;we must be in Christ.</p><p>The gospel annuls our previous relationship in Adam. Our relationship with Christ today is just the same as our relationship with Adam previously. Friends, what grace our God has bestowed upon us! I can say with joy and happiness that we can enjoy everything there is in Christ. In Christ we can partake of all that Christ can do and all that He has. This kind of participation does not require any effort of our own; it comes naturally. As long as we are in Christ, it is ours. This is just like sinning without any effort when we were in Adam. In Christ there is no place for any effort of our own; we can be humble, patient, meek, holy, and transcendent over all things. As long as we are in Christ, we can do all these things and we can have all these things.</p><h2 class="head2">Becoming a New Creation in Christ</h2><p>Let us see what the Bible says about this matter. Please read 2 Corinthians 5:17. Does it say, "If anyone does good, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new"? No! The Bible does not say this. It does not say that only those who make up their mind and strive to do good are transferred from the old creation to the new. Rather, it says, "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation." There is no other condition. It is not a matter of what we are, how we make up our minds, or how hard we strive to change ourselves into a new creation. It says that as long as we are in Christ, we are a new creation. Nevertheless, we all constantly think about how we can become a new creation. We try to improve ourselves, changing a little today and a little tomorrow, gradually working ourselves into a new creation. Even though we are not humble in our heart, we think that we can start at least by being humble with our words. We try to speak to others in a humble way. Or we may try to practice holiness by first being holy with our words and then holy with our thoughts. We think that although we are evil today, we can change for the better and gradually make ourselves holy. We hope that this will one day change us into a new creation. It is difficult for us to say how long we will need for such a change, but we think that it may take ten or twenty years, or perhaps even a lifetime. But please read the Word of God: "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation." Being a new creation has nothing to do with us. As long as we are in Christ, we are a new creation.</p><p>During my gospel meetings in Kaifeng, the younger brother of a magistrate came to me and said, "I admit that I have sinned. But no matter what you say, I still believe in Buddhism and in self-enlightenment. I have studied Buddhism for a few years, not in the superstitious ways, but by a philosophical approach and by seeking after peace of mind and contentment of life. Yet the more I study and the harder I try, the less peace of mind I have; it seems that turmoil is always within me. I have been practicing this for a few years, but have not made much progress, but I intend to spend another thirty years to continue my pursuit, and I hope that I will succeed eventually. According to what you have said, a man can become a new man within a day. Once he is in Christ, he becomes a new man. How can this be? I have studied many religious books and found that the Christian way is the fastest way. But you are very bold. Your way is even faster than the Christian way. How can this be?" I did not give him too much of an explanation, I only told him to go home and try it out. At the next meeting, he came and said, "Your method is fast. The next time you have a baptism, please tell me about it. I want to be baptized." Everything that is in Christ happens fast; there is no need to improve or adjust ourselves slowly. All the virtues are in Christ; they do not become ours by self-improvement, nor are they manufactured. As long as we are in Christ, we have all the virtues.</p><p>Does a lamp need to pray for a few hours, make resolutions, or strive before it can shine? No. All it needs is to be connected to electricity and it will shine. There is no light in the lamp itself; all it does is allow light to shine through it. The same is true with a Christian; he cannot accomplish anything through self-enlightenment, struggling, or conjectures. All he has to do is to touch Christ&mdash;the "electrical power source." Regeneration, sanctification, and power are all in Christ; they have nothing to do with changing ourselves. The overcoming life, holiness, humility, etc., are all Christ. When we are in Christ, we have all of these. We have to say, "Thank Christ that it is not I. All the glory goes to Christ. Everything is done by Christ; it is not done by me. I receive everything in Christ." The only condition is being in Christ; there is no other condition. As long as we are in Christ, we are a new creation, and the old creation has passed away.</p><p>The question is: Are you in Adam or are you in Christ? Sinning or overcoming, perishing or having eternal life have nothing to do with us. It all depends on which man we are in. This is God's way of salvation; it is the way described in the Bible. God saves us by putting us into Christ. In dealing with Christ, He has dealt with everything. Do you still remember the illustration of the chalk box and the chalk? Wherever the chalk box is, there is the chalk. The destiny of the chalk box is the destiny of the chalk. The pieces of chalk do not have to ask what will happen to them. All they have to ask is what will happen to the chalk box. This is our relationship with Christ; we do not have to ask about ourselves; we only need to ask about Christ. As long as we are in Christ, whatever Christ is becomes ours.</p>
