   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRANSFUSED BY THE SEVEN EYES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These seven Spirits are also the seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Eyes speak of transfusion and transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we look at someone, we infuse what we are into him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we are in prayer, we sometimes sense the Lord's eyes upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is infusing us with Himself, changing what we are by adding His substance to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After our time of prayer we are not the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not only has His light shined on us; He has also transfused His element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have had an "injection" of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Day by day it increases and is added to.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without your realizing it, you are being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only is there gold within you; you are becoming pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The gold is taking the form of the stature of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then when you meet together, you are a golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Holy Spirit is released and able to shine forth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now you can see why the seven Spirits are not only the ultimate expression of God but also the ultimate expression of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a lamp has no light bulb, it has no ultimate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The lampstand's ultimate expression is the bright shining of its seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church in each locality can be such a lampstand, shining in the darkness, because all of you individually are being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The element of gold is increasing in you, resulting in your expressing God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The golden lampstand is God Himself and also the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This reality is accomplished by the seven Spirits, which are the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the end the Spirit and the Bride become one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the final objective toward which God is aiming.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the work of the Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By these seven Spirits, seven lamps, and seven eyes, all that God is will be shined into us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By this transfusion of Himself, we shall be metabolically changed to become the golden lampstand in reality.</S>
