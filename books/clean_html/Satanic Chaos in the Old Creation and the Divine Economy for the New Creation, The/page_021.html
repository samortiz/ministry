<P>Now let us consider verses 27 through 29. These verses say, "As many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are of Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise." Abraham has only one seed, Christ (v. 16). Hence, to be Abraham's seed we must be of Christ, be a part of Christ. Because we are one with Christ, we too are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise, inheriting God's promised blessing, which is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. Thus, through faith we, the believers, are Abraham's seed. This means that our race has been changed from the Adamic race to the Abrahamic race. Now we, all the believers in Christ&#151;white, black, yellow, brown, and red&#151;are of the same race, the Abrahamic race.</P><P>We have a further confirmation of this in Galatians 6. Verse 10 says, "So then, as we have the opportunity, let us do what is good toward all, but especially toward those of the household of the faith." Who are those of the household of the faith? They are the spiritual descendants of Abraham, including all the believing Jews and believing Gentiles. No matter what our color may be, we all have faith, and we all are members of the household of the faith, members of the same family. All the believers in Christ together constitute a universal household, the great family of God.</P><P>Whereas in verse 10 we have the household of the faith, in verses 15 and 16 we have the new creation and the Israel of God. "Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters. And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God." The household of the faith is the new creation, and the new creation is the Israel of God. This means that these three terms&#151;household of the faith, new creation, and Israel of God&#151;are synonyms. As real Jews, as Abraham's spiritual descendants, we are first the household of the faith. Second, we are a new creation. "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation" (2 Cor. 5:17a). Finally, we are the Israel of God. Everyone who believes in Christ is a member of the household of the faith, a new creation, and a part of the Israel of God. What a wonderful people we are in Christ!</P><P>On the one hand, we are a new creation; on the other hand, we are still troubled by chaos. Sometimes we may wonder why God does not simply eliminate the satanic chaos. The infinite, eternal God accomplished the miracle of becoming incarnated; He remained in Mary's womb for nine months, and then He was born to be the God-man. Since He could do such a miracle, why did He not destroy those who opposed Him when He was on earth? Not long after the Lord Jesus was born, Herod tried to kill Him. Why did God not immediately do away with Herod? Eventually, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Herodians conspired to kill Him. Why did God not remove all of them? In other words, why did God not rid the earth of chaos? In our opinion, God should come in to clear away all the satanic chaos. We may say to Him, "Lord, why is the chaos still here? Why do You not take it away? If You would eliminate the chaos, a lot of time would be saved, and there would be no more problems." Probably we all have had this kind of thought.</P><P>Today we still experience chaos in our family life. In the morning we may have a pleasant time with the Lord enjoying the divine economy. However, not long afterward we may be troubled by our spouse or by one of our children. Suddenly instead of economy there is chaos.</P><P>We have chaos not only in our family life but even in the church life. Some might say that the church life is a paradise. Yes, in a sense the church life may be a kind of paradise, but this does not mean that there will never be turmoil in the church. In the thirty years that the Lord's recovery has been in the United States, we have seen turmoil after turmoil, chaos after chaos. When there is turmoil in the church life, we may be bothered and ask, "Is this the church life? Is this the recovery? What is the difference between this and the denominations?" In order that we all may be comforted, I am burdened to point out the record in the Bible of the satanic chaos in the old creation and the divine economy for the new creation.</P><P>I also have been bothered by the turmoil, but one day the Lord showed me from the New Testament how much the Lord Jesus Himself was troubled by chaos. When He was a baby, Herod tried to kill Him. But the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, telling him to take the child and His mother and flee into Egypt (Matt. 2:13). Later Joseph was instructed in a dream to return to the land of Israel and to settle in the city of Nazareth (vv. 19-23). God did not clear away all the chaos.</P><P>Although God sent His recovery to this country, He has not removed the chaos. On the contrary, we have been troubled by chaos both from the outside and from the inside. Certain opposers on the outside wrote evil books to slander and defame us. Certain of those who were once on the inside have caused turmoil, saying falsely that, since 1984, the recovery has changed in nature. One person even went so far as to say that the training in Taipei should be dismantled. Others have accused me of no longer caring for life but only for numbers. These accusations were made by those who were formerly on the inside, including some who had been intimately related to me and who had been under my training for twenty-five years. Such accusations and the turmoil caused by them are surely something chaotic.</P><P>During the years I was with Brother Nee, there was chaos again and again. I observed that the chaos came in cycles. Every eight or ten years was a cycle. Since I was Brother Nee's helper, the chaos was directed not at me but at him. He was the "umbrella" upon which the "rain" would fall, and I was under him. After I was sent out of mainland China, to some extent I became the umbrella, and throughout the years the rain has been falling on me. However, I can testify that actually the chaos does not hurt us or damage us. On the contrary, the chaos helps the recovery. For this reason, even in the midst of the chaos, I am comforted, I praise the Lord, and I rejoice in Him.</P><P>The New Testament is full not only of the divine economy but also of the satanic chaos. Let us now consider the record in the New Testament concerning the divine economy and the satanic chaos. After this, we will see the ending of the satanic chaos and the consummation of the divine economy.</P>
