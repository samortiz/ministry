To Restore the Land</H2><P>As such a covenant, He restores the land (Isa. 49:8e). Israel lost the land, and Christ came, in His commission, to restore it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. To Be a Light to the Nations</H2><P>Christ's commission is also to be a light to the nations (42:6e; 49:6c). He is the light of life, the true light, to shine over the world and enlighten every man (John 1:4, 9; 8:12; 9:5). This light is the light of life to enliven man for regeneration (1 Pet. 1:23). He is the divine, marvelous light to deliver God's chosen people out of the darkness of death, the death-realm, the authority of Satan, into God's life-realm of light (1 Pet. 2:9b; Acts 26:18a). Christ as the covenant is for God's people to gain God with His riches as their inheritance; whereas Christ as the light is for God's people to receive God as life for their new germination. The covenant is for inheritance, the light is for life, and Christ is both. Thus, when we receive Christ, we have the surety of our inheritance and the life for our new germination. We have Christ as our inheritance and our germinating life.</P><P>For His chosen people to receive Christ as such a covenant and as such a light, God as the Creator of the heavens and the earth and as the One who gives breath to men, gives also spirit to them, that they may be able to enjoy Him, the Triune God, as their inheritance and life (Isa. 42:5; Zech. 12:1). Isaiah 42:5 says that God is the One "who created the heavens and stretched them out, / Who spread forth the earth and what springs up from it, / Who gives breath to the people upon it / And spirit to those who walk on it." This verse is a sister verse to Zechariah 12:1, which says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. Why did God, after creating the heavens and the earth, form a spirit in man? This was so that man could have a recipient, a receiver, to receive God who is the Spirit to be his inheritance and life. I did not understand until recently why verse 5 in Isaiah 42 was placed between verses 4 and 6. Verses 4 and 6 indicate that there are many riches for us to receive. But how could we receive these riches without a receiver? If there were a table full of food, yet we did not have a stomach, how could we take in the food? Our spirit is our spiritual stomach to receive all the riches of God embodied in Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_230.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_232.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 231</div><br></body></html>
