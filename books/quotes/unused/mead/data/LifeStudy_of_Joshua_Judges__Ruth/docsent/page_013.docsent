   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God s Need for Overcomers Who Struggle</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Pursue Christ in Order to Gain Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul was one who struggled to pursue Christ in order to gain Christ Phil 3:8, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, very few of today s Christians, including us, are like Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may be seeking Christians, but we may pursue Christ only to a certain extent, being content with a routine church life and routine work and service for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Following such a routine does not enable us to endeavor to gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because so many Christians do not pursue Christ in order to gain Him, God needs the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible shows us that, first, God tried to work with the race of Adam, but the Adamic race was a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then God had a new start with another race, with Israel, the race of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, Israel also failed God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then God went to another people the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, although God has been working with the church for nearly two thousand years, God has not yet gained what He desires.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, as early as the first century, the Lord came in to call for overcomers Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 26-28; 3:5, 12, 20-21; 21:7 , and today He is still sounding out the call for the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, even among devoted Christians it is hard to find some overcomers, some who are pursuing Christ in order to gain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the time of Joshua, there were two or three million Israelites, but there were not many Joshuas and Calebs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There were not many endeavoring ones, genuine pursuers of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without such ones both the good land and the Giver of the land would have been idle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Both the land and the Giver of the land needed certain ones to take the land, possess the land, and enjoy the land.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who possessed the land did a favor to the One who gave them the land.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We today need to take and possess the land for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to gain Christ for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do this, we will do Christ a favor.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, if we go on living a routine Christian life and church life, we will not be able to gain the land for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this, God needs some overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are millions of real Christians on earth today, but where are the overcomers?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is calling for overcomers, but who will answer His call?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Who will respond to God s call by pursuing Christ in order to gain Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope that many among us will do Christ a favor by responding to God s call for overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>CHRIST S MAKING US HIS POSSESSION</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we enjoy Christ, He makes us His possession.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is something organic.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we take Christ, possess Christ, and enjoy Christ as our all-inclusive good land, the land will become our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What the land supplies us will cause us to become organic.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Becoming Organic by Being</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Constituted with Christ as the Food</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Produced through Our Labor on the Good Land</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The main thing that the land affords us is food.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we do not have food, we cannot be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we labor on the land, the land will produce food.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we eat the food that is produced by our labor on the land, and as a result we become organic.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Anything that we take into us as food transforms us organically.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Israelites were in Egypt, they ate Egyptian food, and this food caused them to have an Egyptian constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, God brought them out of Egypt and into the wilderness, where they remained for forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every day while they were in the wilderness they ate something heavenly manna.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The manna constituted them into a heavenly people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, the manna ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Regarding this, Joshua 5:12 says, The manna ceased on that day, when they ate of the produce of the land; and there was no longer manna for the children of Israel, but they ate of the yield of the land of Canaan that year.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From that time onward, their constitution began to be different, for they began to be constituted with the produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, the children of Israel were constituted in three ways: first, in Egypt with Egyptian food; second, in the wilderness with manna; and third, in Canaan with the produce of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In each case they were constituted not by teachings or regulations but by what they ate.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As believers in Christ today, we also are constituted according to what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we want to be a heavenly people, we need to eat Christ as our heavenly manna.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we want to be overcomers, we need to labor on Christ as our good land.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To labor on Christ means to gain Christ as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>First, of course, we need to take the land.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This requires that we dispossess the Canaanites.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After possessing Christ as the land, we need to labor on the land.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Through our labor something will be produced, and that produce will become our food, our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As we eat Christ as this food and enjoy Him, we will be constituted with Him, being made the same as Christ in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is what Paul meant when he said, For to me, to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Transformed Metabolically</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>to Become God s Inheritance</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This enjoyment of Christ will transform us metabolically and cause us to become Christ s treasure, His possession.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Paul speaks of this in Ephesians 1.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In this chapter we first have God s choosing and predestinating, and then we have Christ s redeeming.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Through the redemption of Christ, we enter into Christ as a particular kind of element, and this element becomes our enjoyment that constitutes us into God s inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>First, God comes into us to be our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we enjoy Christ, He constitutes us to be God s inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On the one hand, we have Christ as our good land, as our possession.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>On the other hand, the enjoyment of this possession constitutes us with Christ, and we thereby become God s inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>An Organic Matter</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The process of being constituted with Christ to become God s inheritance is altogether organic.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This means that we need to take the all-inclusive Christ as our good land and labor on Him to gain some produce, which will be our organic, transforming food.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As we eat this food, we will grow and gradually mature in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We will be constituted with Christ organically, transformed by Christ as a new element.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then in an organic way we will become God s inheritance, His treasure and possession.</S>
