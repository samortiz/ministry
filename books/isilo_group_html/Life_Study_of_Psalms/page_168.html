The Queen Standing<br>at the King's Right Hand in the Gold of Ophir</H2><P>Verse 9b says, "The queen stands at your right hand in the gold of Ophir." The queen signifies the church, and her being covered with gold signifies the church's appearing in the divine nature. This gold that covers her is Christ. In 1 Corinthians 1:30 we are told that God has made Christ to be righteousness to us for our justification, for us to be justified by God. As our righteousness, Christ is our covering. This covering is altogether divine. Christ is pure gold, "the gold of Ophir." This is the first layer of our covering.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Daughter Hearing and Seeing<br>and Forgetting Her People<br>and Her Father's House,<br>and the King Desiring Her Beauty</H2><P>Verse 10 goes on to say, "Hear, O daughter, and see; and incline your ear;/And forget your people and your father's house." The daughter is the queen, who signifies the church, and her father's house signifies the natural relationships of the church. This word about the daughter's forgetting her people and her father's house corresponds to the Lord's word about denying the natural relationships (Matt. 10:37; Luke 14:26) and caring for the church. Throughout the centuries, many believers have been persecuted by their family.</P><P>Psalm 45:11a continues, "Thus the king will desire your beauty." The queen's beauty here signifies the virtues of Christ expressed through the church. The beauty of the church, her beauty in the presence of Christ, is Christ's virtues lived out of us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Worshipping the Lord</H2><P>"Because he is your lord,/Worship him" (v. 11b). This signifies that as the Lord of the church Christ is worthy not only of her love but also of her worship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Daughter of Tyre Coming with a Gift,<br>and the Rich among the People<br>Entreating Her Favor</H2><P>"The daughter of Tyre will come with a gift;/The rich among the people will entreat your favor" (v. 12). Tyre, a seaport, was a flourishing, commercial center known for its riches. Here the daughter of Tyre signifies the people of the flourishing world. The rich among the people signify the high class. The rich have great wealth, but they do not have what this verse calls "favor." The favor they entreat of the queen signifies the grace of God enjoyed by the church. The grace of God which we have in the church is the real favor. As indicated by this verse, the rich will come to the church to obtain the grace of God.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_167.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_169.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 168</div><br></body></html>
