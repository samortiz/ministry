   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE GOD'S INTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BUILD HIMSELF IN CHRIST INTO US Scripture Reading: 2 Sam 7:11b-14a; Isa 11:1; Eph 3:17; John 14:23; 1 Cor 3:10-12; Rev 21:2-3, 9, 12-14</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message I have the burden to speak a word concerning God's intention to build Himself in Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God desires not mainly to do things for us but to work Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>JOB'S NEED BEING GOD HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although there is no time element with God, nevertheless He has, in the course of time, gradually, bit by bit, released His revelation to man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For instance, He revealed something to Job that He had not revealed to Adam, Abel, Enosh, or Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God revealed to Job that what He wants is a man who has God, not a man of uprightness, integrity, and perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God seemed to be saying, "Job, you should forget about your integrity, your perfection, and your uprightness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You do not need these things you need Me."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God revealed to Job that his unique need was God Himself, but He did not reveal to him anything concerning building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>GOD'S PROMISE TO ABRAHAM</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>CONCERNING THE GOOD LAND AND THE SEED</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God appeared to Abraham, He promised to give him two things the good land and a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The good land and the seed both typify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that, in typology, God would give Abraham Christ as the good land and also give him Christ as the seed, the real Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1 speaks of Christ as "the son of Abraham" v. 1 . Isaac is a type of Christ as the son of Abraham, the One who inherits the promise and blessing God gave to Abraham Gen 22:17-18; Gal 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to Paul's interpretation in Galatians 3, both the good land and the seed are the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The blessing of the gospel is the promised Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>8, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The land signifies Christ, the seed signifies Christ v. 16 , and eventually Christ became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, in verse 14 Paul says, "In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The physical aspect of the blessing that God promised to Abraham was the good land Gen 12:7; 13:15; 17:8; 26:3-4 , which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since Christ is eventually realized as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17 , the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds to the blessing of the land promised to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we believe in Christ, God gives us His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The life-giving Spirit is the reality of the resurrected Christ, the very Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Spirit is the good land, and the Spirit is also the seed.</S>
