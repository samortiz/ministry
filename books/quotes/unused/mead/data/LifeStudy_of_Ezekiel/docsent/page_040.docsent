   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Wheels Being Full of Eyes</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 18b goes on to say, And their rings were full of eyes round about them four.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here we see that the high and dreadful wheels are full of eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we apply this to our spiritual experience, we will realize that it is absolutely correct to say that the wheels are full of eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a church has no move and no wheel beside it, that church is blind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you do not have any move, yet you claim that you have some move, you are surely blind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You have no eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If your church has a high and dreadful wheel, a high and dreadful move, within that move there will be many eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a result, you will have insight, foresight, and other kinds of sight.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you are a Christian who has no wheel and who only knows how to behave properly, you are blind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you mean business with the Lord for His move on earth today, you will be full of eyes, and thus you will have insight and foresight.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because Paul was a person full of eyes, he was very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was clear about the present, the future, the world situation, the Word, the church, physical things, and spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a person full of eyes, he was clear about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some Christians, on the contrary, do not have any eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Likewise, some local churches have no eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The reason these Christians and these churches are blind is that with them there is no wheel, no move of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the more we have the move of the Lord, the more we are enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more we move, the more we will be able to see.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not be like a frog in a well limited by your environment and able to see only what is directly above you in a very narrow way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You need to jump out of your well and participate in the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more you are in the Lord s move, the more eyes you will have and the more clearly you will see.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more move you have, the more you can see.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I can testify of this from my own experience in the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>During the past years I have done much traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have traveled throughout China, America, and Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The more I travel, the more eyes I receive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1958 I traveled through thirty different countries.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By that traveling I received many eyes, and I saw many things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to be impressed with the fact that the wheels are full of eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the wheel moves, it sees.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more it runs, the more it sees.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the wheel were to stop moving, it would stop seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the way the church should be today.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We see by going on.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more we go on, the more we see.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It may be that today we can see only to a certain extent, but tomorrow we will go on and see more.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we stop moving, we will stop seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We Christians should be a moving people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church must move in order to see.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A Wheel within a Wheel</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 16c says, Their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is very significant that the wheels look like a wheel within a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we speak of a wheel, we say that the circumference is the rim, that the center is the hub, and that in between are the spokes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, we have the three main parts of a wheel: the rim, the hub, and the spokes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But in Ezekiel 1 there is no hub, and there are no spokes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead, there is a wheel within a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>James 5:17 may help us to understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This verse tells us that Elijah prayed earnestly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Literally, the Greek words translated prayed earnestly mean prayed in a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This indicates that a prayer from the Lord was given to Elijah, in which he prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He did not pray in his feeling, thought, intention, or mood, or in any kind of motivation, arising from circumstances or situations, to fulfill his own purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, he prayed in the prayer given by the Lord for the accomplishing of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For Elijah to pray in a prayer means that there was a prayer within his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the wheel within a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may apply this matter of a wheel within a wheel to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the church is proper and is moving, then within the church s moving there will be the move of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This means that in our move there is the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>While we are moving, the Lord is moving in our moving.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The inner wheel is the source of power for the moving.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means that the inner wheel is the motor which causes the wheel to move.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If our move is genuine, it must be that within our move is the move of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Every wheel has a hub which turns the wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If the hub stops, the wheel stops.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may say that the hub is the little wheel within the rim of the big wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The big wheel turns because the little wheel is being turned.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the church life, the Lord Jesus is the hub the wheel within the wheel and we are the rim.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If the churches do not move with the Lord, they have no way to go on because there is no wheel within the wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But when the churches move with the Lord Jesus, He becomes the wheel within the wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Nothing can frustrate or stop this kind of move.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Recently a number of saints in the churches migrated to other cities for the spread of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When some heard about this migration, they despised it and asked whether it would accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I can testify that this migration is the Lord s move, the move of the wheel, and that within this wheel there is another wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In this migration there has been a wheel within the wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Wheel Following the Living Creatures</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Ezekiel 1:19 says, When the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This verse tells us not that the living creatures follow the wheels but that the wheels follow the living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When the creatures move, the wheels move.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When the creatures stop, the wheels stop.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When the creatures are lifted up, the wheels are lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is contrary to the concept, held by many believers, that we need to wait until the Lord moves before we can move.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I have been burdened by the Lord to tell His children that there is no need for them to wait for the Lord to move.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord has been waiting for nearly two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we go on, the Lord will follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we do not exercise to move, there will be no wheel, but if we move, the wheels will follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The move of God s work, the move of the gospel, and the move of the church all depend on our moving.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We need to have the confidence, the assurance, and the faith to go on boldly.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we move on boldly, the wheels will follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Let us act boldly and move on to take this country and to take the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Spirit Being in the Wheels</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Verse 20 continues, Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The wheels follow the creatures, and the creatures follow the Spirit, but the Spirit is in the wheels.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It is hard to tell who follows whom.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>One day when we meet the Lord we may say, Lord, we followed You, but the Lord may say, No, I followed you.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If we have the wheel with the coordination, it is difficult to determine who follows whom.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We are one with the Lord, and the Lord is one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Lord follows us, we follow the Spirit, and the Spirit is in the wheels.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is the Lord s move on earth today, and this is the Lord s recovery.</S>
