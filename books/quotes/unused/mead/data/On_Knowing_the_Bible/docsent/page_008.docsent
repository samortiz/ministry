   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BIBLE BEING THE EMBODIMENT OF GOD THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit, however, is very abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is as abstract as the radio waves in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is hard for man to touch Him or to understand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the Bible is the embodiment of this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus said in John 6:63 that the words He speaks are spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This shows us that God's word is the embodiment of God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is like a radio receiver capturing the radio waves in the air; the radio receiver becomes the embodiment of the radio waves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the radio waves are in the air, we neither hear, touch, nor understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As soon as they are captured by the receiver, the radio waves become manifested before us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What was abstract becomes real.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can feel it, hear it, and understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, we can say that the radio receiver is the embodiment of the radio waves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same principle, if there were only God the Spirit in the universe and there were no Bible, God to us would be the same as the radio waves; we would not be able to grasp Him or find Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But thank God that His word is here.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This word is the embodiment of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God the Spirit is contained in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why the Lord Jesus said that His word is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same way, we can say the word in the Bible is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To put this in a clearer way, we can say that the Bible is the embodiment of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A. The Expression of God the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, the Bible is the embodiment of God the Spirit; it is also the expression of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God the Spirit is expressed through the Bible as the embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since the day you heard the gospel until now, how many times have you been moved by the Holy Spirit apart from God's word?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Probably very little.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Almost every time we are moved by the Holy Spirit, it is through God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Never does the Holy Spirit urge us apart from the word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes, it is through a verse you have read in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes, it is through your remembrance of a verse you have read.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes, it is through some words that match the Bible in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These are all words.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although you are moved by the Holy Spirit, it is hard to separate the Holy Spirit from the word in these cases.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is hard for you to say whether you are moved by the word or by the Holy Spirit, because at such times the Holy Spirit is in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word is the embodiment and the expression of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course, we admit that many times we can have the word without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is like having a radio receiver without the radio waves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Surely, this is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We admit that many people read God's Word in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But there are also many times when we just open up the Lord's Word a little and the Holy Spirit comes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Holy Spirit is in the word, and the word is the expression of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At any rate, it is hard for us to be moved by the Holy Spirit without God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To put it in another way, seldom are we moved by the word without the moving of the Holy Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Under normal circumstances, one cannot separate God the Spirit from the Bible, since the Bible is the embodiment and the expression of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Please notice that it is the embodiment of God the Spirit, and not the embodiment of just the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that this Spirit is God, and this God is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This God who is Spirit is God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>B. The Dwelling Place of God the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible as the embodiment of God the Spirit is not only His expression, but also His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God the Spirit resides in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From our experience, we know this is true.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many times, when we read the Bible, we touch God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is because the Bible is the dwelling place of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is the place where God the Spirit resides.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>C. The Means of God the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is another point.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Bible is the means of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whatever He does to us is through the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whatever God does toward us and whatever God wants us to do are done through His word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The word is the embodiment of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, it is also the expression, the dwelling place, and the means of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Under normal circumstances, whenever we touch the word in the Bible, we should receive, touch, and feel the moving of God the Spirit and should contact God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What is the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Bible is God's word, God's revelation, God's breathing out, and the embodiment of God the Spirit.</S>
