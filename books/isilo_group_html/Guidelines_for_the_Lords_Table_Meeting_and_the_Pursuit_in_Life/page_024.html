<p>Answer: &ldquo;It is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy&rdquo; (Rom. 9:16). The eggs laid by a hen hatch and bring forth chickens because there is life in the eggs. If we have some imitation eggs that look exactly the same as real eggs, they will not hatch because they are void of life. Therefore, we can only say, &ldquo;Be merciful to me, O God! Enable me to see that Your plan is for Your Son to be revealed in me, to be formed in me, and to fill my whole being so that He may live Himself out through me.&rdquo; It is only by revelation that we can see this. We cannot see it by exercising our will, by running, by wishing, or by thinking; all of these human efforts are enemies of Christ and hindrances to Him. We must stop ourselves. Today if Christians do not have a heart for the Lord, they will have no desire to do anything for Him. However, merely having a heart for the Lord is insufficient. A brother once asked, &ldquo;Christ is rich, but why am I not rich inwardly?&rdquo; It will not work and it will be useless for him to strive every day for Christ&rsquo;s riches to come into him.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that while we should have a heart for the Lord, we should cease all of our efforts. People always like to ask, &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; Whether in the Gospels or in Acts, from the time the Lord Jesus preached the gospel of grace, these questions were frequently asked: &ldquo;What shall I do? How shall I work?&rdquo; Then in Romans 9:16 Paul said, &ldquo;It is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy.&rdquo; Romans 9 is the answer to all the questions. It is not a matter of &ldquo;doing&rdquo;; there is not such a thing as &ldquo;doing.&rdquo; &ldquo;Though the children had not yet been born nor had done anything good or bad..., it was said to her, &lsquo;The greater shall serve the less&rsquo;;...&lsquo;Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.&rsquo;...&lsquo;I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion&rsquo;&rdquo; (vv. 11-15). After hearing this kind of word, if we can peacefully leave, saying, &ldquo;Good! Let us all go home!&rdquo; this may indicate that we have not been shown mercy. However, struggles may indicate that we have been shown a little mercy. Jacob struggled because he was shown mercy. But it was only when he stopped himself that mercy was fully manifested. However, when this one, who once held his brother&rsquo;s heel as a supplanter and a deceitful man, ceased his doing, God&rsquo;s mercy was manifested in him.</p>
<p>Perhaps not many can understand these words, but we believe that as long as these words remain in the church, one day they will shine upon some among us. We cannot comprehend these words in Christ by merely listening to a few messages. Jacob was shown God&rsquo;s mercy. But this was not fully manifested until he was at Peniel. There he wrestled with God; it seemed that God could not subdue him, but in the end God caused him to be crippled. Jacob loved God, but did he calculate according to God&rsquo;s calculation in the universe? He was so skillful that no one could prevail against him. He even struggled with God, but he was crippled when God touched the socket of his hip. From that day on God&rsquo;s mercy was manifested in him (Gen. 32:22-32).</p>
<p>God wants to work Christ into man, but man must stop his doing. No one knows how long it will take for us to stop ourselves; perhaps it will not happen until we are thirty, forty, or fifty years old. However, we should never think that some people are soft toward God. The fact is that we are all very hardened toward God. It is not easy for us to stop ourselves after only half a year or even a year; we need to pass through quite a long time. This is our real situation; we need to know ourselves.</p>
<p><em>Question: Does our stopping need to pass through the experience in Romans 7:25&mdash;&ldquo;through Jesus Christ our Lord&rdquo;?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We all know that when we preach the gospel, those who believe will be saved. However, if there are one thousand people listening to the gospel, not every one of them will have faith and be saved. Some gospel friends are still waiting, even after being repeatedly urged. This shows that even man&rsquo;s believing is the work of the Holy Spirit. Although we are responsible for preaching the gospel and for speaking, the Holy Spirit can work what we have preached and spoken into people. For example, I may be preaching the gospel on the podium; some in the audience may have come for the first time and others may have come several times. I may repeatedly say, &ldquo;You must believe! You must believe!&rdquo; Some may believe immediately, and others may not believe regardless of how much I say, &ldquo;You must believe.&rdquo; Thus, whether a person believes is absolutely not dependent on our work.</p>
<p>Suppose we give a message that we must see the vision, consecrate ourselves, believe, and obey in order to let Christ live in us. After hearing this word, those who have been shown mercy will be enlightened, stop their entire being, and give themselves to Christ without reservation. This proves that the word entered into them. However, if a person has not been shown mercy, even if he can recite the points of the message about seeing a vision, consecrating himself, believing, and obeying, nothing will happen within him. Three or five years later the Holy Spirit may work in him, causing him to see the light. At that time he will clearly understand the message he heard earlier, and then he will stop himself.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s mercy creates an opportunity for us to stop ourselves in the presence of Christ, and to realize that our behavior, our actions, and our desire to live out Christ are enemies of Christ. Even our good behavior and our actions for Christ are enemies of Christ, not to mention our bad behavior. When God causes us to see this, we will stop our entire being; we will stop ourselves thoroughly. This is not the issue of man&rsquo;s exhortation. We will not know the meaning of consecrating ourselves, giving ourselves to Christ, and letting Him live in us until a time of God&rsquo;s predetermination. Then we will clearly see that the faith in which we believe in Christ is Christ Himself. &ldquo;The life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20b).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Guidelines for the Lord's Table Meeting and the Pursuit in Life &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
