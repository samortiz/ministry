<p>Genuine spiritual living is the issue or expression that is produced by our spirit touching the Spirit of God. When our spirit touches the Spirit, the issue or expression is our humility, our meekness, our prayer, our love toward the saints, and our visiting the saints. When all these human virtues are expressed in our daily living as the issue of the Spirit of God touching our spirit, they are spiritual reality and the genuine spiritual living.</p>
<p>Hence, spiritual reality is the issue that is produced from the Spirit of God touching our spirit. God as the Spirit comes to contact us, and when the Spirit enters into us to be touched and experienced by us, He becomes our spiritual life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD, CHRIST, THE HOLY SPIRIT,<br />
AND LIFE BEING INSEPARABLE</h2>
<p>John 10:10 tells us that the Lord came that we may have life. Chapter one verse 4 says that in Him was life, and Colossians 3:4 says, &ldquo;Christ our life.&rdquo; We are all familiar with these verses, and we often say that the Lord is our life and that once we touch the Lord, we touch life. However, the saints may still find this matter vague. How is it that when we touch the Lord, we touch life? How can the Lord be our life? How can we practically experience the Lord&rsquo;s life? All the saints have these questions. According to the revelation in the Scriptures, we see that God causes us to receive His life through Christ, in whom is life. One day this life flowed out from Christ. In the Old Testament a rock was smitten and cleft, and out from the rock came the living water (Exo. 17:6). The rock signifies Christ, while the living water signifies the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 10:4; cf. John 7:37-38). The rock being cleft and living water coming out signify that Christ was crucified and that the water that came out of Him was the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit comes into us, He is life, and this life is the Holy Spirit. Just as God and the Spirit are one, the Spirit and life are also one (Rom. 8:2). We must see that the Holy Spirit who comes out of the Lord is the life that enters into us. The Holy Spirit is life.</p>
<p>God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and life are not separate entities. God is Christ, Christ is the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is life. This means that God is in Christ, Christ is in the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is in life. When we touch life, we touch the Holy Spirit. When we touch the Holy Spirit, we touch Christ. When we touch Christ, we touch God. Regarding the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life that causes man to have life. Life is in the Holy Spirit, and when we touch the Holy Spirit, we touch life. Regarding life, life is God, life is Christ, and life is the Holy Spirit. Specifically, life is the Spirit, the Spirit is Christ, and Christ is God. Therefore, life is God. One thing we need to mention, however, is that it is in Christ that God becomes our life and that it is in the Holy Spirit that Christ is received by us. When we receive Christ in the Holy Spirit, we receive life, and when we touch Christ in the Holy Spirit, we touch life.</p>
<p>God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and life are not four separate entities but one. When we have one, we have the other three. God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit are experienced and received by us in life. Specifically, life is in the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit enables us to receive life, touch life, and experience life. Hence, when we touch the Holy Spirit, we experience life and touch life. Therefore, we must realize that we cannot touch the Spirit by thinking in our mind, feeling with our emotion, or deciding in our will. Only when we turn to our innermost part can we touch the Spirit. This innermost part is deeper than our mind, emotion, and will. This innermost part is our spirit. Only when we are in the spirit can we touch the Spirit of God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Spiritual Reality &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
