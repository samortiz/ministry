   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>XIII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ITS STREET</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 21 says, And the street of the city was pure gold as transparent glass.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The gates are for entering into the city, whereas the street is for the daily walk, the daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The entering into the city is through Christ s death and resurrection, whereas the daily walk, the daily living in the city, is according to the divine nature, signified by the street being pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Following the entrance of regeneration, the daily life and walk of the saints must be in the way of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The divine nature is their way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible is different from the natural human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the human concept, we firstly walk on the street and then enter the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But in the Bible we firstly enter the gate and then walk on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Catholicism people are told that they must first work and then receive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This thought is devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In God s economy we receive salvation first, and then we work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Firstly, we enter into grace; then we walk in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Never think that by walking or working you will eventually be qualified to receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No, grace is free.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After you have entered in through the gates by grace, you will begin to walk, and you will need to walk a long way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is a very long way from the gates to the top of the golden mountain where the throne of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Recall that the New Jerusalem, a golden mountain, is twelve thousand stadia high more than thirteen hundred and sixty miles .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, the golden street is a spiral, and this makes the way a great deal longer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, we have no choice except to walk on this street.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have been walking on this street for more than fifty-one years, and I am still on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although I may desire to walk faster, sometimes the brothers drag me back, and I am forced to wait for them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A. Uniquely One</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The street in New Jerusalem is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no maze, no leading astray, and no getting lost.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This street is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No matter through which gate you enter into the city, you will find yourself on the same street.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the New Jerusalem there is no such thing as a Baptist street, a Presbyterian street, a Methodist street, or a Lutheran street.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Neither is the street in New Jerusalem related to any ism.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The street is God s divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this divine nature we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>B. Being Pure Gold</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 21 says that the street of the city is pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have seen that gold signifies the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After we are saved and enter into New Jerusalem, we must walk on the divine nature as our way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The divine nature is our way and our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suppose a sister says to me, Brother Lee, I love the Lord and I want to live in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Can you tell me the style of clothing I should wear and how I should fashion my hair?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I would tell this sister that she should choose her clothes and fashion her hair according to the divine nature within her.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The style, color, material, and design of her clothing should be according to the divine gold within.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The divine nature is our street, our way, and we all must walk according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today, our way is not that of regulations; it is the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do you not have the gold nature within you?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then walk according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since you have the divine life with the divine nature, why do you not walk upon it?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Is your speaking according to the divine nature or according to your muddy human nature?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May we all see that today the nature of God is our street.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We in the Lord s recovery are walking in the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As many of the leading brothers can testify, I do not tell others what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, I encourage them to walk according to the divine nature within them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because the divine nature is our golden street, in the church life we have no need for regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The street itself is our regulation, for nothing regulates people more than a street.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every driver of an automobile is spontaneously regulated by the street on which he drives.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the New Jerusalem everyone is regulated by the unique street, by the golden nature of God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>C. As Transparent Glass</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The pure gold, which symbolizes both the street and the city proper of New Jerusalem, is as transparent glass v. 18 , signifying that the whole city is transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The golden street is crystal clear, without any opaqueness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although the pearls may be opaque, every one of them is a great open gate, which will not be shut by day or by night.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>D. A Spiral, Coming Down</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>from the Throne of God</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The street of New Jerusalem is a spiral, coming down from the throne of God to reach all God s chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, this street reaches every gate.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It also leads us from the gates to God s throne.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>E. One Street Serving Twelve Gates</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>in Four Directions</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The one street serves all twelve gates in four directions.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On this street all God s redeemed walk in absolute oneness as they are led by the street to the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hence, in New Jerusalem there is one street leading to one goal.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>F. With the Life Supply</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Revelation 22:1 says, And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This verse reveals that the river of water of life is flowing in the middle of the street.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, in this street is the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Furthermore, as 22:2 says, And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Here we see that the tree of life, which is in the river, grows on the two sides of the river along the street.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thus, all the life supply is related to the street.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The more we walk, act, and have our being according to the divine nature, the more of the life supply we shall receive.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, if you do not care for the divine nature within you, but do things according to your taste, you will immediately lose the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But if you take care of the divine nature within you in a practical way in your daily life, you will enjoy the rich life supply found along the golden street.</S>
