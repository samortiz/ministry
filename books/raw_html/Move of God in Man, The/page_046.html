<P>John 20 tells us that He appeared to Mary early in the morning and then in the evening He appeared to the disciples and breathed Himself into them as the life-giving Spirit (v. 22). He was away from the disciples a short time so that He could pass through death to usher Himself into resurrection. Therefore, when He breathed Himself into the disciples as the life-giving Spirit, that was to bring all the disciples out of death into His resurrection. After the breathing of the Spirit into them, they had the processed and consummated Triune God indwelling them as the all-inclusive, life-giving, and indwelling Spirit, who is the pneumatic Christ. Such a One is the resurrection.</P><P>Peter, John, and all the disciples had received something they did not know how to designate. What they received was the resurrection, and resurrection is the processed and consummated Triune God, the pneumatic Christ. Before His death and resurrection, Christ had already declared, "I am the resurrection" (John 11:25a). Now, because the disciples were not accustomed to His indwelling, invisible presence, He stayed with them for forty days to train them to live by His invisible presence in resurrection.</P><P>Before the Lord's death, Peter had boasted that he would never deny the Lord (Matt. 26:33-35), but later he took the lead to deny Him (John 18:27). However, in John 20 when the Lord breathed Himself as the reality of resurrection into the disciples, Peter was transformed from the oldness of death to the newness of resurrection. But even by the last chapter of the Gospel of John, Peter was not yet fully in resurrection. In John 21 the Lord was training Peter to live according to the new part of his being, the part of resurrection.</P><P>Right after John 21 there is Acts 1. In Acts 1 Peter was altogether in resurrection with the one hundred twenty, which included the sisters and the Lord's flesh brothers. They all had entered into resurrection. They could stay together and be blended together for ten days to pray in one accord (vv. 14-15). They were living, acting, staying, and praying together in resurrection. Then Peter stood up among them and began to expound the Bible (vv. 15-22). That was also something of transformation in resurrection. Of course, Peter was not absolutely transformed because transformation is not something once for all. In chapter one of Acts Peter was very good, but in Galatians 2 Paul spoke of Peter's hypocrisy by shrinking back from eating with the Gentile believers out of fear of those of the circumcision (vv. 11-14). This is an illustration of our need to live and remain in resurrection.</P><P>To stay in the full-time training you must be those who stay in resurrection. If you are out of resurrection, you are wasting your time. The purpose of the full-time training is to bring you into resurrection. Even when you take your meals in the dining area, you should be in resurrection. You should have a set time to partake of your meals together. You should be on time, sit down together, and offer a proper prayer to the Lord. Then all of you should eat at your designated tables to fellowship together. If you eat in this way in the training, your eating together is in resurrection.</P>
