<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The People Having Become Fallen, but Christ and His Throne Remaining the Same in His Glory</H2><P>The people had become fallen, but Christ and His throne remained the same in His glory (v. 1a). On this earth, everything changes and fluctuates, but Christ remains the same today and forever (Heb. 13:8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Train of Christ's Robe<br>Still Filling the Temple</H2><P>The train of Christ's robe still filled the temple (Isa. 6:1b). Christ's long robe signifies Christ's splendor in His virtues. Whereas glory refers mainly to God, splendor refers mainly to man. The splendor of Christ in His virtues is expressed mainly in and through His humanity.</P><P>We may desire to go to heaven to see Christ's glory in His divinity, but in Isaiah's vision this Christ in glory is full of splendor in His human virtues. When we see Christ in His glory, we will see Him mainly in His humanity, which is full of virtues. All Christ's virtues are bright and shining, and this shining is His splendor. Christ's glory is in His divinity, and His splendor is in His humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Seraphim Calling One to the Other,<br>Praising Christ in His Holiness</H2><P>Seraphim were calling one to the other, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts" (vv. 2-3a). This was a praise rendered to Christ in His holiness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Whole Earth Being Filled with Christ's Glory</H2><P>Whereas Isaiah saw the long robe signifying Christ's splendor in His virtues, the seraphim were declaring that the whole earth is filled with Christ's glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Foundations of the Threshold Shaking,<br>and the House Being Filled with Smoke</H2><P>In verse 4 we see that the foundations of the threshold shook at the voice of him who called. This shaking signifies solemnity. In this verse we also see that the house was filled with smoke. This signifies glory burning in awe.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. John's Word concerning Isaiah's Vision</H2><P>John, in his account of Christ's living and working on earth, referred to Isaiah's vision here, saying that Isaiah saw Christ's glory (John 12:41).</P>
