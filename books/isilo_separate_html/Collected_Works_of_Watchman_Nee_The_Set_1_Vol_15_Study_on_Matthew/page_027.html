Verses 18-27 are a record showing the effect of the Lord's presence. The winds and the sea were rebuked. This means that they must have had some consciousness. However, the winds and the sea by themselves have no consciousness; the Lord was rebuking the demons behind the winds and the sea. The winds and the sea always come before a spiritual battle begins.</P><P>Verse 28: This verse is a fulfillment of what the Lord said in verse 18 concerning departing to the other side. This portion mentions that there were two possessed by demons, but Luke's record mentions only one. All of Luke's records are more detailed than Matthew's, especially concerning the sick ones, because Luke himself was a medical doctor. For example, Matthew 8:2 mentions "a leper," but Luke, in 5:12, says "a man full of leprosy." Concerning this particular case of being possessed by demons, Luke's record says that a certain man was possessed by a legion of demons (Luke 8:30). Because Luke was a medical doctor, he had his own observation concerning the sick ones.</P><P>Luke recorded only one possessed by demons for the following reasons: (1) Since the two were the same, it was enough to record only one. (2) Luke did not directly follow the Lord. What he wrote was based on what he had investigated. Therefore, he recorded only the events he had examined. (3) Matthew portrayed the Lord as King. Therefore, he often recorded two, that is, in plurality. On the other hand, Luke showed the Lord as man. For a man, it is sufficient to give the account of one. (4) The Gospel of Matthew is written to the Jews. According to the Jewish regulations, for a testimony there must be two people. On the other hand, the Gospel of Luke is written to the Gentiles. Since there is no such regulation among the Gentiles, there is no need to record two. (5) The emphasis of Matthew is on doctrine. Therefore, he did not record the rest of the things related to the person himself. On the other hand, the emphasis of Luke is on morality. Hence, he gave a detailed account of the person himself. "Coming out of the tombs." Those who are demon possessed are neighbors to the dead ones.</P><P>Verse 29: "They cried out, saying, What do we have to do with You, Son of God? Have you come here before the time to torment us?" Although the demons are wicked, they still confess that the Lord is the Son of God. Therefore, in this respect they are better than some human beings. "Before the time." In the original text the definite article "the" indicates a specific time. The demons know the time of their torment. This gives us a hint that God has appointed a time for the demons to be tormented.</P><P>Verse 30: "Now there was, a good way off from them, a herd of many hogs feeding." The Lord did not respond to the demons. The less we speak to the demons the better.</P><P>Verse 32: "And He said to them, Go! And they came out and went into the hogs. And behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and they died in the waters." The Lord spoke only one word, "Go!" The hogs rushed into the sea on their own because they would not tolerate being possessed by the demons. In this respect, they are better than human beings.</P><P>Verse 33: "And those who were feeding them fled and went away into the city and reported everything, including what had happened to those possessed by demons." Spurgeon said that when false believers die, the pastor would flee into the city to report to people the terrifying news.</P><P>Verse 34: "The whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they entreated Him to depart from their borders." The people entreated the Lord to depart from their borders. This is the same as the request of the demons. The Lord never forces people, so He departed from them.</P><P>Chapters eight through twelve, constituting the third major section, describe how the King manifested Himself and how He was rejected by men. In 8:2-17 we see the Lord as the Son in four different ways. In 8:18-9:8, which is the second minor section, the Lord's authority is manifested in four aspects: the aspect of nature, the aspect of demons, the aspect of men, and the aspect of the believers. These four things reveal man's heart to man. These four sections reveal mainly two things: (1) the Lord's power and (2) the intent of man's heart. Verses 35-38 of chapter nine should be placed at the beginning of chapter ten. Matthew 9:9-34, the third minor section, speaks of how Christ shows mercy to man. The second minor section shows us the authority of Christ.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
