   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How to Handle Finances</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How should we handle the church finances?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the money that the brothers and sisters designate for a local church should be placed in the church offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is designated for the poor brothers should be marked clearly as such.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is designated for individuals or for the work in another region should likewise be clearly marked.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You can separate the offerings for local use and for the work by using two offering boxes, or the two can go into the same offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church has full liberty to distribute these offerings in whatever way it chooses, and individuals have full liberty to give according to their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE MEANING AND THE SPHERE OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Witness Lee asked: What is the meaning and the sphere of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Two Aspects of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Nee answered: There are two meanings to the word "church."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first is the universal church, and the second is the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The universal church is the general church, which includes the church of yesterday, today, here, and elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It even includes the church in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The local church is the church that appears in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Two Aspects of the Universal Church</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As to the universal church, there are also two aspects to it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One aspect refers to the church that includes all God's children both yesterday and today, both here and everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, we have to realize that today we are neither in yesterday, nor in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's children are living on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When all these children of God are added together, we also have the general church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What was there yesterday was past, and what will be there in the future is not here yet.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Between the past and the future, there are all the children of God on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's children must not only practice the oneness in the locality, but they must learn to be one with all God's children on the whole earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Maintaining the Local Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>and God's Testimony on Earth As Well</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If Nanking develops a problem with Shanghai, that is, if the church in Nanking is at odds with the church in Shanghai, you can only say that they are maintaining a local testimony; they have not maintained God's testimony on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today, we must not only maintain a local testimony; we must also maintain God's testimony on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot isolate Shanghai and try to keep it out of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Shanghai belongs to the general church on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Body mentioned in 1 Corinthians is different from the Body mentioned in Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Body in Ephesians 4 includes all the believers past and present, here and everywhere, but the Body in 1 Corinthians only refers to all the believers on earth at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Learning to Be One</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church is local, whereas the work is regional.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A local church cannot encompass the work of a region, because a region involves more than one local church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, all the local churches plus all the regional works equal the general church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order for us to practice the oneness of the church, we must practice the oneness of the general church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This requires that we learn to follow others and learn to be one.</S>
