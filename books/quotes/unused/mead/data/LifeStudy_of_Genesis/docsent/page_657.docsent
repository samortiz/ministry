   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>JOSEPH NOT HASTY TO SHOW</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>HIS GLORY TO HIS BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Joseph saw his brothers bowing down to him, he was not hasty to reveal his glory to them cf.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>45:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not until his brothers' third trip did he reveal himself to them and expose his glory to them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Concealing our glory is even more difficult than holding back our excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You may be successful in restraining your excitement, but it is virtually impossible for anyone not to expose his glory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Joseph, however, was successful in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He did not reveal his glory to his brothers immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is another reason Joseph represents the reigning aspect of the mature life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He certainly had the qualifications of a ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not until our self and our natural man have been thoroughly dealt with can we keep from revealing our glory to others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Joseph was a man who had been thoroughly dealt with and who was living under the rulership of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, he was qualified to be the reigning aspect of the mature life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My burden in these messages is not merely to pass on teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is to help you see the life in the book of Genesis and to know the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The life manifested in the story of Joseph is not the human life, much less the fallen life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, it is not even the good natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, it is the resurrection life, the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although Joseph was in an exciting situation, he did not display any looseness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With Joseph we see not only life, but also the way of life, which is to keep ourselves under control.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Never think that Joseph was not human.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was full of human feelings and sentiments, but he kept himself with all his feelings under the rulership of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, in Joseph we see not only the mature life, but a reigning life and the way of this reigning life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all, especially the young people, need such a life and such a way that is the reigning aspect of a mature person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This life is not easily excited, and it does not reveal its glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, in the midst of excitement it remains calm, controls itself, and conceals its glory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>JOSEPH BEING WISE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>IN DEALING WITH HIS BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Joseph was very wise in dealing with his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was not at all loose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If I had been Joseph, I would have said to them, "Hallelujah, let us dance and have a feast!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let us be happy together."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But Joseph did nothing like this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the contrary, he was calm, sober, and wise.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Joseph did not say, "Reuben and Judah, you did what was right.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But you, Simeon, were wrong, because you took the lead to put me into the pit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You need to be punished for this."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of saying such things, Joseph was wise in at least three ways.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A. Causing Them to Realize Their Guilt</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>in Hating and Selling Him</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Joseph put all his brothers into prison for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He did this for the purpose of causing them to realize their guilt in hating him and in selling him 42:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If I had been Joseph, I would have put them into prison for three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I would have been too excited to keep them there any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I would not have been able to wait until I could feast with my brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even if my brothers could have been patient, I would not have had the patience to wait three days.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Three hours, however, would not have been adequate for Joseph's brothers to realize their guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They needed to be in prison for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>During those days, they must have talked a great deal about what they had done to Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thinking that Joseph was not able to understand them, they even spoke in Joseph's presence about what they had done to him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But Joseph knew what they were talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How Joseph's brothers regretted what they had done to him!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But Joseph seemed to say to himself, "Talk is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I should put them into prison so that they can become sober.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Let them fellowship with one another in prison for three days and three nights."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This was Joseph's way to cause his brothers to have a thorough realization of their guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we are in a pleasant situation, it is difficult to realize our guilt and to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But if we are cast into prison, it is easy for us to repent and to condemn ourselves.</S>
