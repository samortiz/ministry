   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH BEING GOD S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We may apply the same principle to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the universe there is just one church, and in any locality there should also be one church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The one church is God s ordination and allotment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is His portion to us, and this is His will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whether we like the church or not does not mean anything, because the church is God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps at first you were very happy with the church, and you enjoyed a church life honeymoon.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But later you came to dislike the church and desired a separation from it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many Christians today have divorced themselves from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if we do this, we neglect Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we can divorce the church, there will be no building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through the centuries, many Christians have been like a woman who has had several husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After staying with a certain man for a period of time, she divorces him in order to be with another man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the actual situation among today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to recognize that the one church is God s will and ordination and that we have no choice about it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, eventually the church becomes the cross that we must bear.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The question is whether we shall bear it like a criminal being executed or bear it willingly and happily.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should be like Christ who made the cross His choice, His first preference.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although being in the church may cause us difficulties, there is nothing we can do about it, for the church is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, we all need to pray, Lord, grant me the sufficient grace to make me a willing cross-bearer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you pray like this, you will become a happy bearer of the cross, not a criminal.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, you will have the genuine building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nearly all Christians today choose a church according to their taste, like people who choose restaurants according to their taste.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some may not like a certain church because the members shout and call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Others prefer a church where they can speak in tongues or hear musical performances by soloists, quartets, and choirs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are like this, then there is no bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Firstly, we must find out what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once we find out, there must be no further preference, no further choice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether we like the church or not, we must recognize the church is not according to our taste, but according to God s will and ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We simply need to claim the sufficient grace that we may become a happy bearer of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to say, Lord, make me a willing cross-bearer like You were.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You learned what God s will was in Matthew 26, and then You were willing to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You were glad to take up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You could have summoned twelve legions of angels to rescue You, but You did not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You were willing to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thank You, Lord, that through Your willingness to bear the cross we are here today as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now, Lord, we want to partake of Your willingness to take up the cross that Your life may be released.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS BEING GOD S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only is the church God s will, but every brother and sister in the church is also His will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the Bible, we have no way to divide ourselves from the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we prefer certain brothers and sisters above others, we are a Bar-jona, a son of flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the church every brother and sister is God s will, and we have no choice regarding them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Father has begotten them all, and we need to accept them all as His will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no room for our likes or dislikes, both of which are natural.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the church there are no special friendships and no preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, eventually every brother and sister becomes a cross to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, if we receive mercy and grace from the Lord, we shall become a happy bearer of the cross, not a criminal condemned to execution.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If I say that I do not like a certain brother and will no longer spend any time with him, I spontaneously stop bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As soon as I forsake the cross, the building ceases.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church has not been built over the past nineteen centuries because not many have been willing to take up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Are you willing to bear the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The whole church, with every brother and sister in it, is a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have no choice, no preference.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must bear the church and we must bear all of the saints, whether we like them or not.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we have our preference, we are not bearing the cross, and there can be no building.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Wherever I am, I have no choice, for there is just one church.</S>
