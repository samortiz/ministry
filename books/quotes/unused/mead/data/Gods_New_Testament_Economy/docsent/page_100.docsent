   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF ITS STRUCTURE 3 Scripture Reading: John 1:13; 1 John 3:9; 1:2-3; 4:8, 16; 1:5-7; 2 Pet 1:3a, 4-7</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all need to remember that the New Jerusalem has a base and this base is pure gold, which in typology refers to God s divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We believers have all been made partakers of this divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is a very hard task to define the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Simply speaking, the divine nature is what God is, just as the nature of anything is what that thing is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have seen that the Bible tells us that God is Spirit John 4:24 , that God is love 1 John 4:8, 16 , and that God is light 1 John 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then in a total way the Bible tells us that God is life John 1:4; 5:26; 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These four items of what God is are very basic.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Spirit, love, and light are the very constituents of God s being and life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God Himself, God s being, is our life and He is constituted with Spirit, love, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Spirit is the nature of God s Person, love is the nature of God s essence, and light is the nature of God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is Spirit in person, God is love in essence, God is light in expression, and God is life in love as its essence and in light as its expression.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we touch God, we touch Him as Spirit in His Person, as love in His essence, and as light in His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After touching God, we walk, we live, we have our being, in His Spirit as our person, in His love as our essence, and in His light as our expression.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE PARTAKING AND ENJOYING</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>OF THE DIVINE NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since we have defined the divine nature we need to see how to partake of it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Second Peter 1:4 is the only verse in the Bible which tells us directly that we are partakers of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not merely partake of the divine nature, but need to be the partakers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not merely eat, but we are the eaters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Christian life is a life of enjoying the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may have had some experiences of enjoying the divine nature without realizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Two hundred years ago people enjoyed vitamins without having any knowledge concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today, however, even many little children know what vitamins are.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My hope is that one day even our children would know what the divine nature is and that this would be common knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why we are burdened to see the basic element of gold in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The New Jerusalem is God s building and gold, which is the very symbol of His divine nature, is the base of His building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In fact, the divine nature is the base of all God s building through all the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can see the partaking and enjoying of the divine nature in John s line and in Peter s line.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These are the two lines of writings concerning the enjoyment of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Paul s fourteen Epistles there are some implications concerning the enjoyment of the divine nature, but there is no clear word because Paul s ministry is not centered on the enjoyment of the divine nature but is altogether concentrated on the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The divine nature, which mainly refers to the constitution of the divine life, the constitution of God, is constituted with Spirit, love, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul s burden, however, is to show us the working principle of the divine life which is the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The law of a certain life is deeper than the element of that life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John and Peter deal with the nature, but Paul deals with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Romans 8:2 he tells us that the law of the Spirit of life sets us free from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This law is the natural principle of the divine working.</S>
