   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>By the leading of the Lord, we decided to have the crystallization-study of the Epistle of James.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This Epistle has been a topic of debate throughout the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Martin Luther called James a book of straw.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This word is too extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is some straw in James, but not all the points of this book are straw.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To decide what is straw and what is not straw needs a top discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to point out that under God's sovereignty, there are the Old Testament and the New Testament with the old dispensation and the new dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has two peoples: the old people, Israel, and the new people, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Also, there are the old man and the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we speak concerning the Epistle of James, we must realize these four pairs of items: the Old Testament and the New Testament, the old dispensation and the new dispensation, God's old people and God's new people, and the old man and the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I consider the apostle James as the top mixer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He mixed the New Testament with the Old Testament, the new dispensation with the old, the new people of God with the old, and the new man with the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The debate on the book of James cannot be resolved unless one sees these factors.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>James is on Christian perfection, but is this perfection by the old man or by the new man, by the natural man or by the regenerated man?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the book of James there is a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many points in James indicate that he does not refer to the regenerated man but to the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are other points in James, however, that point to the new man, not the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The New Testament tells us we have to put off the old man and put on the new man Eph 4:22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It also tells us that we have to deny the self, which is the corrupted soul, the old man Matt 16:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we need God's strengthening to strengthen our entire being into the inner man, which is the new man Eph 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hebrews 4:12 tells us that the sharp word of God operates to divide our soul from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a base for our study on James in this first message.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The stress of the Epistle of James is Christian perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to history and according to James's writing, there are different perfections on different levels in different ages.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Job 1:1 says that Job was a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The problem in the book of Job is how to discern Job's perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Philippians 3:6 Paul said that as to the righteousness of the law he had become blameless, perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was before Paul was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While he was Saul of Tarsus, he was a blameless person; he was perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Job's perfection was before the law, and Saul's perfection was under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we have James's perfection, but in what age?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His perfection is not only in the age of the law but also in the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>James is a person with one foot in the age of law and the other in the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, he is one person standing in two ages.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the perfection of James, but this is not the genuine Christian perfection revealed in the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Job's perfection is before the law, without law; Saul's perfection is under the law; and James's perfection is under both the law and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The genuine Christian perfection is purely under the absolute grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to remember these four kinds of perfections according to history and the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Christian perfection stressed by James was under both the law and grace, by both the old, natural man and the new, regenerated man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now we want to see the virtues of the perfection stressed by James.</S>
