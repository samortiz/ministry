   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE RELATIONSHIP OF A SERVING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH HUMAN COMMUNITIES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will consider the relationship that a serving one should have with his community.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God did not make man to exist alone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even a billionaire who lives by himself in a mansion will feel that life is meaningless without a community.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who have a heart to serve the Lord full time should know that humans are gregarious.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is impossible for us to live apart from a community.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The propagation and multiplication of mankind depend on communities.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no possibility for the human race to multiply, propagate, and develop without communities.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everything in human life, even the bad things, is developed in communities.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since humans cannot live apart from communities, sociologists study how to utilize the strong points and avoid the shortcomings of communities in order to develop a proper social arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just as humans cannot live apart from a community, so Christians also cannot live apart from a community, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word church is a translation of the Greek word ekklesia, which implies an assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to God s ordination, we cannot live apart from a community as humans, and we cannot stay away from the church as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once we are in a community, relationships are developed spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In human society in general, such contact produces more evil things than good things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A believer, however, has a relationship with another community, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These two kinds of relationships require two different kinds of contact.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A person who serves the Lord must have a proper relationship and proper contact with those both in society and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every person is born into a community.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He has parents, who are above him, and siblings and cousins, who are on the same level with him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he begins school, he will have teachers, who are above him, and classmates, who are at his level and above or below him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When he begins to work, he will have relationships with his boss and colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later, when he gets married and has children, he will have many relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a description of relationships in human communities.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I once told a married brother that he should not be unhappy with his in-laws.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is good enough for him to be satisfied with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If he considers the situation of his in-laws, he is only looking for trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All young females desire to marry a husband who is not influenced by his parents and has a good education and a good job with a good income so that their life will not be entangled with problems from their in-laws.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is often only wishful thinking, because it is difficult for a person to limit the extent of his human relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since God created us and saved us, we should learn to have a proper relationship and proper contact with others in society and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>PAYING ATTENTION TO THE BOUNDARY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first relationship in a community is the relationship between males and females.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This relationship exceeds that of a parent and child.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God did not first create a parent and then a child.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He first created a male and then a female and only through them were descendants brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The relationships within a community began with the descendants of Adam and Eve, but the first relationship was that of a male and a female.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is also a very personal relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A parent-child relationship is not a matter of our own choice, but the male-female relationship involves a choice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must be clear concerning this and keep a dividing line between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not think that we cannot be influenced to make a wrong choice because we have a regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our body is fallen and is still the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Romans 7 says that nothing good dwells in our flesh and that sin dwells in our flesh vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>John 1:14 says that the Lord Jesus as the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The flesh belongs to sin, yet the Son of God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The proper answer is in Romans 8:3, which says, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This verse says that although the Lord Jesus became flesh, He was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin and did not have the sin of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This was typified by the bronze serpent lifted up by Moses for the sinful Israelites Num 21:9; John 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The bronze serpent was in the form, the likeness, of a serpent, but it did not have the poison of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This bronze serpent bore God s judgment for the poisoned Israelites and dealt with the serpents that poisoned them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although Christ did not have the flesh of sin, He was crucified in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, through His death on the cross God condemned sin, which was brought by Satan into man s flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only the Lord Jesus was without the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Bible does not say that man is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It says that man has a spirit Job 32:8 and that man is flesh Gen 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since man is flesh, it is necessary to keep the differences between males and females.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should never abolish such differences.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Colossians 3:11 says, Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we read these two verses carefully, we will discover that they do not mention males or females.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, Galatians 3:28 says, There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the one hand, in Christ there are no differences between males and females.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On the other hand, although we are the new man, in the church life the differences between males and females are still present.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have a spirit, but we also have the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hence, we must keep the dividing line between males and females in our community and also in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>SHAMEFASTNESS BEING GREATER PROTECTION</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we share and testify in the meetings, the sisters should always remember that they are females and that whatever they do should be done with modesty, that is, shamefastness.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Modesty, or shamefastness, is a female virtue 1 Tim 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Bible says that if a woman prays or prophesies with her head uncovered, she disgraces her head 1 Cor 11:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This does not mean that the brothers can act immodestly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Both males and females should have a proper shamefastness.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The more modest we are, the higher the standard of morality we will have and the greater will be our protection.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A proper person should be very modest and be limited in the places he goes, the people he knows, and the things that he says.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The basic principle of the Christian life is to walk according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we walk according to the Spirit, we will have no need for anyone to teach us, but His anointing will teach us concerning all things 1 John 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The saints who have a heart to serve full time should learn the lesson of not being careless when contacting people and being careful concerning the setting in which they contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In particular, the sisters should not forget that they are females when they contact people; they are not free to speak carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Otherwise, their contacting people will bring them many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Not only will they suffer loss but they will also cause the Lord s name to suffer shame.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In human communities as well as in the church, we must remember that there is a difference between males and females.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is wrong to speak with a person of the opposite sex when we are alone in a room.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must have a third person present there.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is not only a virtue but also a great protection.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>AVOIDING TEMPTATIONS RELATED TO MONEY</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>AND TO RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>MALES AND FEMALES IN OUR SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The two greatest temptations in human life are related to money and to relationships between males and females.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We should never think that since we have the Spirit of the Lord and we walk according to the Spirit, we will not encounter temptations related to these two dangers.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>These two dangers always exist and will follow us until we are taken by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Throughout the centuries countless servants of the Lord have been destroyed by these two things, even after serving faithfully for ten, twenty, or even forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Therefore, while you are still young, you must learn to regard these two things as poisonous snakes and wild beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We should never think that we could never be overcome by these temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Few people, if any, can overcome the temptation of money.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When money is not in our hand, we do not know how great a temptation it is.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Only when money comes into our possession do we realize its tempting power.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The Bible calls money unrighteous mammon Luke 16:9, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This shows that money is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>It is impossible for a person living in this world to not have contact with society.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It is also impossible for a Christian living in the church life to not have contact with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Sins come from contact; fewer contacts result in fewer sins.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>According to the teaching in the Bible, we must always remember our position when we contact others.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Those who serve the Lord contact people all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Hence, we must maintain a proper relationship with those whom we contact.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In this way we will have longevity of life in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is the most basic lesson that a full-time serving one must learn.</S>
