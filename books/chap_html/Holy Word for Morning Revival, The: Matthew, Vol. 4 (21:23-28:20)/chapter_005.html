<p class="bold">WEEK 20 — DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 27:1-5, 15, 24, 26</h2><p class="bold">1 &nbsp;Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.</p> <p class="bold">2 &nbsp;And having bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to <sup>1</sup>Pilate the governor.</p> <p class="bold">3 &nbsp;Then Judas, who betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, regretted and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</p> <p class="bold">4 &nbsp;Saying, I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? You see to that yourself!</p><p>5 &nbsp;And he threw the pieces of silver into the temple and departed, and he went away and hanged himself.</p><p>15 &nbsp;Now at the feasts the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wanted.</p><p>24 &nbsp;And Pilate…took water and <sup>1</sup>washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of this <sup>2</sup>man’s blood.…</p><p>26 &nbsp;Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he <sup>1</sup>scourged and delivered up to be <sup>2</sup>crucified.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The spiritual significance of chapter twenty-seven is that it is related to righteousness. In 27:19 Pilate’s wife referred to the Lord Jesus as a righteous man, and in verse 24 Pilate himself called Him a righteous man.</p><p>It is very meaningful that Matthew inserted the record of the destiny of Judas into his account of Pilate’s judgment of Christ. The record of Judas testifies of righteousness. Even the betrayer of the Lord Jesus eventually realized that He was a righteous man and that what had been done to Him was altogether unrighteous. In an attempt to be righteous, he threw away the thirty pieces of silver, for his conscience did not allow him to keep them. This is righteousness. When Judas returned the money, the religious leaders seemed to say, “We cannot keep this money, the price of blood, for the service of God. It is better that we use it to buy a parcel of land for burying strangers [vv. 6-7].” This shows that even the religious leaders had a formal righteousness.</p><p>The concept here in chapter twenty-seven is rather deep. In chapter twenty-six we saw a contrast between the life that can make it to be for the kingdom and the life that cannot make it. Now in chapter twenty-seven we have a contrast between righteousness and unrighteousness.…This contrast implies that the kingdom of the world cannot stand. The reason it cannot stand is that it is not built upon righteousness.…Because of the unrighteousness of the government of the kingdom of this world, Christ was wrongly condemned to die. Nevertheless, actually He was rightly sentenced to death by the righteousness of God.

Not long after he unjustly delivered up the Lord Jesus to be crucified, his rule ended abruptly. He was banished and committed suicide.</p><p>In the evil conspiracy the Jewish religionists convinced the heathen politician to collaborate with them to kill the Lord Jesus.</p><p>24<sup>1</sup> This was to appease his conscience.</p><p>24<sup>2</sup> Some MSS add, righteous.</p><p>26<sup>1</sup> This utterly exposed the darkness and injustice of politics! This injustice fulfilled Isa. 53:5, 8.</p><p>26<sup>2</sup> The Jewish death penalty was carried out by stoning (Lev. 20:2, 27; 24:14; Deut. 13:10; 17:5). Crucifixion was a heathen practice (Ezra 6:11) adopted by the Romans for the execution of slaves and heinous criminals only. The Lord Jesus’ being crucified was a fulfillment not only of the Old Testament prophecies (Deut. 21:23; Gal. 3:13; Num. 21:8-9) but also of the Lord’s word concerning how He would die (John 3:14; 8:28; 12:32). These could not have been fulfilled by stoning.
