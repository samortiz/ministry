   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE SPIRIT OF LIFE SUPPLYING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO THE THREE PARTS OF THE BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: Rom 8:6, 10-11 THE SPIRIT AND LIFE IN ROMANS 8</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 8 is a rich, mysterious, and abstract word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first eighteen verses are especially abstract and mysterious because the main components of these verses are the Spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may know that this chapter covers the two spirits the Spirit of God and the spirit of the believers but these two spirits are mysterious and abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit, who indwells us as the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the resurrecting One, is altogether mysterious and abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, our spirit is the most abstract and mysterious part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Peter 3:4 says that our spirit is the hidden man of the heart; therefore, it is something within our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our heart is quite mysterious and abstract, but within our heart is our spirit, which is more abstract and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Life also is abstract and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even our physical life is difficult to comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Scientists and medical doctors cannot adequately define the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans 8 speaks of the divine life, the uncreated life of God, that was given to us at the time we believed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such a life is much more mysterious than the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first half of Romans 8 concerns mainly the Spirit and life, which are critical, central, and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, most Christians rarely consider the Spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even when we are revived and stirred up to love the Lord, we usually do not consider the Spirit or life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead, we spontaneously consider our behavior, deeds, and conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we are cold toward the Lord, we do not care much about our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, when we have a heart for the Lord and begin to care for the spiritual things, we immediately begin to consider our behavior, conduct, and deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We often make up our mind and pray for the Lord s grace and mercy to help us behave better and improve our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps we make up our mind to be kind, respectful, and loving toward our family members.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To consider behavior and conduct rather than the Spirit and life shows that we are superficial and childish in the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s way is the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Life is not conveyed to us by teaching or doctrine but is imparted to us through, by, and with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Romans 8:2 uses a unique title for the Spirit the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The threefold Spirit mentioned in verses 9 and 11 the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the resurrecting One is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In a phrase such as the Spirit of life, according to Greek grammar, the nouns are in apposition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, the expression the Spirit of life indicates that Spirit is life, that the Spirit and life are one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the same principle, the expression the Spirit of God means that the Spirit is God, and the expression the Spirit of Christ means that the Spirit is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, the expression the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead indicates that the Spirit is the resurrecting One.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the Spirit is life, God, Christ, and the resurrecting One.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 2 also reveals that the Spirit conveys life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as the current of electricity conveys electricity, the Spirit of life conveys and imparts life into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit who indwells us infuses the divine life into every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our concept is that we need to improve our behavior, conduct, and deeds, but God s concept is to infuse Himself into us as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we must have a change in our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we are revived, we should not think about our behavior but should pick up God s concept to consider the inner life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>LIFE BEING SUPPLIED</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>TO OUR SPIRIT, MIND, AND BODY</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our spirit needs the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our mind, emotion, and will our entire soul also need the infusion of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our body also needs the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 10 says, If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is in us, and He is the life supply to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 10 does not say that our spirit is living but that our spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Living is a condition, but it is not life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our spirit is life because Christ, who is within us, supplies our spirit with life, causing our spirit to become life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 6 says, The mind set on the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, our mind also is life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 11 says, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Life is supplied to our spirit, mind, and mortal body.</S>
