   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE WORD, THE TABERNACLE, THE LAMB OF GOD, THE DOVE, THE STONE, AND THE HOUSE OF GOD 3 Scripture Reading: John 1:1-2, 14, 29, 36, 32, 42, 51</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall cover a number of basic matters regarding John's writings, the Gospel of John in particular.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We shall also speak further on the six matters that form the extract of chapter one, which is a prologue of the entire book: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb of God, the Dove upon the Lamb, the stone, and the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. JOHN'S WRITINGS A. Not Only Supplementary but Also Consummating</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Throughout the centuries, teachers and expositors have agreed that John's writings were the last of the New Testament writings to be completed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All of the Epistles of Paul and Peter were completed approximately A.D. 65.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was about a quarter of a century later, that is, approximately A.D. 90, that John composed three categories of writings: the Gospel, the Epistles, and the Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Gospel of John, the Epistles of John, and the book of Revelation were the last books of the Bible to be written.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John's writings are not only supplementary but also consummating.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Gospel of John consummates the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John's Epistles consummate all the other Epistles, and John's Revelation consummates the entire New Testament, even the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John's writings, therefore, are both supplementary and consummating.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Supplementary to the Synoptic Gospels with the View of Christ's Deity</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Gospel of John supplements the synoptic Gospels with the view of Christ's deity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called synoptic Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word synoptic means having one point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke were written from the point of view of Christ's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Matthew reveals that Christ is the King; Mark, that He is the Servant of God; and Luke, that He is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The King, the Servant, and the Savior are all aspects of Christ in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the Lord Jesus is God as well as man, divine as well as human.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, there is the need of a supplement to the synoptic Gospels showing Christ's deity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Gospel of John is both supplementary and consummating, for it unveils the divine side of the wonderful Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In John's writings we have a view of Christ's deity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Consummating the Divine Revelation with the Divine Person, the Divine Life, the Divine Nature, and the Divine Accomplishments of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The writings of John consummate the divine revelation with the divine Person, the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine accomplishments of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John's Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation we can see how much the divine Father has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whatever He has accomplished is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In John's writings we also see how much has been accomplished by the Son and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whatever is accomplished by the Triune God is divine and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>B. Not Only Polemical but Also Unveiling</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some theologians say that John's writings are polemical or argumentative.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word "polemical" is derived from the Greek word for war and denotes a controversial argument, in particular an argument against some opinion or doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John's writings are polemical in that he was fighting against the heresies regarding Christ's Person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, his writings are not only polemical but also unveiling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They unveil the mysteries of the divine economy of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the writings of John one veil after another is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The book of Revelation is a book of unveiling.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Greek, the word "revelation" means unveiling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even now, God's administration is being carried out in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Unbelievers do not see God's administration and do not have any knowledge of it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But because the veil has been taken away, we can see that Christ is on the throne in the heavens carrying out God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is one of the mysteries of the divine economy of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>John's writings are not merely polemical or argumentative, but even the more, they are unveiling.</S>
