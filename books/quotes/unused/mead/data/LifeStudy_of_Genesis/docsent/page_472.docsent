   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Coming to Bethel Twice</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jacob came to Bethel twice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to my experience, this indicates that we all come into the church twice.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first time we come in a dream, and the second time we come in actuality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1925, I had a clear dream, but it was not until seven years later, in 1932, that I came into the actuality and practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many of you have had a similar experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When you first came into the church, it was, for quite a period of time, a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You might have been in a dream for a number of years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But after those years, it was no longer a dream, and you could say, "Oh, I am actually and practically in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The past years have been a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thank the Lord for keeping me in this dream, but now I have the actual experience."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Firstly, Jacob had the dream.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>More than twenty years later, he was brought into the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you compare chapters twenty-eight and thirty-five, you will see a great difference between them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everything in chapter twenty-eight, being a dream, is somewhat vague; nothing is definite.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the experience in chapter thirty-five, however, everything is definite and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, we thank the Lord that the dream in the beginning was a true picture.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everything in the reality is the same as that in the dream.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this, there is no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The only difference is that the dream is indefinite and that the actuality is definite.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need both the dream and the practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We praise the Lord that today we are in the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the practicality of Bethel in chapter thirty-five, Jacob not only set up a pillar, but poured a drink offering upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In chapter twenty-eight there was no pouring out of a drink offering, only the pouring out of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But here, prior to the pouring out of the oil, there was the pouring out of the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This experience is very subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Bethel, we firstly have the dream and then the actuality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the actuality we build a pillar and pour ourselves upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jacob did not pour out the drink offering upon himself or upon the earth; he poured it out upon the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We shall see more of this in another message.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>ff.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Christ on Whom We Rest</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Being Constituted into a Pillar</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to 28:18, Jacob "took the stone that he had made his pillow, and set it up for a pillar" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The pillar was the stone he had used for a pillow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This stone depicts Christ as our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jacob did not have this dream when he was at home, but when he was traveling on his pilgrim journey.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Like Jacob, we also are pilgrims.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we are traveling on our way, we see the vision of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everyone who is on this pilgrim way is weary and needs rest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Where can we find this rest?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The answer is the Lord's word in Matthew 11:28: "Come to Me all who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is the stone on which we may lay our weary head and find rest.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Christ on whom we rest is the constituent of the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We ourselves are not the material for building the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This material must be the Christ on whom we rest and whom we experience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is the Christ wrought into our being who is constituted into the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In today's Christianity it is very difficult for people to have the constitution of the pillar because few have been instructed how to experience Christ in a subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When you were in Christianity, were you ever told how to experience Christ's being wrought into you?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Recently, I told some brothers and sisters that we in the church must not only love the Lord and live for Him we must also live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Oh, there is a vast difference between living for Christ and living by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you live for Christ, it is you who do things for Him, but you remain yourself and Christ is not wrought into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To live by Christ, however, means that Christ is wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By having Christ wrought into our being, we become material for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The stone for the pillar is firstly Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Following this, it is Christ experienced by us and wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now this stone is not merely Christ, but Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ is wrought into our being, and we become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this way, we become the building material for the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This experience is only possible in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At the least, we can say that the greatest possibility of having this experience is in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The reason for this is that outside the church, in the so-called Christian religion, very few are taught to have Christ wrought into them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I am fully assured that, from now on, message after message will be given instructing us how to live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This working of Christ into our being is true transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When the element of Christ is added into us, we become the material for the building of the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This all takes place in Bethel, the place where Jacob was.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In 1964, I was invited to speak to a certain group in Dallas.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>My hosts, who appreciated my ministry, were very kind to me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, they told me, both in plain words and by suggestions, that the people in Dallas were not ready to hear about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They said, "Brother Lee, please sympathize with us and do not say a word about the church."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I did not promise to comply with their request.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Rather, I said, "I fully realize the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But I assure you that the more I talk about Christ and minister Christ as life to the people, the more they will desire to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even if I do not say a word about the church and only minister Christ as life, they will still have the desire for the church."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the last meeting, I was burdened to speak a word about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When I stood up and asked the people to read Romans 12, they were disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But I said to myself, "I don't care whether I offend you or not.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If I do not release my burden, I cannot live."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I then gave a strong word concerning the church, and they were offended by it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Later, I learned that a certain brother, who had not yet come into the church life, had attended that last meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Many had been praying for him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>During that meeting, which was the only meeting he attended, he was caught for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Although I had offended those people, the Lord gained this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Today, this brother has become a pillar.</S>
