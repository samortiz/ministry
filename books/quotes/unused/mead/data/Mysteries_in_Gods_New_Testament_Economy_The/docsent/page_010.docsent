   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The second half of Colossians 2:2 says, "The mystery of God, Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can see that Jesus Christ is a mystery; He is not simple at all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I do not believe that we have exhausted all that the Bible speaks concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I believe that we have only covered a part.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are still many things which we do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In spite of that, when we come together to fellowship and to talk about them, we will gradually be brought into understanding them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Concerning God's mystery, Christ, I have listed six points.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sixth, He ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All these items that Christ has passed through are the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is the Word of God, and the Word is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the Word becoming flesh, God became flesh and stayed with us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His living was God's living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When men saw Him, they saw God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then He died in the flesh and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He lived in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was the grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died to produce many grains John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He died and He lived.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In eternity past, before time began, Christ was the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was divine thought that became constituted as an expression, which in turn became the Word that can be comprehended by man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Word here is logos in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It means an expression constituted by a thought, which is understood by man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although our God cannot be seen in the universe, He is the Word that can be understood by man.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Second, the invisible Word of God became the visible flesh, which is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His whole person is the embodiment of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why the first Epistle of John begins with the Word of life which was there from the beginning and which was with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is that which we have heard, which we have seen with our own eyes, which we beheld, and which we have touched with our own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By becoming the flesh, this Word has become tangible and touchable.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is the mysterious God who was conceived of His Spirit and begotten in the womb of a human virgin Matt 1:20b .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then from this virgin's womb, He was born with humanity to be the mysterious God-man, in whom both divinity and humanity are mingled.</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is Jehovah God as our Savior and is also God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When Christ became flesh, He put on human flesh Heb 2:14a and partook of all that man is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Through this He brought His mysterious divinity into humanity, that is, He brought God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this way, the mysterious fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily in this mysterious God-man Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What is in Christ, the mysterious God-man, is not only divinity but also all the fullness of the Godhead, which is the expression of the riches of all that God is.</S>
