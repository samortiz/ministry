 <h2 class="head2">The Story of the Triune God&rsquo;s Entering into Man</h2>
<p>When God incarnated, the Son came with the Father and the Spirit. In addition, the Son died on the cross and on the third day resurrected. When He resurrected, Paul says that He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Just as His resurrection is a mystery, so His becoming the life-giving Spirit is also a mystery. Although we cannot comprehend this, it is a fact. As the life-giving Spirit, He is omnipresent&mdash;He is both in the heavens and on the earth. This life-giving Spirit is God Himself&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. When this Spirit comes to us, it is the Triune God coming to us. When this Spirit enters into us, it is the Triune God entering into our spirit. When we confess our sins, repent, and call on the name of the Lord, we sense that something changes inwardly. This change is the entering in of the Spirit. Once the Spirit enters, we feel bright and fresh within. Our spirit is revived, enlivened, and strengthened.</p>
<p>For this reason when we repent, confess our sins, and believe into the Lord Jesus, immediately we sense an inward joy and are completely changed. Formerly there was darkness within us, but once we called on the name of the Lord Jesus, immediately there was light. Formerly we felt oppressed within, but once we called on the Lord, we were liberated. Formerly we were evil to the uttermost, being hateful and full of complaints. We may have even thrown dishes, hit the table, and kicked the chairs. However, once we believed in the Lord Jesus, calling on His name, immediately we felt that the people and things around us all changed and became quite lovable. We also became the most happy people. Why is this? There is no other reason except that the Spirit entered into us. This Spirit is God, the Creator, and our Redeemer, who shed His blood and died on the cross for us. When we pray and call, &ldquo;Abba Father,&rdquo; we feel sweet within. Who is this &ldquo;Abba Father&rdquo;? He is the Spirit. Who is this Spirit? He is the Triune God. This is the mystery of the Triune God in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Filled Inwardly and Outwardly<br />
with the Spirit</h2>
<p>In this way the Triune God dispenses Himself into us and also lives in us. Therefore, daily we must breathe Him and pray to Him. Our prayer is just like our breathing. Daily we must also exercise our spirit to receive Him, to eat Him. To eat Him is to receive Him. When we pray and read the Word, we are breathing the spiritual air and eating the spiritual food. Both the spiritual air and the spiritual food are the Spirit. Thus, the result is that we are filled with the Spirit. When we are filled to the extent that we overflow with joy, we will say, &ldquo;It is no longer I, but it is Christ!&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>It is amazing that we are filled inwardly with the Spirit, yet we would say that the One who lives in us is Christ. This proves that Christ is the Spirit within us. &ldquo;It is no longer I, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; This is what many of us have experienced. Consequently, we are inwardly filled with joy, satisfaction, light, and zeal to such an extent that we even are beside ourselves and become &ldquo;crazy,&rdquo; telling whomever we meet about the Christ in us. By this speaking, the gospel goes out. When we are beside ourselves, we do not care about east or west or heaven or earth, and we are neither shy nor fearful. Wherever we go, we speak to others about Jesus, telling them that Jesus is the most wonderful One. Why is this? This is because we are not only filled with the Spirit within but also have the outpouring of the Spirit upon us. Hence, once we open our mouths, others will be moved because we have the Spirit inwardly and outwardly.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this is not to say that we have two Spirits, one inside and one outside. We have only one Spirit. The Spirit within us is the essential Spirit whereas the Spirit outside of us is the economical Spirit. The essential Spirit within us makes us joyful, crazy, zealous, and fearless; the economical Spirit outside of us supplies us with authority as we preach, causing our listeners to be subdued so that they must believe. Since we are filled with the essential Spirit inwardly and with the economical Spirit outwardly, we are completely mingled with the Triune God in spirit. God is Spirit, and this Spirit is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In other words, this Spirit is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;completely filling us and enveloping us. The Spirit who fills us inwardly, the essential Spirit, is like living water for us to drink (John 7:37-39; 1 Cor. 12:13). The Spirit who fills us outwardly, the economical Spirit, is like a mantle of power for us to put on (Luke 24:49; 2 Kings 2:9, 13-15).</p>
<p>The essential Spirit is for our living and enjoyment. When we call on the name of the Lord and enjoy Him, He fills us as the essential Spirit. Then we become ecstatic, burning, and bold, feeling that Jesus is the best. We do not desire anything else but the Lord Jesus. Then when we speak with boldness, proclaiming the name of the Lord, the economical Spirit is poured upon us, covering us to be our authority and power for our ministry and work.</p>
<p>We can see that some people speak with much authority. Actually, the secret is in the Spirit. Before speaking, these people usually exercise their spirits by calling on the Lord, in order for them to be fed within. Then when they come to the meeting, they release their spirits. The more they speak, the crazier they become. Finally, the economical Spirit is poured out upon them so that people receive whatever they speak. This is because they are filled with the Spirit and mingled with God. They have God inwardly and outwardly, in every part of their being.</p>
<p>Real Christians are people who are united and mingled with God. In the past twenty to thirty years, we have published many books speaking about this very matter. I hope that we all would really get into the truth and then go to our relatives and friends to speak the truth. We must speak Christ to people, and we must be &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; toward them, telling them that everything else is poor and that Jesus is the best. We should all be &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; Christians of this kind who are full of Jesus and full of the Spirit.</p>
