<h2 class="head3">7. Having the Spirit of Faith</h2><p>In verse 13 Paul says, &ldquo;And having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke; we also believe, therefore also we speak.&rdquo; The &ldquo;same spirit&rdquo; refers to the same spirit as set forth in the quotation from Psalm 116:10.</p><p>Concerning the spirit in verse 13, Alford says, &ldquo;Not distinctly the Holy Spirit,&mdash;but still not merely a human disposition: the indwelling Holy Spirit penetrates and characterizes the whole renewed man.&rdquo; Vincent says, &ldquo;Spirit of faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human faculty or disposition, but blending both.&rdquo; This means it is the mingling of the Holy Spirit with our human spirit. We must exercise such a spirit to believe and to speak, as the psalmist did, the things we have experienced of the Lord, especially His death and resurrection. Faith is in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit, not in our mind. Doubts are in our mind. The &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; here indicates that it is by the mingled spirit that the apostles lived a crucified life in resurrection for carrying out their ministry.</p><p>Verse 14 says, &ldquo;Knowing that He Who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you.&rdquo; This indicates that the apostles considered themselves dead persons (1:9), for they were always being delivered unto death for the Lord&rsquo;s purpose. Their only hope was in the God who raised up the Lord Jesus and who would also raise them up. They lived with this kind of faith.</p><p>In verse 15 Paul declares, &ldquo;For all things are for your sakes, that the grace, abounding through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.&rdquo; Grace, according to the context, is the very Christ who lives in the apostles as their life and life supply for them to live a crucified life for the manifestation of the resurrection life, that they may carry out their ministry for God&rsquo;s new covenant. As the apostles were under the killing, life was being imparted to others, and grace was abounding through the many. As a result, much thanksgiving will also abound. Paul did not care for the sufferings, because he realized that his being killed imparted life to many and this life became grace to them. As a result, all will give thanks to God. This was the life lived by the apostles, a crucified life for the manifestation of resurrection life by the excellent power of the hidden treasure in the earthen vessel.</p><p>Sooner or later, we shall all experience the grinding. We shall be ground between the top stone and the bottom stone. In this matter we have no choice, for we all need the grinding. It is this grinding that causes resurrection life to be manifested.</p><p>Yes, in the sight of God we have already been constituted. But we still need the testing to determine how much we have been constituted, and we also need the grinding to work out this constitution in a practical and experiential way. Although we have been constituted, we still need this constitution to be carried out. This is done mainly through opposition and the grinding of the dear ones close to us.</p><p>Every church is a grinding mill. Perhaps you do not like the church in your locality and desire to move elsewhere. If you move to escape the grinding, you will find that in the place to which you move you will be ground even more. Therefore, if you move to escape the grinding, you should be prepared for even more grinding. We cannot avoid it. This has been ordained for us; it is our destiny. Praise the Lord for the grinding which causes the resurrection life to be manifested!</p>
