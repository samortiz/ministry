   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Expanding of the Ground of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have also mentioned that life not only is God, but it is Christ, and it is also the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may say that to experience life is to experience the Holy Spirit; therefore, to grow in life also means to allow the Holy Spirit to gain more ground within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we pursue more urgently the working of the Holy Spirit within us and give diligence in obeying the teaching of the Holy Spirit within us as the anointing, the Holy Spirit can then expand His ground extensively; thus life within us will grow to a great extent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the growth of life means also that the ground of the Holy Spirit has expanded within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>D. The Decrease of the Human Element</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The above three points reveal that if in a believer the element of God is increased, the stature of Christ is increased and the ground of the Holy Spirit is expanded, his life then has grown.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All these points speak from God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we shall speak from our side.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Firstly, the growth of life is the decrease of the human element.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The decrease of the human element is the decrease of Adam, the old creation, in man, which also means the decrease of the savor of man and in the increase of the savor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a believer has really grown in life, his speech, actions, living or working must all impart the sense that they are not according to himself, but according to God; not of his own intelligence, but by the grace of God; therefore, they do not carry the savor of man, but more the savor of God, which also means that the human element has decreased and the element of God has increased.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, the growth of life is not only the increase of the element of God, but also the decrease of the element of man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE WAY TO GROW IN LIFE</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It only requires us to practice every day.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we need to live by the Spirit, stay in the fellowship of life and obey the teaching of the anointing at home, in school, and when we are with our friends.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lastly, we need to flee all negative things and by the Spirit overcome all hindrances to life such as the old manner of living, sins, youthful lust, corruption, ungodliness, the world, lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life, the flesh, the self, opinions, criticism, murmuring, reasonings, the soul-life, individualism, and divisiveness.</S>
