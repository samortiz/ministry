   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Calling Him 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The First Time</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God motivated Abraham by calling him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He called Abraham the first time by appearing to him as the God of glory Gen 11:31; Acts 7:2-4a .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God called Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldees and from his relatives into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the one hand, Abraham received God's call, but on the other hand, he was not so willing to carry out God's call.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Abraham came out of Chaldea, but instead of going into Canaan, he went with his father Terah and his nephew Lot and stopped at Haran.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No doubt, Abraham was not willing to leave his nephew, his relative.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Probably he proposed to his father to bring Lot with them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God motivated his calling, but he was not willing to carry it out absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, Abraham came out of Ur of the Chaldees with Terah, Lot, and his wife Sarai.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They all came out of Chaldea, the country full of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time mankind had become joined with Satan, making themselves one with Satan, so God had given them up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God then came to another person to motivate something, to get a new race.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This person was Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Second Time</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God called Abraham the second time after the death of his father Terah Gen 12:1, 4; Acts 7:4b .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He called him out of his country, from his kindred, and from his father's house into the land that Jehovah would show him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, Abraham went with his nephew Lot at seventy-five years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Abraham left Chaldea, but he became stuck at Haran.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This may have been motivated by Abraham's father, and this displeased God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, Terah died at Haran, and this should have been taken by Abraham as a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time God came again to motivate him further.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That was his second calling by which he was motivated and led by God into the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Abraham responded to this second call, God undoubtedly was very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I believe that God was happier with Abraham as the one called by Him and sent by Him than He was with Adam as the one created by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you prefer to be a descendant of Adam or a descendant of Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Abraham is much more pleasant to God than Adam is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Abraham is a wonderful sign of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Christian life should be and could be a pleasant matter to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is always a pleasant thing to God for us to live the Christian life.</S>
