Praying with Our Spirit to Contact the Triune God</h2><p>When a saved person feels he has the Lord&#8217;s presence inwardly, that means the Spirit is in him. Where the Spirit is, there the Lord is (1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Cor. 3:17), and where the Lord is, there the Father is (Rom. 8:9-10). The three are all in the believers; when One comes, all three of Them come. This is because the Spirit is the reality, the realization, of the Son (John 14:17), and the Son is the embodiment of the Father (10:30; 14:10-11). Thus, the three are really just the One, but this One has the aspect of being three distinctly.<p>I am from Shantung Province, so I have eaten wheat for eighty years. If today you ask me what the element in wheat really is, I still do not know. If I must understand wheat to eat it, then I would have died long ago. Recently, I started to like eating yogurt. My wife probably understands what its ingredients are, because she pays close attention to nutrition, but I do not know anything about it. I only know how to eat and enjoy it. Some days I wake up at 4:30 in the morning, and I begin working in my head while I am in bed. When 6:00 comes, I get up and continue working. By 7:20 I am hungry. Then I eat some yogurt which is nutritious and easy to digest and assimilate. As soon as I have eaten it, my entire being is refreshed and satisfied. Today we have the best &#8220;yogurt&#8221; within us, which is the Triune God. What is He like? It is hard for us to describe. The Father is the Son, and the Son is the embodiment of the Father; the Son is realized in the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reality of the Son. What is this all about? I have spoken about it for decades, and I can only speak according to the Bible. I still do not know fully what the mystery of the Triune God is all about.<p>My point is this: While you are here being trained, you should not just be learning the truth; it is even more important for you to learn to eat the &#8220;yogurt&#8221; every day, to enjoy the Triune God daily. To eat the physical yogurt, you do not use your nose or your ears; rather, you use your mouth. Likewise, to enjoy the Triune God, you do not need to work your brain, use your ears, or bow down before the Lord. You just need to use your spirit, open your heart, and open your mouth to pray to the Lord; then you will be able to enjoy Him.<h2 class=head3>2. Exercising Our Spirit to Call on the Name of the Lord to Enjoy the Triune God</h2><p>You are being trained here to learn how to use your spirit. From the time you get up in the morning, you must learn to use your spirit. This is just like when you want to breathe, there is no need for you to beg others or expect any kind of help. You just need to exercise your breathing organs; once you inhale through your nose, the air gets right in. In the same principle, if you want to enjoy the Triune God, you need to exercise your spirit. For example, as soon as you get up in the morning, you feel that you are tired. The more you think about it, the more tired you feel. But if you immediately turn from that condition back to your spirit, then your entire being will be revived. The secret of turning to your spirit is to call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&#8221; You do not need to call loudly. When you call softly from the depths of your being, immediately you will return to your spirit, and your entire being will be revived.<h2 class=head3>3. Experiencing God&#8217;s Salvation and Dealing with the Enemy by Turning to Our Spirit</h2><p>I believe that when you are living together with others, you will face many troubles as soon as you get up in the morning. This is because Satan has many messengers. Many times the sisters who are your roommates can give you many problems. For example, you have just gotten up, and your roommate at that exact moment breaks your toothbrush mug. You dare not lose your temper, but you are very angry inwardly. At this time, you just need to call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&#8221; The more you call, the less you will be bothered. Instead, you will feel that inwardly you have the enjoyment and the watering. I believe that to some extent you all have had this kind of experience. You must know that Satan always stirs up some trouble in our environment to disturb us and force us into anger. When you are angry, Satan is happy. Moreover, when you are angry, all the truths that you have ever heard become nothing; they are all made void and vanish into thin air. Everything you have heard about the Triune God and God&#8217;s salvation are all gone. You are here being trained and have heard so many truths and received so many visions, but because of Satan&#8217;s bothering, whatever you have learned all leaks out.<p>Matthew 1:21 says, &#8220;Jesus...will save His people from their sins.&#8221; Christianity explains this verse by saying that the Lord Jesus washed away our sins through His crucifixion and the shedding of His precious blood. I dare not say that this is not so, but this is only dealing with our sinful deeds. On the positive side, the Lord still wants to save us from the power of sin. We must know that the Lord Jesus has two names: Jesus is Jehovah, and Emmanuel is God. This indicates that the Lord Jesus is both Jehovah and God. He saves us from our sins mainly by becoming the Spirit to enter into us to save us from the power of sin.<p>According to the preceding example, when a sister breaks your toothbrush mug and you get angry, is that sin? And if another sister tracks dirt all over the floor which you had scrubbed clean the previous night, will you get angry? Then another sister carelessly gets her hands, which are greasy with vegetable oil, all over your hair, which you just washed the night before, what will you do? Do you experience Jesus saving you from your sins? I believe that if each time you would call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus,&#8221; instead of getting angry, you will be full of the enjoyment of the Lord. This is your realization, your experience. The result of such realization and experience is that you have the real enjoyment of the Triune God. Consequently, the church is produced. However, if Satan comes to disturb you and you are defeated, and if he comes again, and you are defeated again, then the result will be that you are completely defeated and the church cannot be manifested. You are disgusted with the sister who troubles you, and she also despises you; so how can there be the church? However, if you overcome whenever trouble comes upon you, and if you call on the name of the Lord whenever something disturbing happens to you, then even though the sisters continue to offend you, you will still love them and love the church. When you learn to live constantly in this kind of a spirit, the reality of the church is spontaneously there.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
