   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. He Will Be Exalted and Lifted Up</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Very High</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The second half of Isaiah 52:13 says that Jesus will be exalted and lifted up and very high.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, the Lord Jesus has been exalted already Phil 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>C. Many Will Be Astonished at Him</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Isaiah 52:14 continues by saying that many will be astonished at Him: "Even as many were astonished at Him / His visage was marred more than that of any man, / And His form more than that of the sons of men."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Hebrew word for mar here means to disfigure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word visage denotes the appearance and also refers to the face or facial expression, the countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was Isaiah's poetic writing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In such a poetic writing Isaiah portrayed Christ in the New Testament sense.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was exalted and lifted up and is very high, and He has acted prudently and has prospered in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today even the opposers of Christ respect Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They all know that Christ is a great One.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when we meet Him, we will see that His face was marred, or disfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ was disfigured for us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the one hand, Christ is now glorified, but on the other hand, He still bears the impress of His being disfigured for us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today the Jews might know Christ somewhat as the glorious Christ, but they do not know the disfigured Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We believers know the disfigured Christ much more than the glorified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We were saved not only by a glorified Christ but also by a disfigured Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A so-called picture of Jesus popular among Christians today portrays Him as a handsome man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, Christ our Savior was not that handsome; rather, He was disfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Isaiah said that many people were astonished at this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to people's concept, Jesus is great, high, stately, and glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who would think that Jesus would be such a disfigured One?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After I preached the gospel in China, many learned ones, after listening to the message, came to me and said, "Is this Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We thought that Jesus Christ was a great man, a great figure.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Is this disfigured One, this marred One, really Jesus?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yes, this is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If He were not so, He could never save us; He could never be our Substitute on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is something astonishing.</S>
