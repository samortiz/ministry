   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LESSON THIRTEEN KNOWING THE SECTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The five great items mentioned in the previous six lessons are positive items which we should know; they are the most fundamental truths realities revealed by the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because of the decline and desolation of the church, however, we must also know a most basic negative item in the church's desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the matter of divisions, the so-called sects or denominations, which we see in Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. HAS CHRIST BEEN DIVIDED?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1 "But I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Has Christ been divided?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Was Paul crucified for you?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1 Cor 1:10-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In those days, in the church in Corinth, there were factions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One party said that they were of Paul, and another said that they were of Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Another party said that they were of Cephas Peter , and still another party, who considered themselves superior to all the previous parties, said that they were of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, they were severely rebuked by the Apostle Paul, who had led them to salvation and who had established them as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul called them to account, asking them whether Christ had been divided.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Obviously Christ has not been and cannot be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, those who had believed and had been baptized into Christ were divided one from another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This offended Christ, dividing His Body, separating the unique church, which He redeemed by shedding His blood, into many different sects.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, the Apostle Paul asked the divided Corinthian believers, "Was Paul crucified for you?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Of course not!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul did not die to accomplish redemption for them; neither were they baptized into the name of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was Christ who died to accomplish redemption for them, and it was Christ into whom they had been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet why did they say they were of Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is just like some today who are redeemed by Christ and are baptized into Christ, who say that they are of Luther the Lutheran sect , or of Wesley the Wesleyan sect , or of the Baptist church the Baptist sect , or of the Presbyterian church the Presbyterian sect .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here Paul's rebuking and denouncing of the divisive Christians strongly condemn and deny all divisions, sects, and denominations in Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING UNIQUE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>1 "One Body and one Spirit one Lord one God" Eph 4:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since Christ is not divided, neither should Christians who belong to Christ be divided into sects.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even the more, since the Body of Christ is unique, Christians who are members of this unique Body should not divide it into many different sects.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should only want the unique Body of Christ, not the many man-made sects.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this Body of Christ, there is only one Spirit; also, His Body has only one Lord, that is, one Head.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, all the members of His Body are regenerated by one God and Father, and they are indwelt by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Triune God has been mingled with all the believers as one, and the essence of His divine oneness in the believers has further constituted them into an indivisible Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit is the one life which they all possess.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How can a body have two or more lives?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord is the one Head to whom they belong.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How can a body have two or more heads?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is the one Father who begat them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How can the children of God have two or more Fathers?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is strange and unreasonable for a single body to have more than one life, or for a body to have more than one head, or for a family of children to have more than one father!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yet these unreasonable and strange things are actually being established, supported, respected, and promoted by a majority of Christians!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>None of the lovers of the Lord or those who know the Lord's heart and the truth of the Bible should do this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, they should imitate the Apostle Paul to condemn and deny these things which offend Christ, sadden God, and grieve the Holy Spirit.</S>
