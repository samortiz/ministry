   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To walk in Christ means not to have any substitute for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because of man s fall, culture replaces God in man s life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man was made for God and needs God to be his life, his enjoyment, and everything to him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But because man lost God, he invented culture as a substitute for God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now in His economy God has ordained that Christ, His Son, should accomplish redemption, bring man back to God, and then replace all the substitutes with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen that the various factors and elements of our human life are all replacements for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the factors and elements that have become substitutes for God must now be replaced by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order for this to be our experience, we need to walk in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the matter of shopping we should simply live Christ and not care for anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not consider what items are on sale or how much you have in your checking account.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, simply live Christ and care for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a brother lives in oneness with the Lord, he will walk in Christ whenever he gets a haircut.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Spontaneously he will know how his hair should be cut.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is not only the sphere, the realm, in which we walk, but He is also every factor and element of our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To have Christ in this way in our experience is to walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I appreciate the fact that so many brothers love Christ and the church and are absolute for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, instead of walking in Christ, they walk in their dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They may condemn pride, but they treasure their dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A brother who is a leading one in the church life may enjoy acting dignified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even young brothers, those recently married, may behave according to their own sense of dignity instead of walking in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With their wives, they may exercise themselves to maintain their dignity as husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They may become very unhappy should their wives do anything to dishonor their dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They may regard such behavior as an insult to their headship and a lack of respect for their dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Their attitude is that God has ordained them to be the head over their wives and that their wives should respect them and honor them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, instead of walking in Christ, they walk in their dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead of walking in Christ, others walk according to the tide of their emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the tide is low, they are cold, silent, and unconcerned for the needs of others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when the tide is high, they become active and very talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They talk according to their mood, not according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many saints walk in their moods instead of in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If they feel happy, they are willing to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if they do not feel happy, they become withdrawn and disinterested, unconcerned about those around them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that, although these saints may love Christ and the church, they do not walk in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the extensive revelation of Christ in the book of Colossians, we should not walk in anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means we should not walk in philosophy, in tradition, or in the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Neither should we walk in certain observances or ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is also easy to walk in our habits instead of in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By nature, we all live, walk, and have our being in our habit, not in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>During times of prayer, we may pray ourselves into the spirit and, at those times, have our being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But as soon as prayer is ended, we turn back to living and walking in our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, instead of walking in Christ, we walk in our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How much have you walked in Christ today?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How much of your talk, actions, and attitudes have been in something other than Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must admit that instead of walking in Christ, we walk in many other factors or elements of our living that are replacements for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But according to the book of Colossians, we should walk in the extensive Christ, in the Christ who is universally vast and who is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not need philosophy Christ is our philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We do not need tradition Christ is the best heritage.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We do not need the elementary principles Christ is every principle to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What we need to do is to take Christ as everything and walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to admit that even in the local churches nearly all of us walk in something other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We love the Lord and His recovery, but we live, walk, and have our being in things that are not Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because a certain brother walks in his timidity, not in Christ, he is not willing to speak the truth to others frankly in love.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, this illustration should not be taken to mean that we should walk in boldness instead of timidity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The point is that we should walk in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Very few saints among us walk in things that are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But a great many walk in things that are good, moral, and ethical.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They walk according to their own manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we truly walk in Christ, there will be times when we shall boldly rebuke others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to Galatians 2, Paul openly rebuked Peter when Peter withdrew from eating with the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The point here is not that we should go around rebuking others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is that all our behavior should be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to live and act in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The young people should not say that they cannot help being young, and the old ones should not say that they cannot keep from being old.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whether we are young or old, we all must live and act in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the church there are no young ones or old ones, no timid ones or bold ones.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is only Christ, who is all the members of the new man and in all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, we all should walk in Christ and not live according to any element of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I repeat, not only should Christ be our sphere, the extensive realm in which we walk; He should also become all the elements and factors of our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We admit that it is not easy to walk in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After charging us to walk in Christ, Paul immediately adds the words, having been rooted and being built up in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we would walk in Christ, we must fulfill the conditions of having been rooted in Him and being built up in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our basis for walking in Christ is that we have been rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>On the one hand, we have already been rooted in Christ; on the other hand, we are in the process of being built up in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The rooting, which has been accomplished, is one condition for walking in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Being built up, which is taking place, is another condition.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For being rooted, Paul uses the illustration of plants rooted deeply in the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As an illustration of our being built up in Christ, Paul uses the example of stones.</S>
