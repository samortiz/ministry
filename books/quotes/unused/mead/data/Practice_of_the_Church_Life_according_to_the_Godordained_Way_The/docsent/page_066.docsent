   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OVERCOMING THE THREE "ISMS" HATED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord's recovery is for the producing of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not think that to overcome is merely a matter of overcoming our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Revelation 2 and 3 the overcoming of matters such as our temper is not mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Revelation 2 and 3 cover the entire situation of Christianity, including Catholicism and Protestantism, and also the situation of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Throughout human history these three big "isms" have been God's real enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To overcome is to overcome these three "isms," which God hates to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is still dealing with these three "isms."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In carrying out His dealing, God is very patient.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has dealt with the "ism" of Judaism for almost twenty-six centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's instrument in dealing with the Jews has been the four great empires Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome represented by the four sections of the great human image in Daniel 2:31-33.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Jews have been under God's dealing since 606 B.C. At that time they lost their country through the Babylonian invasion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From that day the Jews have never fully regained their country.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although in 1948 the nation of Israel was reestablished, the number of Jews living in Palestine is still very small.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even today the Jews are still under God's dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the same time God is also dealing with Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Revelation 17 we are told clearly that near the beginning of the three and a half years of the great tribulation, after Antichrist begins to oppose and exalt himself above all that is called God or an object of worship 2 Thes 2:3-4 , he will burn the Roman Catholic Church Rev 17:16 , which is the great harlot mentioned by the apostle John in Revelation 17:1 and the evil woman mentioned by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 13:33.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The woman in Matthew 13 who took the leaven and put it into the fine flour, the woman Jezebel in Revelation 2:20, and the harlot in Revelation 17 all refer to the same entity, that is, Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even some Catholic scholars recognize that the harlot in Revelation 17 refers to the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is also dealing with Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Protestant churches a prominent thing is the "tares," the nominal Christians Matt 13:24-30, 36-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Matthew 13:30, 40-42 the Lord said that when He comes back, the first thing He will do is bind the tares together and put them into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>PRACTICING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>IN FOUR DEFINITE STEPS Practicing the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Priesthood of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To those who love the Lord and have the intention to live an overcoming life for the Lord's recovery, I would like to give some solemn advice: You must study to enter into the first step of the God-ordained way the priesthood of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are the priests of the gospel Rom 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today the New Testament priesthood is a priesthood of the preaching of the gospel to get sinners regenerated to make them members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As New Testament priests, we offer these members of Christ to God as our sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Old Testament the priests offered cattle as sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These sacrifices were merely types.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today we need to offer as our sacrifices not cattle but the regenerated, saved sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have all been chosen to be God's priests 1 Pet 2:5, 9; Rev 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The New Testament eventually tells us that this priesthood is a priesthood of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is clearly stressed in Romans 15:16.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There Paul said that he was a laboring priest, an energizing priest, of the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then he said that he offered to God as New Testament sacrifices all the Gentiles whom he converted into members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this one step of the God-ordained way you must have a beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You yourself must study it and get into it and practice it.</S>
