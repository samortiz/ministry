<h2 class="head1">EVANGELIZING TAIWAN</h2>
<p>When we initially received this new leading from the Lord, we emphatically pointed out that we have enjoyed much blessing from the Lord in Taiwan. Our number is not small. However, for forty years we have not saturated the entire island with the gospel. This is our shame as well as our shortage. Where in Christianity can we find another group of people who have received as much truth from the Lord as we have? Yet we have locked up all these riches. We have not spread them. We have come short. Paul said that he was a debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians (Rom. 1:14). Today there are almost twenty million people in Taiwan, but the number of Christians is fewer than half a million, perhaps even fewer than three hundred thousand. We cannot blame the brothers and sisters in the denominations for not doing their job. They have not received as much light and truth as we have received. The truth that we release in our conferences and trainings is clear, transparent, and rich. Yet we have not brought many people to the Lord. This is the reason I say again and again that we have come short. We are indebted to the Lord as well as to our countrymen.</p>
<p>Hence, we have accepted a heavy burden before the Lord to pay back our debt and gospelize Taiwan within five years. We should even &ldquo;truthize&rdquo; and &ldquo;churchize&rdquo; Taiwan. The gospel, the truth, and the church need to spread all over this land. To achieve this goal, I have proposed that over the next five years we bring in five hundred full-time serving ones each year. They should be college graduates. We will form these two thousand five hundred people into an army and will evangelize all the towns and villages of Taiwan. Now we have two hundred sixty-six full-timers. In the coming term, perhaps two hundred fifty more will join them. We will then have more than five hundred. We hope that by 1988 we will have at least a thousand full-timers who are well equipped and trained to go out to spread the work.</p>
<p>After much consideration before the Lord, we propose to initially send these one thousand full-timers out in one hundred teams. Each team will have ten members. They will go to one hundred towns and will work for a month in the new way, visiting people, preaching the gospel, and building up the church. After this, two members will stay behind to take care of that locality. The rest will regroup into eighty teams and go to eighty more towns. In this way, in five months we will cover all three hundred twenty towns throughout Taiwan. Every town will have two workers remaining in the town to take care of the situation. This is six hundred forty people. The remaining three hundred sixty will return to the big cities to work with others in the community visitation. They will take every high-rise apartment as a &ldquo;town.&rdquo; In addition they will also move aggressively onto the campuses to gain the students.</p>
<p>This is the way we are taking. In five years we will spread a big net over the entire island of Taiwan, a net of the gospel, a net of truth, and a net of the church. After this, we will have another five years to evangelize all the small villages and communities. By that time, every year we will have college graduates who will join our full-time training. After their training they will either go to the towns to strengthen the testimony, spreading the gospel to the surrounding villages, or they will cooperate with the work in the cities to gospelize all the communities and campuses. By 1994 all the cities, towns, and villages will be saturated with the gospel, the truth, and the church. This is not a dream. It is something that can be realized.</p>
<p>Forty years ago the Lord brought us to Taiwan. He has blessed this government, and after forty years of hard work, Taiwan has reached a state of prosperity. Communication is well developed, the standard of living is high, the educational level is excellent, and people&rsquo;s hearts are open to the gospel. Many brothers and sisters occupy top positions in various areas of society. This is the Lord&rsquo;s doing. He has done this for the gospel&rsquo;s sake. We must cooperate with the Lord&rsquo;s work and reach the three goals in our evangelizing work&mdash;to gain the communities in the big cities, to gain the towns and villages, and to gain the campuses.</p>
<p>According to statistics, there are more than forty thousand saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in Taiwan. Of those, more than eighteen thousand meet regularly. If all these eighteen thousand saints rise up and consecrate themselves to function in an organic way, the dormant ones will follow. Everyone will be driven to pray, and everyone will offer himself to take advantage of the golden opportunity that the Lord has provided us. To gospelize Taiwan in five years will be light and easy. With such a situation before us, I hope that we will be wise and do everything to cooperate with the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FINANCIAL NEED</h2>
<p>At present, although the amount we give to the full-timers is small, the total sum is sizeable. Every month the church in Taipei needs seven hundred fifty thousand dollars. For the whole island, the total is $1.82 million. In addition to this, there is the need of building the big meeting hall. Our present total offering per month for the entire island is about twelve million. In order to cooperate with the five-year plan of gospelizing Taiwan, and in order to produce more full-timers to meet His need and to have enough support to sustain them, there is the need for more brothers and sisters to give materially to the Lord in a more faithful way.</p>
<p>Prayer: Lord, what a glory that at this crucial time and place we have a part in such an economical move of this age&mdash;the move of evangelizing Taiwan in five years! Lord, thank You that You have chosen us to be the crucial persons. We all say Amen to this move. This is the King&rsquo;s business. This is a move from the throne. We will all rise up to join Calvary&rsquo;s host. Lord, we know for certain that this is not a dream or empty talk. It is our glorious future. You will help us to reach this goal. We say Hallelujah to this glorious and victorious move!</p>
