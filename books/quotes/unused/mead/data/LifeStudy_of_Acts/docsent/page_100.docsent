   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Antioch and Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 10:1 11:18 Luke records the spread of the gospel to the Gentiles through Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 11:19 the record goes on to tell us that those who were scattered by the tribulation that took place over Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here we see that the migration from Jerusalem went as far as Antioch, where there was a church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church at Antioch, therefore, was produced through Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to trace this matter in the record in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the account concerning those in Antioch was heard in the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem, they sent Barnabas to go as far as Antioch 11:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Barnabas was sent out to visit the churches in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 11:19 we see that the scattered saints spoke the word only to Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But when some of these saints came to Antioch, they spoke also to the Greeks v. 20 . This is a hint that the trend of the Lord s spreading was toward the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Luke s record not only shows the tendency of the Lord s spread toward the Gentiles, but also reveals how Saul was produced as the vessel to carry out God s ministry in the Gentile world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Saul was produced through Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was not a new start apart from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jerusalem s migration reached Antioch, and a church was raised up in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then Jerusalem sent out Barnabas as an authoritative representative.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When he saw the grace of God, he rejoiced.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was happy with the marvelous situation of the church in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, Barnabas realized that there was still a particular need the need of ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The scattered saints had gone to Antioch for the raising up of a church, yet among them there was a shortage of ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because of this, Barnabas went away to Tarsus to hunt for Saul 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Barnabas found Saul, he brought him to Antioch, and for a whole year they were gathered in the church and taught a considerable number v. 26 . This was part of the initiation of Saul s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During a time of great famine, the saints in Jerusalem and Judea were in need.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Material help was sent from the church at Antioch to those in Judea through Barnabas and Saul 11:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we have pointed out, this indicates that through Barnabas Saul was brought into the service among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Step by step the Lord brought in Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No doubt, he was welcomed in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After fulfilling their responsibility, Barnabas and Saul returned to Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Keeping the Oneness of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By the time Barnabas and Saul returned to Antioch, Saul had been fully prepared as a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was a product through Jerusalem, for he had been prepared by God through Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have emphasized the fact that with Saul we do not have a new start apart from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We stress this matter because it is something the Lord did sovereignly and wisely in order to keep the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One Stream</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the booklet entitled The Divine Stream we pointed out that there is only one stream in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This stream started from Jerusalem and flowed through Samaria to Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From Antioch the stream turned to Asia Minor and then to Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord did not have two streams, one starting from Jerusalem through Peter and another starting in the Gentile world through Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No, the Lord had only one stream, the stream that started from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord knew that there was the need of a particular vessel, a new vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Peter was not qualified to be this vessel, and Peter could not replace this vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord did all things wisely and sovereignly to put Saul, His chosen vessel, into the proper relationship with the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we have pointed out, Saul was actually produced through Jerusalem.</S>
