   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SEED OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How did the Lord Jesus begin the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some people have the concept that Christ began the church life with teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No, He did not do that.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus began the church life by sowing Himself into man as the seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church life simply comes out of this very seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus came to sow Himself into us, and this seed of life brings forth the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Matthew 13:3 says, "Behold, a sower went forth to sow."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus came, not as a teacher to begin the church life by teaching, but as a sower, sowing Himself as the seed of life into the fallen race.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is from this seed that something springs forth as the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Apostle Paul says, "I have planted, Apollos watered" 1 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not imagine that Paul went simply to preach and Apollos came to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No, Paul planted and Apollos watered.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Both planting and watering are for the growth of life, which issues from the seed which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I like these three words: sowing, planting, and watering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What the local church mostly needs is not teaching, but planting and watering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do need to be watered that we may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Teaching does not help us to grow, but watering does.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why it is rather difficult for anyone to see a real church life on the earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is simply because of the lack of planting and watering among the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Teaching alone kills and divides, but watering helps the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Corinthians 3 speaks of the church being planted and watered and also mentions something more.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It says that we are not only the husbandry of God, but also God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The husbandry requires the growth, and the building requires the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How can we be built up?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we want a solid church life with a group of believers built up in a solid way, we must minister Christ as life so that everyone will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First Corinthians 3 speaks of the growth and the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is by growth that we can be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Peter 1:23 tells us that we were all born of the incorruptible seed which is Christ, the living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ has sown Himself into us as this seed, and out of this seed we are born.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After we are born, as newborn babes, we need the milk of the Word that we may grow into salvation 1 Peter 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to be saved from so many things, and this kind of salvation can only be realized by growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This corresponds with Romans 5:10, which tells us that we must be saved by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is by growth in life that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need milk, not knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The newborn babes need to drink of the milk that they may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then 1 Peter 2 continues by saying that as we grow, we become the living stones to be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more we grow, the more we grow together.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more we grow, the more we grow into one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more we grow, the more we grow into a building.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are built up together by growth, not by being organized or taught.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is all by growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Wherever we go, we must not try to adjust others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let them be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not try to correct and change them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What they need is to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even if you can adjust and correct them, it means nothing, for there is still no growth in life.</S>
