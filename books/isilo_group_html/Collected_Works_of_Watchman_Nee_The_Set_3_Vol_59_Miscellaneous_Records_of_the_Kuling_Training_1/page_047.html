We did not follow any order in our discussion. Yesterday we spoke of a few examples in the Old Testament related to rebellion against authority. Today I would like to point out one basic principle of authority. This principle is stated as follows: No authority has its origin apart from God. All authorities are from God and are appointed by God. God has ordained His system of authority in the universe, and more particularly, in this world, for the purpose that this system would manifest His authority. We must realize that every authority within this system is ordained by God and is of God.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD ORDAINING A SYSTEM<br />OF AUTHORITY IN THE UNIVERSE</h2><p>Although we have said this before, we will repeat it today. God controls and rules over the entire universe (including the physical world) with authority. He runs the universe according to the principle of authority. If we trace authority in this universe to its highest source, we will find God Himself. As we ascend level after level on the ladder of authority, we reach the peak which is God's own authority. Yesterday I said that it is rare for a man to receive direct commandments from God. It is rare to find God's authority directly acting on a person. Most of the time His authority is expressed through those who are charged and commissioned by Him to be deputy authorities. God has ordained certain men, systems, or organizations as His authority. Such deputy authorities are commissioned and ordained by God. Yesterday we also said that a command from a deputy authority deserves as much attention as a direct command from God. All authorities are from God. Therefore, direct authority and deputy (i.e., indirect) authority are equally important. Only the foolish vinedressers demanded the personal appearance of the master. They did not consider the coming of the prophets to be sufficient. Even the son of the master was not good enough for them. This is the reason they killed the prophets one by one. In the end, when the son did come, they did not obey him, but killed him as well. Finally, the master himself had to come to deal with the situation (Matt. 21:33-41). This is the story of the foolish vinedressers. Only a foolish person would say that deputy authority cannot be considered as authority.</p><p>God created the universe with His word. He spoke, and it was done. God did not have to resort to any special means; He did not have to depend on any special kind of power. When He said, "Let there be light," there was light. Once He says something, it is done. This is the basic principle of God's creation of the universe. After creating all things, God instituted many natural laws to rule over the universe. Every object is ruled by some kind of natural law. On the one hand, God established these natural laws. On the other hand, He upholds all things by the word of His power (Heb. 1:3). Therefore, we can say that God rules the entire universe by His authority. The entire universe is upheld by the operation of natural laws; there is no exception. These natural laws continuously operate. This principle applies not only to the natural realm but also to the supernatural realm (i.e., the spiritual realm). God rules over everything in the spiritual realm with His authority. God created the cherubim, the angels, and the twenty-four elders. There are also the gods spoken of in Psalm 82. They are the deputy authorities appointed by God in the universe. Every authority has his own rank in God's ordering. Unfortunately, one of the cherubim fell. Lucifer fell because of his ambition to set up his own throne to make himself equal with God. He wanted to overthrow God's authority and to build up his own authority, but he fell. One-third of the angels followed him as a result of his fall. They became the powers of darkness today. The head of this dark force is the fallen one, Satan.</p><p>In His re-creation, God created man on the sixth day and placed him under His authority. Man is different from other creatures. God entrusted man with authority and assigned him to rule over the earth and to dress and keep it. He put the fowls of the air, the fish of the sea, and the beasts and creeping things of the earth under man's dominion. All living creatures on earth are under man's authority. God commanded man not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because he would die in the day that he ate of it. Whoever ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil would die; this was a fact. This command also signifies authority. It was not a threat of God. (God wanted man to receive the knowledge of good and evil directly from Him. But when man fell, good and evil became something within him.) God forbade man to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This was a command, and it related to authority. Eve was tempted to eat of the fruit. In her rebellion she took the fruit and ate it. As a result, she committed the sin of rebellion. Paul said in 1 Timothy that Adam came first in God's creation, and Eve followed. For this reason the woman should submit, but Eve did not submit. She was tempted, and she fell (Gen. 3:12-13). Paul saw authority in the order of creation. In reading Genesis we find that Eve took the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil when she ignored God's command. She did not ask her husband first. Instead, she stretched out her hand and took the fruit. In reality, when Eve stretched out her hand, she was stretching out her head. Eve's action signified her rebellion against God's established institution on this earth; she did not submit to Adam. If a man stretches out his hand without first checking with authority, in reality he is stretching out his own head. Satan tempted Eve to rebel against Adam. Today he is leading the whole world into rebellion.</p><p>To rebel against God's established institution is to rebel against God's authority. In earthly institutions those who come afterwards should submit to those who have come before. This is God's ordained order. Eve destroyed the order of authority. She ate of the fruit which God forbade. This shows that the relationship between God and man was broken. Man overturned God's authority, and the relationship between God and man was destroyed. Man took the same line as Satan when he overthrew God's authority. Satan fell because he wanted to make himself equal with God. When Satan tempted Eve to eat of the fruit, he told her that she would be like God if she ate of it. This was a temptation to uplift oneself to God's stature. It is according to Satan's principle of overturning God's authority. Satan wanted to usurp God's position. But he got into trouble with God's authority instead. Eve's sin brought her into conflict with human authority on the one hand and with God's authority on the other. She ate of the fruit, and Adam ate of it as well. Satan succeeded, and the line of authority between God and man was broken. Man did not check with God or inquire of Him. He contemplated, planned, and acted in himself. He failed to learn to inquire of Him or to act under His authority. Such an act annulled authority.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 59: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (1) &nbsp; pg 47</div><br></body></html>
