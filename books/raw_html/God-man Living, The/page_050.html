<h1 class="title">THE FIRST GOD-MAN&rsquo;S LIVING<br />
A MAN OF PRAYER</h1>
<h1 class="title">(6)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 15:36-39; 17:19-21; 18:15-22; 19:13-15</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman" start="2">
<li>The divine facts in the mystical human life of the first God-man in the record of the synoptic Gospels concerning the first God-man as the King-Savior in the kingdom of the heavens, the Slave-Savior in God&rsquo;s gospel service, and the Man-Savior in God&rsquo;s salvation:
	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="6">
	<li>In the performing of the miracle of feeding four thousand people with seven loaves and a few small fish (Matt. 15:36-39), He trained His disciples again to learn from Him that:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Before performing the miracle, He gave thanks (Matt. 15:36), indicating that:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>He honored His Father as the source of the supply of the people&rsquo;s necessities, standing on the position of One sent by His Father.</li>
			<li>He trained His disciples to give thanks to God the Father for their necessities and in everything (1 Thes. 5:18; Eph. 5:20).</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>After performing the miracle, He left the crowd and went to the borders of Magadan (Matt. 15:39), indicating that He would not remain in the issue of the miracle with the crowd for the enjoyment of their appreciation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In answering His disciples&rsquo; question concerning why they were not able to cast out a demon (17:19-21), He trained them that:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>They should pray with faith&mdash;v. 20.</li>
		<li>They should also pray with fasting&mdash;v. 21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In dealing with one who is disobedient to the church (18:15-22), He trained His disciples:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To bind the disobedient one with their heavenly authority by two or three of them meeting together to pray for the disobedient one in harmony&mdash;vv. 18-20.</li>
		<li>To forgive the offending one (this might indicate the disobedient one) up to seventy times seven times&mdash;vv. 21-22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When people brought their children to Him that He might lay His hands on them and pray but His disciples rebuked them (19:13-15), He trained them:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By correcting them not to prevent the little children but to allow them to come to Him, indicating that the kingdom of the heavens is of such&mdash;v. 14.</li>
		<li>By laying His hands on the little children&mdash; v. 15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
