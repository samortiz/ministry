   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN CONCERNING THE WAY OF LIFE OPEN TALKS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:Evening, January 15, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Tonight, first of all, we will make an announcement regarding the nature of this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this meeting, we hope to discuss the problems we face in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, we do not want to be loose; on the other hand, we do not want to be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We will only talk about problems related to the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Anything apart from the way of life will not be discussed here.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE LEADING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>AND THE PROVISION IN THE ENVIRONMENT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Question: I know that as long as I have the peace within, I can proceed with what I want to do.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But do I also have to wait for the proper provision in the environment?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Lee answered: Terms such as "provision in the environment" and the "leading of the Holy Spirit" have all been used in a loose way in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, we do not like to use these terms.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who truly know God will not question about provisions in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If there is a leading within them to do something, they can ignore all favorable or unfavorable environments.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes a favorable environment will turn out to be a frustration to God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Bible, you find very few cases of people getting clear about God's will through going along with environmental provisions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The most important thing is the heart, and not the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's leadings for Christians are all in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a person is right before the Lord, almost everything he does is right.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From Paul's life we can see that his environments were mostly contradicting ones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Acts 16, we see that he wanted to go to a certain place, but the Holy Spirit forbade him to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In his spirit he realized that it was God's forbidding.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He did not act according to the provision in the environment, but according to the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not think that God's leading will direct us to success.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is not for our being successful or failing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The main thing He is doing is to testify of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes we do not have to be too clear about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we are too clear, we may end up being wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There was a brother who told me once that he had prayed and was clear that God wanted him to go home and give his wife a good beating.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This kind of leading is not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The relationship between the leading of the Holy Spirit and the provision in the environment can be illustrated by the riding of a bicycle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, we need to tread the pedal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the other hand, we need the brake.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to aggressively follow the leading of the Holy Spirit, but at the same time we also need to accept the limitations in the environment.</S>
