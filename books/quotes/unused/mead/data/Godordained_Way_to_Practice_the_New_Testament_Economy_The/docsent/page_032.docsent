   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEADING AND PROMOTING EACH ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE ATTENDANTS TO LEARN TO TAKE PART</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE ACTIVITIES IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to lead and promote each one of the attendants in the home meetings to learn to take part in the activities in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to take the lead, but we should not do everything for everybody.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the new ones in the home meetings follow our lead, we need to promote.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not say to the new believers, Let us sing Hymn #49.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not call a hymn, but it is good to say, May we sing a hymn?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When they say yes, we should ask, Who will select the hymn? or What number would you like to sing?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let them select and call the hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you do everything in the first few meetings with the new believers, they will consider you as a pastor who goes to their home to conduct a worship service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not say, Please let us read John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you feel that it is the right time to read some verses, propose this matter to them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You should say, Would you like to read some verses?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When they respond that they would, you should not say, Let us read John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ask them what they would like to read.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They may want to read the last verse of Revelation 22.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not say to them, Let s not read that verse because it does not suit today s meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Say Amen to what they want to do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Let them read the verse they choose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By doing this, you will be practicing to promote each one of them to learn to take part in the activities in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may have a burden to read John 3:16, but it is better to drop the reading of this verse and let the new ones decide what to read.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The environment may indicate that your burden for this verse was not of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If it was of the Lord, someone would surely say, Let us read John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You have to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You have to believe that the Lord is moving in the reading of the verses.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not make up your mind to read certain verses in a definite and sure way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Leave the entire meeting in the hand of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You may feel that to conduct the home meeting in this way is to make the meeting a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But it is not bad to have a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am a person who likes to have everything in order, but when three of my grandchildren come to visit me, they make a mess of things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When they come to my house, they may get into mischief, but I am always pleased to see them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they do not come back after a period of time, I miss them and expect them to come back again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I believe that my heart toward my grandchildren is somewhat like God s heart toward the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If my little grandsons were trembling and fearful of offending me when they came to my house, that would not make me happy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When they are so energetic and full of life, my wife and I are happy and full of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Most grandparents like to have their grandchildren come to bother them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My grandchildren s bothering is quite pleasant to me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God also needs some enjoyment and happiness from His children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our God is not only divine but also very human.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He partook of the human nature, and He likes to receive the human worship.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must worship God according to His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The religious way to meet of Christianity puts aside God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It makes everything formal, scheduled, and dead.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christianity is full of formalities.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus did not meet with people in that way when He was on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to lead the attendants into the practice of selecting hymns, singing hymns, praying, reading and pray-reading the holy Word, giving testimonies, and fellowshipping one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By leading the attendants into such a practice, we will set a good example for them to follow and copy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not give orders but make suggestions to the attendants that they may learn to take the initiative in the activities in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Let the new ones do things and let them take the initiative in all the activities in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>FUNCTIONING AS ONE AMONG THE ATTENDANTS</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should also take the chance to give words of life supply occasionally, not as a pastor, a preacher, or a teacher, but as one of the attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not make ourselves another class of people in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Finally, we need to take the chance to pray and to call a hymn at the right juncture as one among the attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to take the fellowship in this chapter and put it into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then we will have good home meetings according to the heart s desire of our God and of our Lord Jesus.</S>
