<p>In Romans 7 and 8 there are four laws. The law of God is the outward law written in letters (7:22). The law of good is in our natural being represented by our mind. In our mind is a law that always tries to do good and this is the law of good (7:23). Also, the law of sin is in our members (7:23). When a person wants to do good, there is another law, the law of sin, that defeats him and captures him. Lastly, Romans 8:2 refers to the law of the Spirit of life.</p>
<p>The first law is the law of God, the Mosaic law. The second law is the law of good which is a kind of natural law of mankind. Mankind was created according to God, and because God is good, there is a natural law within man always trying to do good. The third law is called the law of sin, and sin is the very embodiment of Satan. The law of sin may be called a satanic law. The fourth law is called the law of the Spirit of life. This is the divine law because the very Spirit is also the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God in contrast to Sin, which is the embodiment of Satan. The law of sin is satanic and the law of the Spirit of life is divine. The four laws are the Mosaic law, the natural law of the human being, the satanic law, and the divine law.</p>
<p>Furthermore, every life is a law. The satanic life is the satanic law, the divine life is the divine law, and the natural life is the natural law. As a believer in Christ we are also a created person. As a created person, within our being we have the natural law. We became fallen and received the satanic life and nature into our being and with this satanic life is the satanic law. Then we got saved and we received the divine life with the divine law. Therefore, in Romans 7 and 8 we see four laws and three lives.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD DISPENSING HIMSELF<br />
INTO THE TRIPARTITE MAN</h2>
<p>Our God is the Triune God who has passed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Now He is the all-inclusive Spirit to be the divine life for our participation, experience, and enjoyment. First, He dispenses Himself into our spirit, the center of our being (8:10). From the center, He spreads into our mind and saturates it with life (8:6). Then He extends into our mortal body and thereby makes our whole tripartite being life (8:11). In this way we become men of life in all three parts of our being. This is the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONFORMATION OF THE BROTHERS<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S FIRSTBORN SON INTO HIS IMAGE</h2>
<p>Romans 8:29 and 30 say, &ldquo;Because whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers; and whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.&rdquo; This particular crucial point is fully and adequately covered in the Life-study Messages. You have to go to the Life-study Messages to labor on this crucial point.</p>
<p>Along with this crucial point, you need to study the first-fruit of the Spirit (8:23). The firstfruit of the Spirit simply denotes that the Spirit has been given to us as a first taste, a foretaste, of our eternal inheritance, which is the very processed Triune God. In the New Testament we have received an inheritance. The Spirit is given to us as a foretaste of the full taste of this inheritance, which is the Triune God Himself given to us for our enjoyment. This Spirit who was given to us as a foretaste of our divine inheritance is called the firstfruit of the Spirit. The firstfruit of the Spirit means that the firstfruit is the Spirit. In any kind of harvest the firstfruit is a foretaste of the full taste of the harvest. For us, the many brothers of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, to be conformed to His image, we need to enjoy the Spirit as the firstfruit. The firstfruit of the Spirit as the foretaste of the divine enjoyment is the very element for our conformation into the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son.</p>
<p>The issue of the enjoyment of the Spirit as the foretaste is the redemption of our body, which is the full sonship. The firstfruit of the Spirit and the redemption of our body, the full sonship, are both in 8:23&mdash;&ldquo;And not only so, but we ourselves also, having the firstfruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body.&rdquo; As we are enjoying the Spirit as the foretaste we are still groaning for and eagerly expecting sonship. The sonship in this verse is the consummation of the sonship, not the initiation of the sonship as in Galatians 4:5. The full sonship is the redemption of our body. We have received the sonship already, but we will not receive the full sonship until our body is transfigured or conformed to the glorious body of Christ (Phil. 3:21). The full sonship is the redemption of our body, which is also the transfiguration of our body.</p>
<p>Romans 8:18 says, &ldquo;For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed to us.&rdquo; Romans 8:30 tells us, &ldquo;And whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.&rdquo; To glorify is to bring us into the coming glory. This will not be done outside of us objectively, but this is being done right now inside of us subjectively. The work of transformation is a process to bring us into glorification, the upcoming glory. The consummation of transformation is conformation; transformation results in conformation, and conformation issues from transformation. Also, conformation equals glorification.</p>
<p>Romans 8:19 says, &ldquo;For the anxious watching of the creation eagerly expects the revelation of the sons of God.&rdquo; The revelation of the sons of God is in the full sonship. Someday we sons of God will be revealed to the entire universe, especially to the angels and mankind and the demons. That revelation of the sons of God is the full sonship in glorification. Romans 8:20 and 21 say, &ldquo;For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.&rdquo; The creation will not participate in the glory, but they will enjoy the freedom of the glory. Today all the creation is under slavery. When our full sonship comes, we will be glorified and that glory will set the entire creation free from the bondage of slavery.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 06: The Crucial Points of Truth in Paul's Epistles &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
