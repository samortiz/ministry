   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How can we overcome the accusations of Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The voice from heaven tells us, "They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The blood is the basis of victory, and it is the instrument to overcome Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He may accuse us, but we can answer that the blood of Jesus Christ, God's Son, cleanses us from every sin 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Every sin" means any sin, whether it is great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The blood of God's Son cleanses us from all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Satan may tell us that we are wrong, but we have the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The blood of the Lord Jesus can cleanse us of our many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The blood of Jesus, God's Son, cleanses us from every sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must not only reject the accusations which are without cause, but we must also reject all the accusations which have cause.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When God's children have done something wrong, we need only the blood of Jesus, His Son, not the accusations of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The precious blood is needed for sin, not accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's Word never speaks of the need for accusation after we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The only problem is whether or not we have confessed our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we have confessed, then what more can be said?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we have sinned and do not confess, then we deserve to be accused.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But where there is no sin, there is no cause for accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we have sinned and have confessed, we should not be accused.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you have sinned, you can bow and confess to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Immediately the blood of the Lord Jesus will cleanse you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not think that you will be a little more holy if you consider how sinful you are, or that you will be more holy if you have more feeling toward your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No. You only must ask yourself one thing: How do I treat the blood of the Lord Jesus? We have sinned, but His blood cleanses us from every sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"Every sin" means great sin or small sin, recollected sin or forgotten sin, visible sin or invisible sin, sin which we think can be forgiven and sin which we do not think can be forgiven every kind is included in "every."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The blood of Jesus, God's Son, does not wash us of one or two sins, or even many sins, but it cleanses us from every sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We admit that we have sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not say that we are without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But regardless of this, we do not accept the accusations of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before God we are clean because we have the precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not believe in the accusations more than we believe in the precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we commit sin, we do not glorify God, but when we do not trust the precious blood, we dishonor Him even more.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is a shameful thing to sin, but not to believe in the precious blood is even more shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must learn to trust in the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Romans 5:9 says, "...having now been justified in His blood."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When many people come into the Lord's presence, they have no peace in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They also have a feeling of worthlessness and of being wrong within.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is because they have a false hope.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They expect that they will have something positive in themselves to offer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When they discover that they do not have anything positive to offer in themselves, the accusations come.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>An accusation is like this: "A person like you will never have anything good to offer to God."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But we must remember that we originally possessed no positive goodness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There was nothing good in ourselves that we could offer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We could only present one thing to Him the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We could only be justified by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We do not have any positive righteousness in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We become righteous only because of the righteousness which we receive through redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every time we come to the throne of grace, we can look to Him for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is a throne of grace, not a throne of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every time we come before God, our only qualification is that we have been redeemed, not that we have advanced in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No Christian can ever reach the stage where he can say, "I have been doing pretty well recently; now I have the boldness to pray."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No. Every time we come before God, our only ground, our only position, is based upon the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must realize that no amount of spiritual growth can substitute for the effectiveness of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not one spiritual experience can ever replace the work of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even if someone should become as spiritual as the apostle Paul, the apostle John, or the apostle Peter, he would still need the blood to stand before God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sometimes when we have sinned, Satan comes to accuse us, and sometimes when we have not sinned, Satan still comes to accuse us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sometimes it is not a problem of whether or not we have sinned, but a problem of not having a positive righteousness to offer to God; so Satan accuses us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, we must be clear: We can come into God's presence only because of the blood, not because of anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since we have been cleansed by the blood and justified by the blood, we are under no obligation whatsoever to accept the accusations of Satan.</S>
