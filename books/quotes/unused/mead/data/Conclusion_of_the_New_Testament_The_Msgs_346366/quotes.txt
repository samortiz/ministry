[1]  If we apply this key to every verse and phrase in the book, we will see that Paul s concern here is nothing other than the experience of Christ.
[2]  3:10; 1 Sam 10:6 ; as the Holy Spirit, in relation to the conception and birth of Christ Luke 1:35; Matt 1:20 ; as the Spirit of Jesus, in relation to the Lord s human living Acts 16:7 ; as the Spirit of Christ, in relation to the Lord s resurrection Rom 8:9 ; and here as the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[3]  The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is for us to live Christ.
[4]  In Philippians 1:19 Paul says, I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[5]  Salvation in this verse means to be sustained and strengthened to live and magnify Christ; this requires the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[6]  The circumstances in which Paul found himself forced him to experience and enjoy Christ in a fuller way through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[7]  Paul s circumstances encouraged him to live Christ and to magnify Christ.
[8]  Living Christ also includes tasting Christ for growing in Him 1 Pet 2:2-3 and enjoying Christ as the God-allotted portion and participating in His riches in the fellowship of God Col 1:12 .
[9]  To live Christ by the divine life of Christ in resurrection is to have Christ grow in us so that we may be conformed to the image of Christ as the Firstborn among many brothers Gal 4:19; Rom 8:29b .
[10]  It is by such a bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ that the seekers of Christ, as His overcomers in the consummation of this age, live Him for His magnification in the New Testament economy of God for the producing and building up of the organic Body of Christ as the counterpart of the consummated Triune God, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as His eternal enlargement and expression for eternity.
[11]  Philippians 2 reveals that we may experience and enjoy Christ as our pattern.
[12]  In chapter 1 the central point is to magnify Christ, to live Christ vv.
[13]  Since our goal is to gain Christ, we should forsake all other things and pursue nothing but Christ.
[14]  2 On Account of the Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ
[15]  The excellency of the knowledge of Christ is derived from the excellency of His person.
[16]  The Jews consider the law of God given through Moses the most excellent thing in human history; hence, they are zealous for the law.
[17]  But when Christ was revealed to him by God Gal 1:15-16 , he saw that the excellency, the supereminence, the supreme preciousness, the surpassing worth, of Christ far exceeded the excellency of the law.
[18]  His knowledge of Christ issued in the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.
[19]  Since Christ is excellent, the knowledge of Christ is also excellent.
[20]  Christ is unlimited; hence, we need to have the excellency of the knowledge of the unlimited Christ, that is, to have a vision of the preciousness of Christ.
[21]  In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the goal of the believers pursuit.
[22]  Paul lived in a condition of having not his own righteousness but the righteousness that is out of God v. 9 , in order to know to experience Christ and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings.
[23]  Paul first received the revelation of Christ, then sought the experience of Christ to know and enjoy Christ in an experiential way.
[24]  Christ s sufferings are of two categories: those for accomplishing redemption, which were completed by Christ Himself, and those for producing and building the church, which need to be filled up by the apostles and the believers v. 24 . We cannot participate in Christ s suffering for redemption, but we must take part in the sufferings of Christ for the producing and building up of the Body cf.
[25]  In Philippians 3:10 Paul spoke of being conformed to His death.
[26]  This expression indicates that Paul desired to take Christ s death as the mold of his life.
[27]  The excellency of the knowledge of Christ, counting all things as loss, gaining Christ, being found in Him, knowing Him, knowing the power of His resurrection, and knowing the fellowship of His sufferings all issue in one thing being conformed to Christ s death.
[28]  Paul lived a crucified life continually, a life under the cross, just as Christ did in His human living.
[29]  Through such a life of being molded to Christ s death, Paul experienced and enjoyed the resurrection power of Christ.
[30]  The mold of Christ s death refers to Christ s experience of continually putting to death His human life that He might live by the life of God John 6:57 .
[31]  God has put us into the mold of Christ s death, and day by day God is molding us to conform us to this death Rom 6:3-4 .
[32]  If we put to death our natural life, we will have the consciousness that we have another life, the divine life, within us; this life will be released, and then in our experience we will be conformed to Christ s death John 10:10; 1 John 5:11-12 .
[33]  Second, if we are willing to be conformed to Christ s death, we will overcome the world and defeat Satan v. 31; Heb 2:14 . Third, by being conformed to His death, we experience Christ in His death for the release, impartation, and multiplication of life John 12:24-26; 2 Cor 4:12 . We need to be conformed to the death of Christ so that the divine life within us may be released and imparted into others and thereby multiplied.
[34]  Forgetting the Things Behind and Stretching Forward to the Things Before to Pursue toward the Goal
[35]  for the Prize of the High Calling of God in Him
[36]  Paul had experienced and gained Christ tremendously, yet he did not account of himself to have experienced Christ in full or to have gained Him to the uttermost.
[37]  In order to gain Christ to the fullest extent, Paul not only forsook his experiences in Judaism but also would not linger in his past experiences of Christ.
[38]  Whatever state we have attained to in our spiritual life, we all must walk, as the apostle did, by the same rule, in the same path; that is, we must pursue Christ, toward the goal that we may gain Christ to the fullest extent as the prize of the upward calling of God.
[39]  Philippians 1 through 3 reveals our progressive experience of Christ.
[40]  In chapter 1 to experience Christ is a matter of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[41]  No doubt, this is a matter of our experience of Christ as the Spirit of Jesus Christ in our spirit v. 19 . In chapter 2 our experience of Christ is a matter related to our mind.
[42]  Our experience of Christ in our body, that is, the transfiguration, the redemption, of our body, will be the consummation of the experience of Christ v. 21 . This will be the conformation of our natural body to the heavenly form of the body of Christ s glory.
[43]  The life which Paul lived in the experience of Christ was that of eagerly awaiting the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who would come from the heavens to transfigure his body of humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory.
[44]  He is the firstborn Son of God, and we will be conformed to His image to be the many full-grown sons of God, who are the many brothers of Christ and the members of the Body of Christ, the corporate expression of the Triune God v. 29; 12:4-5 .
[45]  Philippians presents marvelous aspects of Christ for our experience and enjoyment.
[46]  In chapter 1 Christ is the life for us to live, in chapter 2 Christ is the pattern for us to follow, and in chapter 3 Christ is the goal and the prize for us to pursue.
[47]  This indicates that in Christ as the motivating strength that empowers us all the time, we can do all the things that pertain to our experience of Christ as revealed in Philippians 4, including standing firm in Christ, rejoicing in Him always, letting the peace of God guard our hearts and thoughts in Christ, being content through Him as the secret, and having God fill our every need in Christ.
[48]  In verse 7 Paul goes on to say that the peace of God, which surpasses every man s understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.
[49]  The God of peace patrols or stands guard before our hearts and thoughts in Christ.
[50]  He then learned the secret of how to take Christ as life, how to live Christ, how to magnify Christ, how to gain Christ, and how to have the church life, all of which things are rudimentary principles.
[51]  The secret of the Body is to take Christ as our life, to live Christ, to pursue Christ, to gain Christ, to magnify Christ, and to express Christ.
[52]  e. Being Able to Do All Things in Him
[53]  In verse 13 we find a basic principle related to the apostle s secret of sufficiency in Christ: I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me.
[54]  In this verse we find the secret to which Paul refers in verse 12: The secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack.
[55]  Paul was a person in Christ 2 Cor 12:2 , and he desired to be found in Christ by others.
[56]  For us to be able to do all things in Christ who empowers us is to be satisfied in any circumstance through Christ who empowers us as the secret of our daily Christian life.
[57]  We need to realize that Paul s word about Christ as the empowering One specifically applies to Christ s empowering us to live Him as our human virtues and thereby to magnify Him in His unlimited greatness.
[58]  In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in Colossians.
[59]  God s will for us is that we know Christ, experience Christ, enjoy Christ, be saturated with Christ, and have Christ become our life and person.
[60]  As the portion of the saints, Christ is the Son of God s love, the kingdom of God is the kingdom of the Son of God s love, and in Christ we have redemption.
[61]  For Christ to be the Head of the Body, and for us, His believers, to be the members of His Body, God needed to deliver us out of the authority of darkness, the kingdom of Satan Matt 12:26 , and to transfer us into the kingdom of Christ, the kingdom of God s Beloved.
[62]  In verse 14 Paul continues, In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
[63]  The deliverance in verse 13 deals with Satan s authority over us by destroying his evil power, whereas the redemption in this verse deals with our sins by fulfilling God s righteous requirement.
[64]  Christ s death has accomplished redemption unto the forgiveness of our sins.
[65]  OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-THREE EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST
[66]  In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the portion of the saints.
[67]  Firstborn of all creation refers to Christ s preeminence in all creation, because from Colossians 1:15-18 the apostle stresses the first place that Christ has in all things.
[68]  This means that all things now subsist together in Christ, just as all the spokes of a wheel subsist together in the hub.
[69]  Christ is the hub of all things that exist in the universe; they all subsist together in Christ as the hub.
[70]  If we see this, we will realize that all material things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ and that they all subsist in Christ for the purpose that God may be expressed.
[71]  If the old creation is in Christ, through Christ, unto Christ and subsists together in Christ, so the new creation is all the more.
[72]  In the church we are in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ, and we subsist in Christ to be God s expression in Christ.
[73]  In Colossians 1:19, Paul tells us that in Christ all the fullness was pleased to dwell.
[74]  This fullness God Himself expressed was pleased to dwell in Christ, to reconcile us with Himself, and to present us to Himself.
[75]  Colossians 2:2-23 reveals that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the mystery of God.
[76]  In verse 2 Paul speaks of the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.
[77]  Moreover, as the mystery of God, the mysterious story of God, the all-inclusive Christ is the history of God; the whole story of God is in Christ and is Christ John 1:14; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rev 4:5 .
[78]  In Colossians 2:3 Paul says that in Christ all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.
[79]  In writing Colossians Paul was fighting against the Gnostic philosophy by declaring that Christ, as the totality of all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, is far better, higher, and more profound than the Gnostic philosophy.
[80]  Those who were influenced by such teaching considered themselves as having much wisdom and knowledge, but they spoke many things concerning God and Christ that were not according to the truth.
[81]  To walk is to live, to act, to behave, and to have our being; it implies everything in our daily living.
[82]  To walk in Christ is to live, move, act, and have our being in Christ.
[83]  Furthermore, to walk in Christ means not to have any substitute for Christ.
[84]  Now in His economy God has ordained that Christ, His Son, should accomplish redemption, bring man back to God, and then replace all the substitutes with Himself.
[85]  The various factors and elements of our human life are all replacements for Christ, but the factors and elements that have become substitutes for God must now be replaced by Christ.
[86]  In 2:7 Paul speaks of having been rooted in Christ.
[87]  As such, we have been rooted in Christ, our soil, our earth, that we may absorb all His riches as nourishment.
[88]  Having been rooted in Christ, we now are being built up in Him Col 2:7 .
[89]  Paul s words being built up in verse 7 do not directly refer to the building up of the Body of Christ.
[90]  Hence, the word bodily in verse 9 points to the physical body that Christ put on in His humanity, indicating that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ as One who has a human body.
[91]  On the one hand, Christ possesses all the fullness of the Godhead, for it dwells in Him bodily; on the other hand, this Christ, who is the Head of all rule and authority, is above all rule and authority, that is, above all the fallen angels occupying positions of power in the air in subordination to Satan v. 15 . Christ not only has the fullness of the Godhead but is also above all rule, authority, and power of Satan.
[92]  The Greek word translated full in verse 10 implies completion, perfection.
[93]  Because all the fullness dwells in Him, after we have been put into Christ 1 Cor 1:30 , we are made full, filled up, with all the divine riches.
[94]  In Christ we lack nothing, for in Him we have been perfected and completed.
[95]  Because all the fullness of the Godhead is in Christ and because we have been placed in Him, we have been made full in Him.
[96]  The New Testament reveals clearly that all those who believe in Christ have been put into Christ.
[97]  2 Christ Being the Head of All Rule and Authority
[98]  In 2:10 Paul indicates that the Christ in whom we have been made full is the Head of all rule and authority.
[99]  2 In the Putting Off of the Body of the Flesh
[100]  In verse 11 Paul speaks of the putting off of the body of the flesh.
[101]  The circumcision that took place by the death of Christ and is applied by the powerful Spirit accomplishes the putting off of the body of the flesh.
[102]  Paul s concept in Colossians 2 was that since the believers in Christ have been circumcised in the circumcision of Christ, which was accomplished by Christ s death and is applied by the Spirit, and since this is the circumcision in which they have been buried and terminated, there is absolutely no need for the practice of asceticism.
[103]  In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the mystery of God.
[104]  Everything that we do will remind us to contact Christ, to enjoy Christ, to experience Christ, and to have Christ as our everything.
[105]  g. The Head of the Body, out from Whom
[106]  All the Body Grows with the Growth of God
[107]  In 2:19 Paul speaks of holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God.
[108]  The heresy of angel worship distracted the believers in Colossae from holding Christ as the Head.
[109]  God s economy is to head up all things in Christ through His Body, the church, thereby making Christ the center of all things Eph 1:10, 22-23 .
[110]  When we live by our culture instead of by Christ, we separate ourselves from Christ as the Head and are defrauded of our prize, which is the enjoyment of Christ.
[111]  In Colossians 2:17 Paul says that the body, the reality, of all the shadows is of Christ, but in verse 19 he speaks not of Christ but of holding the Head.
[112]  The reason for the change in terminology from Christ to the Head is that our enjoyment of the Lord causes us to become conscious of the Body.
[113]  If we enjoy Christ continually, we will not continue to be individualistic.
[114]  This marvelous life, which is ours, is described in many wonderful aspects of Christ in the first two chapters of Colossians, such as the portion of the saints and the mystery of God 1:12; 2:2 .
[115]  Christ as the life of the saints is the highest enjoyment; no other enjoyment is superior to Christ as our life.
[116]  That Christ is our life is a strong indication that we are to take Him as life and live by Him, that we are to live Him in our daily life in order to experience the universally extensive Christ so that all He is and has attained and obtained will not remain objective but will become our subjective experience.
[117]  In Colossians 3:1 Paul tells us that Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.
[118]  Rather, we should seek the things which are in the heavens, such as knowing Christ as everything to us so that we may take Him as life and thereby walk in Him.
[119]  As those who have died with Christ from the things on the earth, especially to things related to asceticism, as those who have been baptized into His death Rom 6:3 and raised together with Christ, we should live in the heavens.
[120]  Because our life not our natural life but our spiritual life, which is Christ is hidden with Christ in God, who is in the heavens, we should no longer care for things on the earth.
[121]  As long as we are hidden, we are with Christ in God, in the heavens, and in the church, but when we advertise and promote ourselves, we are outside of Christ and are not with Him.
[122]  Our life is the Christ who dwells within us, and this life is hidden with Christ in God; the Christ hidden in God is typified by the manna hidden in the golden pot Rev 2:17 .
[123]  In Colossians 3:1 Paul says that since we were raised together with Christ, we should seek the things which are above.
[124]  This verse indicates clearly that we have one position with Christ.
[125]  In Romans 8:19 we are told that the creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the sons of God, at which time it will be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God v. 21 . When we appear with our Christ in glory, even our vile body will be transfigured into a glorious body, but as we await that wonderful day, we must remain hidden with Christ in God, in the heavens, and in the church.
[126]  In this message, we will continue to consider Christ as the life of the saints.
[127]  On the one hand, Paul speaks of the creation of the new man Eph 4:24 ; on the other hand, he refers to the renewing of the new man Col 3:10 .
[128]  Since the new man has already been created, why is there still the need for the new man to be renewed?
[129]  In 3:11 Paul goes on to say, Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.
[130]  We must be permeated with Christ, saturated with Christ, and have Christ organically wrought into our being.
[131]  In verse 11 Paul says not only that Christ is all but also that He is in all.
[132]  In other words, on the one hand, Christ is all the members, and on the other hand, He is in all the members.
[133]  Since Paul says that Christ is all, why is there the need for him to say that Christ is in all?
[134]  If Paul did not say that Christ is in all, only that He is all, then we may think that in the new man Christ is needed and that we are not needed.
[135]  When we take Christ as our life and live together with Him, seeking the things which are above, we have the sense deep within that we are one with Christ and that Christ is us Gal 2:20 .
[136]  To say that Christ is all and in all in the new man indicates that we are one with Christ and that Christ is one with us.
[137]  In the Epistles of 1 Thessalonians through Philemon, we see the experience and enjoyment of Christ in many practical points concerning our Christian walk.
[138]  One aspect of our hope, which we may call the hope of the church, is the coming Christ, that is, Christ in His coming.
[139]  The coming of Christ is our incentive to work for Him by fostering the believers unto maturity so that they may be our hope, joy, crown, and glory at His coming.
[140]  The hope of Christ s coming is our comfort concerning the dead in Him.
[141]  According to 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, the hope of Christ s coming comforts us concerning the dead in Christ, in order that we would not sorrow or lose heart but instead believe that all the dead ones will be raised up to meet the Lord with us in the air on the day of His coming.
[142]  In 1 Thessalonians 5:1-11 Paul indicates that the coming Christ is the cause of our watchfulness.
[143]  We have a wonderful hope, a hope that the Lord Jesus will come back and that we will be raptured to Him.
[144]  In this message we will continue to consider our experience and enjoyment of Christ in His coming as the hope of the church.
[145]  First Thessalonians 5:23 says, The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[146]  God sanctifies us, first, by taking possession of our spirit through regeneration John 3:5-6 ; second, by spreading Himself as the life-giving Spirit from our spirit into our soul to saturate and transform our soul Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 3:18 ; and last, by enlivening our mortal body through our soul Rom 8:11, 13 and transfiguring our body by His life power Phil 3:21 .
[147]  God not only has made us holy in position by the redeeming blood of Christ to separate us unto Himself in His judicial redemption; He also is sanctifying us in disposition by His own holy nature to saturate us with Himself in His organic salvation Heb 13:12; 10:29; Rom 6:19, 22; Eph 5:26 .
[148]  In order for our soul to be sanctified, our mind must be renewed to be the mind of Christ 12:2 , our emotion must be touched and saturated with the love of Christ Eph 3:17, 19 , our will must be subdued by and infused with the resurrected Christ Phil 2:13; cf.
[149]  Then our body will even become a member of Christ 1 Cor 6:15 so that we may live Christ, express Christ, and magnify Christ Phil 1:20 .
[150]  Christ in His coming is the incentive of our suffering for Him.
[151]  In 2 Thessalonians 1:7 Paul says, To you who are being afflicted, rest with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of His power, in flaming fire.
[152]  In 1 Timothy 3:15-16 Christ is presented as God manifested in the flesh.
[153]  First Timothy 3:15-16 indicates that not only Christ Himself as the Head is the manifestation of God in the flesh but also that the church as the Body of Christ and the house of God is the manifestation of God in the flesh the mystery of godliness.
[154]  The incarnated Christ in His human living was not only justified as the Son of God by the Spirit Matt 3:16-17; Rom 1:3-4 but was also vindicated, proved, and approved as right and righteous by the Spirit Matt 3:15-16; 4:1 .
[155]  Paul concludes 1 Timothy 3:16 with the phrase taken up in glory.
[156]  This refers to Christ s ascension into glory Mark 16:19; Acts 1:9-11; 2:33; Phil 2:9 .
[157]  According to the sequence of historical events, Christ s ascension preceded His being preached among the nations.
[158]  However, it is listed here as the last step in Christ s being the manifestation of God in the flesh.
[159]  When a church is well taken care of according to the instructions given in the first two chapters of 1 Timothy, with the oversight of the elders and the service of the deacons fully established, as revealed in chapter 3, the church will function as the house and household of the living God for His move on the earth, and as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world.
[160]  The truth borne by the church is the Triune God, having Christ as the embodiment, center, and expression, to produce the church as the Body of Christ, the house of God, and the kingdom of God Col 2:9; Eph 1:22-23; 4:16; 1 Tim 3:15; John 3:3, 5 .
[161]  In 2 Timothy 1 we see that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the One who brought life and incorruption to light in order that we might know life and incorruption.
[162]  It is through the gospel that Christ brought life and incorruption to light v. 10 . While we may know life and incorruption, the unbelievers know only death and corruption because they have not yet heard or received the gospel.
[163]  In verses 9 and 10 Paul tells us that the grace of God, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages, now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus.
[164]  Christ brought life and incorruption to light to fulfill the promise of life for a believer to be an apostle.
[165]  Second Timothy 1:1 speaks of Paul as an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God according to the promise of life, which is in Christ Jesus.
[166]  This verse indicates that Paul became an apostle not only through the will of God but also according to the promise of life, which is in Christ Jesus.
[167]  The unique way for sinners to escape God s judgment and obtain God s eternal salvation is to believe in God s embodiment, Christ, that they may become righteous and be justified in order to have life and live John 3:16-18 .
[168]  This passage reveals that Christ is the seed of David, raised from the dead v. 8 for the salvation of God s chosen people with eternal glory v. 10 , and that Paul, His servant, was empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.
[169]  Through the centuries there have been two schools of interpretation regarding this remarkable, marvelous, and excellent sacred and divine title: 1 that two persons are indicated, God and Christ; 2 that there is but one person, Jesus Christ being our great God and Savior, the deity of Christ thus being asserted.
[170]  In Titus 3:5-7 we see that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the means of the pouring out of the Holy Spirit.
[171]  Verse 6 says that God poured out the Holy Spirit upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior.
[172]  The Holy Spirit, who is the Triune God reaching man, has been not only given to us but poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior, to impart to us all the divine riches in Christ, including God s eternal life and His divine nature, as an eternal portion for us to enjoy.
[173]  Furthermore, we need to put on the new man, that is, to apply what Christ has accomplished in creating the new man, by living and magnifying Christ through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19-21 .
[174]  c.In Order That Having Been Justified by His Grace,We Might Become Heirs
[175]  In 3:7 Paul goes on to say, In order that having been justified by His grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
[176]  This verse speaks forth the issue and goal of God s salvation v. 5 and justification v. 7 , which include the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit vv.
