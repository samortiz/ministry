   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Another manifestation of our fallen situation is our politeness, in the sense of being a kind of politics.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>That is actually falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You may say that to be polite is to be nice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But you need to be saved from being so nice.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The wild people need to be saved from being wild.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The nice people need to be saved from being nice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then we may wonder whether we should be wild or nice.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But whether we are wild or nice, we are still fallen.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some people are naturally emotional.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Generally speaking, the northern people from the cold region are rather conservative.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When they are happy, they are happy within.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is really hard for us to know that they are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are hiddenly and conservatively happy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the southerners from the tropical zone are more emotional and easily excited.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Maybe they are not that happy, yet they express themselves as being very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The northerners need to be saved from their being conservative and the southerners need to be saved from their being excited.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They both need to be saved in Christ's life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is not so conservative or so excited.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The southerners need to be cooled down a little bit by Christ being life to them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the Lord fed the five thousand with five loaves and two fish, He was very calm.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not jump up and say, "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The disciples may have been excited, but the Lord Jesus was calm and told them to pick up all the fragments and put them into baskets Matt 14:14-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ as life to us saves us from what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you are slow, Christ will save you from your slowness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you are quick, Christ will be your life to save you from your quickness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We had a co-worker among us whom I met in 1934.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brother Watchman Nee told me concerning this brother that if you tell him to go east, he will go west.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you said yes, he would say no. So it was very easy for you to get along with him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you wanted him to go east, you just needed to ask him to go west.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then he would go east.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many times when we say no, the Lord says yes.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you are a quick person, the Lord will tell you to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is according to Christ as life, not the law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all need to be saved from what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you like to laugh, the Lord says, "Don't laugh."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you like to be quiet, the Lord says, "Be excited."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord will say to the northern Canadians, "Be excited," and to the southern Mexicans, "Be quiet."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are fallen people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whatever we are is in a fallen condition.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not keep anything of what you are naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to be saved from our natural condition, from what we are naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some may ask whether it is right to be quiet or to be excited.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our answer is that neither is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the Lord saves you to be excited, you have to be excited.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the Lord saves you to be calm, you have to be calm.</S>
