   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because the perishing ones did not receive the love of the truth, which God intended to give them that they might be saved, God sends to them an operation of error, an active power of misleading, that they might believe the lie.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to live a life to match the Lord's requirements so that we may be counted worthy to be in the manchild, or to be among the one hundred forty-four thousand, or to be the living ones who are raptured according to Matthew 24.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those believers who are watchful and ready will be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, those who are not watchful and ready will pass through the tribulation.</S>
