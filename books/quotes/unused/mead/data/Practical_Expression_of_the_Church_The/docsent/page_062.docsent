   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY BUILDING IN LOVE Scripture reading: Ephesians 4:16; 1 Corinthians 8:1; 1 Corinthians 13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter, we must see that love is the practical living of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church's living is love.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word "living" can also mean "expression"; the expression of a local church is love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we only demonstrate a certain kind of teaching or form, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The expression of the local church must be love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE MOST EXCELLENT WAY</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why did the Apostle Paul write 1 Corinthians 13?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Chapters 12, 13 and 14 are three chapters forming a section which deals with gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The middle part is the chapter on love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church at Corinth had left the proper expression of the local church: they had turned from love to the exercise of gifts; they had become a kind of manifestation of gifts rather than love.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first thing seen at Corinth was the practice of gifts mainly, the speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Apostle Paul then wrote and adjusted them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Tongues and other gifts are not the most excellent way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only love is the excellent way, and in a sense, love is the best way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the end of chapter 12, the Apostle Paul says, "But desire earnestly the greater gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And moreover a most excellent way show I unto you" ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the most excellent way?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The answer is in the following chapter, that is, love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He opened the next chapter in this way: "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love " 1 Cor 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This verse proves that tongues and other gifts are different from love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may have the gifts and still lack the love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may speak in the tongues of men and of angels and still be short of love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If so, we are as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is the sound, but not the love; the noise, but not the life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have been concerned for many years because some Christians pay too much attention to tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They have neglected this verse, which tells us that speaking in tongues is not something in life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Tongues are only a kind of sound.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are not life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sound without love proves that speaking in tongues is not of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Otherwise, the Apostle would not speak in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He opened this chapter by saying that the Corinthian believers need life, not just sound.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is the expression of life?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It must be love, for life is expressed in love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Love is not sound; love is the expression of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must never try to love by our own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am not encouraging you to love, because I know that you cannot love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more I exhort you to love, the more you will hate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more I demand love from you, the more I will get hatred from you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We simply cannot love.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can do many things, but we cannot love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is easy to speak in tongues, but it is not so easy to love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Love is the most excellent way; therefore, it is the most difficult way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The greatest difficulty in the church life is love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can teach, but we cannot love.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can serve, but we cannot love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can clean, but we cannot love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can mow the lawn, but we cannot love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The sisters can play the piano, but they cannot love.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is easy for us to pray-read, but we cannot love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We simply cannot love.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is easy to do anything but love.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>THE DESCRIPTION OF LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is love?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we read the description of love again in this chapter, we will realize that Christ is love.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Love is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil" 1 Cor 13:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Love is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The whole description of love in this chapter pertains to a living person, and that person is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What can exist forever and ever?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this chapter, the Apostle Paul minimizes all things but love.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Nothing can compare with love.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All the offerings, donations, and gifts cannot compare with love.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even prophecy and knowledge cannot compare with it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>First Corinthians 13:8 says, "Love never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Paul uses these three words in this verse: fail, cease, and vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What shall fail?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Prophecies!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What shall cease?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Tongues!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What shall vanish away?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Knowledge!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Tongues, prophecies and knowledge shall fail, cease and vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Word is exceedingly clear in this verse, but many so-called Pentecostal groups simply pay all their attention to prophecies and tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Love never fails.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Prophecies will fail, tongues will cease and knowledge will vanish away, but love remains forever.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Who is this love?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What can compare with God?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Tongues?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Prophecies?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Knowledge?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Only God is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>"Knowledge puffeth up, but love builds up" 1 Cor 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Christians think they need the teachings, but this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We should not put too much trust in teachings or gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We must put absolute trust in love.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In the first of the seven epistles in Revelation, the Lord Jesus says that they had lost their first love.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The word "first" in Greek also means "best."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>First love is best love.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Philadelphia, the church to whom the sixth epistle was written, means brotherly love, and this is the best of the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The best church is the church of brotherly love, not the church of gifts, knowledge or power.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Lord only wants a church of love.</S>
