   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Because we are on this earth, we are limited by time and space, and we have many business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The saints in Anaheim and the saints in San Francisco and Fresno cannot meet together often.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is impossible because of the inconvenience of distance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They need to have their own particular activities.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church in Fresno may decide to rent a small hall, whereas the church in Anaheim meets in a big hall.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is altogether according to the practical need.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But this does not indicate any division, separation, or independence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When all the churches come together for a conference, those who are coming from another city may not function in the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They may think, "This is not my home church."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a result, they would not function.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But certain brothers who live in the locality where the conference is held may function frequently because they think, "This is my home church."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Dear saints, this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord has only one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church of God is only one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1 Corinthians 10:32 Paul spoke of three categories of people on this earth: the Jews, God's chosen people; the Greeks, the unbelieving Gentiles; and the church of God, a composition of the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church is uniquely one on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I go to London, I should not consider that I am from the United States and that this is their church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I should not consider that I am a guest and they are the host, that they have their jurisdiction and that I have no concern in the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I should consider that I am a member of the church of God, which is universal and sometimes local.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is okay to say sometimes but not all times.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Two thousand years ago, the communication and the means of travel were not as convenient as they are today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even fifty years ago, it took me forty-eight hours to travel by boat from my home town, Chefoo, to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later, after World War II it took only forty-five minutes to travel this distance by plane.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today the world has become so small.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am so glad that the world situation is tending this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is for our experience of the genuine oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How can we keep ourselves independent and keep our so-called jurisdiction, saying, "This is my city.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is my country.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is my region"?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In today's world and in today's recovery, we cannot and should not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 1963 I told the saints that the international trade and commerce would turn from the Atlantic to the Pacific.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why I chose Los Angeles to be my place for the Lord's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now we can see that there is much more traffic for commerce on the Pacific than on the Atlantic.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The world has changed, so we should not keep ourselves in a backward state.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are going to have the Lord's blessing, we must be one in all the parts of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus prayed for this in John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He prayed to the Father, "That they may be one even as We are" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>11, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should keep the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are narrow, independent, and insisting on our jurisdiction in our locality, we will not even be able to be in one accord with others in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Universally, we should be one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Locally, we should be in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Are you expecting to see the Lord's blessing?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You must learn the "two-layer lesson."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Locally, you must serve with the saints in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Universally, all the churches should be one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today's problems in the Lord's recovery are all due to one thing we have not seen the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we have seen the Body, there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then minor things such as whether we use leavened or unleavened bread and wine or grape juice at the Lord's table will not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As long as we receive the threefold dispensing of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit, everything is okay.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As long as we would stay under the transmission of the transcending Christ from the heavens, everything is okay.</S>
