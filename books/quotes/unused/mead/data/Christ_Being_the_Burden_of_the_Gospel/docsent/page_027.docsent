   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VARIOUS WAYS OF SALVATION INVENTED BY MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Due to mankind s need of salvation, many wise men and philosophers have tried to invent different ways of salvation to meet man s various needs.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some of these ways are intended to meet the needs in man s behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since man s behavior is neither proper nor upright, some wise men invented the way of self-cultivation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They believed that what man does and how he behaves will be proper and upright if he sincerely exerts his effort to cultivate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Other wise men have said that a person s nature is easily corrupted if he is accustomed to living an easy life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, if man endures more hardships by buffeting his body, he will be able to restrain his lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some philosophers have considered that the meaning of human life is determined by a person s accomplishments and his ability to make a name for himself in the eyes of the next generation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, others have thought that the meaning of man s existence is for him to enjoy himself while he can.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, they devised different theories and methods for man to have accomplishments and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They emphasized that man only needs to be successful in his career and to obtain various kinds of enjoyment in order to have a meaningful human life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These methods are man s inventions to take care of the sense of the vanity of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In addition, some wise men invented the way of rendering distinguished service to mankind in order to achieve virtue so that they can atone for their mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They believed that a person who commits sins during the first half of his life can render distinguished service when he becomes old to make atonement for his past mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many people believe in this way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>MAN S WAY OF SALVATION BEING INEFFECTIVE,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>AND ONLY GOD S WAY OF SALVATION BEING EFFECTIVE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the ways of salvation invented by the intellects throughout the generations are nothing but an attempt to solve the problems of man s behavior, man s nature, the vanity within man and the meaning of human life, and man s eternal destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we examine all the man-invented ways of salvation, we will see that they are only temporarily effective.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Self-cultivation cannot solve the inherent problem of man s behavior, buffeting oneself cannot solve the basic problem of man s corrupted nature, accomplishments in man s career and material enjoyment do not remove the sense of emptiness that comes from man s ignorance of the meaning of his human life, and doing good deeds and developing virtues cannot atone for one s wrongdoings in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All of these are only ways to bribe man s conscience and bring in a false and temporary comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, all the man-invented ways of salvation cannot solve man s problems.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, we thank God that the way of salvation lies in God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible tells us how God prepared a wonderful way of salvation for the human race in order to deal with and to meet all of man s needs.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>GOD S LOVE BEING THE SOURCE OF GOD S SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s wonderful way of salvation has three major steps, and each step comes out of God s heart of love toward man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has a fervent love for man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible says, God so loved the world John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we consider the words of the Bible, we will see that God s heart is set completely on man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has no other love in this universe but man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although we do not know why God loves man so much, we know that His entire heart is set on man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In a sense, all that He thinks of, all that He is concerned for, and all that He worries about is man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Human words cannot describe God s love toward man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible uses the love of a mother for her child to describe God s love toward man Isa 66:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From our experience we know that the greatest, richest, sweetest, and most intimate is the love of a mother toward her children.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, the Bible says that God s love toward man is greater than a mother s love toward her children.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God said, Can a woman forget her nursing child, / That she would not have compassion on the son of her womb?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>/ Even though they may forget, / Yet I will not forget you 49:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is not willing to lose or forget man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without man, God would feel lonely and would not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After creating the first man, Adam, God said, It is not good for the man to be alone Gen 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In saying this, God was also referring to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In other words, it is not good for God to be alone, to be without man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, He created man so that man could be His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a result, God is man s unique satisfaction, and man is God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God is man s happiness and rest, and man is God s happiness and dwelling Isa 66:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Man lacks everything if he lacks God, and God lacks satisfaction if He lacks man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If man does not have God, he is empty, and if God does not have man, He has no one to fill.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Man needs God, but God also needs man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The relationship between man and God is like the relationship between children and their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Children need their parents, but parents need children even more.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although the prodigal son needed his father, he did not know how much more the loving father had been eagerly awaiting his return Luke 15:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All parents find it difficult to sleep when their children are out until late at night.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the children are out wandering, they may forget about their parents, but their parents at home will be thinking of them restlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sometimes when the children return home at three or four o clock in the morning, they are fearful that the noise from parking their car or walking to the entrance might wake their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, they try to come into the house quietly, expecting everyone to be asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They do not know that at the moment they stand at the entrance, their parents will hear them and will rush out to open the door and let them in. A parent s heart is always thinking of his children.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, on the surface, children need their parents, but actually, parents need children more.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Children who are without parents have no rest, and parents who are without children are even more without rest.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the analogy that the Bible uses to describe God s love toward man and His need for man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We often feel that, as desolated sinners, we greatly need God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But we hardly consider that God also needs the desolated sinners because His heart loves man, is toward man, and is fully on man.</S>
