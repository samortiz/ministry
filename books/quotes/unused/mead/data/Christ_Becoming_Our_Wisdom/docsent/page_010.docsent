   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We can take humility as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Suppose I am a very proud person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I am aware of my pride, yet I cannot humble myself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, I pray, "God, be merciful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Please send the Lord Jesus to help me so that I can be humble."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brothers and sisters, have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have made Christ my help in trying to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I think that with His help I can become humble.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, I ask Christ to help me to become humble.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But this is my concept; this is not God's way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God does not ask Christ to help me to become humble.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God gives me Christ, who is my humility.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has not given us Christ as a power so that we can produce humility; God has given us Christ to be our humility.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brothers and sisters, does the Lord have power?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yes, every one of us knows that He has power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Has He given us this power?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yes, He has given us this power.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then why are we still so weak?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to realize that He has given all the power to us already, but we cannot use this power.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord's power is real, but we cannot use it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we try to be humble by the Lord's power, we find that we cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the most we perform some outward acts which we call humility.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But inwardly, there is no such thing as humility.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's Word shows us that our humility is not the power of Christ, but Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What does it mean for us to say that humility is just the Lord Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It means that I do not have any humility and I cannot be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even if the Lord gives me the strength to humble myself, I still cannot be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I can only say to the Lord, "You are my humility.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I allow You to become my humility."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brothers and sisters, what is the meaning of Christ becoming my humility?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Simply put, it means that Christ replaces me and expresses His own humility in my place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we ask God for power to humble ourselves, we may be able to humble ourselves for a while, but this humility is merely good behavior, a good attitude, a good intention, and a good condition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This humility is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we ask the Lord to be our humility, we lift up our heads and say to Him, "Lord, I do not have any humility in me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even if You give me the strength to humble myself, I still would not have humility.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore Lord, I ask that You come and be my humility and that You be humble in my place."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After we look to the Lord this way, any humility that we begin to have will be a spontaneous humility.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such humility will not be a work, but a living person Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Take patience as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not have any patience, and I cannot be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>My patience is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The same is true with meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I do not have any meekness, and I cannot be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>My meekness is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brothers and sisters, have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God has made Christ my patience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has made Christ my meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All our virtues are just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christian virtues are different from common human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The virtues that we commonly speak of are individual things, but Christian virtues are not individual, fragmentary things, but a living person, who is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our virtue is not plural in number, but singular in number.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our virtue is not fragmentary things, but a person.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Brothers and sisters, if we do not have Christ, we do not have anything.</S>
