   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. DANIEL A. The Writer s , the Place, and the Time</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Daniel was of the children of Judah 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His name means God is the Judge or my God is the Judge.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This book covers approximately seventy-three years, from 607 B.C. to 534 B.C.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>B. The Subject</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The subject is the judgment and destruction of Satan and the kingdoms of the world ushering in Christ and the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>C. The Background</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and carried away Daniel and his three friends Dan 1:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They were chosen to be taught in the palace and prepared to serve the king, for they were well favored, skillful in all wisdom, and gifted in knowledge and the understanding of science.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Daniel requested that they be tested ten days by being given only vegetables to eat and water to drink, after which their countenances would be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the end of ten days, their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, the prince of the eunuchs allowed them to take vegetables and water only Dan 1:8-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At that time, God s people were carried away, the house of God was destroyed, and the vessels of the house were taken to the house of the false gods Dan 1:2; 2 Chron 36:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The dominion and glory of God on the earth were completely gone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The people were under the rule of the king of Babylon and were associated with demons, because even the food they ate and the wine they drank, being sacrificed to demons, were defiled and unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In such a time, God gained Daniel and his three friends, some who cared for the dominion and glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were determined that, by refraining from eating the royal food and drinking the royal wine, they would not be defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, they were the overcomers in captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since Daniel was such a person, he was able to pray for the holy city and the holy temple of God until they were recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was a man of God who turned the age of captivity to recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was also able to interpret dreams and see visions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All young people should take Daniel and his three friends as examples.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>D. The Central Thought</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The most high God is the Ruler of heaven and earth and the supreme Judge.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men 4:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, He is the One that rules over the rising and falling of Gentile nations, He is the One that gives the kingdom to whomever He will 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He arranges the position and work of His faithful servants.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He bestows outstanding gifts and wisdom upon them, and in the end He is the One that protects them and gives them peace during their affliction and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He judged the rebellion of Judah, the pride of Nebuchadnezzar, and the blasphemy of Belshazzar.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He also will judge Satan, his servants, and the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Finally, it is He who will bring in the kingdom of God to replace all the kingdoms of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>E. The General Sketch</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Chapter one gives an introduction and the history of Daniel and his three friends.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Chapter two tells us the key to the whole book Nebuchadnezzar s dream of the great image.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Daniel interpreted this image as the prophecy concerning the nations Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and the Roman Empire, which became two parts and will be ten nations in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The kingdom of God will come down from heaven to smash the kingdoms of the world into pieces and fill the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Chapters three and four tell us that Nebuchadnezzar was proud and was judged.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Chapter five tells us that his son, King Belshazzar, blasphemed God and was punished.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Belshazzar died and his kingdom was turned over to the Medes and Persians.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Chapter six tells us that Daniel defied the decree of King Darius and continued to worship God in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was thrown into a lions den.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God saved him from the lions mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Chapters seven through twelve tell us of the visions that Daniel saw the four beasts, the ten horns, the little horn, the Ancient of Days, the Son of Man, the ram, the he-goat, the great horn, the four notable horns, the little horn, the seventy weeks, and so on.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He predicted that Christ would be cut off four hundred eighty-three years that is, sixty-nine weeks after the issuing of the decree to rebuild Jerusalem Dan 9:25-26 ; that He would receive the kingdom and come back 7:13-14 ; and that at His coming back He would be as a stone cut out without hands, which would become a great mountain the kingdom and would fill the whole earth 2:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He also prophesied that in the future resurrection, some will receive eternal life and others will receive eternal punishment Dan 12:2; John 5:28-29 ; they who are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars forever and ever Dan 12:2-3; Matt 13:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After Daniel finished his work faithfully, he was asked to rest and wait for the resurrection, rapture, and reward.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We all should be like Daniel to receive the same reward.</S>
