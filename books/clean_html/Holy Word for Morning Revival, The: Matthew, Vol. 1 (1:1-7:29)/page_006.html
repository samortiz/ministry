Tamar conceived through committing incest with her father-in-law (Gen. 38:6-27).…The fault was…on the side of her father-in-law, Judah, who admitted that she was more righteous than he (Gen. 38:26).…Although Tamar may be held responsible to a certain extent, she was righteous, and she had a heart for the birthright.…The significance…today is that if we care for Christ and are seeking Him, any way we can truly gain Him is the right way. [Following this, is Tamar’s] son, Pharez (v. 3). Tamar conceived twins (Gen. 38:27-30). At the time of delivery, one boy, Zarah, tried to come out first, but he did not succeed.…Pharez preceded him to be the firstborn. Thus, the first became the last, and the last became the first.…Pharez inherited the birthright.…This proves that it is not up to man’s endeavoring; it is up to God’s choice.</p><p>We proceed to Rahab (v. 5). Rahab was a harlot in Jericho (Josh. 2:1), [yet]…she became a grandmother of Christ. How could [this be?]…To answer this question, we need to find the principles. The entire population of Jericho was destroyed except Rahab, her family, and her possessions. She was saved because she turned to God and God’s people (Josh. 6:22-23, 25; Heb. 11:31).</p><p>[Next is] Boaz…a type of Christ, and Ruth is a type of the church.…Boaz redeemed Ruth; he also redeemed the birthright for her.…Boaz redeemed his kinsman’s inheritance and married the man’s widow (Ruth 4:1-17); hence, he became a notable forefather [and]…great associate of Christ. As a brother and a Boaz, you should [daily] take care of others’ birthright [enjoyment] of Christ, not only your own.</p><p>We come now to Ruth (1:5).…Ruth belonged to the tribe of Moab (Ruth 1:4).…The Moabites were forbidden to enter the congregation of the Lord, even to the tenth generation [Deut. 23:3]. [But] Ruth…was seeking God and God’s people (Ruth 1:15-17; 2:11-12). This reveals a most prevailing principle: no matter who we are or what our background is, as long as we have a heart which seeks after God and God’s people, we are in a position to be accepted into the birthright of Christ.</p><p>We continue with Jesse (vv. 5-6).…Jesse is a person who brings forth Christ, who branches out Christ by being rooted in Christ [see Isa. 11:1, 10].…Christ is our source, and Christ is also our issue.…[We move on to] David…the eighth son of his father.…In the Bible the number eight signifies resurrection, a new start.…David was the last of the generations of the fathers, [and] also the first of the generations of the kings. [To]…have the rich enjoyment of Christ,…often [requires us]…to be the end of one situation and the beginning of another situation.</p><p>After David committed murder and adultery, he…repented.…David repented and God forgave.…Altogether we have three items here: transgression, repentance, and forgiveness. If we put all three together, the result is Solomon.…The church is always built up by this kind of person, Solomon, the issue of man’s transgression and repentance plus God’s forgiveness.
