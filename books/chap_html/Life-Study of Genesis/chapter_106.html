<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE<br>OF JOSEPH AND BENJAMIN</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><P>Jacob's prophecy regarding his twelve sons ends with a blessing that includes ten items. The history of these twelve sons begins with a sinner, that is, it begins with sin, even with a gross sin, not a refined sin. At the beginning we have a person who is full of sin, and at the end we have a person who receives the universal blessing. Thus, the prophecy ends with the full blessing. With Joseph, everything is a blessing, and the blessing is everywhere. There is blessing upon blessing.</P><P>The Bible is a wonderful book; no human mind can fully understand it. The more we study the Bible, the more we realize how little we really know it. The Bible is too profound. The ten blessings related to Joseph, for example, require the whole Bible for their development.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. BLESSED</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. With the Precious Things of Heaven</H2><P>First are the blessings with the precious things of heaven above (49:25). The precious things of heaven above certainly include rain and snow. These precious things must also include the angels, for the angels certainly are a blessing to us. They are our servants and even camp around us (Heb. 1:13-14; Psa. 34:7). Every believer has at least one angel. For example, Acts 12 speaks of Peter's angel (v. 15), and in the Gospel of Matthew the Lord Jesus indicates that we have angels (18:10).</P><P>The material things in the Old Testament are shadows of the reality in the New Testament. In the New Testament the blessings are spiritual blessings. Ephesians 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ." In this verse we have the words blessed and blessing. We are blessed with all spiritual blessings in the heavenlies. The word "places" is not found in the original text. It is difficult to say what the words "the heavenlies" definitely refer to. Certainly this includes the heavenly nature, the heavenly position, the heavenly condition, the heavenly situation, the heavenly atmosphere, and the heavenly capacity. The spiritual blessings are of a heavenly nature, in a heavenly situation and atmosphere, and under a heavenly condition. In other words, every aspect of these spiritual blessings is heavenly. Today we are enjoying these heavenly blessings. According to the New Testament reality and fulfillment, the precious things of heaven above are the blessings in the heavenlies.</P><P>Ephesians chapter one reveals that one of these heavenly blessings is God's selection. God did not select us on earth, but in the heavens. Thus, our selection is heavenly, with the heavenly nature, under a heavenly condition, and in a heavenly atmosphere. A second spiritual blessing is predestination. Predestination is nothing earthly; rather it is heavenly. After God selected us, He predestinated us, marked us out, in the heavenlies. This marking out is heavenly in nature, in atmosphere, and in condition. Although the worldly people know nothing of the heavenly blessings, we are enjoying them, for we have been selected and predestinated by God from heaven. We all have been marked out, and wherever we go we bear this heavenly mark. This mark was made in the heavenlies before the foundation of the world. Therefore, it is not anything earthly, but heavenly. The adoption to be the sons of God is another heavenly blessing mentioned in Ephesians 1. Redemption and forgiveness are also included among these heavenly blessings. Although we are on earth, we are nonetheless enjoying the heavenly redemption and the heavenly forgiveness. The One who redeemed us and who has forgiven us is the very God in heaven. Our redemption and forgiveness come from the heavens. Besides all these, in Ephesians 1 there are also other items listed among the spiritual blessings.</P><P>The heavenly rain and snow also come down upon us. There are many who do not like snow. However, those who live where there is snow are often healthier than those who live in a warm climate. Whether we like it or not, in our spiritual life our heavenly Father sometimes sends snow upon us. It is healthy to be outside in the snow; it is a marvelous enjoyment as well. Rain is good, and snow is enjoyable. These are some of the precious things of heaven above. We need to constantly remind ourselves that we are under God's blessing of the precious things of heaven.</P>
