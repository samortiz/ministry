<h1 class="title">The Principle of Babylon</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 11:1-9; Rev. 17:1-6; 18:2, 4, 7</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The principle of Babylon (Heb. <em>Babel</em>) is man&rsquo;s endeavor to build up something from earth to heaven by human ability, signified by bricks&mdash; Gen. 11:1-9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Stones are made by God, whereas bricks are made by man, being a human invention, a human product.</li>
	<li>Those who live according to the principle of Babylon do not see that they are limited; rather, they attempt to do the Lord&rsquo;s work by their natural ability with their human effort.</li>
	<li>The building of God is not built with man-made bricks by human labor; it is built with God-created and transformed stones and by the divine work&mdash;1 Cor. 3:12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The principle of Babylon is hypocrisy&mdash;Rev. 17:4, 6; Matt. 23:25-32:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The significance of Achan&rsquo;s sin was his coveting a beautiful Babylonian garment in his seeking to improve himself, to make himself look better, for the sake of appearance&mdash;Josh. 7:21.</li>
	<li>This was the sin of Ananias and Sapphira, who lied to the Holy Spirit&mdash;Acts 5:1-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>They did not love the Lord very much, but they wanted to be looked upon as those who greatly loved the Lord; they were just pretending.</li>
		<li>They were not willing to offer everything cheerfully to God, but before man, they acted as if they had offered all.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Whenever we put on a garment which does not match our actual condition, we are in the principle of Babylon&mdash;Matt. 6:1-6; 15:7-8.</li>
	<li>Everything done in falsehood to receive glory from man is done in the principle of the harlot, not in the principle of the bride&mdash;John 5:44; 12:42-43.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The principle of Babylon is that of not considering herself a widow but of glorifying herself and living luxuriously&mdash;Rev. 18:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Only those who have fallen would consider themselves not to be a widow&mdash;Luke 18:3; Matt. 9:14-15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In a sense, the believers in Christ are a widow in the present age because their Husband, Christ, is absent from them&mdash;cf. 1 Cor. 16:22; Rev. 22:20.</li>
		<li>Because our Beloved is not here in the world, our heart is not here&mdash;cf. Luke 12:34.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Anything in our living which is in excess is luxury and is in the principle of Babylon&mdash;1 Tim. 6:6-10.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The principle of Babylon is the principle of a harlot&mdash;Rev. 17:1, 5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Babylon&rsquo;s purpose is for man to make a name for himself and deny God&rsquo;s name&mdash;Gen. 11:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To denominate the church by taking any name other than our Lord&rsquo;s is spiritual fornication&mdash;cf. Rev. 3:8.</li>
		<li>The church, as the pure virgin espoused to Christ, should have no name other than her Husband&rsquo;s&mdash;2 Cor. 11:2; 1 Cor. 1:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Babylon means confusion&mdash;Gen. 11:6-7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the church we should not have different kinds of speaking; we should have only one mind and one mouth under one ministry with one unique teaching for the one Body&mdash;Rom. 15:5-6; 1 Cor. 1:10; Phil. 2:2; 1 Tim. 1:3-4.</li>
		<li>When we are in our mind, we are in the principle of Babylon; when we are in our spirit, we are in today&rsquo;s Jerusalem, in which there is the divine oneness&mdash;John 4:23-24; Eph. 4:3.</li>
		<li>We should not dare to have any division because our Husband is one, and we His wife are also one&mdash;Matt. 19:3-9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>With the rebellious people at Babel, there was a scattering&mdash;Gen. 11:8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the ancient time all the Israelites came together three times a year at Jerusalem; this was versus the scattering at Babel&mdash;Deut. 12:5; 16:16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>It was by this unique place of worship to God, Jerusalem, that the oneness of His people was kept for generations&mdash;Psa. 133.</li>
			<li>Jerusalem not only signifies our spirit but also signifies the genuine ground of oneness, the ground of locality&mdash;Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:11.</li>
			<li>In order to come out of Babylon, we must be &ldquo;in spirit, on the ground&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #1260).</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The sin of Jeroboam, who set up another center of worship, is the sin of division caused by one&rsquo;s ambition to have a kingdom, an empire, to satisfy his selfish desire&mdash;1 Kings 12:26-32.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Babylon is a mixture of the things of God with the things of idols:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon burned the house of God in Jerusalem, carried away all the vessels in God&rsquo;s house for God&rsquo;s worship, and put them in the temple of his idols in Babylon&mdash;2 Chron. 36:6-7; Ezra 1:11.</li>
		<li>In the New Testament, this mixture is enlarged with the great Babylon&mdash;Rev. 17:3-5; cf. 21:18; 22:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord&rsquo;s call in the book of Revelation is for His people to come out of Babylon&mdash;18:4-5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>According to God&rsquo;s Word, His children cannot partake of anything that has the character of Babylon&mdash;2 Cor. 6:17-18.</li>
	<li>God hates the principle of Babylon more than anything else&mdash;Rev. 11:18b; 18:24; 19:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Anything which is halfway and not absolute is called Babylon.</li>
		<li>We need God to enlighten us so that in His light we may judge everything in us which is not absolute toward Him&mdash;3:16-19.</li>
		<li>Only when we judge ourselves in this way can we confess that we too hate the principle of Babylon&mdash;cf. Rev. 2:6.</li>
		<li>By His grace, may the Lord not allow us to seek any glory and honor outside of Christ&mdash; John 7:18; 12:26; Phil. 1:19-21a; cf. Exo. 28:2.</li>
		<li>The Lord requires that we delight and seek to be ones who are absolute, not ones who are living in the principle of Babylon.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When God judges the harlot and shatters all her work, and when He casts out all that she is and the principle she represents, voices from heaven will say, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo;&mdash;Rev. 19:1-4.</li>
	</ol></li>
