   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHRIST AND THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now I would like to speak a word concerning the difference between Christ and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The difference between Christ and the law is the difference between the Old Testament economy and the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Under the law in the Old Testament, man was always striving to arrive at the standard of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man realized that he was weak and sinful, so he asked for God's mercy, God's lovingkindness, and he put his trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He also took refuge in God, waited on God, hoped in God, praised God, thanked God, and worshipped God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was all man's doing because in the Old Testament God was apart from man, and man was apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man and God were separate.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then in the New Testament economy, God came into man to become incarnated and be born as a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Christ lived on this earth, that was God living on this earth in man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through His redemption, He solved all the problems for man and paved the way so that He could enter into man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In His incarnation He entered into the womb of a virgin, but through His death and resurrection He entered into thousands of men.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to enter into man, He was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b and the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29 who brought men into God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His incarnation He brought God into man; in His resurrection He brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By this He accomplished the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He mingled God and man into one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we believers are in Him and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He and we have become one person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He has the divine life and the divine nature, and so do we.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have the human life and the human nature, and so does He.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He has become us, and we have become Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to recognize that we have been crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now it is no more we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the New Testament economy, we have to do something, but not the things done by the Old Testament saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the New Testament economy, we have to believe into Christ John 3:16, 36 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we have to love Him John 14:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We also have to live Him that we may magnify Him Phil 1:19-21a .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the New Testament, we are not doing something out of ourselves in our natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To believe into Him is to receive Him; to love Him is to enjoy Him; and to live Him is to magnify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not our doing in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whatever we are doing in the New Testament is an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God does not want us to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He wants us only to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To live Christ implies many things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To live Christ implies being holy and overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To live Christ implies not losing our temper and being enduring and full of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We just need to live Christ, and this living implies everything in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It implies our faithfulness and our honesty.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To live Christ means everything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why the New Testament charges us to live Christ that we may magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to live, move, and walk by the spirit, having our entire being according to the mingled spirit Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Much of the terminology in the Old Testament psalms is good, but it is good in a natural realm.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It has nothing to do with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The New Testament is altogether in another field, in another world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is altogether in the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, everything in the New Testament is altogether a matter in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our honesty, faithfulness, patience, endurance, kindness, and everything we are and do involves the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All of our virtues should be the expression of the Triune God, not of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Christian life in the New Testament is not our doing, but is altogether a matter of our living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To live Him in order to magnify Him is to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, every day we should not do anything but enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ is our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This thought is in Hymns, #499, #501, and #841.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These three songs were written absolutely according to the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hymn #841 is concerning the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many Christians, however, still exalt the law, remaining in the Old Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to have the proper discernment to see the difference between the Old Testament economy and the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the one hand, the psalms are lovely because they are the aspiration of the sentiment of the ones who were seeking after God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the other hand, many portions of the Psalms are not according to the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The New Testament economy includes first, incarnation; second, resurrection; and third, mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God came into us and He brought us into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He has accomplished a mingling of divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We and He are living as one person in the same one life and with the same one nature.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should not endeavor to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Instead, we live only one person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We live Christ that He may be magnified.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I hope we can see this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we come to any psalm, we have to weigh it with this scale of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then we can realize what belongs to Mount Sinai and what belongs to Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are here on Mount Zion where we have the church, the Body of Christ, and God's economy for God's testimony.</S>
