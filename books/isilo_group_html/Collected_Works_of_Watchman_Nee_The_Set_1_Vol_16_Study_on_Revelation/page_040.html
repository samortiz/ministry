Revelation 12:2</H2><P>"And she was with child, and she cried out, travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth."</P><P>Since everything about this woman is symbolic, her pregnancy, birth, and crying out in 12:2 must not be interpreted literally. Birth has only three meanings in the Bible: (1) literal birth, (2) spiritual birth, and (3) resurrection. Since Revelation 12:2 is symbolic, this birth cannot be literal. Furthermore, since the man-child shepherds the nations with an iron rod, which speaks of overcoming, this birth cannot be a spiritual regeneration either. Since it is neither the first interpretation nor the second, it must be the third, that is, a birth in resurrection. The external evidence of this is in Acts 13:33 and Romans 1:4, but this chapter also contains evidence. The last phrase of Revelation 12:11 says that those brought forth were martyred ones, that they were dead ones. These were begotten from the dead. Hence, it indicates resurrection. Symbolically speaking, this is Jerusalem. When the Christians are resurrected, Jerusalem has to pass through the great tribulation, which is like hard labor. The woman's crying out must be their prayer.</P><P>Why do Christians come out of Jerusalem? It is because (1)the Lord is the Lion of the tribe of Judah (Rev. 5:5); (2)salvation is of the Jews (John 4:22); and (3)Jerusalem is our mother (Gal. 4:26).</P><P>The dragon has two aspects: (1) the heavenly dragon and (2) the earthly devil. Jerusalem also has two aspects: (1) she has a high position before God, and (2) she is a refugee on earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Revelation 12:3</H2><P>"And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold, there was a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems." </P><P>The "great red dragon" is the same as "the Devil and Satan" in verse 9. He is God's adversary. He is also the serpent in Genesis 3:1. Red is the color of war. The "great red dragon" signifies that he is a murderer from the beginning to the end. (See John 8:44 and 1 John 3:8, both of which are also recorded by John.)</P><P>"Seven heads." Compare this with Revelation 17:9 and 12. The "ten horns" are ten kings which are subordinates of the great king. The heads are larger than the horns, while the horns execute the decisions of the heads. After the revival of the Roman Empire, the dragon will lead the ten small kings to persecute the children of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Revelation 12:4</H2><P>"And his tail drags away the third part of the stars of heaven, and he cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, so that when she brings forth he might devour her child." </P><P>The third part of the stars of heaven that are cast down to the earth are the angels in 12:9. One third of the angels follow the devil. The casting down of the dragon happens before the rapture of the man-child.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Revelation 12:5</H2><P>"And she brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne."</P><P>Since the "woman" in 12:1 typifies Jerusalem of the nation of Israel, who then is the "man-child"? Some say it refers to the Israelites, but this cannot be true because of the following reasons:</P><P>(1) The sun, the moon, and the stars already typify the nation of Israel.</P><P>(2) This man-child is raptured to the throne, but the Bible never says that the nation of Israel will be raptured. This would not match the prophecy concerning Israel.</P><P>(3) This man-child believes in the blood of the Lamb (Rev. 12:11), but the Israelites never have. Some say that the Israelites will believe in the Lord during the tribulation, but the Bible never says so. The Bible says that when the Lord Jesus' feet stand upon the Mount of Olives, God will open up to the Israelites a fountain of salvation, and they will be saved at that time (Zech. 13:1; 14:4; 12:10-14).</P><P>Some say that the man-child is the Lord Jesus, but this cannot be true for the following reasons:</P><P>(1) The "woman" typifies Jerusalem, but the Lord was born in Bethlehem.</P><P>(2) This man-child is not an individual but a corporate entity (Rev. 12:10-11).</P><P>(3) If the man-child refers to the Lord, then the dragon must refer to Herod. But 12:9 expressly says that the dragon is Satan himself.</P><P>(4) After the man-child is born, he is immediately raptured, but after Jesus was born, He lived for over thirty-three and a half years and was raptured only after His death and resurrection.</P><P>(5) Because it is a "great" sign, the words "brought forth" cannot be interpreted literally.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 16: Study on Revelation &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
