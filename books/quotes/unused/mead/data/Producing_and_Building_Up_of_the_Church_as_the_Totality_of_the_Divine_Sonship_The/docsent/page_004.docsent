   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Church Being the Body of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Totality of the Divine Sonship,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Having the Divine Life and Nature</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not easy to define what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was young, I often heard about the church in our Sunday school class.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time we thought that the church was simply a physical building that has a high tower with a bell in it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today many people still understand the church in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Gradually, however, we found out that the church is not a physical building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Later on, we received an improved definition of the church from the teachers among the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They told us that the church is the gathering together of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the believers, the called ones, gather together, that is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This definition is according to the Greek word ekklesia, which is translated church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, this is still a somewhat natural understanding of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the New Testament, the church is not only the meeting together of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, the church is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22b-23; 1 Cor 12:27; Col 1:18 , and it is the totality of the sonship of all God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This sonship indicates that we possess the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to our experience, we cannot deny that as human beings we do have the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not mean that we are God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can never be God Himself; we will be human beings for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nevertheless, in our humanity there is the element of God s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We in the church are still human, but there is another element within us, which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If someone spills a glass of plain water on his shirt, it will not change the appearance of the shirt, but if the water has the element of tea in it, it will leave a brown color.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the same way, no one should touch us without being affected by the divine element within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can boast to Satan, saying, Satan, do not touch me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am a son of God, and within me is another element God s divine life and divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Living by the Divine Life and the Divine Nature</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>for the Corporate Expression of God</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>in the Divine Sonship</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This church as the divine sonship requires us to gather together, not in our self but in the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever we come together, and even in our daily life, we should not live by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to live according to the extra element within us, the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the reason that the Christian walk requires faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To have faith is to believe in something that we cannot see, feel, or touch.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must all live according to something unseen 2 Cor 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In himself no one can be a perfect husband.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Realizing this, a brother may pray, O Lord, help me to be a perfect husband.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, the Lord does not care to help us in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, He wants us to forget about ourselves and live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should tell the Lord, I can never be a perfect husband; therefore, I will forget about myself and not live by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, I want to live by You.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are still a glass of water, but now our color, appearance, taste, and element have changed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In ourselves we are not good.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If someone rebukes us and says that we are not a perfect husband, we can say, You are speaking the truth, but I am actually worse than this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have nothing good in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we can say to the Lord, I do not ask You to help me to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead, I want to forget about myself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thank You, Lord, that You are in me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am no longer only water; I have the divine tea in me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we can see that we are all teaified, that is, sanctified, the church will be rich, uplifted, and living.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When someone drinks tea-water, he cares mainly for the tea, not for the water.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are still water, but we have an additional element with its color, appearance, and taste.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church is not a religion, a society, or a social body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, it does not serve people with mere water or with dry tea.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>People cannot take tea by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order to take tea, it must be mingled with water.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If someone looks at a glass of plain water, he may say that there is no tea, but if he has a glass of tea-water, he will see the tea.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Likewise, some people today say that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They should not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If they would come to the church, they will see God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we meet together as the church, we must have the element, color, appearance, and taste of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After people attend our meeting, they should not say, I saw some American people, British people, young people, and older people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To see only this much is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Rather, they should say, I cannot explain what impressed me in that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I did not even care for that way of meeting, but I received something there that I cannot deny.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What people must receive in our meetings is God Himself 1 Cor 14:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the meaning of the church as the divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the past fifty years I have seen many cases like this.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Sometimes the parents of a young person did not want their son or daughter to be involved with the church life, but once the parents started coming to the church meetings, they received the tea-water.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In this way, many parents eventually took the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is our experience in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christianity today is a religion that offers a limited concept of salvation, but the Lord s recovery is to bring us back to the living sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Here we do not care for mere opinions or concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Rather, we are all drinking tea-water and serving others with it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In this message I have used the illustration of tea-water because the spiritual reality that it points to is mysterious, abstract, and profound, and we do not have the adequate vocabulary in our human language to express it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We all must have a heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today we praise the Lord that we are saved, forgiven, and redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, we are also the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have the divine sonship with the divine life and the divine nature within us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We are not God Himself, but we do have God s life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Therefore, God lives in us, and we can live by God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is not merely to be saved, forgiven, and redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is altogether a matter of the divine sonship.</S>
