   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO LOVING CHRIST THE PERSON Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:14; 2 Cor 5:14-15; Gal 2:20; John 14:21, 23; 21:15-19; Rev 2:4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the first chapter, we saw that life is simply Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ as life to us is a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can deal with many things without love, but we cannot deal with a person without love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may deal with a table or a chair without love, but not with a person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose I am your roommate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you do not love me, you will find it very difficult to have me as your roommate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It would be difficult for me to stay with you, and it would be difficult for you to stay with me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So love is needed in order to deal with a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the Bible, our relationship to the Lord is likened to a marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are His Bride, and He is our Groom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A bride and a groom must have love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a marriage lacks love, then that marriage will have difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is impossible to have a genuine marriage without love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Marriage is built uniquely upon love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without love, there is no marriage life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Likewise, our relationship with the Lord is like a marriage, and this marriage depends upon love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no problem on the Lord's side, for He certainly loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The problem is on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do we love the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When someone mentions the name of Jesus, do we have a sweet feeling within?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we think even a little about Him, are we attracted to Him?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>FAITH AND LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul says in 1 Timothy 1:14, "And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Grace is abundant in two aspects: in faith and in love in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Originally, Paul as Saul of Tarsus had nothing to do with Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was even full of hatred toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But one day he received mercy and grace from the Lord, not only to believe in Jesus, but also to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once he hated Jesus; then, by the grace of God, he loved Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the greatest mercy, and this is real grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not enough just to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We also must love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am sure we have all thanked God for His mercy and grace which have caused us to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But have we ever prayed, "O Father, how I thank You that by Your grace I love the Lord Jesus"?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not only do we need faith, but also love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The entire Gospel of John shows us these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the first part of the Gospel, we read that the Lord Jesus, who was God Himself, was the Word in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then one day He became incarnated as a man to dwell among us, full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John's Gospel encourages us to believe in this One.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One of the most important verbs in the Gospel of John is "believe."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Word has been made flesh and we must believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To believe simply means to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>John 1:12 says, "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We believe by receiving, and we receive by believing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We believe what God has given, and by believing we receive what He gives.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Gospel of John, after speaking of believing, the Lord Jesus appeals for our love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He tells us, " he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him" 14:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In these verses the Lord Jesus did not say, "he that believes in me."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To believe in the Lord is one thing, but to love Him is another.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To believe is to receive, but to love is to enjoy what you have received.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>So in the last chapter of John's Gospel, the Lord asks Peter three times, "Lovest thou me?"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By this, the Lord was showing Peter that, as one who had received Him, he must learn to enjoy Him by loving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We know that the sisters go to the supermarket, buy many groceries, and store them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Though these groceries are bought and stored, they have not yet been enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, the sisters must not only store them, but also enjoy them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is unnecessary for me to ask if you believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But I have a big question mark as to whether you love the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Tell me honestly, do you love the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do you love Him more than all other things?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Peter could say, "Lord, thou knowest that I love you."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Can we say the same thing?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>With an honest heart, can we say, "Lord Jesus, You know that I love You"?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now that we have believed in the Lord, He is appealing for our love.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Suppose I give a nice Bible to a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I want him not only to receive it, but to love it and spend much time with it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is why believing in the Lord is one thing, but loving Him is something deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Paul said that the grace of God was abundant to him with both the believing and the loving.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is by His grace that we believed in the Lord Jesus, and it is also by His grace that we love the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have faith in Him as well as love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We believe in Him and we love Him.</S>
