   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE TO BE SAVED BY THE RENEWING OF OUR MIND, ISSUING IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF OUR SOUL, AND BY BEING BUILT UP IN THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Rom 12:2a; 8:6, 5b; 12:1, 3-5 SAVED BY THE RENEWING OF OUR MIND, ISSUING IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF OUR SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 12:2 says, "And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.''</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Transformation is not simply a change.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, transformation is a metabolic process.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this metabolic process a new element is supplied and an old element is discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In metabolism, a new element comes in to supply, replace, and discharge the old element.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Transformation is the completion and issue of renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First we are renewed, and then we are transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Renewing issues in and brings in transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Renewing is in our mind, and transformation is in our entire soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When our mind, the main part, the leading part, of our soul is renewed, our entire soul is transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The transformation of the soul comes out of the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This kind of renewing and transformation saves us from our living, a living which is conformed to the present age the modern style of the world Rom 12:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The present age is just the modern style.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This can be shown by the different architectural styles over the past centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Europe, you can tell the age of a building by its style of architecture.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the time the building was built, its architecture was the modern style.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The hair styles and styles in dress of people today are also according to the present age, the modern style, of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have seen in one of the preceding chapters that our disposition has been soaked with the element of the world and that we love to have the present age, the modern style, the present fashion, of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Subjective sanctification saves us from the world-soaked disposition, and the renewing with transformation saves us from the appearance, the living, which is fashioned according to the present age, the modern style, of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such a saving delivers us, by the indwelling Spirit, out of the world, not only inwardly but also outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Inwardly, we are saved from our disposition, and outwardly, we are saved from a living which is conformed to the present age of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through Our Cooperation by Setting Our Mind on the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our being saved from the living that is conformed to the present age is through our cooperation by setting our mind on the spirit Rom 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to turn our mind away from the worldly appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to be saved from the modern style of the world, we must set our mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through Our Cooperation by Receiving the Dispensing of the Divine Element in Our Inner Being</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must realize and believe that God's divine element is always being dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not reject this dispensing, we will immediately receive the dispensing of this divine element into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is the inner dispensing of the divine element that transforms our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, we must set our mind on the spirit, minding the things of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we must be careful not to reject or block the inner dispensing of the divine element within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This dispensing takes place day after day in a slow way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Digestion in our physical body is an illustration of this dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Through digestion, whatever we taste by eating is dispensed into our blood, cells, and fibers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through the dispensing of the food into us, nourishment and sustaining strength are absorbed into our cells and fibers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every day we live by this dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The dispensing in the physical life is a figure of the dispensing in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the spiritual life, the dispensing is a matter of the divine element spreading within us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through years of study and experience, we found the fact of dispensing in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The dispensing of the divine element within us is spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This dispensing is also a law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The digestion of our physical food dispenses the food into our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It goes on all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Physically speaking, we live on the dispensing of food through digestion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Spiritually speaking, we live on the inner dispensing of the abiding divine element in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This abiding divine element is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is our food John 6:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As our food, He gets into us and there is the dispensing of this food into our spiritual being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without this spiritual dispensing, we could not live spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Being renewed in our mind and being transformed in our soul issue in all the virtues and victories in chapters twelve to sixteen of Romans: being built up in the Body of Christ, living an excellent life of the highest standard of ethics ch.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>12 , subjecting ourselves to authorities, practicing love, putting off the works of darkness by putting on Christ as the weapons of light ch.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>13 , living a proper church life in its locality ch.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>14 , and crushing Satan under our feet that we may enjoy the God of peace by participating in the grace of Christ 16:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Being renewed in our mind and being transformed in our soul issue also in our being conformed to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29; 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the prerequisite for our being glorified as a last step of God's full salvation in His divine life Rom 8:30 .</S>
