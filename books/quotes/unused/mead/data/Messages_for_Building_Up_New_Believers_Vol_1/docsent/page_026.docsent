   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Love of Man s Glory</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why did the rulers in John 12 not confess the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They did not confess the Lord because they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many people dare not confess because they want both; they want Christ, and they also want the synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They want Christ; this is why they believe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But they also want the synagogue; this is why they will not confess Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a person wants both, he will not be absolute in either.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you want to serve the Lord, you must make a choice between the Lord and the synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Otherwise, you can never be a good Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You must make a choice between the Lord and man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The rulers were afraid of losing men s favor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They were afraid that if they confessed the Lord they would be put out of the synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But a person who chooses the Lord in an absolute way will not be afraid of being put out of the synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If people do not persecute you after you have believed in the Lord, you should say, Lord, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If people persecute you after you have confessed the Lord with your mouth, you should also say, Lord, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What is so strange about this?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot be like those rulers who, for the sake of their love for the synagogue, refused to confess their faith in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If everyone in the church had been like them, there would be no church on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If Peter had returned home and remained silent after he believed in the Lord, if Paul, Luke, Darby, and the rest had remained silent after they believed, and if everyone in the church had remained silent and dared not confess the Lord, their troubles definitely would have been less, but there would be no church on earth today!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One characteristic of the church is that it dares to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Another characteristic is that it dares to confess its faith in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be saved is not just to believe in the Lord Jesus; it is to believe and to confess that one is a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The confession is important.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christianity is not only manifested in one s conduct but also in one s mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The mouth must confess.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One must confess, I am a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not enough for a Christian to just have good conduct; he must also confess with his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you take away the mouth, there will be no Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Scripture is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The heart believes unto righteousness and the mouth confesses unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christianity is believing in the heart and confessing with the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>CONFESSING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>AND THE LORD S CONFESSION</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord said, Every one therefore who will confess in Me before men, I also will confess in him before My Father who is in the heavens Matt 10:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thank the Lord that if we confess the Lord today, on that day He will also confess us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord also said, But whoever will deny Me before men, I also will deny him before My Father who is in the heavens v. 33 . But he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God Luke 12:9 . What a great contrast! All we have to do is confess that this excellent One, this chiefest among ten thousand, is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He will then confess us before the heavenly Father and the angels of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you think it is difficult to confess such a Lord before men, the Lord will find it difficult to confess such a person as you when He descends in the glory of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today we must not shrink back from confessing the Lord through fear of men Isa 51:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If today we find it difficult to confess Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, then on that day, when our Lord comes back, He will find it difficult to confess us before His Father and all the glorious angels.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What a serious thing this is!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In reality, it is not difficult for us to confess the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is especially easy when we compare our confession with His confession of us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is difficult for Him to confess us because we are prodigal sons who have come home, and there is nothing good in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since He will confess us in the future, let us also confess Him well before men today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May all the newly-saved brothers and sisters be bold to confess the Lord from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should never try to be Christians in secret.</S>
