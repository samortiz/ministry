CALLED BY GOD THROUGH HIS GRACE</h2><p>In 1:15 Paul also says that God called him through His grace. Paul was called to be an apostle through the grace of Christ, not through the law that came by Moses. This calling took place at the time of his conversion. We also can testify that we have been called by God. Actually, God&rsquo;s calling of us began with His setting us apart from our mother&rsquo;s womb. If we spend time to review our past, we shall see that God&rsquo;s calling of us began with our conception in the womb. God arranged the time and place of our birth. Then He called us. How grateful I am to the Lord that He caused me to be conceived in the womb of one who was in Christianity, although she was not saved at that time. In this way God caused me to be born into Christianity, beginning His calling of me by setting me apart from my mother&rsquo;s womb. Then one day, in 1925, God&rsquo;s calling was accomplished in a full way when I believed in the Lord Jesus. None of us should have any doubt about being called by God. Rather, let us worship Him and thank Him for His calling. Everything related to us, such as our family and education, is according to God&rsquo;s sovereignty and related to His calling of us.</p><h2 class="head1">III. HAVING THE SON OF GOD REVEALED IN HIM</h2><p>In 1:15 and 16 Paul says that God was pleased to reveal His Son in him. The Son of God was unveiled to Paul and shown to him. This means that he received a vision of the living Person of the Son of God. Since Paul is a pattern of the believers and the Son of God was revealed in him, we also should have Christ revealed in us. When the Son of God is revealed in us, something divine is added to us. Selection and calling do not cause anything to be added into us. But the revelation of the Son of God in us causes divinity to be added to our humanity. God Himself is added into our being to become our life. He who has the Son has life (1 John 5:12). Hence, to have the Son of God revealed in us means to have God added to us to become our life.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. NOT CONFERRING WITH FLESH AND BLOOD</h2><p>After the Son of God was revealed in Paul, he &ldquo;did not confer with flesh and blood.&rdquo; This means that he did not confer with man, who is made up of flesh and blood. This confirms the fact that Paul did not receive the gospel from man (1:12).</p><p>After we believed in the Lord Jesus, many of us immediately conferred with others. If we recall our experience, we shall realize that much of this was of no avail. As soon as I was saved, I turned to various people for help. However, I was only frustrated by them and cooled down. Some of you may have spoken to certain preachers or ministers, only to find that you were discouraged by your contact with them.</p><p>When young believers contacted me thirty years ago, I had a great deal to say. But it is much different today. Now when others contact me, I simply tell them to pray and to seek the Lord, to bring everything to Him for His leading. I do not want to be the flesh and blood with which others confer. We should neither confer with flesh and blood, nor should we be the flesh and blood with whom others confer. Let us leave others and their situation to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">V. NOT GOING UP TO JERUSALEM<br />TO THOSE WHO WERE APOSTLES BEFORE HIM</h2><p>Paul opens verse 17 with the words, &ldquo;Neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me.&rdquo; We all have made mistakes in this regard. We have gone to a place we consider today&rsquo;s Jerusalem seeking to confer with certain leaders. To go to some Jerusalem to those who were apostles before us is something of tradition and of religion. Actually, it is to confer with flesh and blood.</p><p>Some of the leading ones may be concerned that such a word will cause the saints not to seek the proper fellowship. Furthermore, they may think that this will ruin the leadership. But would it not be wonderful for all the saints to be trained not to confer with flesh and blood? How good it would be if we all brought ourselves with our needs and problems directly to the Lord! If we would be today&rsquo;s apostles, we should follow Paul&rsquo;s pattern in not going up to Jerusalem to confer with others.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Galatians &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
