My daughter suffers terribly from demon possession.</p><p>24 &nbsp;But He answered and said, I was not <sup>1</sup>sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</p><p class="bold">25 &nbsp;But she came and worshipped Him, saying, <sup>1</sup>Lord, help me!</p> <p class="bold">26 &nbsp;But He answered and said, It is not good to take the children&#8217;s bread and throw it to the little dogs.</p> <p class="bold">27 &nbsp;And she said, Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters&#8217; table.</p><p class="bold">28 &nbsp;Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you as you wish. And her daughter was healed from that hour.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>21<sup>1</sup> The further troubling by the rejecting religionists caused the heavenly King to depart farther from them, even into the districts of Tyre and Sidon, into a Gentile land.</p><p>22<sup>1</sup> Because of the rejection by the religious Jews, the opportunity to contact the heavenly King came to the Gentiles, even to a weak Gentile woman.</p><p>22<sup>2</sup> The title Lord implies Christ&#8217;s divinity, and the title Son of David, His humanity. It was proper for this woman, a Gentile, to address Christ as &#8220;Lord.&#8221; However, she had no right to call Him &#8220;Son of David&#8221;; only the children of Israel were privileged to do so.</p><p>24<sup>1</sup> The Lord was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. However, at this time He came to a Gentile region, thus affording the Gentiles an opportunity to participate in His grace. This bears dispensational significance, showing that Christ came to the Jews first and that because of their unbelief, His salvation turned to the Gentiles (Acts 13:46; Rom. 11:11).</p><p>25<sup>1</sup> This second time she addressed Christ only as &#8220;Lord,&#8221; not as &#8220;Son of David,&#8221; because she realized that she was not a child of Israel but a heathen.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Here [in verse 26] another opportunity was created for [the heavenly King] to reveal Himself, this time as the children&#8217;s bread. The Canaanite woman considered Him the Lord-a divine person-and the Son of David-a royal descendant, great and high in His reign. But He unveiled Himself to her as small pieces of bread, good for food. This implies that as the heavenly King, He rules over His people by feeding them with Himself as bread. We can be the proper people in His kingdom only by being nourished with Him as our food. To eat Christ as our supply is the way to be the kingdom people in the reality of the kingdom.</p><p>The Lord said that the children&#8217;s bread should not be thrown to the dogs. This indicates that in the eyes of the Lord all the heathen are dogs, which are unclean in the eyes of God (Lev. 11:27).</p><p>The Canaanite woman, not offended by the Lord&#8217;s word but admitting that she was a heathen dog, considered that at that time Christ, after being rejected by the children, the Jews, became crumbs under the table as a portion to the Gentiles. The holy land of Israel was the table on which Christ, the heavenly bread, had come as a portion to the children of Israel. But they threw Him off the table to the ground, the Gentile land, so that He became broken crumbs as a portion to the Gentiles. What a realization this Gentile woman had at that time! No wonder the heavenly King admired her faith (v. 28).
