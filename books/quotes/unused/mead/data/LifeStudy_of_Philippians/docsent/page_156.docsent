   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUFFERING FOR THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This process of obtaining Christ, as revealed in verse 10, is to know Him by knowing the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, if we would know the power of Christ s resurrection, we must share in His sufferings and know the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In a very real sense, Christ s sufferings have not yet been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When some hear this, they may say, Christ died, was buried, and was resurrected once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now He is on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can you say that His sufferings have not been completed?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Consider Paul s word in Colossians 1:24: Now I rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be sure, Christ is on the throne, but there is still a lack with respect to His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the Head, Christ s sufferings are complete.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the sufferings of Christ for the Body are not yet finished.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such sufferings are also called His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, in Colossians 1:24 Paul regarded his own sufferings as the filling up of what is lacking of Christ s sufferings for His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, Paul indicates in Philippians 3:10 that we need to share in Christ s sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The sufferings of Christ for His Body are still going on, and we need to share in them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Christ was on earth, He suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As those who follow Him, we must share in His sufferings for His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we would know Christ by experiencing the power of His resurrection, we must share His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The process of obtaining Christ is related to His resurrection, His sufferings, and His death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To know Him we must share His sufferings and be conformed to His death that we may experience the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>FREE FROM EARTHLY ENTANGLEMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 10 opens with the infinitive to know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This infinitive is related to a compound predicate found in verses 8 and 9: that I may gain Christ and be found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First we need to suffer the loss of all things and count them as refuse that we may gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To gain Christ in this way is not simply to believe in Him or receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is to count all things as loss, to suffer the loss of all things, and then to count them as refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul was one who suffered the loss of all things and counted them refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was free from all earthly entanglements.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To gain Christ he had given up everything, including religion and culture, and counted it all as refuse, trash, dog food.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, the way was clear for Paul to gain Christ and to be found in Him in order to know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The rendering to know Him is a literal translation of the Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many versions, however, do not use the infinitive.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, they say that I may know Him, or in order that I may know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, according to the Greek, Paul was saying that he wanted to gain Christ and be found in Him to know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Like Paul, we need to be free from all earthly entanglements and also count everything as refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we shall be able to say, Lord Jesus, I care only for You.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I want to gain You, be found in You, and know You.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have pointed out that the obtaining in verse 12 is a continuation of the gaining of Christ in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul s desire was to gain Christ in order to know Him and obtain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul was seeking to gain Christ that he might obtain Him by knowing Him, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>CHRIST S RESURRECTION AND SUFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To know Him refers to knowing Christ in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But knowing the power of Christ s resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings and being conformed to His death are details related to knowing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually to know Christ here means to know the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some Christians claim that they have known Christ for years, but they do not know the power of Christ s resurrection, although they may realize that Christ is powerful and that He displayed this power by raising Lazarus from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, the resurrection of Lazarus is very different from the power of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, Lazarus died and was again buried in the tomb, but Christ s resurrection was a resurrection that brought Him to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When Paul speaks of the power of Christ s resurrection, he has in mind something different from the power manifested in the resurrection of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul is speaking of a resurrection that can be called Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He wanted to know the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In verse 10 Paul mentions the fellowship of Christ s sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is possible to suffer without participating in Christ s sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, someone may lose his job because he fails to work properly, and this may cause him to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But this suffering has nothing to do with Christ s sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is also a difference between those sufferings which are for our transformation and those which are for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul s word in 3:10 does not refer to suffering for transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we compare 3:10 with Colossians 1:24, we shall see that the sufferings about which he is speaking here are those which make up the lack of Christ s afflictions for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is when we suffer for the Body that we shall experience the power of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No doubt, sufferings are needed for us to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But we should not identify such sufferings with the sufferings of Christ, for He did not suffer in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many Christians do not even have a proper understanding of those sufferings which are for transformation, much less those sufferings which are for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some Bible teachers stress suffering as a discipline or punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They warn others to obey the Lord and to walk according to the Word of God, lest they be disciplined by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some use Hebrews 12 to point out that sufferings may work to make us holy v. 10 . However, they often do not explain what it means to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the book of Romans Paul does not speak of suffering as a discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, he refers to transformation and conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Romans 8:28 says that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Certain Bible teachers place great emphasis on this verse without connecting it to the following verse, which indicates that God s intention is to have us conformed to the image of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This conformation is the result of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All things work together for our good that we may be transformed and conformed to the image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>No doubt, this process involves suffering, suffering which helps us become mature sons.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As we undergo this kind of suffering, we also can experience the power of Christ s resurrection, but not as much as when we suffer for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Just as there is more than one kind of suffering, there is more than one kind of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>All the dead will be resurrected, some to the resurrection of life and others to the resurrection of judgment John 5:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The kind of resurrection with which we are concerned in this message is Christ s resurrection and its power.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Not many Christians know the power of this unique resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Knowing the power of Christ s resurrection is related to knowing the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Paul experienced the power of Christ s resurrection in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When we suffer for the sake of the Body in the name of Christ, we also shall experience the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I can testify that when I am bold to stand for the Lord, I experience anointing and empowering.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However, if you are ashamed to say that you are a Christian, especially a Christian in the church life, you will have no power.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But if you testify that you are a Christian standing on the church ground, you will be empowered.</S>
