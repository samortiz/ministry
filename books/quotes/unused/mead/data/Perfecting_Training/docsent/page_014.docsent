   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EATING, NOT FAULT-FINDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I am invited to any dinner, I only know how to eat; I don t know how to investigate.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes, however, I noticed that when a poor eater was invited to dinner, he didn t eat.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather he tried his best to find bones in the chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was not a chicken eater; he was a chicken-bone finder.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It seems his job was to find the bones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have put out many issues of The Stream magazine and many life-study messages for people to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What a shame that this poor man was only looking for bones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We put out these messages only for the eaters; we never put them out for people to find bones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There may be some bones in every message.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The American way of cooking fish is just to have the filet, but the Chinese way is to cook the whole fish.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They serve the tail, the bones, the fins everything on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you like to find fault, you can find all the faults in the Chinese cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the Chinese cooking is not to afford you a way to find fault; it is to afford you the whole fish for your eating.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What you eat and what you taste is the meat of the fish.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Forget about the bones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have to realize that without the bones the fish could not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I used to receive many letters and phone calls.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of all the letters I received, some of them were from mental cases.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And mental cases always include a strong opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whoever writes me a letter with a strong opinion I always consider that to be somewhat a mental case.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is really true.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you are so opinionated you are mentally ill.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We invite people to our dinner to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The life-studies of Genesis, of Revelation, of Matthew, and of John are all for you to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not present these things for people to study to find the bones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1936 Brother Watchman Nee and I were in Tientsin, the northern port which was quite close to the old capital of Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was very much sorrowful about one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He had put out a booklet concerning how to get yourself comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was a good booklet to comfort some suffering ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then a man who was so opinionated criticized Brother Nee saying that the translation of the text of that verse was not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Nee came to me pointing out that he had published that little booklet to comfort people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But that person did not get one bit of comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was only bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brother Nee had invited people to eat the chicken, but there was an eater who would not eat the chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather he was bothered by the chicken bones.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a real picture of today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all have to learn one lesson: in the church life we only know how to eat the chicken; we don t know how to count how many pieces of bones there are.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Learn to get nourishment, forgetting all the faults.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you can do this, it is a strong sign that you have been delivered from the custom, the habit, of being opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How could we be such?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is only one way remain in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever you get out of your spirit, right away you have your opinion concerning everything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If four brothers come together not in the spirit, they will be full of opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without the Lord s salvation in our spirit, our daily life is just a life of opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Consider your talk at the dining table with your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You talk about this person; you talk about that person; you talk about that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All this talk is opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If this word concerning opinion would impress you, tomorrow morning you will have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever you open your mouth there is nothing but opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Opinion is a strong sign that you are out of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When you remain in the spirit the opinion is peeled off.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Five weeks have passed since the last meeting we had concerning the peeling off of opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I would like to ask how many of your opinions have been peeled off.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This tells us how much you have remained in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you say that in these past five weeks, no opinion has been peeled off, that is a poor sign.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That signifies that you have not been remaining in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>My experience of the past few weeks has been that mostly I have been much more aware of how little I am in the spirit because my opinion is a strong indication that I am not one spirit with the Lord at that moment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I really appreciate what was said the last time we were together: it is at the very moment that we prayed the prayer that brings us into the spirit that we are the Lord, and we are one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I must admit and speak fairly that a good portion of time the opinion is there, and it is so easy to express something with my wife about someone or about something.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This has been a real exposure to show me how little time I spend in the spirit.</S>
