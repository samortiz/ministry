<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fellowship of the Divine Life,<br>between the Believers among Themselves<br>in Their Spirit</H2><P>The fellowship of the apostles is also the fellowship of the divine life, between the believers among themselves in their spirit (vv. 2-3, 7; Phil. 2:1). Among the believers there is a wonderful thing called fellowship. This fellowship is carried on by the Spirit in the believers' regenerated spirit. Hence, in Philippians 2:1 it is called "fellowship of [our] spirit."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit<br>in All the Believers</H2><P>The fellowship of the apostles is also the fellowship of the Holy Spirit in all the believers. Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all." These three&#151;love, grace, and fellowship&#151;are not three separate things; rather, they are three aspects of one thing. The fellowship of the Spirit carries with it the grace of Christ, and within the grace of Christ is the love of God. Thus, these three items are just one divine gift as a portion to us, that is, the Triune God Himself in three aspects: in the Father as love, in the Son as grace, and in the Spirit as the fellowship, the application.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fellowship of the Body of Christ<br>in the Oneness of the Spirit</H2><P>This fellowship is the fellowship of the Body of Christ in the oneness of the Spirit. Ephesians 4:3 tells us to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit, and then verse 4 follows immediately to say, "One Body and one Spirit." These two verses indicate that the oneness of the Spirit is just the fellowship of the Body of Christ. This fellowship of the Body is in the oneness of the Spirit. If we do not have the oneness of the Spirit, we are not enjoying the fellowship of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Exclusions from the Unique Fellowship<br>of the Body of Christ</H2><P>According to the New Testament there are four kinds of exclusions from the unique fellowship of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Removal of the Believers Living in Gross Sins</H2><P>The believers who live in gross sins should be excluded from the unique fellowship of the Body of Christ. Some of the believers in Corinth not only committed gross sins occasionally but also lived in gross sins. In 1 Corinthians 5:9-13 the apostle taught us to remove this kind of person from our midst. However, many Christians interpret the word remove as excommunicate. This is a mistake. The sense here is not excommunicate but remove. The removing here is not an excommunication but a form of quarantining, as is used to isolate those who are sick of a contagious disease (cf. 2 Cor. 2:1-8).</P><P>In his writing of 1 Corinthians 5:13 Paul quoted the word remove from the Septuagint. In Leviticus and Numbers God charged the Israelites to "remove" a leper from their fellowship that this one might be healed (Lev. 13:45-46). After his healing, such a one was to be brought back into the fellowship (Lev. 14). The dealing here with a leper was a quarantining. This, not excommunication, is what is meant in 1 Corinthians 5:13 by the removal of one who is living in gross sin.</P>
