<P>In the present age, the age of grace, we are enjoying Christ as our Passover, as our unleavened bread, and as the firstfruit offered to God in resurrection. Eventually, we offer Christ to God as our Pentecost, which is the consummation of God's work for His new creation. The food offered to God by the believers who experience Christ as the reality of all the feasts from Passover to Pentecost has nothing to do with the old creation but is altogether in the new creation. Eventually, the church in this age of grace will consummate God's will in His new creation. The church will be matured and will be raptured to be one with Christ in His joyous wedding. Then the church will come down with Christ to the earth, at which time He will blow the trumpet to gather the Israelites back to the land of their fathers. Christ will then be their propitiation, and the feast of tabernacles will begin.</P><P>At this juncture, I would like to ask a question: What is God's food? What is God's food in our daily life, in the Christian life, and in the life of Israel? To be sure, we all would say that God's food is Christ. But this raises another question: In what way is Christ God's food? Christ is God's food in the way of His fulfilling God's eternal economy. God desires to have His economy fulfilled by Christ, with Christ, and in Christ. This is the way Christ is God's food.</P><P>The more we enjoy Christ and experience Christ, the more we fulfill God's economy, and the more we participate in the fulfillment of God's economy, the more we will be able to offer Christ to God as food. Our being resurrected with Christ in His resurrection and our being saved are parts of the fulfillment of God's economy. The exercise of our New Testament priesthood to preach the gospel by visiting people, helping them to believe in the Lord Jesus, and baptizing them is also a part of the fulfillment of God's economy. Likewise, living a life in Christ without sin after we have been saved is a part of the fulfillment of God's economy with Christ, by Christ, and in Christ. In all these matters Christ is food for God.</P><P>Both the church and Israel are great parts of the fulfillment of God's economy. When the church was formed on the day of Pentecost and so many were baptized into one Body, God enjoyed a wonderful feast. Israel's being gathered, their repenting, and their being propitiated at the time of the Lord's coming back will be further parts of the fulfillment of God's economy. Once again, Christ will be enjoyed by God's people and also by God Himself. In these matters related to Israel, Christ will be God's food. Furthermore, in the millennium and for eternity in the New Jerusalem, Christ will be God's food.</P><P>In Numbers 28 and 29 there are three sections&#151;the sections pertaining to daily life, to the Christian life, and to the future of Israel. Each section is for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy in which Christ is the centrality and the universality. Because Christ is everything for the fulfillment of God's economy, He is God's food, God's satisfaction. For eternity Christ will be God's satisfaction, and for eternity we will enjoy the Christ who satisfies God. Hallelujah for the Christ who is God's food and also our food!</P>
