   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In John s Line Righteousness with Light</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The enjoyment of the divine nature is mainly to enjoy the divine love and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Peter did not stress the divine life but the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The ultimate development of the divine nature is love, agape, and this love issues in holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John mentions that God is love, but he does not stress love that much.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, he stresses light which is the nature of the divine expression.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John tells us in his first Epistle that he preached the eternal life to others that they might be brought into the divine fellowship 1:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through this life, you have received the divine fellowship and if you remain in the divine fellowship, you will enjoy God as light 1:5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The message which John heard from God and announced to others was that God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John stressed that when we enjoy the divine nature, God becomes light to us and we enjoy God as light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This light issues in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Righteousness is the expression of the life partaking of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Peter s line love issues in holiness and in John s line light issues in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Peter stresses holiness; John stresses righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In his first Epistle he calls the Lord the Righteous One 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Righteousness is the issue of light.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you are in the light, you do everything right.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you do everything wrongly and foolishly, this means that you are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You do not know where you are going, what you are doing, or what you are speaking because you are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, when you are in the light, everything becomes crystal clear to you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You know where you are, what you are doing, where you should go, what you should do, and what you should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In John s writing, he was trying to inoculate the believers against a heresy which taught that the believers did not have sin and that they did not need to make any confession of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John proved in his Epistle that even though we have been regenerated, we still have sin within us and there is the possibility that we will commit sins 1 John 1:8 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John indicates that if we remain in the fellowship and enjoy God as light there is no way that we can say that we are not sinful anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We still have a sinful nature and there is still some possibility that we may fall into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we need to confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John then goes on to talk about righteousness which is the opposite of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Anything that is unrighteous is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He says that If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness 1 John 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To cleanse us from all unrighteousness is to make us right.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Light in Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First John 2:29 says, If you have known that He is righteous, you know also that everyone who practices righteousness has been begotten of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then 1 John 3:7 tells us that he who practices righteousness is righteous, even as that One is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verses like these indicate clearly that enjoying God as light issues in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Love separates us from being common, and light makes us right in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we are in darkness, we do everything wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Light regulates us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the place in which we are is in darkness, our walk is not regulated since we cannot see where we are going.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Light always regulates us and keeps us in order.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Righteousness comes out of the enjoyment of God as light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Light is the nature of the divine expression and righteousness is the expression of the life partaking of the divine nature, the expression of the life that enjoys God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you are in the light and are enjoying God as light, you will have an expression that you are right in everything and with everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When you do things wrongly and when you do wrong things to others, this is a strong indication that you are not in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can prove this by our experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nothing else tests or proves our Christian life as much as the marriage life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How good or how bad a husband is is always proved in the eyes of his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No one knows a brother as thoroughly as his wife does.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether or not he has stayed with the Lord and remained in fellowship with the Lord is known by her.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whenever a husband loses his temper with his wife, he knows nothing, he is the most foolish person, and he speaks nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is absolutely not right because he is in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, when a brother stays with the Lord, remaining in His fellowship and enjoying Him as love and as light, he becomes holy and righteous in the sight of his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As an issue of being in the light the husband does everything right and says everything right.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is possible for one to pretend to be something in others eyes, but you cannot pretend to be anything in the eyes of your spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He or she knows the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When you stay in the divine fellowship, however, the other party of your marriage knows and can testify that you are different.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The enjoyment of God as love makes us holy and the enjoyment of God as light makes us right.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Light is the essence of righteousness, and righteousness is the shining of light.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In conclusion, holiness is the issue of the enjoyment of the divine love and righteousness is the issue of the enjoyment of the divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The ultimate consummation of holiness is the enjoyment of God as love, and the ultimate consummation of righteousness is the enjoyment of God as light.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The issue of our partaking of and enjoying the divine nature is holiness and righteousness.</S>
