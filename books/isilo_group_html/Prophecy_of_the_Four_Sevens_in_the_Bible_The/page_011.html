Putting Forth Leaves<br>Signifying the Outward Activities</H2><P>When the Jews regained Jerusalem in 1967, that was the fig tree putting forth its leaves. One of the final signs that will take place will be the rebuilding of the temple. According to recent news reports, some of the Jews are preparing for the rebuilding of the temple with all its services. The temple of God will be rebuilt before the Lord comes back (cf. Matt. 24:15; 2 Thes. 2:4).</P><P>In view of the Lord's coming back, we need to consider the world situation today. The tendency of the development in the political, economical, and military situation in Europe is toward that of a strong man rising up. This strong man will be the one who will sign the seven-year covenant with Israel. From the day that this strong man, Antichrist, signs this covenant with Israel, there are seven years left to the end of the present age. After three and a half years, he will break this covenant, and the second half of three and a half years will be the time of the great tribulation. Just before the initiation of the great tribulation, the overcomers of Christ will be raptured. If the believers who are alive at that time are not ready and matured, they will be left on the earth to pass through the time of the great tribulation. The tribulation will come from three directions: from God, from Antichrist, and from Satan. God will judge the entire universe by supernatural calamities, making the earth unsuitable for living. Satan and Antichrist will do their best to destroy and damage mankind.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4.

Summer signifies the age of the restoration of the nation of Israel (Acts 1:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5.

Watching and Being Ready to Be Taken,<br>by Being "Stolen" by the Appearing Lord<br>as the Secret "Thief," into His Presence<br>(Parousia) in the Heavens</H2><P>We need to watch and be ready to be taken, by being "stolen" by the appearing Lord as the secret "thief," into His presence (parousia) in the heavens (Matt. 24:40-44). A thief comes to steal precious things at an unknown time. The Lord will come secretly as a stealing thief to steal you if you are so precious.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Prophecy of the Four 'Sevens' in the Bible &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
