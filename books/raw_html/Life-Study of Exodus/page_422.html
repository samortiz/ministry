<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">THE PRIESTLY GARMENTS</h1><h1 class="title">(14)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 28:30; Lev. 8:8; Num. 27:21; Deut. 33:8-10; Ezra 2:63; 1 Sam. 23:6, 9-12; 28:6</h1><p>In the foregoing messages we pointed out that the Urim is a type of Christ as the illuminator burning with oil, the Spirit, by fire from the altar, the cross. We have also seen that the Thummim typifies Christ as the perfecter. As the Thummim, Christ is the alphabet for inscription and completion. Many Christians today do not have Christ inscribed into them in a clear, definite way. But even if we have the definite experience of Christ and the clear inscription of Christ, we still are not complete. Therefore, we need Christ to be added to us to be our completion. In this message we shall go further to see today&rsquo;s application of the Urim and the Thummim.</p><h2 class="head1">TODAY&rsquo;S APPLICATION</h2><p>The twelve transparent stones in the breastplate indicate that the saints should be transparent in order for Christ to shine through them so that God&rsquo;s will may be shown. Suppose the twelve stones on the breastplate had been opaque instead of transparent. Furthermore, suppose nothing had been inscribed on any of the stones and no light was shining. Then the stones would have been opaque, without inscription, and without the shining of light. In such a case it would be impossible to use the breastplate to find out God&rsquo;s will, God&rsquo;s leading. This is the situation in most Christian groups today. There is no transparency, inscription, or light. It is very possible that this may be the situation of some local churches.</p><p>Many years ago in mainland China I visited some so-called churches. It seemed to me that everyone in these groups was opaque, altogether lacking in transformation and transparency. Furthermore, little of Christ had been inscribed into the saints. It seemed they had Christ in name, but they were very short of the experience of Christ. Moreover, there was no light among them. What they needed was a very basic, elementary kind of help. God&rsquo;s will could not be made known through them.</p><p>If you consider the condition of the majority of Christians today according to what we have covered in these messages, you will realize that in most cases with the believers there is opaqueness instead of transparency. There is virtually nothing of the inscription of Christ. Instead of the shining of light, there is darkness.</p><p>If as a local church we would be used by God as a breastplate, we all must be transparent, and we must have Christ inscribed into us. This means that we must have some definite experiences of Christ as the letters in God&rsquo;s spiritual alphabet. Our experience of Christ must not be vague. Rather, it should be clear and definite. However, the situation among most Christians, including us, is very different from this.</p><p>If we have been enlightened by the Lord and if we are bearing the burden of the Lord&rsquo;s interests, we shall be troubled by the situation among God&rsquo;s people. The more we consider the situation and condition of both the saints and the churches, the more burdened we shall be. We shall be deeply concerned about the lack of transparency, the lack of inscribing, and the shortage of light.</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE LORD&rsquo;S LEADING<br />CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h2><p>Today&rsquo;s application of the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim also requires that the leading ones bear the saints and Christ on their hearts so that they may know the condition of the saints and the completion of Christ for God&rsquo;s leading. In every local church there should be a group of leading ones who bear the saints and Christ on their heart. These leading ones need to see the Lord&rsquo;s shining and read the saints. Then they will be able to receive God&rsquo;s leading concerning the church in their locality.</p>
