<h2 class="head2">Visitation and Edification of New Believers</h2><p>The new believers' edification has to be done with proper arrangements as well. Once our gospel visitation is strengthened and the number of new believers increases, there is the need of proper edification and perfection. Otherwise, the church will be overburdened. If we do not have a good new believers' edification program in the first year, it will be harder to make it up in the second year. If a baby does not open his mouth the first year after his birth, it will be hard to open his mouth eight or ten years later. This same principle applies in the church. If a man does not open his mouth in the first year, he will remain dumb after ten or twenty years. Dumbness is a matter of habit.</p><p>If we do not edify the new ones properly, we will add more burden to the church; many brothers and sisters will be brought into the church life in a muddled way. This easily will bring in worldly elements and human opinions. If this is the case, case the more people we save, the less spiritual the church will become, and the more problems we will have. Every worker must be clear that he has a double responsibility. On the one hand, he has to push people through the gate. On the other hand, he has to lead them on the way.</p><p>The goal of the new believers' meeting is to develop the proper habit and character in the new believers. Let me use myself as an example. When I was saved in 1919, I sometimes prayed twenty times a day and sometimes did not pray at all. I was very loose. The same could be said about my reading of the Bible. It was unstructured. When I was stirred up, I would read fifty or sixty chapters a day. When I was cold, I did not want to touch the Bible at all. It was only for conscience's sake that I would read one or two verses. I lived this way because I had not received good training and edification during the first year of my Christian life. The second year after being saved I went to Shanghai and met Miss Groves. She was a co-worker of Miss Barber. She asked me, "Do you read the Bible?" I was very clever, and I answered, "Yes." But she pressed further by asking, "How much?" I felt ashamed and dropped my head, saying, "Sometimes more, and sometimes less when I do not feel like reading." She testified, "From the time I was seven years old until now, I have memorized one verse a day. I am fifty-seven years old now. (She lived until well over seventy years old.) From the day that I became a Christian, I have never woken up after six o'clock." Her word pinned me down. During those few months, I was trained by her. This was a tremendous help to me in my later walk with the Lord.</p><p>We have to do the same with the new believers. Sometimes we have to walk with them for a while or stand on the street corner and recite a verse with them before letting them go. We have to learn to pick up the proper habit. We can prepare a prayer list and pray for the new ones every day. We have to study the Bible and remind each other to do the same thing every day. Then we have to help the new ones to do the same. This kind of training helps all of us develop a habit of godliness.</p><p>Reading the Bible and praying are not the only things that we should do; we have to help the new ones develop the habit of leading others to Christ. During the above mentioned period of time, I went to see Miss Groves every Saturday. She would ask me how many people I had saved that week. If I said that no one had been saved, she would say, "See, you have not saved anyone for a whole week. How many will you save this month? How many will you save this year?" The leading brothers have to learn to pin down the young ones step by step. We have to tell them that if they do not run a straight course, the ones coming after them will follow their example and will not have a proper walk. Once we relax in the new believers' edification, the church will be full of worldly Christians. Hong Kong has over two million people. We can easily gain some people if we work. We must not allow the brothers and sisters to have a concept that they can sit back comfortably in the church life.</p><p>The first year after I was saved, I brought a person to the Lord who was working as a cook for a Western missionary in Kuling. That was the result of preaching to him continuously for a few days on the mountain. I forgot his name and thought that no one would listen to me because I was just a boy. The first time I met Miss Groves, she asked, "You have been a Christian for a year. How many people have you saved?" I had been afraid that she would ask, and I lowered my head and said, "One." She said, "Do you have the audacity to tell me that you have saved only one?" She asked for the name of the person. I only knew that this one was a cook. She said again, "You only brought one to the Lord, and you don't know his name!" Later, she taught me how to deal with my sins. She taught me to make a prayer list and to persevere in prayer. Thank the Lord, in the second year I brought over sixty to the Lord.</p><p>If we do not study the Bible conscientiously, we cannot be a proper Christian. Throughout church history, it has been commonly recognized that no one can know the Lord properly if he does not study the Word properly. Not only do the young ones have to study; even the older ones have to do the same. The older ones have to check with the younger ones about their reading, and the younger ones have to check with the older ones about their reading. I give the younger ones the authority to check with the older ones so that the older ones will not be lazy. This is the only way for the church to become strong.</p><p>If a person develops the proper Christian habits at the beginning of his Christian life, it will be easy for him to go on as a Christian. Prayer, reading the Word, and leading men to salvation&mdash;these are things that we have to build up in a proper way. If we do, there will not be so many easygoing Christians. Once the number of easygoing Christians increases, the proper church service will disappear. Before we can go on in a proper way, we must build up these habits from the beginning. The fifty-two lessons for edifying new believers are the foundation. If you did not pick them up last year, you have to do so this year. We spoke about them in 1950. We still will speak about them in 1960. The subjects do not need to change. There is no need for improvement, because there is no need for advancement with foundational work.</p>
