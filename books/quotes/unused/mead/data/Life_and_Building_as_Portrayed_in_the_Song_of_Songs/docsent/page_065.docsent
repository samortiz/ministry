   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRACTICAL CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Up to the first part of this century the Lord used many different saints to recover numerous items for His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nearly all of the items that needed to be recovered have been recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now, the Lord's intention is to put all of the items of His recovery together to build up the local lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord's recovery today is simply the building up of the local lampstands, or in other words, the real practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is so practical.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nearly all of the spiritual things have been recovered, and today the Lord is seeking the real practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not simply some teaching, revelation, vision, theory, or principle of the Body that the Lord is seeking, but a real, solid practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the real building up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many of us can testify that until we came to the practical church life, we were never satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The day we came to the church, we realized we were home.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We were home because the Lord in us was home.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But simply to come to the church is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At first the church life is so sweet to us, and we have a real honeymoon.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But a honeymoon cannot last forever.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sooner or later we may begin to have some problems with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How good it was to get into the church life, but gradually, the dear ones become not so dear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We know that we should love them, but it is so hard to love them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This exposes our real need of building up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a group of brothers are living together in the brothers' house, it is so sweet at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everyone quotes Psalm 133: "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But after a while dwelling together is not so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At this point some leave.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They simply cannot take it any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is because they do not have the building up, and they do not want the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE MAIN LESSON</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The main lesson I have learned in all these years is the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people are seeking to be holy and spiritual, but without being built up they are still short of the Lord's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Though some may be holy and spiritual, without the building they are still unable to fulfill God's consummate purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If holiness and spirituality are not for the building up of the local church, they are still short of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's purpose is the building, and this can be proved by the end of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All God's work throughout the centuries and the generations is for the building up of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What comes forth at the end of the Bible is not a group of spiritual persons or holy people, but a built-up city.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is all God cares for.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He does not care merely for our being holy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He does not care merely for our being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The only thing He eventually cares for is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you are not in the building, you are missing the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In God's eyes, there is nothing in every locality but a lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the spiritual persons must lose their identity to be built up into the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the lessons in the brothers' houses are for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All experiences are for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Anything that is not for the building is not of much worth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even salvation is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Peter was brought to the Lord, he was given a new name indicating that he was to be a stone in God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord saved Peter so that he could be built up in His church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>SHAMING THE ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By the Lord's mercy, we are not here simply to be Christians or to have good meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are not here for anything but the building.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God needs a building in Los Angeles, and He needs a building in your city.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nothing shames the enemy as much as the building.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As long as we are built up together, the enemy is put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The enemy has been boasting much to the Lord throughout the centuries concerning the divisive situation of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But I believe the Lord is telling him now, "Satan, wait for a little while and you will see a building in Los Angeles and in so many other cities!"</S>
