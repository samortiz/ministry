The Offerer's Portion</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Flesh of the Cattle&#151;the Supply of Christ</H2><P>The flesh of the cattle signifies the rich supply of Christ as our nourishment (7:15-18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) Of the Peace Offering<br>for Thanksgiving (of Emotion)<br>Good for Eating for One Day</H2><P>The meat of the cattle of the peace offering for thanksgiving is good for only one day (v. 15). It can last only one day because the motive of this offering is shallow. It is presented out of the offerer's emotion, so it does not last very long. Our experience testifies of this. Sometimes we offer something to the Lord out of our emotions, but within a short time it disappears.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) Of the Peace Offering for a Vow or a Voluntary Offering (of the Will) Good for Eating for Two Days</H2><P>The meat of the cattle of the peace offering for a vow or a voluntary offering (of the will) is good for eating for two days (vv. 16-18). The peace offering for thanksgiving is something emotional, whereas the one for a vow is something of the will and is stronger and deeper. We need to help the saints to realize that an emotional offering is good, but it does not last too long. We need to go deeper to present a voluntary offering. Because He is the Lord and we are His redeemed, we should do something in a voluntary way. There is no emotion involved here, but something strongly motivated from our will. This offering can last for two days because it is stronger.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Cakes of All Four Kinds as Described<br>in 1), 2), 3), and 4), under 2a&#151;Christ<br>in His Humanity as Food to His Offerer</H2><P>The four kinds of cakes which we have described earlier signify Christ in His humanity as food to His offerer (Lev. 7:12-13). They are the portion of enjoyment to the offerer. The more we offer, the more food we have.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Congregation's Portion</H2><P>The congregation's portion for their enjoyment is the flesh of the cattle, signifying the supply of Christ for nourishment, under the condition of cleanness (Lev. 7:19-21; 1 Cor. 5:8-11, 13b). The entire congregation enjoys the meat of the cattle, but they do not have a share of the cakes. The condition for the entire congregation to enjoy, to participate in, the peace offering is that they must be clean. First Corinthians 5 points out that today we are keeping the real Feast of Unleavened Bread. We need to keep this feast without any leaven, that is, without any sinful things. Whoever is living in sinful things should be cut off from the fellowship of the church, the Body. Such ones have no share in the enjoyment of the peace offering. This strongly indicates that today any saint who is still involved in sinful things cannot have the fellowship of the Lord's table. He has to be cut off from the fellowship of the Body.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Basic Lessons on Service &nbsp; pg 58</div><br></body></html>
