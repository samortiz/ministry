   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By His Blood</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Old Testament times only the high priest could enter into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once a year he brought the atoning blood and sprinkled it upon the expiation cover.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That was the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Hebrews 10 we are told that now, in the New Testament age, there is a new way of entering into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This new way is not only for the high priest but for all believers, not by the blood of goats and bulls but by the blood of Jesus, and not through an unrent veil but through a veil that has been rent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we may pass through the rent veil, enter into the Holy of Holies, and go directly to the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The blood of Jesus opens the way for us to come into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because the Lord has opened the way and brings us in, we may enjoy God in the Holy of Holies and daily be infused with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The living way, the way to the tree of life, has been opened by the blood of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This opened way has now become the new and living way for us to come into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, through the redeeming blood of Christ, we can once again enjoy the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To enter the Holy of Holies is to come before God in order to contact God and pray to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is by means of the redeeming blood shed by the Lord Jesus on the cross that washes away all sins, which hinder our fellowship with God 1 John 1:3, 6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through His blood, He has brought us before God so that we might become a new creation to take the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because we are sinful in the old nature and in the flesh, there is no other way to enter into our spirit and remain in the spirit than through the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are careless with God and our fellowship with Him, we may not sense that we are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is because regardless of how spiritual we may be, we are still in the old nature, the self, the soul, and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if we care for our fellowship with the Lord and desire to enter into the Holy of Holies, we will immediately sense a condemnation within.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we mean business with the Lord to come into His presence, we will sense that we need the cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes we may not sense a particular problem, but we may still have a general sense that we are dirty because we are still in the old nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we need the blood to cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is through the blood and by the blood that we can enter into the Holy of Holies, that is, into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through the Veil, His Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The veil in Hebrews 10:20 is the second veil 9:3 within the tabernacle; this veil typifies the flesh of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Christ s flesh was crucified, this veil was rent Matt 27:51 , thus opening the way for us, who were alienated from God, who is signified by the tree of life Gen 3:22-24 , to enter into the Holy of Holies to contact Him and take Him as the tree of life for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This implies that because our old man was crucified with Christ, we have an open way to contact and enjoy God in our spirit as our life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The way by which we enter into the Father is the crucified Jesus and resurrected Christ with His redemption Heb 10:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Jesus was crucified, the veil that separated man from God was rent from top to bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His crucifixion opened the way and made Him the way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephesians 2:18 says, Through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This verse indicates that through Christ as the way we have access in the Spirit unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we call upon the name of the Lord, we have the sense that we are in the presence of God and that God is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today the Triune God is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually, Christ as this life-giving Spirit is the access for us to touch God and enter into Him.</S>
