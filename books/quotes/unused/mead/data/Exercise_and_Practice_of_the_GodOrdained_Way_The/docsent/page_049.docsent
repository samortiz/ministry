   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPEAKING TO THOSE WHO USE THE WORLD SITUATION AS AN EXCUSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some people like to use the situations existing in the world as an excuse to reject the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They reason that if there is a God, why would He allow so many things to happen?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They mention the wars with so many people being killed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Others reason that God should perform miracles to take care of all these problems.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One of the most common questions raised by thoughtful persons is why God would allow these sorts of things to occur.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can answer such a question by saying, "Yes, you are really right.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nearly every thoughtful person would ask the same question.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Honestly speaking, I don't know how to answer you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This question is too great.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I can answer you, I must be God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is mysterious, and we do not understand everything that He does.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But one thing we know is that in the Bible He tells us that He wants us to repent and that He wants us to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now, I don't know that much, but I must tell you I do know that I should repent, and I did.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I do know that I should believe in the Lord Jesus, and I did.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I also know that God wants you to receive His salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This approach condenses all the potential problems into one point.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way you save yourself from being tempted into a misleading problem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You could argue with him three days and three nights without result.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more you argue, the more he has to say.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You should not follow him into these things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You must say something to restrict him, to bring him back to the point for which you came to see him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You came to him to bring him to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Learn never to fight or argue with people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In considering this present case, a good verse with which to bring such a one back to the point is Deuteronomy 29:29 which says, "The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What has God revealed in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible reveals that we are sinners, that we have to repent, and that we have to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Right away you can bring this one to the point toward which you are working.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, if you use your Bible too much, you will fall into Bible teaching rather than conversing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>SPEAKING TO THOSE WHO USE RELIGION AS AN EXCUSE TO REJECT THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Someone may say that he does not want to believe in the Lord Jesus because he has been damaged by religion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He may refer to all the ugly things that are happening these days in religion, such as the preachers who are misleading people and taking their money.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At this juncture we should not discuss religion with such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Forget about that.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, with such a case, it is better to point out to this dear one that today, in this universe, there is God, who is absolutely good and bright.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Also there is Satan, the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is working today, but His enemy, the Devil, is also working.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Matthew 13 the Lord told us that while He is working, the Devil is also working.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why you have wheat, the good ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You also have tares, the bad ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even among His twelve disciples, there was Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Later in the New Testament, a number of Christians were deceived and misled.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But we cannot give up the positive side because of the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not wise to reject being wheat just because of so many tares.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the way we can respond to such a case.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>ANSWERING ACCORDING TO THE KIND OF PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>While you are talking with someone, you can realize what kind of person he is from his attitude or from the tone of his words.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If he is highly educated or quite knowledgeable concerning the Bible, you have to consider how to proceed with him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Your answer must be according to his level of education and according to the amount of knowledge he has about the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If he is not highly educated and not knowledgeable concerning the Bible, you can take a simple, clear way with him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Remember that you should never fight or argue.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do not say "no" to people's words.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, use whatever is brought up by the person to instruct him.</S>
