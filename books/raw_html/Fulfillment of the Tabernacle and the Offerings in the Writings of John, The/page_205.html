<h2 class=head2>Proved to Be without Fault</h2><p>As soon as Pilate ended his conversation with the Lord Jesus, he went out to the Jews and said to them, “I find no fault whatever in him” (v. 38b). In the Lord’s trial before Pilate there was not actually any judgment. Instead, there was a manifestation of the Lord as the King of the kingdom of God and as the living witness to the truth, the universal reality. Furthermore, He was proved to be without fault. He was perfect and was not wrong in anything. Nevertheless, as we shall see in chapter nineteen, they put the Lord Jesus to death.<h2 class=head1>DEATH FOR MULTIPLICATION AND GLORIFICATION</h2><p>Chapter eighteen is a record of the preparation of the great I Am to pass through the process of death for the purpose of multiplication and glorification. We have seen that the emphasis with respect to the Lord’s death in John’s Gospel is on multiplication rather than redemption. The Lord died so that He as the one grain might become many grains in resurrection. This multiplication makes it possible for the Father to have a house with many abodes, for the Son to have many brothers, for the vine to spread through its many branches, and for the new man with its many parts to be born. The first man, Adam, was created by God. But the second man was not created; rather, the second man was begotten, produced, through Christ’s death and resurrection. The result of Christ’s death and resurrection is multiplication, and this multiplication is the Lord’s glorification.<p>When the Lord Jesus was speaking concerning Himself as the true vine, He said to His disciples, “I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing” (15:5). Concerning this fruit-bearing, the Lord went on to say, “In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit, and you shall become My disciples” (v. 8). Here we see that when the branches of the vine bear fruit, the Father is glorified.<p>The principle is the same with the grain of wheat in 12:24. The one grain fell into the ground and died and then grew up to become many grains. This multiplication of the one grain is the glorification of that grain. In 12:23 and 24, we see the glorification of the Son. The Son’s glorification issues in the Father’s glorification because the Father is glorified in the Son’s glorification. Now we need to see that this glorification is a matter of multiplication, and this multiplication has not ceased.<p>The multiplication is continuing through the fruit-bearing of the many branches of the vine. Christ is the vine, and we are the branches. These branches are actually the many grains produced by the Lord as the one grain. At first, the Lord Jesus was the only grain. Then He was multiplied through death and resurrection to produce many grains. Now we, those who believe in Christ, are the many grains and also the many branches of the vine. As branches, we are destined to bear fruit. This fruit-bearing is also multiplication, and this multiplication is the continuation of the Lord’s glorification.<p>In the synoptic Gospels the Lord commands the disciples to go forth and preach the gospel to disciple the nations. In Matthew 28:19 He says, “Go therefore and disciple all the nations”; in Mark 16:15, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all the creation”; and in Luke 24:47 He says that “repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations.” However, in the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus does not charge us to go forth to preach the gospel in order to win souls. What we have in this Gospel is not gospel preaching but fruit-bearing.<p>Many in the Lord’s recovery are expecting to see more increase. In the divine economy the increase does not come mainly from gospel preaching. Rather, the real increase comes as the result, the issue, of death. As we have pointed out, in chapter twelve there was a golden opportunity for the Lord to be exalted and to have a large crowd following Him. That is the kind of increase valued by many Christians today. Certain preachers enjoy drawing a crowd and having a big following. But according to John 12 to have a crowd follow Him is not the Lord’s way to have His increase. His way is to be multiplied through death. This applies also to us. We may think that the increase will come through gospel preaching. Although I am certainly for the preaching of the gospel, I must tell you that the real increase comes through death. If we want there to be an increase in the Lord’s recovery, we need to die. For the increase, we need to be put to death.
