   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SOUL-LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some who have studied the Bible have pointed out that there are three words for life in Greek: 1 bios, 2 psuche, and 3 zoe.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although all three words denote life, the life which they denote is different.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Bios refers to the physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Lord Jesus said that the widow had cast in all the "living" that she had, He was using this word Luke 21:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Zoe is the highest life, the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever the Bible mentions "eternal life," the word zoe is used for "life."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Psuche is the life which makes a man living; it is man's natural life, that is, the life of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Bible speaks of man's life, it uses this word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What we want to pay attention to now are the words "soul" and "soul-life."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the original language, they are the same word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Old Testament was written in Hebrew, and the New Testament was written in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Old Testament, both "soul" and "soul-life" are nephesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the New Testament, both "soul" and "soul-life" are psuche.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, we see that the soul is one of the three elements of man and is man's life, the very natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In many translations, the word soul is translated as "life."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we will give only a few examples:</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat" Gen 9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"For the life of the flesh is in the blood" Lev 17:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"For those who seek the life of the child" Matt 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save a life or to destroy it?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Luke 6:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ" Acts 15:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"But I consider my life of no account as if precious to myself" Acts 20:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"To give His life as a ransom for many" Matt 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"The good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep" John 10:11, 15, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the above passages, the word life is "soul" in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But we cannot translate it as soul, for that would not make sense.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reason there is this kind of usage is that the soul is man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have said that the soul is one of the three elements of man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The soul-life is man's natural life, the life which enables a person to exist, to be organic, and to live.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is the life which gives man the power to live as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since the Bible has nephesh and psuche to denote both the soul as well as man's own life, we can readily see that these two things, though distinguishable, are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are distinguishable because in some places psuche can be considered the soul or the life, but not vice versa.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, the same word is used many times in Luke 12:19-23 and Mark 3:4, but it cannot be translated into the same word in English.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do, it will not make sense.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the other hand, the soul and man's own life are inseparable because the two things are fully integrated within man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without man's soul, there is no more life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible never tells us that a fleshly person has any life apart from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man's life is the soul that has permeated the body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the soul is joined to the body, the soul becomes man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Life is but an expression of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since our present physical life is the life of the soul, the Bible calls our present body "a soulish body" 1 Cor 15:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This point about the soul being our human life is the most crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This has much to do with our being a spiritual Christian or a soulish Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We will speak more concerning this later.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have seen many verses that prove that the soul contains the faculties of the mind, the emotion, and the will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We know that man's thoughts, imaginations, judgments, feelings, emotions, stimulations, and desires all come from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, man's life is nothing but a life that is joined to the mind, the emotion, and the will.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Man's life is but an expression of the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the things in the natural realm that are included in man's personality are the various faculties of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The soul-life is man's natural life in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The various activities mentioned above in the Scripture, such as love, hatred, knowledge, counsel, vexation, rejoicing, and decisions, are all functions of the soul-life.</S>
