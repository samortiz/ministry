   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE PROCESS OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order for the Lord to pass through the process of death, it was necessary for everything and everyone involved in this process to be prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Judas, Peter, the high priest, and Pilate all had a part in this process.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Judas betrayed the Lord, and Peter, bold in the flesh to resist, first cut off the ear of a slave of the high priest and later denied the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Jewish high priest judged the Lord and rejected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After this rejection, He was transferred by the Jewish religionists to Pilate, the Roman governor.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Pilate had no way to condemn the Lord, but he was forced by the people to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With Judas, Peter, the high priest, and Pilate we see certain steps that were a necessary preparation for the process of death through which the Lord Jesus, the great I Am, passed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not long before the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus, the Roman Empire adopted crucifixion as a method of executing criminals.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No doubt, it was sovereign of God that the Roman Empire adopted this method of executing criminals before the Lord was tried and sentenced to death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Old Testament it was prophesied definitely that the Messiah was to be cut off, crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In John 12 the Lord Jesus also prophesied that He would be lifted up, that is, crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the Jewish way of executing criminals convicted of a capital offense was stoning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, in order for the prophecies concerning the Lord's crucifixion to be fulfilled, it was necessary for Him to be transferred from the Jewish authorities to the authority of the Roman rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, according to Roman law, the Jews were not allowed to execute criminals.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Concerning this, John 18:31 says, "Pilate said then to them, You take him and judge him according to your law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to kill anyone."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the next verse, this took place so that "the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which He spoke, signifying what kind of death He was about to die."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the matter of executing the Lord Jesus was left to Pilate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The transfer of the Lord Jesus from the Jewish religionists to the Roman rulers led to the death of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>CHRIST BEFORE PILATE The King of the Kingdom of God</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Lord Jesus was before Pilate, Pilate actually did not judge Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, Pilate held a conversation with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this conversation certain marvelous things were manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, Jesus was manifested to be the King of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Jews had mocked the Lord Jesus by saying that He was the King.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Pilate heard of their mocking word, he questioned the Lord concerning His being a King.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 18:37 Pilate said to Him, "Are you then a king?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord answered, "You are saying that I am a king."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Immediately before Pilate asked Him about being a king, the Lord had said to him, "My kingdom is not of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If My kingdom were of this world, My deputies would have fought that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now My kingdom is not from this world" v. 36 . The Gospel of John is the only Gospel that records this aspect of the conversation between Pilate and the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The reason John's Gospel includes this is that his Gospel reveals that the One who was about to be crucified is the great I Am and the King of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The One who stood before Pilate was not merely Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This One was Jehovah, the I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was the King of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A Witness to the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the presence of Pilate the Lord Jesus was also manifested as a witness to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He said to Pilate, "For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should testify to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice" v. 37 . To this, Pilate replied, "What is truth?" v. 38 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Concerning truth, or reality, we have seen that the entire universe may be compared to a shell and that the content of this shell is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As created human beings, we also are shells, empty containers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need God to be our content, to be our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Triune God is the reality in the universe, and the Lord Jesus came to testify concerning this reality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This Gospel reveals that God is the truth, the reality, and the Spirit is the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every word that conveys the Triune God is also truth or reality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Truth, then, is the divine Trinity as the content of the universe and of God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus indicated to Pilate that He came as the King of the kingdom of God and also came to testify to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For the Lord to testify to the truth means that He testified that the Triune God is the real content of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Pilate did not understand, and there was no time for the Lord Jesus to tell him any more.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Pilate abruptly ended the conversation by saying, "What is truth?"</S>
