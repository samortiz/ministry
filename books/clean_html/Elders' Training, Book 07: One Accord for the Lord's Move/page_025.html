<h2 class="head1">KNOWING YOURSELF AND KNOWING OTHERS</h2>
<p>I want to get into all these points contained in this book to make the truth so bright in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the heavens should not be closed. The heavens have to be open to us; the sky should not be cloudy but clear. Do not think that I am fighting against anyone or blaming anyone. My burden is to make God&rsquo;s New Testament economy clear. Like Paul, I can never deny that the Lord has shown me something. A wise master builder is an architect who designs the building, and after designing he superintends and oversees the construction work.</p>
<p>I have the full assurance to say that among the elders and the co-workers there has been the ambition to be above others, to take the lead, and to have another line. It is very good if you can take the lead, but you have to ask yourself if you have that portion of grace. For years you have been doing your work with the materials from this ministry. I never said anything negative against anyone, but I have been watching over your writings. I would like to see that the Lord has really raised up more brothers. I would be happy. Actually, though, in whatever you minister, in whatever you wrote, there is nothing new in any point. Every point is a kind of copy of an existing point in the ministry. You just would not say that is something quoted from the ministry. You want to give people your kind of color so that they think that is your kind of teaching with the pretense that people will not be able to understand Brother Lee&rsquo;s word. You have to consider what your position is in the Lord&rsquo;s move. You may not have the portion to do what you are doing.</p>
<p>While I was involved in the work on mainland China for eighteen years, I recognized and admitted that I did not have the portion to take the lead there. I recognized, respected and regarded Brother Nee as the unique master builder. I had no idea or opinion concerning the way the Lord&rsquo;s recovery needed to take. The design came from Brother Nee. He was the superintendent, not I, so I had no right and no position to express any kind of opinion. My position and my right, thank the Lord, was just to take Brother Nee&rsquo;s instructions.</p>
<p>During those eighteen years on mainland China, Brother Nee had a number of conferences for the co-workers. Sometimes Brother Nee said, &ldquo;Witness, what would you say?&rdquo; I had nothing to say and I had no opinion because I was just waiting to take the word from Brother Nee. I was learning under him, and I watched to see how the co-workers responded to him. I learned a great deal. Young brothers&mdash;this is wise. If you watch how others respond to the leading one and listen, you are wise. You will not say a word because you do not have the position to give any opinion. The steering wheel is not in your hand. For you to give your opinion concerning what direction the car should take causes trouble, bothers people, and makes people unhappy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING AMBITIOUS</h2>
<p>It is stupid to be ambitious. All the ambitious ones in the past twenty-three years of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States were finished and even terminated by their ambition. We all need to condemn ambition. If you can design the proper, unique design for God&rsquo;s building and if you can superintend the construction to point out all the needs of the building, you do not need to qualify or enthrone yourself. What you are and what you can do will enthrone you. Who are the apostles? Who are the leaders? This does not depend upon a person&rsquo;s ambition, intention, proclamation, or claim. That does not work. It depends upon the facts. Do you have the ability to design God&rsquo;s building according to His New Testament economy? You may be far off. Thank God that you may know how to preach the gospel. Thank God that you may know how to water the saints by teaching the Bible. You should be satisfied with that portion. You have to be contented with the portion the Lord has given you with thanksgivings, realizing that you can only do that much.</p>
<p>You do not have any idea or view concerning the design of the building of God. Do you have the ability to watch over, to oversee, the entire work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery concerning His New Testament economy? To do this is not merely a matter of a general leading an army and giving commands to go and fight. It is a greater thing to be able to design God&rsquo;s unique building in the universe. The New Testament ministry is a matter in life, not just a battle, a fighting. The church is God&rsquo;s farm full of the growth in life that produces the transformed materials which constitute the construction of God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace He has shown me these things. To some extent, I have been forced to talk this way. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery means something. Both Brother Nee and I had the boldness to share these things with others because we cannot deny that we have seen something. We have studied not only the Bible but also Christianity. We studied the Brethren and we know who they are. Even they themselves do not know that much about themselves. We do not have any degree, so we dare not say that we are the learned doctors. We are like Jesus the Nazarene. Thank Him that we have seen something which we cannot deny.</p>
<p>I have been forced to present the real situation to you. I love you and I am trying my best to rescue you from a vague situation. In that kind of vague situation, you may be ambitious to be something. I beg you not to do this. If you have really been gifted with a certain capacity, you do not need to be ambitious. You do not need to consider that you are such a person. This is all vanity. It all depends upon how much the Lord has measured to you, what the portion is that the Lord has given to you. Be faithful to that portion and you will get a reward.</p>
