   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECOVERY BEING WITH THE SMALL AND LESS SPIRITUAL ONES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We praise the Lord that there was a response to the Lord's call.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not many, but a small number returned to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, Ezra and Nehemiah, the two books of recovery, tell us that those who returned from captivity were a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They were small in number and not very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They were so timid that only a little opposition caused them to give up the work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today some among us may be concerned that in the Lord's recovery we are so small.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we hear of opposition, we may be concerned and afraid, and we may want to hide.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the fulfillment of the type of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It must be like this; otherwise the type would have no fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the type there were the timid and "messed up" ones, and today in the recovery of the church life we also have some timid and "messed up" ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hallelujah for this!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In a sense there were not many good ones in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Other than Zerubbabel and Joshua, most were the fearful ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, our situation already has been prophesied and typified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I consider our situation, in one sense I am sorry, but in another sense I am happy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I say, "Praise You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here You have the fulfillment of the type."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Regardless of how timid the people were, there was still a return, and as long as there was a return there was the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time in Babylon there still were a good number of the people of Israel who were more spiritual and godly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In principle, they may have done the same thing that some dear Christian leaders do today, telling people, "There is no need for you to go to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just stay here.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is omnipresent; God is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is not limited by a place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If God can be there in Jerusalem, to be sure, He can be here with us in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no need to go.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Simply be godly and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God does not care for the place.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Babylon or Jerusalem, Jerusalem or Babylon; it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you are not a spiritual person, regardless of how much you go back to Jerusalem, you will still not be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are a timid person, even if you go back to Jerusalem, you will still be timid."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not listen to that kind of message.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Consider the return from captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Regardless of how timid the people were, regardless of how much they were messed up, they were still the returned captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They made it possible for God to have the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Regardless of how spiritual the people in captivity were, they could never rebuild the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But regardless of how weak the returned ones were, it was they who rebuilt the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They brought in the recovery, and they rebuilt the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Look at the captivity in the Catholic Church, in all the denominations, and even in the small free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is revival after revival, and people are seeking to be spiritual and godly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some have become spiritual and godly, but where is the rebuilding of the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Where is the recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Will God be defeated to the uttermost?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you believe that the Lord Jesus will come back under such a defeated situation?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To be sure, He will not.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before His coming back, He has to regain the victory; He has to rebuild the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Consider the type, the picture, of the scattering from Jerusalem to Syria, Egypt, and Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This picture is better than a thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After considering this picture, will you still pray for a revival?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Will you still seek to be individually spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Will you still seek to be a godly person, merely looking up to the heavens and praying for America and for other places?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A spiritual and godly person is wonderful, but consider the picture of the captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What can the Lord gain from this kind of person?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do we believe that in a scattered situation the Lord can come back as the Bridegroom to receive His bride?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This would be a shame to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If everything among the Christians is poor, yet the Lord comes back in glory as the Bridegroom to receive His bride, Satan will challenge Him, saying, "Jesus, where is Your bride?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord Jesus cannot come back under this kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today in this century the nation of Israel has been re-formed, and Jerusalem has been returned.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, today is a day of fast recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Jerusalem was returned to Israel, but what about the church?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is still a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord must do a quick work to recover the church life!</S>
