   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes our spirit may be right but not so willing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may have a spirit which is right for going out to preach the gospel, yet we may not have the morale.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This simply means that we do not have a willing spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Spirit is the outpouring Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Joel 2:28-29 prophesied that the Lord would pour out His Spirit upon all flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This pouring out of the Spirit was fulfilled as the former rain on the day of Pentecost and will be fulfilled as the latter rain in Zechariah 12:10 when the Jews will repent at the Lord s coming back Joel 2:23 .</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not so easy for us to be gathered.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the Spirit as God is the gathering Spirit.</S>
