	 <h2 class="head1">CONCERNING AUTHORITY OVER US</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Origin of Authority over Us</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;There is no authority except from God, and those which exist are ordained by God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 13:1).</p>
<p>All authority is from God, and those that exist are ordained by God. God gave man authority to rule other men after the flood (Gen. 9:6). However, men who receive authority often abuse it and force people to do things that offend God. In such cases those who fear God cannot obey their command and offend God, even though they should be subject to the authority from God. The record in Daniel 1:8-16, 3:8-27, and 6:4-23 is an example of ones who were subject to authority while not obeying commands that were offensive to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Believers and the Authorities over Us</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Let every person be subject to the authorities over him, for there is no authority except from God...Render...fear to whom fear is due, honor to whom honor is due&rdquo;; &ldquo;Be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient...to slander no one&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 13:1, 7; Titus 3:1-2; see also 1 Pet. 2:13-14).</p>
<p>All the authorities over us are ordained by God; therefore, believers should be subject to them, rendering fear and honor. Believers should obey and not slander.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Honor the king&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 2:17).</p>
<p>Believers should honor the king or leader of a country.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Render to all the things due: tax to whom tax is due, custom to whom custom is due&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 13:7; see also Matt. 22:21).</p>
<p>The believers should also do their part to pay taxes properly.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Petitions, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made...on behalf of kings and all who are in high position&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 2:1-2; see also Dan. 1:8-16; 3:8-27; 6:4-23).</p>
<p>Believers need to pray for all those who are in high position. We need to petition the Lord to give them wisdom, peace, and salvation. This is very important.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR PRINCIPLES CONCERNING THE LIVING<br />
OF THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Profitable to Yourself</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All things are lawful to me, but not all things are profitable&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:12; see also 10:23).</p>
<p>All things are lawful to the believers, but they must also be profitable. Believers certainly should not do anything that is not profitable or is harmful to themselves.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Free from All Things</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:12).</p>
<p>Believers must not be controlled by what they do. Anything addictive, anything that controls people or causes them not to be free, should not be done.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building Up Others</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All things are lawful, but not all things build up&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 10:23).</p>
<p>Whatever the believers do should also build up others. Anything that corrupts or stumbles others should not be done.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Glorifying God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 10:31).</p>
<p>Whatever the believers do must be done to the glory of God. Anything that is a shame to God&rsquo;s name or that damages the testimony of God should not be done.</p>
<p>Doing what is profitable to oneself, being free from all things, building up others, and glorifying God are four great principles for the daily living of the believers. In the living of the believers, both big and small matters can be tested and decided by these four principles, especially when the Bible does not give a clear teaching on the matter. If something is according to all of these principles, it is permissible. If a matter violates even one of these principles, we should not do it. Matters such as smoking and going to movies are not expressly forbidden in the Bible, but these four principles can help us determine whether or not we may do them.</p>
