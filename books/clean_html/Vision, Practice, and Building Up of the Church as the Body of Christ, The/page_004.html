<h2 class="head3">The Proper Meaning of Sonship</h2>
<p>We need to know the proper spiritual vocabulary, including the word <em>sonship.</em> Sonship indicates that we have the life, birth, and right of inheritance of a son. Birth is one thing, and the birthright is another. Esau and Jacob both had the same birth and the same life, but only one&mdash;Jacob&mdash;had the birthright. Therefore, Esau had the life of a son but not the full sonship. Sonship is birth plus birthright. All real Christians have the birth of the sons of God, but not all today have the birthright. At least by the time of the New Jerusalem, we all will have the birthright. Before that time, only the overcomers will enjoy the birthright of the sons of God.</p>
<p>Romans 8:16-17 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God. And if children, heirs also; on the one hand, heirs of God; on the other, joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him.&rdquo; There is a difference between children and heirs. Children have the proper birth, but heirs have not only the birth but also the birthright. We must first be the children; then we must become heirs. If we are children without the birthright, we do not have the full sonship.</p>
<p>Through our birth, both in the physical and spiritual realms, we received life. When we were born of our father, we received our father&rsquo;s life. Through the birthright, however, we receive the inheritance of all that our father is and has. Because we have been born again, we have received the life of God. However, simply because we are children of God does not mean that we are heirs of God. We may be children yet not be heirs. The book of Hebrews helps us to realize what the birthright is. Hebrews does not speak much about the divine birth; rather, it speaks of the birthright. Hebrews 12:15 says, &ldquo;Looking carefully lest anyone fall away from the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and through this many be defiled.&rdquo; To fall away from the grace of God does not mean that the one who falls has not been born again. He has been born again, but after someone is born again, there is a possibility that he will fall away from the grace of God.</p>
<p>Verses 16 and 17 continue, &ldquo;Lest there be any fornicator or profane person like Esau, who for one meal gave up his own birthright. For you know that also afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for repentance, even though he sought it with tears.&rdquo; As those who are born again, there is the possibility for us to enjoy the birthright, but there is also the possibility that we may lose the birthright. Many Christians are in danger of losing the birthright. They are the real children of God, but for a certain period of time they will not be the heirs.</p>
<p>We must remember well that sonship in the Scriptures means birth plus birthright. By the spiritual birth we have received the life of God, but it is by the birthright that we will inherit all that God is, all that God has, all that God has planned, and all that God will accomplish. God is the Father, and He has many things that He has planned and will accomplish. All that God Himself is, all that He has, and all that He has planned and will accomplish together are the inheritance. God&rsquo;s election, God&rsquo;s purpose in choosing us, is that we may have His life to become His sons and then inherit Himself as our everything, including all that He has, has planned, and will accomplish. Life plus inheritance added together equals the sonship. This is a very profound item.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Sonship Meaning That We Are in God Himself</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:5 tells us that we are predestinated unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself. Here Paul uses a strong word&mdash;not only <em>Him</em> but <em>Himself.</em> The phrase <em>to Himself</em> is very meaningful. In Greek it means <em>unto</em> or <em>into Himself</em>. This is not a small matter. <em>Into Himself</em> implies that we must get into God. God predestinated us unto sonship through Christ so that we may get into God. We have seen that sonship means that we receive God&rsquo;s life into us and will inherit all that God is, all that He has, and all that He will accomplish. Here, though, we have another aspect. Sonship is also for us to get into God. We all have to learn to study the Word carefully and remember phrases such as <em>to Himself.</em></p>
<p>Every part of verse 5 is important, including <em>predestinated,</em><em> unto sonship, through Jesus Christ,</em>and <em>to Himself.</em>The last phrase says, &ldquo;According to the good pleasure of His will.&rdquo; Here we see the good pleasure of God and the will of God. Verse 6 continues, &ldquo;To the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved.&rdquo; <em>Graced us in the Beloved</em> is a hard phrase for the translators of the Bible. There may be no human word except in the original Greek to express the right meaning of this phrase. It means that God made us the very goal and object of His grace. We may translate this phrase as, &ldquo;Made us the object of His grace in the Beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Produce a Holy City with God&rsquo;s Divine Nature</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention concerning the church is also that the church may be holy. Ephesians 1:4 says, &ldquo;Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love.&rdquo; We need to know the proper, full, and deeper meaning of the word <em>holy</em> in the Scriptures. Even up to the present day in Christianity this word is not understood in a full way. The ultimate consummation of the Bible is a holy city, corresponding to the word <em>holy</em> in this verse. The purpose of God&rsquo;s selection and choosing is to make us holy. On the one hand, to be holy is to be separated unto God, but this is its superficial meaning. The deeper meaning of <em>holy</em> is to be mingled with God. We have to be mingled and overlaid with God in His holy and divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4), just as the items in the tabernacle were overlaid with gold. The furniture in the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle appear to be golden, not wooden. However, we should not say that there is no wood. Rather, all the wooden furnishings have one appearance, that is, the appearance of gold. Therefore, we may say that all those wooden items became golden; that is, they became holy.</p>
<p>Gold signifies the divine nature as God&rsquo;s holiness. God is holy; that is His nature. In Revelation 21 we are told that the holy city, New Jerusalem, is golden. That the city itself is gold indicates that it is holy. To be separated unto God is only the beginning. We are separated for the purpose of being overlaid with gold, that is, overlaid with God. To be holy, we must be mingled with God. To be holy is not only to be separated unto God, but even the more to be in God, to be overlaid with God, to be mingled with God, just as the wooden boards of the tabernacle were in the gold by being overlaid with gold. In order to be in God we must be overlaid with God. The little word <em>in</em> is used many times in the New Testament for this purpose; we are in God, in Christ, in the Holy Spirit, in Himself, and He is in us. The proper meaning of being holy is that we are made to be in God.</p>
