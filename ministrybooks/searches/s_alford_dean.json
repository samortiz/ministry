This term describes the inward conditions of man, including the human spirit. The Bible scholars at that time did not have a thorough understanding of the human spirit. It was not until the beginning of this century that the matter of the human spirit was properly understood. People like Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis spoke much about the human spirit. We received much help sixty years ago from them. After further study during the past few decades, we became even clearer about the matter of the human spirit. [62] "

Deceit is the essence of Satan, who is a liar, but truth is the essence of God, who is truth. Thus, the lusts are of Satan, who is the deceit, whereas righteousness and holiness are of God, who is the truth. Vincent points out that in these verses deceit and truth should be personified.

Alford says that the Greek word for forbearance means to not be strict with respect to legal rights. For example, a certain thing may be ours, but we do not claim it according to strict, legal right.

This kind of question, asking for something, may be considered an appeal or demand. Peter\u2019s thought here may be that baptism is the appeal to God of the baptized one for a good conscience unto God. Baptism, as a symbol, a counterpart of our belief in all the accomplishments of Christ, testifies that all the problems we have before God and with God have been solved. Hence, it is also a testimony, witnessing that in our conscience there is no more offense, but rather we are full of peace and confidence that we have been baptized into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19) and organically united with Him through the resurrection of Christ, that is, by Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of life. Without the Spirit of Christ as its reality, baptism by water immediately becomes an empty and dead ritual. "

Prior to these visits, I did not have much of an impression concerning him. In 1933 Brother Watchman Nee spoke highly of him to me, telling me that there was hardly anyone in church history who was as spiritual as Brother T. Austin-Sparks. Brother Nee translated some of his writings into Chinese, and the saints highly esteemed them. In 1933 I dropped my job in order to serve the Lord full time. Later, when I went to Shanghai, Brother Nee gave me Bible expositions by J. N. Darby and Henry Alford as a gift. At that time I also read Brother T. Austin-Sparks\u2019s book entitled The Release of the Lord, which speaks of Christ, the cross, and resurrection. In 1938 Brother Nee was invited to England a second time. When he returned to China, a brother asked him why we had not invited T. Austin-Sparks to China. Brother Nee did not give an explanation; he said only that it was not the right time. He told me that Brother T. Austin-Sparks\u2019s view of spiritual matters matched, and might exceed, ours, but his view of the practice of the church differed from ours. Once, as Brother Nee and I were walking, we spoke concerning the ground of the church. Brother Nee told me that in our work in the East we had a clear understanding concerning the matter of the church, whereas in the [474] West the truth concerning the church had been so thoroughly damaged by the British Brethren that even T. Austin-Sparks was not clear concerning the ground of the church; hence, in the West there were problems concerning the practice of the church. "

I considered these various authorities and took them as a base, but I also added something new. I stood on their shoulders to write and speak something higher. I used some of their terms, but I sometimes [93] introduced new terms to convey the new revelation. For instance, footnote 1 on Romans 4:3 says, \u201cGod appeared to Abraham a number of times..., each time transfusing something of His glory, something of Himself, into Abraham. Hence, Abraham\u2019s believing was actually the springing up within him of the very element that God had transfused into him.\u201d This use of the word transfusing does not occur in other Christian writings.

Thank the Lord that He has given you such a gift that you can speak for many hours at a time. But I cannot do this. I am not so gifted. I do not have the speaking gift.\u201d Due to our feeling that we are unable to speak in the meetings, we need to consider 2 Corinthians 4:10-14. In these verses Paul speaks about Christ\u2019s death and His resurrection in a subjective way, in a way that identifies us with Christ\u2019s death and resurrection. Verses 10 through 12 say, \u201cAlways bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus\u2019 sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So then death operates in us, but life in you.\u201d How could Paul speak in this way? In verse 13 he gives us the secret: \u201cAnd having the same spirit of faith.\u201d What is the \u201cspirit of faith\u201d? Alford in his New Testament for English Readers states that the spirit of faith is \u201cnot distinctly the Holy Spirit,\u2014but still not merely a human disposition: the indwelling Holy Spirit penetrates and characterizes the whole renewed man.\u201d Vincent in his Word Studies in the New Testament says, \u201cSpirit of faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human faculty or disposition, but blending both.\u201d The spirit of faith is the mingling of the Holy Spirit with our human spirit. We must exercise such a spirit to believe and to speak the things we have experienced of the Lord, especially His death and resurrection. Faith is in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit, not in our mind. Doubts are in our mind. The \u201cspirit\u201d in verse 13 indicates that it is by the mingled spirit that the apostles live a crucified life in resurrection for carrying out their ministry.

Henry Alford points out in his commentary on Philippians that the dogs, evil workers, and concision referred to in Philippians 3 are those who preached the gospel in rivalry with Paul, referred to in chapter 1.

The teaching of these Judaizers was a wind that would \u201cblow away\u201d some of the saints from the central lane of Christ and the church.

Henry Alford, in his notes on the New Testament, says that the phrase in Christ means that Christ is the sphere, the realm, and the element in which and with which we have been redeemed. We have been redeemed into Christ as a sphere for us to stay in and as an element for us to be made something. In Ephesians 1:7-12 we are told that we sinners, after being redeemed into Christ, have become God\u2019s inheritance, His treasure. How could sinners be God\u2019s treasure, God\u2019s inheritance? This is because we sinners are in Christ, having Christ as our precious element. Before we received Christ, we were absolutely worthless. David said that he was a worm (Psa. 22:6). This is what we were before we were saved, but Christ redeemed us through His blood out of what we were and put us into Himself. Now He is not only our sphere but also our element for Him to make us precious with Himself. We all have been redeemed, and now we have Christ as the precious One within us. Christ is not only a sphere where we should stay, walk, and be a Christian but also the precious element for us to be made with Him as a precious treasure to God. Thus, we sinners all have become God\u2019s inheritance. Now we can declare that we have not only God\u2019s nature and God\u2019s life but also God\u2019s element. "

Therefore, I hope the brothers could see the financial problem of the apostles: If various churches can send support, thank God; but if various churches cannot send support, it does not mean that we should take other occupations or change our occupation as apostles. This is the problem today. Our occupation is as apostles. But I may make tents today in order to have this occupation. Today, in order that I and the brothers with me can be apostles, I may make tents. Making tents was not Paul\u2019s occupation. Paul\u2019s occupation never changed. From the time he was called in Damascus, his occupation never changed. In order that the young men who were with him could have a supply, he made tents.

This second way of translating this verse would indicate after God raised Christ from the dead, seated Him in the heavens, and subjected all things under His feet, He then gave Him to the church as the Head over all things. This would not be logical according to the sequence. The three steps of raising Christ, seating Him in the heavens, and subjecting all things under His feet are great steps. According to the second way of translating the verse, these great steps are followed by a lesser step\u2014giving Christ to the church."

This then is a strong word in the Bible, telling us emphatically that Christ is the Spirit. \u201cThe Lord Christ of verse 16 is the Spirit who pervades and animates the new covenant of which we are ministers (v. 6), and the ministration of which is with glory (v. 8). Compare Romans 8:9-11; John 14:16, 18\u201d (Vincent). \u201cThe Lord of verse 16 is the Spirit...which giveth life, verse 6, meaning: \u2018the Lord,\u2019 as here spoken of, \u2018Christ,\u2019 \u2018is the Spirit,\u2019 is identical with the Holy Spirit...Christ, here, is the Spirit of Christ\u201d (Alford). \u201cAll that transforming and indwelling Spirit is Christ Himself. \u2018The Lord is the Spirit\u2019\u201d (Williston Walker)."

We must exercise such a spirit to believe and to speak, like the psalmist, the things we have experienced of the Lord, especially His death and resurrection. Faith is in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit, not in our mind. Doubts are in our mind. Here spirit indicates that it is by the mingled spirit that the apostles lived a crucified life in resurrection for the carrying out of their ministry."

The judgment seat is where Christ will judge His believers at His coming back, not concerning their eternal salvation but concerning their dispensational reward (1 Cor. 4:4-5; 3:13-15).

Dean Alford says that an exact, accurate, and literal translation of the Greek term would be \u201cannihilated,\u201d which in its original meaning means to bring something to nothing. Hence, in this verse Paul is talking about being brought to nothing, to nought, from Christ. He was telling the Galatians, \u201cDear saints, you who seek to be justified by law have been brought to nothing from Christ. You were grafted into Christ, and you were enjoying the riches of Christ. But by going back to the law and to circumcision, you are brought to nought, you are annihilated, from Christ.\u201d"

Righteousness here signifies God\u2019s deeds, and holiness signifies His being. Whatever God does is righteous, and whatever God is, is holy. The new man was created according to God in both of these respects. Moreover, both righteousness and holiness are of the reality. Dean Alford says that in this verse reality denotes the very essence of God, for God is reality. This is in contrast with the lusts of the deceit mentioned in 4:22. Deceit is the essence of Satan, who is a liar, but reality is the essence of God, who is reality. Thus, the lusts are of Satan, who is the deceit, whereas righteousness and holiness are of God, who is the reality. Vincent points out that in these verses deceit and reality should be personified. The new man was created according to God in righteousness and holiness, two aspects of God\u2019s essence."

You will also be meek and moderate, full of compassion for others. As we pointed out in the previous message, the opposite of forbearance is being just in a very exacting way. A person who lacks forbearance will be exacting and demanding of others. But to be forbearing means that we are satisfied with less than our due. Alford says that the Greek word for forbearance means to not be strict with respect to legal rights. For example, a certain thing may be ours, but we do not claim it according to strict, legal right. This is forbearance."

This kind of question, which asks for something, can be considered an appeal or demand. Peter\u2019s thought here may be that baptism is the baptized one\u2019s appeal to God for a good conscience toward God. Baptism, as a symbol, a counterpart of our belief in all the accomplishments of Christ, testifies that all the problems we have before God and with God have been solved. Hence, it is also a testimony, witnessing that in our conscience there is no more accusation and that instead we are full of peace and are confident that we have been baptized into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19) and have been organically united with Him through the resurrection of Christ, that is, by Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of life. Without the Spirit of Christ as its reality, baptism by water immediately becomes an empty and dead ritual. [224] "
