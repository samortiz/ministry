   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECOVERY OF THE WHOLE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the matter of preaching the gospel, we have to recover the kind of preaching that is done by the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We do not need to invite people with big advertisements.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, we should ask all the brothers and sisters to invite people individually.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is a difference between inviting people through advertisements and inviting them individually through the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this way the whole church will be able to rise up to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This kind of service will be the whole Body serving together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we have only a few serving today, we have not reached God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The way to go on today is to have authority plus the one-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When authority is added to the one-talented ones, we have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whether or not a church is up to the standard depends on whether the one-talented one are functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not enough just to have the two and five-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If our work does not bring out the one-talented ones, our work is a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The flesh always comes with the one-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before we have learned obedience ourselves, we will not know whether others are obeying or not.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But after we have learned obedience, we will detect disobedience as soon as it is present.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are coordinated, there will be authority among us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With authority we can deal with the rebellious and the insubordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our co-workers have been working and laboring all this time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would like to ask if they feel tired?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps God is telling us to let go now.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The way today is not to struggle individually by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The way today is to do things all together and in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is the reservoir of Christ; all the riches of Christ are stored in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If one day we see the whole church rising up to preach the gospel, we will realize what a beautiful and powerful picture it is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>TAKING THE WAY OF THE WHOLE CHURCH SERVING</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today very few spiritual giants are being produced any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the last century during the Keswick movement, many spiritual giants were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At that time people had a very shallow knowledge about the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When A. T. Pierson stood up to preach, very few people knew what he was talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today man's knowledge about the Bible has increased.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a person steps up to the platform to preach today, he only needs to speak the first sentence, and everyone knows what will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today there are very few five-talented ones like Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, although there are very few spiritual giants, two or three one-talented ones and two-talented ones will make up for a Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today we do not have many Pauls.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can no longer wait for spiritual giants to come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I believe the time has come for the church to rise up to serve, work, and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no way for us to go on individually any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the time for us to take the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to be in the same mind with God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We criticize the denominations and their system of one man monopolizing everything, but in the local churches, one co-worker plus two or three elders monopolize the services.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They are replacing the functions of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In principle this is the same as the denominations.</S>
