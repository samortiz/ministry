   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING CHRIST BY GOING ALONG WITH HIM AS OUR INNER PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One day we heard the gospel, and we repented and confessed our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We called on the Lord's name and received Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we received the Lord, we received another person into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He changed our choices and preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One by one our sinful habits were dropped, and we became different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From the day that I received the Lord, I had the sensation that Someone was taking care of me, controlling me, and regulating me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was going to lose my temper, He did not agree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He spoke to me from within, "You have to go along with Me."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, I was forced to stop my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do you realize that this was to live Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since the day I received Christ, when I began to criticize others, He within me as a person said, "Do not say anything like this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I do not speak in this way."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I did not speak my criticism, because He did not speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ lives in us not only as our life but also as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have a particular person within us, and this particular person is our unique life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is now subjective and organic to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is our person, the better person, even the best person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He should become our daily life, our daily living, and our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many times we neglect to hear Him and act too fast.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though He says, "Do not do it," we do not care for His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At these times, we neglect Jesus within us, without caring for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we have to say, "Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Lord, I rebelled against You."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we say this to the Lord, He may tell us to confess to someone we have argued with or offended.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is always urging us from within to go along with Him, to be one with Him, and to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To live Christ is to go along with Him as our inner person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our Christian life is not merely a matter of speaking something spiritual in the meetings, but a matter of living Christ in our private life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many times I wanted to say something or go somewhere, but Christ within me was not saying what I wanted to say or going where I wanted to go.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His not going forced me to say, "Lord, since You will not go, I will not go either.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I will stay home."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By going along with Christ as my inner person, I have been graced by Him to grow in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was easy for me to lose my temper when I was young.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now, however, it is difficult for anyone to offend me so that I lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is because the One who lives in me does not lose His temper.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I exercise myself to be one with Him to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Christ is increasing in us, all things other than Christ are decreasing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This experience is another part of the biography of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul said that Christ is our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He also said in Galatians 2:20, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This should not be just a doctrine or theological knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This should be a living fact in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is no more I who live, but the very Christ who died for me and who died with me, lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all have to declare this, and this should be our experience in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to live Christ in all the details of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes when I am joking, the One within me tells me to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I stopped joking in order to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is not only my life but also my person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the brothers buy a tie, they should buy a tie according to the One who lives in them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not wear the kind of ties many of the people in the world wear because Christ within us does not wear that kind of tie.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should also experience Christ as our person in the way that we cut our hair.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not think that this is a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a brother's hair is too long, do you think Christ would still speak freely through him?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To live Christ means having Christ as our person and life, not just day by day but moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The living of Christ is the organic and basic foundation of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The aggregate of each one of us living Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The church is the totality of the living of Christ of all the saints.</S>
