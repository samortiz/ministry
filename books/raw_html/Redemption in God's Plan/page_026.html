        <h2 class="head2">Justifying Us</h2>
<p>Not only were we under God&rsquo;s condemnation because of our sinful acts, but our very constitution was one of sin (Rom. 3:23; 5:19). Hence, Christ not only bore our sins but also became sin on our behalf on the cross (2 Cor. 5:21). By dying on the cross, He took away our sins and terminated our constitution of sin (Rom. 6:6). When He was raised from the dead and brought us into the new realm of resurrection, we were justified in Him, and we became righteous and acceptable to God (4:25).</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s death dealt with our sins and our constitution of sin. It terminated our old man, which was under condemnation, and it terminated everything of the old man. It also ended our condemnation before God. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection brought us into a new position by our being justified by God and by becoming the righteousness of God in Him. In His death He bore our sins and became sin on our behalf. In His resurrection we gained Him as our righteousness and became the righteousness of God in Him. In His resurrection He became our righteousness so that we in Him would not only be righteous before God but also become the righteousness of God in Him (2 Cor. 5:21). He is not only righteous before God, but He is also the righteousness of God. Because we have participated in His resurrection, He has not only become our righteousness to make us righteous before God, but He has also made us the righteousness of God in Him as well.</p>
<p>Righteousness relates to God&rsquo;s procedure and God&rsquo;s law. Only that which is in accord with God&rsquo;s procedure and law is righteous. We used to be contrary to God&rsquo;s law, and our conduct and living were not in accord with God&rsquo;s procedure. Thus, we were unrighteous before God. All our unrighteousness is related to ourselves, and all our righteousness is related to Christ. Christ&rsquo;s death dealt with our unrighteousness, and His resurrection enabled us to enter into Him and to gain Him as our righteousness. His being is absolutely in accord with God&rsquo;s law, and everything related to Him is absolutely in accord with God&rsquo;s procedure. In resurrection He became our righteousness so that we would be in accord with God&rsquo;s procedure and law. His resurrection causes us to be in full accord with God because we are in Him. In the resurrected Christ God sees us as absolutely righteous. In the resurrected Christ we are in absolute accord with God and thus fully acceptable to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Regenerating Us</h2>
<p>The death of the Lord Jesus terminated our fallen human life, whereas His resurrection imparted His eternal divine life into us. Through His resurrection we can partake of His life, which was released from within Him by His death. His resurrection is the source of our regeneration (1 Pet. 1:3). The life of God, which was concealed within the Lord Jesus, was released through His death so that it could enter into us through resurrection, thus regenerating us. In His resurrection we were not only saved by God but also born of God. We were not only justified by God but also regenerated by God. We received the Lord Jesus as our righteousness so that we might be acceptable to God, and we received Him as our life so that we might be born of God.</p>
<p>Righteousness is outward, and its emphasis is on our position. Life is inward, and its emphasis is on our disposition. In His resurrection Christ became our righteousness so that we might obtain an acceptable position before God outwardly. He also caused us to receive His life so that we might receive the divine nature of God inwardly. The resurrection of Christ caused us to be justified so that we might have a proper relationship with God, and His resurrection caused us to be regenerated so that we might have a union in life with God. The resurrection of Christ enabled us to meet God&rsquo;s requirement of righteousness, and it also imparted God&rsquo;s nature into us. Because of His resurrection we can come forward to God and even live in God. We can see God&rsquo;s face and partake of His divine nature. We can have fellowship with God, and we can be mingled with God (John 14:20; Gal. 2:20).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Entering into Us to Be Our Life</h2>
<p>Through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection we not only received His life for our regeneration, but we also received Him into us to be our life (Col. 3:3-4). Actually, His life entering into us is just Himself entering into us, because He is life. Through His resurrection He can enter into us to be our life so that we may partake of Him. Through His incarnation He was joined to us, and through His resurrection we were joined to Him. Because He was joined with us in His death by His partaking of blood and flesh, He was able to die on our behalf. Because we are joined with Him in His resurrection by our receiving His life, we can partake of all that He is. His death terminated every negative thing in us, and His resurrection germinated every positive thing in us. His death delivered us from ourselves and everything belonging to us, and because of His resurrection we can receive Him and everything belonging to Him.</p>
<p>Through the death of Christ we no longer have to live by ourselves or as ourselves. Because of His resurrection we can live by Him and live as He lives (John 14:19). He is in us as life, and this life cannot be held by death. Through the power of His resurrection, He delivers us from everything of ourselves and everything belonging to sin and death so that we may experience His death, be conformed to His death, live in Him daily, and be transformed into His image from glory to glory (Phil. 3:10; 2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
<p>The death of Christ causes us to put off everything other than Christ; the resurrection of Christ causes us to receive everything that is of Christ. Because of His resurrection He can live in us, and we can live in Him; we are fully joined as one with Him (Rom. 6:5). Since He is in God and one with God, His resurrection has brought us into God and joined us with God. Through His resurrection God can live in us, and we can be joined with God. In His resurrection we are fully joined as one with God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
