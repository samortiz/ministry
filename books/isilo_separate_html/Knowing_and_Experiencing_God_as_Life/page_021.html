<p>The third necessary item is a conscience without offense. First John 3:20 says, &ldquo;If our heart blames us, it is because God is greater than our heart and knows all things.&rdquo; God is greater than our heart; hence, when our heart blames us, God will blame us, and we will not have boldness toward Him (v. 21). Our heart blaming us is our conscience functioning within us. When our conscience operates, it blames us and causes our heart to lose its peace. The offense in our conscience comes from our sins. If we do not have light, our sins will not be manifested. Hence, an offense in our conscience is the issue of not receiving the shining of light.</p>
<p>When the divine light shines on any sin that we have committed, our conscience has an offense. We must deal with our conscience immediately; otherwise, the cleansing of the blood will cease. When the cleansing of the blood stops, the anointing also stops. This is terrible, because when the anointing stops, our fellowship with God also stops, and we will sense that we are not abiding in God but are outside of Him. Furthermore, instead of living by His life, we will live by our pitiful self. This is the greatest suffering of a Christian, and it is a miserable condition. In order to take God as life and live in Him, we must not neglect dealing with our conscience.</p>
<p>If we desire to learn to live in God, we must know the cleansing of the blood, the anointing ointment, and our conscience, which represents God&rsquo;s speaking in us. The condemnation in our conscience is God&rsquo;s demand in us as well as His speaking to us. The Spirit dwells in our spirit, and the main part of our spirit is our conscience. Hence, the function of our conscience is one of the functions of our spirit. When the Spirit anoints us, He adds the divine element into us. He also strengthens the shining of the divine light in our being, which causes our spirit to be bright. When our spirit is bright, our conscience manifests its function by condemning us and causing us to sense an offense. This is when we must deal with our conscience.</p>
<p>Hence, if we want to live in God and take Him as life, we must deal with our conscience thoroughly. Otherwise, our fellowship with God will be broken. Some people may be saved, but they are careless Christians; they do not have much fellowship with the Lord. We cannot say that such a person has no feeling in his conscience; even though he is careless, he still has some feeling in his conscience. If he would be willing to deal with the feelings in his conscience, his fellowship with God would immediately be restored.</p>
<p>If we fellowship with God and are willing to learn to live in Him, our conscience will be full of feelings. We might feel that we have offended our parents or our siblings or that we have offended others by using their things. We might feel that we dress according to our preference and not according to the Lord&rsquo;s desire. Instead of ignoring such feelings, we should deal with them one by one. If we deal with them thoroughly, we will have peace in our conscience, and the Spirit will move more deeply in us. As long as we are willing to let Him move in us, more light will be manifested in us.</p>
<p>A Christian can be living and strong when his conscience is without offense. When our conscience has an offense, it becomes sick, and we cannot be strengthened in the Lord, nor can we testify before men. First Timothy 1:5 speaks of &ldquo;love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith.&rdquo; Our faith and love are linked to our conscience. Pure love, a good conscience, and unfeigned faith are related to one another. Without a good conscience, we cannot have pure love; rather, our love will not be pure. Furthermore, our faith will be weak; it will not be genuine or strong. When there is an offense in our conscience, there will be a leakage, our faith will leak away, and we will not be able to pray, because our conscience will condemn us. Since God is greater than our conscience, He will also condemn us. Hence, in order to have unfeigned faith and pure love, we must have a good conscience, a conscience without offense.</p>
<p>It is crucial for a believer to maintain a good conscience before the Lord. The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;Holding faith and a good conscience, concerning which some, thrusting these away, have become shipwrecked regarding the faith&rdquo; (v. 19). A person who thrusts away his conscience, that is, does not deal with the feeling of offense in his conscience, can be compared to a damaged ship that allows water to leak into it, causing it to be shipwrecked. When the conscience has a leaking hole, sinful things and worldly things will cause a believer to sink into the ocean of the world and into the abyss of sinful things. A person in this situation cannot be transcendent, cannot rise above sins and the world, and cannot live before God. Hence, a Christian must deal with his conscience until there is absolutely no offense in it. Then he will be like a ship without any leaks.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul said that he served God in a pure conscience (2 Tim. 1:3). Those who desire to fellowship with God, live before Him, and serve Him by taking Him as life must depend on the blood and the anointing. However, the continual application of the blood and the anointing depend on our dealing with our conscience. When we do not deal with our conscience, the cleansing of the blood will cease, and the anointing will also cease. Furthermore, our spiritual experiences will cease. Our spiritual dealings must begin with our conscience.</p>
<p>I hope that my words will touch your conscience and open a way for you. As those who have the life of God and who desire to live in Him and to take Him as life, we must take this way. When God moves in us, we will see light. This light will expose our sins, and as a result, our conscience will feel an offense. Then we should deal with our conscience; that is, we should confess our sin and deal with it. We must not be casual concerning this matter. If we do not deal with our conscience, we will not grow. When there is an offense in our conscience, our fellowship with God cannot be maintained, and we will not live in His presence. Hence, as soon as there is a feeling in our conscience, we must learn to deal with it immediately, confessing our sins to God. Sometimes we may also have to apologize to people and make restitution.</p>
<p>If we truly desire to grow in life and to experience the Lord as life, we must deal with our conscience until our conscience is very keen and responds even to a small mistake. Many saints deal with their conscience in a detailed way. When one saint went to visit a friend, he stood at the door because he was not invited into the house. He said, &ldquo;The host did not ask me to come in. If I go in, I will violate his authority, and this would cause my conscience to lose its peace.&rdquo; When he entered into the living room, he would not sit down until the host asked him to. He said, &ldquo;This house and this chair belong to the host; I am not the owner. If I sit down, I will violate his ownership.&rdquo; While in the living room, he dared not to pick up the newspaper and read it, because he was not the owner. If he had picked up the newspaper, he would have needed to confess to his host. This may sound like a joke, but we should all have experiences like this. This experience shows that this saint dealt with his conscience strictly; hence, his conscience was sharp and keen. If we are restricted by our conscience, our move and walk will not be careless.</p>
<p>Some people sit anywhere and touch anything they like without the permission of their host. They can even look at the things in the closets. This shows that they live in darkness. Their conscience does not have much feeling; hence, they cannot live in God. They move and walk freely according to their convenience. In John 7:6 the Lord Jesus said that His time was not ready, but with many people, their time is always ready. They enter when they want to, sit down when and where they want to, and touch what they want to. Such ones have not dealt with their conscience. Furthermore, some people are careless with their money; they think that if they owe a brother or sister, there is no need to take care of the debt in a full and accurate way. Such ones surely do not live in God or in the light, and the offenses in their conscience have not been dealt with properly.</p>
<p>If a person truly lives in God, the divine light in his conscience will restrain and restrict his walk. The divine light will manifest whether he is short in a matter or too much. It will also expose when he does something unnecessary and when he is improper. His conscience will be full of feelings. If he does not deal with these feelings, he will not be able to pray, he will not have the faith to pray, and he will not be able to fellowship with or to live in the Lord.</p>
<p>Whether we can enjoy the cleansing of the blood and the anointing depends on whether we are willing to deal with the offenses in our conscience. When God shines in us, our sins will be exposed, and our conscience will sense an offense. We should deal with this feeling immediately by applying the blood. When the blood cleanses us, the anointing ointment will anoint us with more of the element of God. This is the way that we grow. This cycle is not once for all. This cycle of the fellowship of life is unceasing. When the divine element is added to us, the divine light will become stronger. When the light is stronger, more sins will be exposed. When our sins are exposed, our conscience will condemn us. In order to deal with our conscience, we need the cleansing of the blood. It is through this cycle that we can experience the blood&rsquo;s cleansing and the anointing. As we experience the cycle of the fellowship of life, our naturalness will gradually decrease, and the divine element will gradually increase in us. This is the way to be delivered from the self, to live in God, and to let Him be our life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
