   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Question: Should the meeting place have a name?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Answer: No, it should not.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Please read the preceding answer to the question concerning sects, especially the part about having names.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The building which we use for meetings does not need a name to differentiate itself, because the church of God is God's children, not the house they use to meet in. The building that is used for meetings is not the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God does not dwell in the building we meet in. He dwells in us 1 Cor 3:16-17; 2 Cor 6:16; Eph 2:21-22; 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Finally, dear brother!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not talk about these matters because we naturally like to be critical of others, repudiate the errors of others, or be contentious about words.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, we do not leave the denominations because we are proud and arrogant in our natural selves, wanting to be leaders and not willing to be restricted by others; nor is it because we are naturally stubborn and like to be individuals away from the crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The reason we speak about the error of denominations and leave them is because denominations are condemned by God; they are the fruit of the flesh, and they are of the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We leave the denominations because the flesh and the old man have already been crucified on the cross Gal 5:24; Rom 6:6 , because God wants us to put off the old man Eph 4:22 , and because we want to please God, to deal with the flesh, and put off the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we leave the denominations because we have argued with someone, or if we only leave the denominations and do not deal with the flesh or put off the old man, it is worthless before God!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we leave the denominations because we want to put on the new man, deal with the flesh, and put off the old man to pursue the riches of spiritual life and to manifest the Body of Christ, then that is very precious before God!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May God bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I bless you with peace!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Your brother in Christ,</S>
