   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE EMPTINESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF RELIGION S TRADITION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND THE FULLNESS OF LIFE S LIVING WATER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verses 9 through 14 we see the contrast between the emptiness of religion s tradition and the fullness of life s living water.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Samaritan woman asked the Lord Jesus, Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We see by this question that religion s father is considered to be the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Samaritans thought of Jacob as the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They took him as their grandfather, thinking him to be the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Samaritan woman also considered that Jacob s well was the best.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This signifies that religion s inheritance is always considered as the best.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Samaritan woman said to the Lord, You have no bucket...where then do you get the living water? v. 11 . This signifies that religion s way is considered as the most prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although religion considers its way to be the most prevailing, yet religion s water never quenches the thirst of religious people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is proved by the Lord s reply in verse 13.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is greater than religion s father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you preach the gospel in China, people will talk to you about Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every race and tribe claims to have someone great, but none is greater than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is greater than Jacob, Confucius, Plato, and every other kind of grandfather.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, God s gift is greater than religion s inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Would you like to have Jacob s well or God s gift?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is God s gift?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you say that God s gift is Christ, that answer is not totally accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The divine life is God s gift, for Romans 6:23 says that the free gift of God is eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This divine life shall become in us a spring of water welling up into eternal life v. 14 . This divine life is much better than Jacob s well.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you visit Jacob s well in Palestine today, you will find it under the control of an Armenian monk.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I visited there, everyone who wanted a cup of water from Jacob s well had to pay two dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, all of that is tradition and means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The water in that well is the same as any other.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To ask is more prevailing than religion s way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The living water of God quenches our thirst and becomes a spring of water welling up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Death s thirst is quenched by life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In principle, this also is to change death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This statement is simple but its meaning is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The water here signifies the enjoyment of material things and the amusement of worldly entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>None of these can quench the thirst deep within man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However much he drinks of this material and worldly water, he shall thirst again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more he drinks of these waters, the more his thirst is increased.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, in education people like to have higher and higher degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After receiving a bachelor s degree, they want a master s, and after that, a doctorate.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Others may desire to accumulate ten thousand dollars in a savings account, but after that, they want to have a hundred thousand, and after a hundred thousand, a million.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more you drink of the water of this earth, the more thirsty you become.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Never try to quench your thirst with any kind of worldly water.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although the Samaritan woman had had five husbands and was living with a man who was not her husband, she still was not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nothing could quench her thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some sisters love clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, no woman can be satisfied with any type of garment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After you purchase one, you will want a second and a third.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you have ten pairs of shoes, you will want to have fifteen pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some women who have more than fifteen pairs of shoes still are not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This kind of water will never satisfy people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is only one water that satisfies people for eternity Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ satisfies today, tomorrow, and for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is ever new, ever fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He always satisfies.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>So, the Lord could tell the Samaritan woman that whoever drinks of the water that He gives will not thirst, for that water will become in him a spring welling up into eternal life.</S>
