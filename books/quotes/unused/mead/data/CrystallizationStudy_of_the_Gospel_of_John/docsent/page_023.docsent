   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The next process was the resurrection, which was not as quick as most people think.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By reading 1 Peter 3:18 with Romans 1:4, we can see that the resurrection was a designating process.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was through the process of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many today do not see that God has been processed, because they are covered by their traditional veil.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why Paul said we have to look unto Christ with an unveiled face 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The entire New Testament unveils to us that God went through the process of incarnation, the process of human living, the process of an all-inclusive death, and the process of a life-dispensing resurrection.</S>
