   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Separated from Self-glory</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second item of the Nazarite s consecration is that his hair should not be cut.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those in the priesthood must be a peculiar people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must be a little strange and uncommon.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If I were to say that you are peculiar, you might not be so happy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if you were to say that to me, I would be very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be peculiar in this sense is proper for a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What does it mean to forbid the Nazarite to cut his hair?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Corinthians 11:14 says that long hair is a shame to a man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not a glory, but a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Long hair is a glory to a woman, but a shame to a man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A Nazarite is one who is willing to bear shame for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To have long hair means to be separated from self-glory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The self has been put to death; hence, there is no self-consciousness, self-righteousness, or self-glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As long as we have something of self-glory, we can never be in the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must bear the shame for the Lord s testimony and for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not be a glory-seeker; be a shame-bearer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are going to be priests, we must learn to bear the shame.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hebrews 13:13 tells us to go outside the camp and bear His reproach, which means to bear His shame.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not be afraid of bad names or evil reports.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we are not bold enough to bear the shame, we cannot be in the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A priest is a person with long hair; that is, he has no self-glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be a genuine priest will cause others to despise you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this country of amusements and glory-seeking, you can speak about anything to Christians except separation from the world and the denial of self-glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever you speak about these things, they are offended.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is a real price to pay for the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must bear the reproach, denying all self-glory for His sake.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Separated from Natural Affections</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The third item of the Nazarite s consecration is that he must not be defiled by anything dead, especially by the death of his nearest relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our nearest relatives, representing our natural affections, can be a means to deaden us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must be separated from our natural affections, which so easily deaden.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can easily be deadened by other people s deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must overcome our natural affections and not be affected by our mother, our father, our sister, or even our wife or husband.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our business with the Lord must not be involved with anything of our natural affections.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If it is, then immediately we are deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are born priests and kings, but what about our relationship with our parents, our brother, and our sister?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All of this simply means that we must overcome our natural affections.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So many Christians who have been born priests and kings are out of function today because of these three things: earthly pleasure or entertainment, self-glory, and natural affections.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are going to realize the position of the real priesthood, we must voluntarily consecrate ourselves unto the Lord to be separated from all of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Separated from Spiritual Deadness</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, the Word of the Lord is even clearer about the matter of spiritual deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Numbers 6:9 says that if anyone dies very suddenly by you, you are defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only our relative s death, but anyone s death can affect us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are deadened by them, all the days of our separation will be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may have overcome our natural affections, but suppose one day in the church life a brother standing by us dies very suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I do not mean that he dies physically, but spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If this happens, we must be careful not to be affected by him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not let him pass on his deadness to you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Satan is the very source of death, and he always likes to spread death toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many brothers and sisters in the church life have been deadened by one or two dead members.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whenever we sense or smell the stench of spiritual death, we must run away.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do you enjoy looking into a trash can?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No matter how fine a home is, it always has a trash can.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even a king s palace has a trash can.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you come to my home, will you come to smell and enjoy the trash can?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sometimes when you visit a local church, you do not go to the living room, but to the trash can.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You do not exercise yourself to taste the good things, but to enjoy the trash can the gossip, the criticism, and the murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Eventually, you are deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The more you contact these negative things, the less you are able to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You are simply deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You may have one hundred reasons for listening to the negative talk, but you are deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If anyone dies very suddenly near you, you must run away.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Run away from the dead members, or your spirit will be deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Earthly enjoyment, self-glory, natural affections, and sudden spiritual deadness in others must all be overcome; otherwise, the priesthood will be ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We all must realize that the situation today is not normal.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If it were, it would be unnecessary to apply the principle of the Nazarite.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must volunteer to be a Nazarite, such as Samuel, who turned the age of degradation into the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It was a Nazarite, John the Baptist, who turned the Old Testament dispensation into the New Testament dispensation and ushered in the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In these last days there must be a people who will turn this age into another age.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only the Nazarites can bring back the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It cannot be done by today s Christianity, but by those who will voluntarily separate themselves from earthly enjoyments, self-glory, natural affections, and sudden spiritual deadness in others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They will be the Nazarites of today who will turn this age of degradation into the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They will bring back the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must pray concerning this principle of the Nazarite.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Do not say that we have been born priests and kings.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This ordination by birth does not work under today s degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is the need for the side door, which is the vow of the Nazarite.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We all must lend ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As far as spiritual personnel is concerned, the Lord is very poor today.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must offer ourselves to Him so that He can borrow us for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Only the vow of the Nazarite can meet today s emergency.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord is calling for a people who will separate themselves entirely from all earthly enjoyment, self-glory, natural affection, and sudden spiritual deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Who will be the volunteers?</S>
