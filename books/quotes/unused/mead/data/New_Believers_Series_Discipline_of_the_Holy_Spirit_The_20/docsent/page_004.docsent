   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BREAKING AND CONSTITUTING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord causes many things to come our way, few of which are according to our preference.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is why the Bible charges, "Rejoice in the Lord always" Phil 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should rejoice in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the only way we can rejoice always.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Besides the Lord, what can make us rejoice always?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why does God allow all the bad things to come upon us?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is His purpose for doing these things?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His goal is to break down our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we read Jeremiah 48:11, we will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jeremiah 48:11 says, "Moab has been at ease from his youth;/And he is settled on his lees/And has not been emptied from vessel to vessel;/Nor has he gone into exile./Therefore his taste remains in him,/And his scent is not changed."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Moabites were the descendants of Lot Gen 19:36-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They were related to Abraham but were of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moab was at ease from his youth and never experienced any tribulation, trial, blow, suffering, or pain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nothing happened to him that would cause him to shed tears; nothing ever rent his heart or frustrated his way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In man's eyes this is such a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But what did God say about the Moabites?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He said, "He is settled on his lees/And has not been emptied from vessel to vessel."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For wine to settle on its lees means that the liquid is a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When wine ferments, the top part becomes clear liquid, while the lees sink to the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As soon as the vessel is shaken, the lees and the liquid mix together again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to have a clear liquid, one has to pour the wine from one vessel to another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the old days there was no filter, and the only way to remove the lees was to pour the liquid from one vessel to another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The liquid and the lees were originally mixed together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By pouring the liquid from one vessel to another, the lees were left behind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes some lees would escape with the liquid to the other vessel, and there would be the need to pour the liquid to yet another vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This would go on and on until all the lees were gone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moab was never emptied from one vessel to another.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was like wine settled on its lees.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His "lees" were not yet removed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why it says that "his taste remains in him,/And his scent is not changed."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moab always tasted like Moab.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His scent remained the scent of Moab.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His condition had not changed since the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But God is not after the old scent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He wants to change the scent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some have been believers for ten years, yet their taste remains the same as it was ten years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are like Moab, whose taste remained and whose scent was not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some people were sloppy when they first believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After twenty years they are still sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They lived in ignorance and foolishness the first day, and they still live in ignorance and foolishness today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Their taste remains the same, and their scent is not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God does not want this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God wants to remove our old habit, nature, and character; He wants to remove every undesirable element in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He wants to empty us from this vessel to that vessel and from that vessel to another vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After being emptied a few times, our "lees" will be left behind, and the original taste will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moab had an easy life, but as a result, "his taste remains in him,/And his scent is not changed."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps our life is not as easy as Moab's. Perhaps we have not been "at ease from...youth." Perhaps we have had to go through "many tribulations" like Paul Acts 14:22 . If so, we should realize that the Lord is removing our lees and our original taste.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord wants to take away our own taste and natural scent.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The old things must be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord has to uproot them all.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is pouring us from one vessel to another and then to a third.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He allows this to happen to us today and that to happen to us tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord turns us from one environment to another, from one experience to another.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Each time He arranges an environment around us and breaks us, we will shed some of our old taste and scent.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Time after time we will be purified of our old taste.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every day we will be a little different than the day before, and the next day we will be different still further.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the way the Lord works in us; He tears down a little today and a little tomorrow, until all our lees are gone, our taste is lost, and our scent is changed.</S>
