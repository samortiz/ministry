MATTERS RELATED TO SIN</h1>
<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Twenty</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE ORIGIN OF SIN&mdash;SATAN</h2>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Isa. 14:12-14; John 8:44; Ezek. 28:13-17</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>How sin came in
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Satan was originally an archangel created by God.</li>
	<li>Because he was proud and exalted himself, wanting to be equal with God, sin came in. It was through Satan&rsquo;s rebellion that he became God&rsquo;s enemy.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>What is behind all sin
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The principle of sin is pride, self-exaltation, self-will, not caring for God&rsquo;s desires, and disobedience to God.</li>
	<li>Because Satan was the first one to exalt himself and rebel against God, he became the one from whom all sin originates.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Twenty-one</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE ONE COMMITTING SIN&mdash;ADAM</h2>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rom. 5:18-19; 3:10-18</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Sin transmitted to man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although sin originated with Satan and was initiated by him, it was passed on to man and committed by man. Explain how Satan tempted Adam to commit sin in the garden of Eden.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Man being a sinner
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Because Adam followed Satan and was tempted by Satan, sin entered into man. Since that time all men have been sinners. Man&rsquo;s committing of sin did not begin at his birth, but it began nearly 6,000 years ago. From the time of Adam until now man has been committing sin.</li>
	<li>Today you also commit sin. Use examples of man&rsquo;s living and conduct to show that he commits sins.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Twenty-two</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE ONE WHO CONDEMNS SIN&mdash;GOD</h2>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Gen. 18:25; John 8:7-11; Exo. 34:7</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God should condemn sin
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God created us.</li>
	<li>He also rules over us.</li>
	<li>It follows that if we sin, He ought to condemn our sins.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God can condemn sin
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Only God is without sin.</li>
	<li>Hence, He alone can condemn our sins.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God will condemn sin
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is righteous.</li>
	<li>His righteousness demands His judgment on our sins.</li>
	</ol></li>
