   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE RICHES OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me. And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Heb 8:10-11</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1 John 2:27</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both Hebrews 8 and 1 John 2 declare that today, under the new testament, there is no need of any outward, human teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hebrews 8:10 says that God s laws are inscribed within us; thus, there is no need for anyone to teach us to know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First John 2:27 says that the anointing abides in us; hence, we do not need any human teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One passage says that God s laws are inscribed in us, and the other says that the anointing abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What are these two things?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is quite possible for us to be Christians for years and yet not know that we have these two wonderful things within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have a wonderful law written in us cf.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jer 31:33 and a mysterious anointing abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How marvelous, and yet how pitiful if we do not realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is because of the inner law and the inner anointing that we do not need any outward, human teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE CROSS AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The inner law and the inner anointing are something of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have seen the principle of the cross, that is, the all-inclusive ending of the negative things in the universe, and we have also seen the principle and the reality of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The cross ends the old creation, whereas resurrection produces the riches of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through the cross the old creation is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through the Lord s death all twelve items of the old creation have been brought to the cross and completely crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But that is not the end of the story, for after death came resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What was resurrected?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Were Satan, the kingdom of Satan, sin, and the flesh resurrected?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A thousand times no!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The eternal Spirit resurrected only the essence of what God originally created for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The human nature was a part of God s original creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God created the human nature for His purpose, but Satan damaged it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, by His death the Lord brought the Satan-damaged nature into death, but by His resurrection the Lord brought the God-created nature into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord not only redeemed the human nature but also uplifted this human nature to a higher standard.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, the new creation consists of Christ in the eternal Spirit and the recovered and uplifted human nature in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What are the items of the riches of resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First, there is the Triune God, not in the sense of the Old Testament but in the New Testament sense.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then there is the divine, eternal life, which is God Himself as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The difference between God and the divine life can be illustrated by the difference between electricity and light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Strictly speaking, electricity is light, and light is electricity, but there is still a distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, electricity is used not only as light but also as power, heat, etc. Similarly, God Himself is our life as well as many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The third item is the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 , the fourth is the law of life Rom 8:2; Heb 8:10 , and the fifth is the anointing 1 John 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These five items are the all-inclusive riches of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the other things that we can name are included in these five items.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The new creation inherits all these items in Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the riches of resurrection, we can say, are simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The divine nature is certainly God Himself, and the law of life and the anointing also are something of God Himself and His moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Man, however, is not one of the riches of resurrection but is recovered and uplifted by these riches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are somewhat familiar with the Triune God, the divine life, and the divine nature, but most Christians are not familiar with the law of life and the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In today s Christianity these have been neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the inner law and the inner anointing are the practical riches of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do not know these two things, we cannot know resurrection in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Resurrection will be known only objectively unless we know the law of life and the inner anointing; only by knowing these two things can we experience resurrection in a subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Let us consider the Old Testament with the law and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In a sense the Old Testament was even called the law and the prophets Matt 7:12; 22:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What is the difference between the two?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The law is a set of fixed rules that cannot be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For instance, one item of the law requires everyone to honor his parents Exo 20:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a changeless rule, and everyone must keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is no need to seek guidance from the Lord concerning honoring one s parents; the law concerning this matter is fixed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Another rule is, You shall not steal v. 15 . This also is an established, fixed rule.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is no need to pray, Lord, tell me whether or not it is Your mind for me to steal.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Give me guidance about stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is no need to seek such guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This same principle applies to the rest of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus, the law is a set of fixed rules that everyone must keep.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It does not alter with each individual.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Regardless of whether a person is a man or a woman and whether he is old or young, rich or poor, he is compelled to keep the rules.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The prophets, however, speak to the individual situation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Suppose someone came to Jeremiah and asked, Is it all right for me to go to Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The prophet might say this time, You may go.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But another time he might say, You may not go.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The prophets give the living guidance of the Lord according to the different individual situations.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The law is unchanging, but the word of the prophets may change many times depending on the situation of those involved.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Once we have the law, we always have it, for the commandments are permanent; however, the guidance from the prophets is valid only for the occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The prophet, therefore, must be contacted continually.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The one who sought Jeremiah could not say, One month ago the prophet said it was all right for me to go Jerusalem; therefore, I can go now without consulting him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If this one desired to go to Jerusalem again, he had to seek guidance from the prophet once more.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Whether or not he needed to honor his parents required no guidance, for this was a fixed principle of the law, but the way in which he should honor his parents was definitely a matter of guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>To determine the way he should honor his parents on a certain occasion, guidance was needed; therefore, he had to contact the prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Old Testament forbids women to wear men s clothing and men to wear women s clothing Deut 22:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This was clearly established by the Lord as a settled rule and a changeless law.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But when we are shopping for an article of clothing, one item may be worth two hundred dollars, and another, twenty dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Deciding which item to buy is a matter of seeking the Lord s guidance, not His law.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This illustrates the difference between the law and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The fixed principle of the law varies with no one, but the guidance of the prophets varies with everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Sometimes with the same person it may vary from one occasion to another.</S>
