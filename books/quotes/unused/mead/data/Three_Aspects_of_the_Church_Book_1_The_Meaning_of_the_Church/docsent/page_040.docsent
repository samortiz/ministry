   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Establishing the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once the children of Israel entered Canaan, they began to engage in warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This warfare continued until the time of David.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Joshua was the first to enter Canaan, and he began to wage war.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After him, various judges continued to fight for God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Samuel was a judge, and he too fought on behalf of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>David followed Samuel and also fought for God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through warfare, God s kingdom was brought in. Hence, the riches of Christ and the spiritual warfare have the purpose and result of bringing in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The final result of the church s warfare is to bring in God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Revelation 12 shows that the overcomers will war with Satan, the result of which will be the coming of the kingdom of God v. 10 . Today some in the church are in the wilderness, and others are already in Canaan fighting for God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The result of this warfare is that Satan will be cast down from the air and then from the earth, at which time the authority of God, the kingdom of God, will be brought to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This will be Christ s second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Old Testament, after the kingdom of Israel was established, Solomon, the king of peace, sat upon the throne 1 Kings 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This typifies the second coming of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Both the coming of the Lord Jesus and the establishment of the kingdom are the result of the warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to fight continually until the kingdom is established and the King of peace is enthroned; that is, we need to fight until the authority of God is brought to the earth, until Christ comes back, and until He becomes the King of peace on the throne of God, governing and ruling over everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The children of Israel in each stage of their history are a type of the church in its various stages.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Being Desolate</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not long after David and Solomon established the kingdom of Israel, the kingdom became desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the completion of the temple, on the day when the temple was dedicated to God by Solomon, the glory of God filled the house 2 Chron 7:1 , demonstrating that God was with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, not long after that the children of Israel were defeated in warfare, became desolate, and were finally carried away in captivity to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The establishment of the kingdom of Israel and the building of the temple typify the church bringing in the kingdom of God, attaining to God s purpose, and being full of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was the situation of the church at Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By the time Solomon dedicated the temple to God, he had already succeeded David, typifying that the Christ in glory had succeeded the suffering Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the day of Pentecost the apostle Peter said, The God of our fathers has raised Jesus, whom you slew by hanging Him on a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This One God has exalted to His right hand as Leader and Savior Acts 5:30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the type, the age of David was already over, and the age of Solomon had begun, an age in which a temple was built on the earth and dedicated to God to be His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The glory of God filled that temple.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This typifies the Spirit of God filling the disciples on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The situation on the day that Solomon dedicated the temple to God, when it was filled with the glory of God, typifies the situation of the church on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Shortly after the completion of the temple, however, the children of Israel failed and became desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This desolation typifies the desolation of the church after Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is seen in the examples of Jezebel and Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the seven epistles in Revelation, Balaam is mentioned 2:14 , showing that the failures of the children of Israel typify the failures of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later, Jezebel v. 20 and Babylon 17:5; 18:2 are also mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This shows that the desolation of the children of Israel typifies the desolation of the church after Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because of the desolation, the children of Israel were taken captive to Babylon 2 Kings 24:13-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In God s eyes, Babylon is equivalent to Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The children of Israel being taken captive to Babylon typifies the church being taken captive to Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Revelation 2 speaks of the church in Thyatira v. 18 and of Jezebel v. 20 . The church in Thyatira denotes the apostate Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rome is Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The main reason that the children of Israel were taken captive to Babylon was due to the sins of Jezebel and Ahab.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Jezebel taught the house of Ahab to worship idols, thus provoking God to anger 1 Kings 16:29-33 , and as a result, the children of Israel were carried away into exile.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The case of Jezebel depicts the desolation of the children of Israel and typifies the desolation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The result of the desolation of the church is its being taken captive to Rome, that is, to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Revelation 17 the church has fallen into Babylon vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, a voice out of heaven is heard, saying, Come out of her, My people, that you do not participate in her sins and that you do not receive her plagues 18:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Her refers to Babylon the Great, which points to Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to Revelation 17:9, the woman Babylon the Great is sitting on the seven mountains, which correspond to the seven hills upon which Rome was built.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we want to understand the desolation of the church, we need to carefully study the historical record of the period extending from Solomon to the deportation to Babylon; that is, we need to study 1 and 2 Kings and 1 and 2 Chronicles.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These four books fully depict the desolation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not consider these books merely as a history of the Israelites but as a portrait of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, what Jeroboam did in 1 Kings 12:26-30 is exactly what deformed Christianity does today.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Likewise, Jezebel s causing the children of Israel to be carried away to Babylon parallels the church s being taken captive to Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, Israel s desolation typifies the desolation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The entire Bible speaks of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Genesis 2 there is a couple: Adam and Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>From that time onward, the Bible continues to speak of Adam and Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At the end of the Scriptures, there is the wedding feast of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lamb, Christ, is typified by Adam, and the woman He marries, the church, is typified by Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Between Adam and Eve and the marriage feast of the Lamb is the story of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should never think that the books of 1 and 2 Kings and 1 and 2 Chronicles are only speaking of the history of the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Without the revelation of the Holy Spirit, we would consider these books to be merely history books; however, those who have spiritual insight realize that what is recorded in 1 and 2 Kings and 1 and 2 Chronicles is a picture of the church, a revelation concerning the church that depicts the desolation of the church on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we read only the New Testament, we would not be able to clearly know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, if we thoroughly study the Old Testament, we will see a clear picture of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We will realize that the failures of the church today are the same as those of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We will also see that the church is desolate just as the children of Israel became desolate shortly after building the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Moreover, we will see that the church has been taken into captivity just as the children of Israel were carried away to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we take the history in the Old Testament as a picture of the church, we will see a detailed type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Bible is a living book by which we may know Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>These two great items Christ and the church are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They are the Husband and the wife.</S>
