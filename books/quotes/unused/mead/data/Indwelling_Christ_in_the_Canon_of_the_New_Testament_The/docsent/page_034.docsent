   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN GALATIANS 1 Scripture Reading: Gal 1:4, 13-14, 15a, 16a; 2:20a; 3:24, 27, 28; 4:19; 5:2, 4 RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that in the book of 2 Corinthians, Paul gives us a record of his life, showing us how he experienced the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After this, in the book of Galatians, he still is speaking about the indwelling Christ, but with a specific aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the matter of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all must realize that religion is mostly composed of four things: teachings or doctrines, regulations, traditions, and ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In any religion, there are the teachings, the regulations, the traditions, and ordinances or rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All of these four things are covered in the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We also see that in the book of Galatians the law is thoroughly and absolutely dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are some similar aspects in the books of Romans and Galatians, but Romans does not mention the law as much as Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul shows us in Galatians that if we use the law in a wrong way, it becomes an entanglement to us in enjoying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, the law in this book is fully dealt with in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul tells us that he was one of the foremost ones in the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As such, he opposed Christ and persecuted the church, while at the same time he kept all the traditions of his forefathers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, we see the religion, the teachings, the law, and the traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He also mentions the matter of circumcision two or three times.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a kind of ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, he was concerned about them keeping the days, months, seasons, and years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is all a matter of ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we can see in this short book how religion, which includes the teachings, the law, the traditions, and the ordinances, is opposed to the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE PRESENT EVIL AGE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul opens the book of Galatians by calling such a religion the present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of God and our Father Gal 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every book in the Bible opens in its own specific way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul opens Galatians by saying that Christ gave Himself for our sins in order to deliver us from this present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He did not say that Christ gave Himself to deliver us from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In a general sense, all Christians usually consider that Christ gave Himself for our sins to deliver us from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But here Paul says that Christ gave Himself for our sins to deliver us from this present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was the age in which Paul was living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many Bible translators translate the Greek word for age into world, because an age is a part or period of the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the ages added together equal the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During the time of the Apostle Paul, there was a certain age.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you have ever read the world history of that period of time, you could see that that age had three aspects: Greek philosophy, Roman politics, and the Hebrew religion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Greeks brought in the philosophy, the wisdom, and the knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Romans brought in the way to govern and organize a strong administration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then the Hebrews had the best religion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now we can see that what Paul means when he speaks of the present evil age is the Hebrew religion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As far as he was concerned, he was not in Greek philosophy or Roman politics.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But he was very much in the Hebrew religion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And his subject in this book is not in the sphere of philosophy or politics.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is fully related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, we must realize that religion is part of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Most Christians do not know what Paul meant when he said that Christ gave Himself for our sins to deliver us from this present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They all interpreted this word to mean the world in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But this is not the Greek word kosmos.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is the word for age.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not the world in a general way, but the age in which Paul lived.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And of course this had to be the religious world of the Hebrew religion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Galatians 6:13-15 the Apostle Paul also made it very clear that circumcision, the religious ordinance, was something of the world to which Paul was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Also, at the time when Paul wrote this letter to the Galatian churches Galatia was a province of the Roman empire , the saints in those churches had become ensnared in a kind of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that they had been caught by the present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is why the Apostle Paul wrote this letter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the believers in Galatia had been caught in a religious realm which at that time was the present evil age.</S>
