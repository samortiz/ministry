[1]  CONTENTS The Service of the Priesthood Serving in the Spirit to Minister Christ to Others Serving in Coordination The Relationship Between the Ministry and the Church Gospel Preaching in the Church Realizing the Body Life
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE SERVICE OF THE PRIESTHOOD Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:5, 9; Rom 12:1-2, 4-7
[3]  In the Christian life there are always two aspects, the matter of life and the matter of service.
[4]  As the Lord's children, we need a proper spiritual life, and we need the proper spiritual service.
[5]  First we have the aspect of life, then the aspect of service.
[6]  We should be separated from the common things unto the Lord and learn how to remain in the presence of the Lord, how to bring the need of the people, the need of the sinful world, to the Lord and pray.
[7]  If you have a burden to minister a word to the church, first you need to check whether you have been built up in the reality of the Body and are in the coordination.
[8]  CHAPTER TWO SERVING IN THE SPIRIT TO MINISTER CHRIST TO OTHERS Scripture Reading: Rom 7:6; 2 Cor 3:6, 8 THREE VITAL POINTS
[9]  In the previous chapter we saw three vital points regarding the matter of service.
[10]  The first is that in the church all the serving ones must be built up together as a spiritual house, the priesthood 1 Pet 2:5 .
[11]  When you are going to visit one of the saints, you need to learn to visit in the spirit.
[12]  The purpose of all we do in the church service is to minister Christ to others.
[13]  CHAPTER THREE SERVING IN COORDINATION Scripture Reading: Rom 7:6
[14]  We have already seen that we need to serve the Lord in the spirit, and that in our service the one thing we need to do is to minister Christ to others as life.
[15]  Whatever we do in the Lord's service, we must do it in the spirit.
[16]  In Romans 7:6 we are told that we need to serve the Lord not only in the spirit, but also in the newness of the spirit: "But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, so that we serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter."
[17]  On the first day that I come here to serve, I may do ninety percent of the things and leave ten percent in the hands of others.
[18]  If you do not serve the Lord with others, you will never know yourself, but when you serve with others, you will be exposed how "good" you really are.
[19]  In my experience I have always been tested by the brothers in the service.
[20]  We do need the training in this matter, and we need the practice.
[21]  CHAPTER FOUR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MINISTRY AND THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Acts 13:1-4a
[22]  In order to serve the Lord among His children in the most proper way, we must know the relationship between the work, or the ministry, and the church.
[23]  If we consider the record and the teachings in the Acts and all the Epistles in the New Testament, it is clear that the ministry is something closely related to the church yet still different from the church.
[24]  Before that day, there was no church in Jerusalem, but something else was there, something closely related to the church but different from it.
[25]  DISTINGUISHING THE SERVICE OF THE MINISTRY FROM THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH
[26]  If we are going to serve the Lord, we must realize whether we are serving the Lord in the church or in the ministry.
[27]  We may answer in this way: When he went to the church meetings simply as a brother, what he did there was a service of the church, but for the most part Timothy's service was of the ministry; it was for the church but not of the church.
[28]  Of course, it was for the church, to help the church and the saints, but as far as the responsibility, the burden, and the ministry are concerned, it had nothing to do with the church and was entirely outside of the church.
[29]  If we are serving in the church, we must be coordinated in the church service, but if we are serving in the ministry, we must be coordinated in the service of the ministry.
[30]  CHAPTER FIVE GOSPEL PREACHING IN THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; Mark 16:15; Acts 2:14; Eph 6:15
[31]  In this chapter we will see something concerning how to preach the gospel in the church.
[32]  According to church history, Christians in past generations have taken many ways to preach the gospel for the Lord.
[33]  If we are going to practice a proper church life, our church life and the Christian life of every brother and sister must be balanced by gospel preaching.
[34]  We need to help all the brothers and sisters learn how to pray, on the one hand, and learn how to preach, on the other hand.
[35]  When we first came to Taiwan in 1949, many of us were poor.
[36]  HELPING THE SAINTS TO PREACH THE GOSPEL BY MANY MEANS
[37]  At a certain point, when the leading ones of the church realize that the church needs to have a gospel campaign, a gospel meeting, they should call the saints together every evening to have a week of prayer meetings to pray specifically in preparation for the gospel preaching.
[38]  CHAPTER SIX REALIZING THE BODY LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 12; Gen 1:26
[39]  By the mercy and grace of the Lord we have seen something of life, and we have seen that in order to experience life we need certain real dealings, including dealing with the flesh, the self, the conscience, the world, and the spirit.
[40]  If we take care of all these dealings, we will attain to a point where we realize the divine life in the church life.
[41]  We will realize the Body of Christ, not merely in doctrine but in a practical way in our Christian practice and Christian life; that is, we will realize the real practice of the Body of Christ.
[42]  Although this may be a familiar subject or term for many of us, we look to the Lord that we may see something in a very practical way.
[43]  We must offer ourselves in the body to the Lord, we must not be conformed to this present age, and we must be transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[44]  Fourth, we have to discern, know, and test what the best will of God is v. 2c . If we have all these practical matters, we will then attain to the point where we are able to realize the Body life, the life of the Body of Christ.
[45]  We may talk about the church life, the Body life, and the Body of Christ, but the realization of the life of the Body of Christ depends on the above four practical matters, three positive and one negative.
[46]  If we have the practical experiences of offering ourselves in our body to the Lord, of not being conformed to the present age, of being transformed in our old nature, and of having the discernment of the best will of God, we will have the ground to realize the Body life.
[47]  At this point, we will realize that as people who are regenerated and transformed by the Holy Spirit, we are members of the Body, and as members, what we must experience is something not of this world or of ourselves but something absolutely of Christ Himself.
[48]  Today there is the urgent need of this teaching concerning the Body life, but we must realize that the teaching is not for the teaching; it is for life, for the church, for Christ.
[49]  Then we will realize the Body of Christ as a life that is absolutely not independent, individual, and not of the natural self, but a life which is Christ Himself to be experienced by us in a corporate way.
[50]  THE PRACTICAL STEPS TO REALIZING THE BODY LIFE Giving Up the Self
[51]  If we are going to practice and realize the Body life, we first must give up our self.
[52]  Third, if we are going to realize the Body life, we must seriously and heartily learn always to keep the harmony.
[53]  This does not mean that in doing something wrong we are in harmony to be wrong, and it does not mean that we never have disagreements or discussions.
