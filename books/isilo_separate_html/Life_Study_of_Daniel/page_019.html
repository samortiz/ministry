DANIEL'S THREE COMPANIONS<br>STANDING AGAINST THE DEVILISH WORSHIP<br>AND BEING ACCUSED BY THE CHALDEANS</H2><P>Daniel's three companions, the young overcomers among the Jewish captives, stood against the devilish worship and were accused by the Chaldeans (vv. 8-12). The Chaldeans were jealous of Daniel and his companions and took their refusal to worship the golden image as grounds to accuse them before Nebuchadnezzar.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. NEBUCHADNEZZAR TEMPTING<br>THE YOUNG OVERCOMERS<br>BY GIVING THEM ANOTHER CHANCE<br>TO WORSHIP THE GOLDEN IMAGE</H2><P>Nebuchadnezzar, in rage and fury, tempted the young overcomers by giving them another chance to worship his golden image, with the threat of throwing them into a blazing furnace of fire (vv. 13-15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE ANSWER OF THE THREE YOUNG OVERCOMERS</H2><P>The three overcomers answered, "If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the blazing furnace of fire, and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king" (v. 17). Their response to Nebuchadnezzar was impolite and very bold (vv. 16-18). Yet there was still something of the natural thought in their response. They said that God was able to deliver them from the blazing furnace. Actually, God did not need to deliver them from the furnace. He kept them in the furnace and made the fire of no effect (v. 25). They were bold, but they were not so spiritual. If they had been spiritual, they would have said, "Nebuchadnezzar, we are happy to go into the blazing furnace, because when we go He comes. He makes your burning furnace a very pleasant place."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. NEBUCHADNEZZAR BEING FILLED WITH FURY<br>AND COMMANDING THAT THE OVERCOMERS BE BOUND<br>AND THROWN INTO THE BLAZING FURNACE OF FIRE</H2><P>Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury, and the countenance of his face was changed toward the young overcomers. He commanded that the furnace be made seven times hotter than usual, and that certain mighty men in his army bind the overcomers and throw them into the blazing furnace of fire (vv. 19-21).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
