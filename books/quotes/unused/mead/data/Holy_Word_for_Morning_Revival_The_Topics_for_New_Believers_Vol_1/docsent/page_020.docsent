   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 3 DAY 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Eph 5:18 Be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>25-26 Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Inward Washing of the Water in the Word Accomplishing a Work of Transformation</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Ephesians 5:18 Paul charges us to "be filled in spirit," no doubt with the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But how can the Spirit of God get into our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The answer is that the Spirit comes into our spirit through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When our spirit is filled with the Word, the Word, having come into us, becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is proved by 5:26 which speaks of "the washing of the water in the word."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the Word did not get into us, how could it wash us inwardly?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The washing in 5:26 is not an outward washing, but a washing from within, a washing that removes spots and wrinkles, thereby accomplishing a work of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fact that we are washed by the water in the Word proves that it is possible for the Word to get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>76</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the divine concept, water here refers to the flowing life of God typified by flowing water Exo 17:6; 1 Cor 10:4; John 7:38-39; Rev 21:6; 22:1, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The washing of such water is different from the washing of the redeeming blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The redeeming blood washes away our sins 1 John 1:7; Rev 7:14 , whereas the water of life washes away the blemishes of the natural life of our old man, such as "spot or wrinkle or any such things" v. 27 . In sanctifying the church, the Lord firstly washes away our sins with His blood Heb 13:12 and then washes away our natural blemishes with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are now in such a washing process in order that the church may be holy and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>77</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we read and pray-read the Bible in a proper way, even musing upon the Word, singing it, and dwelling in it, our inner being will be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may say that we are filled with the Word, with the Spirit, or with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may also say that we are filled with the anointing, with God, or with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By this inward filling we have the power to defeat the darkness in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We also have the living water flowing within us to wash away the old elements, the wrinkles and the spots, and to renew us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we are filled in this way, we sense that Christ is settling Himself in our being, making our inner chambers the rooms for His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Also, when we enjoy such a filling, we love all believers, no matter what their nationality may be.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moreover, our inner eyes are enlightened, and our vision becomes clear.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Oh, there is nothing more refreshing and cleansing than to be inwardly washed by the water in the Word!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we are filled with the Word and washed by it, our entire being is renewed and transparent, and we have a foretaste of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>78</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we would pray-read chapter by chapter and book by book, week after week, month after month, and year after year, gradually we will receive enlightenment, and all the things of Christ will spring up within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the riches of Christ will become our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this way all the riches of Christ are ministered and dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These heavenly elements and spiritual ingredients will cause us to have not only an outward change but a metabolic change, a change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All these new elements will replace and discharge all the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a metabolic change, transforming us into a new condition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Pray-reading is wonderful, but we also have to pray, "Lord, clear a way within me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>O Lord, have a free course within me."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Pray-reading does not help us to obtain mere knowledge; rather, it brings many things of the Lord into us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we need to give the things of the Lord a free course within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This affords us the best spiritual digestion, assimilating what we have pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Never say no to the Lord; learn always to say amen.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>79</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
