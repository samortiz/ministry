   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE PRACTICE OF PROPHESYING 1 Scripture Reading: Heb 1:1-2a; John 1:1; Gen 1:6-7, 9, 11, 14-15; Psa 33:6a, 9; John 5:24; 14:10b; Num 11:29b; 1 Cor 14:31; 1 Thes 5:20; Amos 2:12b; 7:12-13; Jer 11:21; 15:19; 1:8-9; Psa 73:28a; 25:14; 73:17; Acts 6:4; 1 Thes 5:16-20; Col 3:16; Acts 19:6 I. GOD BEING A SPEAKING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our God is a speaking God Heb 1:1-2a .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since God is our Father, we as His children must follow Him to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should speak all the time, but we should not speak in the way of murmuring or gossiping.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, we should speak the word of life Phil 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hebrews 1:1-2a says, "God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In times of old God spoke to the fathers in the prophets, but now He is speaking in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, "the Son" mentioned in verse 2 is corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today we believers are a part of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is still speaking in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Throughout the past twenty centuries, the speaking of those who spoke forth the Lord according to the New Testament and its principles has been the Son's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the New Testament, the apostle Paul is an example of one whose speaking was the Son's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have stressed that the entire New Testament is the teaching of the apostles Acts 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, if we teach the same thing as the New Testament teaches, our teaching is also a part of the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some dissenting ones have said that the apostles' teaching comprises only what the Lord Jesus spoke in the four Gospels and what He charged His disciples to teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They have neglected the Lord's word in John 16 which says, "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No doubt, the place where the Lord declared the "many things" is in the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some Christians also consider that only the words spoken directly by the Lord Himself in the four Gospels are the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They do not believe that what was spoken after the four Gospels in Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation is the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Colossians 1:25 Paul said that he was commissioned to complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that before Paul's writings, the holy Word in the Bible was not yet complete.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The holy Word was not complete in regard to God's economy and the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>GOD EVEN BEING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is even the Word John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must receive grace that we ourselves also would become the word, that is, God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some may ridicule us by saying that "you are the word of God."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They say this because we speak the word of God to them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In a sense, we are the word of God to people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are the ones from whom they hear the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, we are the word of God to them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we go to visit sinners, we must not forget that we are the word of God to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our going to visit them means that the word of God is also going to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we visit sinners, we must utter something of God's word to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we must learn to speak.</S>
