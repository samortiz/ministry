This is mentioned in Psalm 91:1, &#8220;He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.&#8221; We all must learn to hide ourselves in the secret place of the Most High. This means to be in the presence of God in the heavenly places, which is to stay in the Lord&#8217;s ascension. If I am troubled by a certain person or a particular situation, I must pray, &#8220;O Lord Jesus, keep me in the cleft of the rock, and help me to stay in the secret of the steep places. O Lord, may I stay at Your cross, and may I stay in Your presence in the heavenlies.&#8221; In this way I am crossed out, and everything is under my feet. Hallelujah!<p>This is a wonderful working out of the transformation of life. No one will fail to be transformed by such a life. As long as we are staying at the cross and in the heavenly places in the Lord&#8217;s presence, there will be a real growth in life and transformation of life.<h2 class=head1>PERMEATED WITH DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2><p>After a long period of such experiences, we come to 3:6, &#8220;Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?&#8221; It is better to say &#8220;permeated with myrrh and frankincense.&#8221; We know that in typology myrrh signifies the fragrance of Jesus&#8217; death, and frankincense signifies the sweet flavor of His resurrection. We all must be permeated by the flavor of the death and resurrection of Christ. Then we will be perfumed with myrrh and frankincense. This is not just a doctrine to learn; it is an experience that takes time. For many months and years we need to be under the permeating fragrance of the death and resurrection of Christ.<p>In addition to the myrrh and frankincense, there are also the &#8220;powders of the merchant.&#8221; Christ is the merchant, and all of His sweet powders must saturate us. We must be permeated with the death and resurrection of Christ and with all the attributes of the heavenly Christ. This will surely bring about a real transformation.<h2 class=head1>PILLARS SUPPORTING GOD&#8217;S INTEREST</h2><p>The seeking one has now become pillars of smoke standing on the earth supporting the expanse. The Apostles Paul and John were such persons. They were, and still are today, the pillars of smoke in the whole universe supporting the skies. When we read their writings, we realize that they are real pillars to the skies. When we become such pillars, the Lord can commit His purpose to us and upon us. Then we are pillars that stand fast without shaking. This figure is taken from the ancient mode of construction in which they did not use walls to support the building, but they used pillars or columns. Everything rested upon these pillars. This is why Paul mentioned Peter, James, and John as pillars of the church (Gal. 2:9). In 1 Timothy 3:15, the church of the living God is spoken of as the pillar and ground of the reality. Now the seeking one has become such a pillar to uphold God&#8217;s interests on the earth.<h2 class=head1>THE REST OF CHRIST</h2><p>Who is this one? &#8220;Behold his couch, which is Solomon&#8217;s; threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel&#8221; (3:7). The answer came that she is now the couch of Solomon. The question was about her, but the answer is concerning Solomon. This is because she is now one with Solomon; she is one with Christ. Christ is the content and she is the container. A couch is a kind of container to hold the content, not for moving, but for resting in the night. The valiant men of war are around this couch. This surely means that she has now come into the stage of spiritual warfare. Only the mature ones can fight in the war, and here the war is waged even at night. Yet even during the war in the night, Christ can still have His rest in such a seeking one. Who is this? She is the rest of Christ. She is not only the pillar supporting God&#8217;s interests on the earth, but she is also the couch affording the rest to Christ, even during the war at night.<p>Now she is not for her own satisfaction, but for Christ&#8217;s satisfaction. In chapter two, she was under the apple tree for her satisfaction, but now Solomon lies down and has his satisfaction in her. Who is this one? This is Solomon&#8217;s couch, his resting place during the war at night.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life and Building as Portrayed in the Song of Songs &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
