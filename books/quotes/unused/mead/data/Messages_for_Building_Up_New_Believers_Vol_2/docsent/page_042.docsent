   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE DELIVERANCE Scripture Reading: Rom 7:15 8:2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is possible for a person to be free from sin immediately after he has believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, this may not be the common experience of all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After believing in the Lord, many people fall back into sin instead of being freed from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is true that they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They belong to the Lord and possess eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, they are still troubled by sin and are unable to serve the Lord as they wish.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is a very painful experience for a person to be continually troubled by sin after he has believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A person who has been enlightened by God has a sensitive conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is sensitive toward sin and has a life that condemns sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, he may still be bothered by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This results in much frustration and even discouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is indeed a very painful experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many Christians try to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some think that if they try hard enough to renounce sin, they will eventually be free from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a result, they try their best to reject the temptations of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some realize that sin should be overcome, and they continually wrestle with sin in the hope of overcoming it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Others think that sin has made them a captive and that they must strive hard to free themselves from its bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, all these are man s thoughts; they are not God s word or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>None of these methods lead to victory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s Word does not tell us to struggle with sin by our own efforts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It says that we should be delivered from sin, that is, be released or freed from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sin is a power which enslaves man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The way to deal with this power is not by destroying it ourselves but by allowing the Lord to free us from it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have sin, and there is no way to separate ourselves from it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord s way is not to vanquish sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is saving us from sin s power by moving us away from it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>New believers should know from the start the right way to be delivered from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no need to travel a long and tortuous path to find deliverance from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can take the way of freedom as soon as we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now let us try to deal with this matter according to Romans 7 and 8.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I. SIN BEING A LAW</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Romans 7:15-25 says, For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do....For to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For I do not do the good which I will; but the evil which I do not will, this I practice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it out....I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man, but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members....So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verses 15 through 20, Paul repeatedly uses the word will and the phrase do not will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The emphasis is on willing or not willing, resolving or not resolving.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verses 21 to 25, there is another emphasis on the law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These two things are the keys to this passage of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, we need to understand the term law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The common understanding of a law is that it is something that remains the same all the time, something that allows no exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moreover, there is power in a law.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This power is a natural power, not an artificial power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All laws have power.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, gravity is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you throw something up, it will eventually fall back to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You do not have to pull the object down with your hands; the earth has a force that pulls it down for you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you throw a stone up, it will fall.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you throw an iron up, it also will fall.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you throw something up in China, it will fall.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you throw the same thing up in other countries, it will fall.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>An object in the air will fall the same today and tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Any object in the air, as long as nothing is holding it, will fall regardless of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A law remains the same all the time and allows no exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is a natural force which requires no human effort for its perpetuation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Romans 7 shows us that Paul was trying to be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He was trying to free himself from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He wanted to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He did not want to sin or to fail.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, he eventually admitted that his resolutions were all futile.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He said, To will is present with me, but to work out the good is not.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He did not want to sin, yet he sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He wanted to do good and walk according to God s law, yet he could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In other words, what he willed he could not do, and what he resolved to do, he was unable to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Paul willed again and again, but the result was only repeated failure.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This shows us that the way to victory lies not in the human will or human resolution.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Paul willed and resolved again and again, but he still failed and sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Obviously, to will is present, but to work out the good is not.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The best that a man can do is make resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The willing is present but not the good, because sin is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Following verse 21 Paul showed us that he remained defeated even after he made numerous resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is because sin is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This law of sin was present with him every time he resolved to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He was subject to the law of God in his heart, but his flesh yielded to the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Whenever he willed to obey God s law, a different law rose up in his members, subjecting him to the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Paul was the first person in the Bible to point out that sin is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This was a very important discovery!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is a pity that many who have been Christians for years still do not realize that sin is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Many people know that gravity is a law and thermal expansion of objects is another law.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But they do not know that sin is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Paul did not know this at first.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>After sinning repeatedly, not voluntarily but involuntarily by a potent force in his body, Paul discovered that sin is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Our history of failure tells us that whenever temptations come, we try to resist them.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But we are never successful in this resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When temptations come again, we again try to resist them, only to end up in another defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This experience repeats itself ten times, a hundred times, or a thousand times, and we still find ourselves defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is the story of our failure.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We fail again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is not something that happens by chance; it is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If a person committed only one sin in a lifetime, he could consider sin as something incidental.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>However, those who have sinned a hundred or a thousand times will say that sin is a law; it is something that continually drives them on.</S>
