<P>Verse 13:"Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour." The lesson here is still to be watchful. The Lord told them to watch, showing that all the virgins had life. The Lord did not say to the virgins that they needed to be born again to obtain salvation. In verse 10 those who were ready went in with Him to the feast. To be ready is to be watchful; hence, the two are together. To be ready is to have no unfinished business. Every day a ready person is prepared to hand over his business. A watchful person is one who sees His coming and is therefore always ready. We believers should be those who can hand over everything every day. For us, the Lord can come any day.</P><P>The five foolish virgins were ready and watchful in the beginning, but they did not persevere. Readiness is related to the unfinished business in our lives. Watchfulness is related to the imminent coming of the Lord. To be ready, to be watchful, and to wait requires the strength that comes from the infilling of the Holy Spirit, the second kind of oil. One cannot trust in his self. The self quickly becomes weak and confused. In order for our watchfulness to last, we must depend on the Holy Spirit. The filling of the Holy Spirit will automatically issue forth in good works, the fruits that glorify God.</P><P>Those who are truly watchful always feel that they are not fully ready; they do not trust in themselves and are willing to follow humbly. Brothers and sisters, it is of no benefit to equip ourselves with prophecy if we are not watchful and ready. Would it not be a great loss if we have the knowledge of prophecy today yet suffer loss in the future? Get ready! The Lord wants to see our lamps and our light. Watch! No one knows the day or the hour. If the day and the hour were known, there would be no need to watch. In chapters twenty-four and twenty-five there are five instances where it is said that no one knows the day of the Lord's coming. This repetition is to stress its importance. Do not rely on being caught up after the tribulation. The Lord does not reveal the day of His coming because He wants us to be watchful.</P><P>Verses 14-30:The parable of the talents, from verse 14 through verse 30, can be divided into four sections: (a) the distribution of the Lord's talents (vv. 14-15); (b) the ways the slaves used their talents (vv. 16-18); (c) the judgment of the first and second slaves (vv. 19-23); and (d) the judgment of the third slave (vv. 24-30).</P><P>In order to understand this parable, we must first understand the difference between our relationship (1) with God and (2) with the Lord. Otherwise, it will be difficult to understand the Bible clearly, and we will encounter many difficulties and contradictions. Before God we are children, and before the Lord we are servants, or slaves. We are children by faith, and we are servants by works. In grace we are children and in responsibility we are slaves. We are children because of the Son and we are slaves because of the Spirit.</P><P>This passage concerns the relationship between the slaves and the Lord, not the relationship between the children and the Father. From 25:14 on, the Gospel of Matthew no longer deals with the relationship between the children and the Father, which is eternal. Rather, it deals with the relationship between the Lord and His slaves, which lasts until the end of the millennium. The relationship with the Father has to do with salvation and eternity. The relationship with the Son has to do with victory and reward. The parable of the talents concerns the reward, not eternity. The question of eternity has already been resolved.</P><P>There are basic differences between the New Testament and the Old Testament. In the Old Testament we must labor before we can gain life. That is, we must first be slaves; then we can be children. However, in the New Testament we must first possess life, and then we work. This means that we must be regenerated first; then we become slaves. God does not desire the fleshly service of His believers.</P><P>Verse 14:"For the kingdom of the heavens is just like a man about to go abroad, who called his own slaves and delivered to them his possessions." The phrase "the kingdom of the heavens" is not in the original text. The original text reads, "It is like a man." This "man" is the Lord. The term "abroad" refers to a foreign country, one that is not in this world and is different from any country on earth. Our citizenship is of that country (Phil. 3:20). "About to go abroad" refers to the Lord's ascension (Heb. 9:24; 1 Pet. 3:22). "Called his own slaves." From this we know that this cannot refer to the Jews, because the Jews are not slaves. Neither can it refer to the unsaved, for they are not the Lord's own purchased slaves. Formerly, Abraham circumcised his son and his purchased slaves according to God's covenant. Today our position is both as children reborn and as slaves purchased by the blood. The Lord wants us to serve Him as His slaves. There are two extreme views today in the church: one emphasizes works instead of faith; the other emphasizes faith instead of works.</P><P>"Delivered to them his possessions." Because the man was going to travel abroad, he delivered his possessions to his slaves that he might test them. A servant may be faithful while in the presence of his lord, but his faithfulness is genuine only when it is maintained in the absence of his lord. The man's delivering of his possessions to them indicated that he expected them to manage his possessions for him. The situation is the same today. We serve an invisible Lord who has delivered His possessions to us.</P><P>This parable is different from that in Luke 19:13, where it says, "Do business until I come." Here the Lord did not tell us specifically what to do. Rather, He wants us to seek His will and to accomplish it. Only those who are able to discern and accomplish His will are qualified for the reward. The real test lies in the fact that the slaves are not told what to do.</P>
