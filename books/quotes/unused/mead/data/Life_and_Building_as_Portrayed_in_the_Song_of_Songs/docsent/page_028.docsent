   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE GARDEN AND THE CITY Scripture Reading: S. S. 1:11; 3:6, 9, 10; 4:4a, 6, 12-16; 5:1; 6:2, 4 LIFE IS FOR BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must keep in mind that the theme of all these chapters on the Song of Songs is life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not only a matter of life, but also of building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the above verses we see something of building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver" 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This verse follows the one in which the Lord calls His seeking one "a company of horses."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we have mentioned, a horse is something natural, something of birth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is absolutely nothing of building related to a horse.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the Lord promises to work on her with gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both of these materials are not natural to her.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They must be built into her.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here we have the implication that the Lord is going to build something upon her.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the books in the Scriptures were inspired by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We see this clearly in the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not one human being could compose such poetry with all the spiritual applications found in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we did not have the experience and the light from the Lord, even though we were scholars in the language and poetry of this book, I do not believe we could see the real significance here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The real significance is in the matter of building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From 1:11, we must go to 3:9-10, the verses concerning the palanquin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have seen that it is built up with wood, silver, gold, and purple, plus the interior decoration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The palanquin has gold as the base, just as the New Jerusalem does.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the New Jerusalem, the main part of the city is gold Rev 21:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In that city is the throne for Christ the King.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is just like the palanquin, in which there is a purple seat, signifying the kingship of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All of these materials are for building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The palanquin is not natural; it has been built up with all these materials.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Chapter four says that her neck is like the tower of David.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A tower is a high building, and this building is for an armory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By this time, it is clear that the seeking one already has a certain amount of building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Life comes first, and building follows.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Life is for building, and building is the issue of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE GARDEN</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After this, the seeking one continues to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is seen in 4:12-14: "A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thy plants are an orchard paradise of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; henna flowers with spikenard.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now the seeking one is likened by the Lord to a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She is not only a palanquin, but also a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The purpose of this garden is mainly for the growth of certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This corresponds with 1 Corinthians 3:9, which says that we are God's farm and God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God's farm is equal to the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Growing is for building.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What is grown on the farm is for the building of God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The seeking one has become not only a palanquin in which Christ can move, but also a garden to grow so many spices.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually it says this garden is "a paradise" Darby's New Translation and ASV footnote .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whatever grows in this garden is for the Lord's satisfaction and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Song of Songs begins with eating, drinking, and enjoyment on the seeker's side, but now the enjoyment is for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In chapters one and two, the seeker is eating the fruit of the apple tree and drinking the wine in the banqueting house.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But now, the Lord is eating the fruits of the garden and drinking the wine and milk for His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk" 5:1 .</S>
