CONFORMING US TO HIS DEATH</h2>
<p>It is through the life of Christ that His death operates in us, and it is through His resurrection power that we experience His death and are conformed to His death. His life in us is His resurrection power. This resurrection power applies the death that the Lord accomplished on the cross to us so that we may live in His death and bear its likeness, thereby being conformed to His death. This is revealed in Philippians 3:10. In order to be conformed to the death of Christ, we need to know not only Christ but also the power of His resurrection. By knowing Christ and the power of His resurrection we can be conformed to His death, because the power of His resurrection applies His death to us.</p>
<p>We can partake of Christ&rsquo;s death because we partake of Christ. He enters into us in His resurrection. Since we are joined to Him, we can partake of His death. In His incarnation He was joined to humanity. Then through His death and resurrection, He imparted His life into us so that we could be joined to Him. Through this joining we can participate in His death, and His death becomes our death. We can die with Him because we are joined to Him as one (1 Cor. 6:17). We are joined to the Lord by His resurrection and in His resurrection life. In His resurrection we were regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3); His life was imparted into us so that we could partake of Him and be joined with Him as one. The Lord Jesus has made it possible for us to partake of His death and for His death to become our death. His resurrection has brought His death to us, and His resurrection life, His resurrection power, applies His death to us so that we may experience His death and be conformed to it.</p>
<p>When the resurrected Christ entered into us, we sensed the effect of His killing work in putting us to death. We also sensed many negative things within us being put to death. When we allow Christ in His resurrection life and power to live in us, we sense the operation of His killing power. This power kills our self, our flesh, and everything that He condemns. The more we allow the power of His resurrection to operate in us, the more His resurrection life applies His death to us. His resurrection life causes us to experience His death and be conformed to it; that is, His resurrection life puts us into the mold of His death so that we may bear its likeness.</p>
<p>The resurrected Christ enlivens us and also puts us to death. The more He lives in us, the more He puts us to death. The more His resurrection life lives in us, the more its killing power operates in us. Those who allow Christ to live in them experience the killing work of His death. The living Christ brings us to the killing of His cross. The operation of His resurrection life conforms us to His death.</p>
<p>If we do not allow Christ to live in us, we will be ignorant of our flesh, our self, and our natural constitution, but if we consecrate ourselves to the Lord and let Him live in us, our flesh, our self, and our natural constitution will be manifested to us. When our flesh, our self, and our natural constitution are manifested, the Lord will require us to put them to death. If we are willing to obey, His resurrection life will operate in us to bring forth the killing power of His death to our flesh, our self, and our natural constitution. Christ applies the cross to us so that we may experience His death in His resurrection life. When His death is planted in us and grows into our living, we will bear the likeness of His death with the full measure of His stature.</p>
<p>If we allow Christ to live in us, allow His resurrection life to operate in us, and allow Him to be our life and to live out of us, we will experience His death and be conformed to the mold of His death. The resurrection life of Christ will bring us to death and require that we pass through death. If we are faithful to live by the resurrection life of Christ and fulfill its requirements, everything that we are will be brought to the cross and gradually terminated so that Christ may be formed in us. Christ brings His death to us, and the death of Christ adds Him to us. Hence, Christ gives us the cross, and the cross gives us Christ.</p>
<p>Christ brings us to the cross, and the cross ushers us into Christ. Christ and the cross cannot be separated; one is the cause, and the other is the effect. When Christ comes, the cross comes, and when Christ reigns, the cross reigns. Christ&rsquo;s work in us is measured by the effect of the cross in us. Christ always brings the cross, and the cross always ushers in Christ. The work of the cross in us determines how much Christ we gain. The extent to which we have been emptied by the cross is the extent to which we can be filled with Christ. The extent of the termination of the cross in us is the extent to which Christ&rsquo;s life can increase in us. If we want to gain Christ, we must accept the cross, and if we want to experience the cross, we must let Christ live in us.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life brings His death to us and becomes the power for us to experience His death. <em>Hymns,</em> #481 says, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not hard to die with Christ / When His risen life we know; / &rsquo;Tis not hard to share His suff&rsquo;rings / When our hearts with joy o&rsquo;erflow. / In His resurrection power / He has come to dwell in me, / And my heart is gladly going / All the way to Calvary.&rdquo; This hymn expresses the meaning of Philippians 3:10. The resurrection life of Christ conforms us to the death of Christ. When we know Christ and the power of His resurrection, we experience His death, live in His death, and are conformed to His death.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Cross &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
