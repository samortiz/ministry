   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before God spoke to men, He spoke to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He spoke to that which was not being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time there was nothing; so He spoke to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By His speaking He called things not being as being Rom 4:17, Recovery Version .</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God worked by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The real working of God among us today is His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If God does not speak among us, we can do nothing regardless of how much we work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If God does not speak, the elders and the leading ones in the churches can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when He speaks, we must say, Praise the Lord!</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Old Testament, God spoke to people not once for all and only in one way, but in many portions and in many ways: in one portion to the Patriarchs in one way; in another portion through Moses in another way; in one portion through David in one way; in other portions through a number of prophets in several different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Old Testament, contains many different portions.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every way of utterance has been used in the Scripture.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That was a most wonderful way of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moses understood by it that there was no need for him to be burnt.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He needed to be burning, but he did not need to be burnt.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God was not going to use him as the fuel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A little burning bush spoke a great deal to Moses.</S>
