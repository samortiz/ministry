   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE SON TO BE GLORIFIED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THAT THE FATHER MAY BE GLORIFIED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The basic concept of the Lord s prayer in John 17 is glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 1 the Lord said, Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the subject, the central point, of this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we see the main points of the three previous chapters, we shall be able to understand what it means to have the Son glorified that the Father may be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Father is to glorify the Son so that the Son may glorify the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a mutual glorification between the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the Father will glorify the Son, then the Son will glorify the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a prayer that follows a message conveys the main point of the message, so the Lord s concluding prayer covers the main point of the message He gave in the preceding three chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Keep this in mind, for it will help you to understand this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The main point of the Lord s message in John 14 through 16 was that the Son may be glorified so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In what way is the Father to be glorified in the Son?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through the organism of the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we have seen, the organism of the vine tree is for the propagating and spreading of life, that is, for the multiplication and reproduction of life, and also for the expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Triune God is propagated, multiplied, and expressed through this organism, the Son is glorified, and in the Son s glorification the Father is glorified also.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, the Lord prayed that He, the Son, would be glorified so that the Father also might be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God s eternal purpose, His ultimate intention, is to manifest, to express, Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As I have pointed out several times in the past, glorification simply means manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To be glorified is to be manifested and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, electricity that is not manifested is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before a lamp is switched on, the electricity is hidden within the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But when the lamp is turned on, the electricity is manifested and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, it is God s intention to manifest and express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the electricity is glorified when it is manifested, so God is glorified when He is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In creation God created man in His own image Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Image denotes some sort of expression.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without a certain kind of image, God could never be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, the image is the very expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s intention in creating man in His own image was that He might be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus is God who became incarnated as a man for the purpose of declaring the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John 1:18 says that no one has ever seen God but that the Son has declared Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is unseen and invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No one except the Son of God has ever seen Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now, in His incarnation, the Son has declared Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To declare God means to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus is the very image of the invisible God Col 1:15 , which means that He is the very expression of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The best illustration of glorification is the blossoming of a flower.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A carnation seed, for example, is sown into the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After it grows up out of the earth, it blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This blossoming is the glorification of the carnation seed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The carnation seed contains the life element and the life shape of the carnation flower.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The style, color, and beauty of the flower are all contained in a little carnation seed, but no one can see this style, color, and beauty until the seed grows out of the earth and blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The blossom is the glory of the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The blossoming is the glorification of the seed, for it is by blossoming that the seed is glorified, that is, expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Jesus Christ came in the flesh, He was like that little carnation seed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Him, that is, in His human form, His human shell, were all the beauty and shape of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the colorful aspects of the divine life were concealed and confined in that little Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One day, He was sown into the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After He died, He grew up and blossomed in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In His resurrection, the beauty, form, style, color, and riches of life were released and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That was the glorification of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since all that God the Father is has been embodied in the Son, when the Son is glorified, the Father is also glorified in the Son s glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After the Lord became flesh, He expressed God to some extent, but the glory of God, the glory of all His attributes, was hidden in His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The glory of all God s fullness was covered, being clothed by His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, the Lord told His disciples that He had to die and be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The word die is not a pleasant word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, it is not bad for a seed to be put into the earth and die.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is good because the glory and beauty of the flower that are hidden in the seed are released by its death.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The colorful beauty and the rich glory are released through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After the Lord told His disciples about His impending death and resurrection, He offered a prayer to the Father, praying that the Father would glorify the Son that all the glory hidden within Him might be manifested through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To glorify the Son means to bring forth all the glory hidden within His flesh, to release by means of death and resurrection all the divine glory concealed within the flesh of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have seen that the subject of the Lord s prayer in John 17 is glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord was God incarnated in the flesh, and His flesh was a tabernacle for God s dwelling on earth 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God s shekinah glory was concealed within the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once, on the Mount of Transfiguration, His divine element was released from within His flesh and expressed in glory, being seen by three of the disciples Matt 17:1-4; John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But it was concealed again in His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Before He uttered this prayer, He had predicted that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in His glorification 12:23; 13:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now He had to pass through death that the concealing shell of His humanity might be broken for His divine element, His divine life, to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He also had to be resurrected that He might uplift His humanity into the divine element and that His divine element might be expressed so that His entire being, both divinity and humanity, might be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In this way, the Father would be glorified in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In John 17 He prayed for this.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The concluding prayer of the Lord was for the glorification of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The fulfillment, the answer, of this prayer for the glorification of the Triune God has three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The first stage was the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the Lord s resurrection, all the life beauty, life essence, life color, life shape, and all the aspects of the divine life of the Triune God were released.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In His resurrection, the Lord s divine life was released from within His humanity and imparted into His many believers 12:23-24 , and His whole being, including His humanity, was brought into glory Luke 24:26 , and, in that, the Father s divine element was expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God firstly answered and fulfilled this prayer in the Lord s resurrection Acts 3:13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Secondly, this prayer has been fulfilled in the church, in that, as His resurrection life has been expressed through His many members, He has been glorified in them and the Father has also been glorified in Him through the church Eph 3:21; 1 Tim 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Look at the church in Acts on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There we see the beauty, shape, and riches of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord s resurrection was not the complete fulfillment of His prayer; it was just the first step in the fulfillment of this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The next step is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>From the day of resurrection until the second coming of the Lord is the age of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In this age, the Lord has been glorifying Himself in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Throughout all generations, the Son of God has been and still is being glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>What are we doing today?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If we say that we are coming together to exhibit Christ, it means that we are glorifying Christ and making Him manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we say that we are testifying for the Lord, it means that we are manifesting Christ through us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The testimony of the Lord is the manifestation and glorification of the Lord through us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we want a testimony for the Lord Jesus on our jobs, in school, and in many other places, it means that we want the Lord Jesus to be manifested through us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is the glorification of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When the Lord is manifested and glorified through us, the Father is also glorified in the Lord at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Thus, the Lord s prayer is still being fulfilled today through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In the church we can see the beauty and the riches of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But, at times, we can also see in the church the ugly human expression.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>On the one hand, the church is of the divine life; on the other hand, it is still in the natural human life.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In the church the divine life is expressed, but sometimes the natural human life is also expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When the divine life is expressed, that is beauty and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>But when the natural human life is expressed, that is a shame and a disgrace.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Do not look at the black side of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Do not seek for the trash can come to the living room and see all the beauties that are there.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In every home there is at least one place where the trash is kept.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Likewise, in every local church there is a place where the trash is.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Such a place is ugly and stinking.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Do not try to find it.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Rather, sit in the living room of every local church.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Whenever you visit a local church, you should forget about looking for the corner where the trash is.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>You are not going there to be a finder of the trash.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>You are going there to visit the church.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Therefore, you need to stay in the church s living room enjoying the beauty of the divine life expressed in that particular church.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>However weak a local church may be, there is at least a small amount of the beauty of the divine life in it.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We need to look at the beauty of the church life, for the church life is the second stage of the glorification of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Some brothers and sisters do nothing except look for the trash in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Some are not only the trash hunters but also the trash exposers.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>They would never see the beauty of the divine life in their local church.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>They always notice the trash.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>They are the trash hunters, the trash exposers, and also the trash exhibitors.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>They like to make a show to exhibit all the trash in their local church.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Whenever they do this, they are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Sometimes, before going to visit another local church, the young co-workers come to me for advice.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>I always tell them, When you go to that church, try your best to find the good points.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Forget about any bad points you might see.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Don t look at them.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Stay away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Do not be impressed with the trash in the church you are visiting.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Even in your local church you should not try to find the trash.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>If you do this, you will be the first one to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The trash will firstly damage you.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>I like to go to the dining table of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>In every home, the best things are put on the dining table.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Just go, sit down at the dining table, enjoy what is there, and say, Praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>After you have been satisfied, say good-bye and leave.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>I do not want to know anything bad or negative.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>What I see is altogether glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>We must believe that every local church, as long as it is proper, has a certain amount of the beauty of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>What is the third stage of the fulfillment of the Lord s prayer in John 17?</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>It is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>This prayer in John 17 will be ultimately fulfilled in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Through the holy city the Son will be fully expressed in glory, and God will also be glorified in Him for eternity Rev 21:11, 23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Look at the picture of the New Jerusalem: it is a vessel to express Christ, to make God expressed through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>The New Jerusalem is the glorification of the Son so that the Father might be glorified through the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Perhaps you are not clear about the picture of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Revelation 21 and 22 reveal clearly that God is the light and that Christ, the Lamb, is the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>The light is in the lamp, and the lamp is the center of the city, around which is a transparent wall.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>God is pictured as the light shining through the lamp, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>The Son of God will be glorified through the transparent wall of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>The city, composed of all the redeemed ones, has the names of the twelve tribes of Israel and the names of the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>The twelve tribes represent all the saints of the Old Testament, and the twelve apostles represent all the saints of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>The New Jerusalem is the composition of all the redeemed ones who are very transparent and are built together.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>They have Christ, the center, as the lamp in which God, the light, shines.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>When the lamp is manifested and glorified through the wall of the city, the light in the lamp is also glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>The New Jerusalem is a complete picture showing how the Son is glorified in that city and how the Father is glorified in the Son s glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>Many times some dear saints have said to me, Brother, you don t know how poor the church is where I am.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>I do not like to hear that.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>It is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>The church may be poor today, but after a period of time it will no longer be poor.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>Perhaps you do not have the faith to say this of your local church.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>You may say, No, the church in my locality could never be better.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>Do not use the word never, for, at the least, your church will be good in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>Every part of the city of the New Jerusalem will be radiant and glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>In 1941, during a prayer meeting in the church in Shanghai, a leading sister offered a long prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>In that prayer she said, with groanings, O Lord, have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>The church here is so weak.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>Immediately afterward, Brother Nee offered a prayer in which he said, Praise the Lord that the church is not weak.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>The church is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>His prayer shocked everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>There seemed to be a fight going on between these two prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>Which prayer was right?</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>Ultimately, when we come into the New Jerusalem, we shall see that Brother Nee s prayer was right.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>The church is altogether glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>Do not help Satan, the liar, to spread his lies.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>Do not believe the lies.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>The church is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>If it does not appear so today, it may be glorious tomorrow, next year, or in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>In eternity, for certain, all the church will be glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>We have seen that this prayer has a threefold fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>The first stage of the fulfillment was the resurrection of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>By His resurrection, the Lord Jesus has been manifested and glorified, and by this glorification the Father has also been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='182' RSNT='1' SNO='182'>The second step of its fulfillment is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='183' RSNT='1' SNO='183'>From the day of Pentecost to the day of the Lord s second coming, the Holy Spirit has manifested and will continue to manifest Christ through the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='184' RSNT='1' SNO='184'>In other words, the Holy Spirit glorifies Christ through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='185' RSNT='1' SNO='185'>When Christ is glorified, the Father also is glorified in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='186' RSNT='1' SNO='186'>The last stage of the fulfillment of this prayer will occur when the fullness of time comes.</S>
