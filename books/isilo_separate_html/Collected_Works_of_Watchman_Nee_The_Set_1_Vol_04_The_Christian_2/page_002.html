INTRODUCTION (VERSES 1-3)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse One</H2><P>Verse 1: "The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves the things that must quickly take place; and He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave John."</P><P>"Revelation" is the opposite of concealing. It means to open a curtain. Revelation is God opening the curtain of the future to reveal to men the truth behind it. This really convicts many people! God points out the subject in order to encourage those who read and hear. Yet, how men despise this book! Revelation means unveiling. After all, is a revelation an unveiling or a concealing? Can the things which God reveals as a guide for our daily living and for our keeping (v. 3) leave room for any doubt, that we may not know how to follow them? If you do not read Revelation, there is really no excuse!</P><P>Many people make the mistake of taking the "revelation of Jesus Christ" to be the coming again of our beloved Lord. Indeed, many times the Bible considers His revelation (His manifestation) as His coming again. Here, however, it clearly refers to this book because it is the "revelation...which God gave to Him to show to His slaves." This book, Revelation, is not only inspired of God (2 Tim. 3:16), but is also revealed by God. There is a difference between revelation and inspiration. Revelation is what God gives to men directly, without which no one has the ability to know the truth within it. Inspiration is God keeping men from making mistakes and causing what they write to be absolutely true and dependable that others may gain benefit and blessing. The revelation here is the same as "revelation" in 1 Corinthians 14:26. It is what God reveals; it is not concerning the coming again of the Lord Jesus.</P><P>"The revelation of Jesus Christ"! This revelation is of our Lord. When we hear His name, are not our hearts burning like fire? This book speaks forth the special value of our Lord. It reveals our Lord, and without it we cannot know Him. This is the revelation "which God gave to Him." Those Christians with spiritual knowledge can see the peculiarity of this word. Even though this revelation is of Him, God gave it to Him. He Himself did not have it! This book comes from God as God. It is not God as the heavenly Father revealing this revelation of His Son in His house. Here our Lord is not acting as the only begotten Son in the bosom of the Father, enjoying an intimate Father-Son relationship. Rather, it is God on the seat of the universal government instructing His slave Jesus Christ. The sense here is the same as that which is mentioned in Mark 13:32: "But concerning that day or hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father." In the Gospel of Mark, He is the Son of God to be a slave. The slave does not know what the master will do; he only knows what the master has told him. In this book, the position of God is neither the Father of the Lord Jesus nor the Father of Christians. In this book the Lord Jesus is a man and a slave of God exalted by God. He did not exalt Himself. This is really an example for all His slaves! He orders them to walk the path He walked. It is only there that they can have fellowship with Him. It is even more remarkable that there is no other inspired writer in the New Testament who exalted the incomparably great divine glory of the Lord Jesus higher than John did in his Gospel. Yet, it is also John who in Revelation described in detail His glory as a man, having, of course, not concealed His deity.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
