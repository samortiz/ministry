   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Customs Lane, Foochow THE NEED FOR GOD'S SERVANTS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>TO EXERCISE THEIR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In speaking of the exercise of our senses, we are not talking about the senses in our emotion, but the senses in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Corinthians 2 speaks of a kind of people whose spirit discerns all things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As God's children, we know things by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, it is strange that many people cannot use their spirit; their spirit does not function.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It would be terrible if all the lights in the city of Foochow refused to work when we needed them and worked when we did not need them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Perhaps three or five brothers among us can use their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The rest only touch their spirit occasionally and accidentally.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we cannot use our spirit, we can only depend on our eloquence, our mental ability, and our cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May the Lord have mercy on us and judge us when we work by our eloquence, mental ability, and cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The most fundamental thing for a worker to have is his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If I work as a telegraph operator, I need one basic faculty my ears.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>An operator cannot have a problem with his ears.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In serving the Lord, we can have a problem with our ears, eyes, hands, feet, or mouth, but we can never have a problem with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once we realize that we serve and worship God with our spirit, we should learn not to trust in our emotion or our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should pray instead that the Lord would empower us to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you do this, we can send you away in peace, and the church can send you away in peace as well.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not think that this is a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This demands our very life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our entire being has to change.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to tear down our theology and learn instead to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE BENEFITS OF EXERCISING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who are able to exercise their spirit reap four benefits from their exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, they are able to live before God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While they contact others with their spirit, they are able to keep themselves in God's presence at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They do not have to turn back to God after they have contacted men.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second, those who exercise their spirit know men.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Third, they can release the power that is within them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephesians 6:10 says, "Be empowered."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This has nothing to do with praying for power to come upon us from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to be the ones who will to be empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we want to be empowered, the power within us will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we do not consciously will to be empowered, the power within us will not be released.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that his entire being opens up to others easily.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is hard for some people to release their spirit because they have too many shells; their outer man is not broken.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Fourth, it is easy for those who exercise their spirit to receive others' spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is also easy for them to receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is easy for such ones to receive help from others because their spirit is open.</S>
