   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Bible tells us that the sisters should dress in a modest way 1 Tim 2:9; 1 Pet 3:3 , but only the Lord knows how modest is modest.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When you say, "O Lord," the Lord knows and you know.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1943 a young lady who was very worldly began to come to our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After she came to a few meetings, the Lord touched her.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first time she came to the meeting, her hair was like a "high tower," arranged high upon her head.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One day she came to our meeting, and this tower was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Meeting by meeting we could see that something changed with her.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That really means that she got rid of a number of things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, she became a simple young lady.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No one told her anything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She experienced the transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The power of the divine life changed her.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One brother used to smoke before he was saved by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After he came to our meetings and was saved, he lost his taste for smoking by being transformed from within.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was absolutely changed and kept away from the old things of his old manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In our meetings we do not give messages telling people to give up their sinful and bad habits.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But Christ is the transforming life within the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we mean business with the Lord by saying, "O Lord," there will surely be a change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This change in life is not something outward, but something from within.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is very careful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is never careless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more you go along with Him, the more you contact Him, the more you say, "O Lord," the more you will be restricted by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ will restrict us in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This restriction is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The issue of life is growth and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Life grows; life also transforms.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not trust in teaching, but we have full trust in the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more you say, "O Lord," the more you will be transformed from within.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This transformation might seem slow, but it is steadfast, bit by bit, and day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more you take in Christ, the more you will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is not a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is powerfully living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As you take Him in, He will transform you in your attitude, your emotion, your motive, your desire, your aim, and your behavior in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everything will be touched by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Life grows and life transforms.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>C. H. Spurgeon was a great preacher in England during the last century, yet at one time he still smoked.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A brother of the Brethren assembly was bothered by this and went to see C. H. Spurgeon.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Spurgeon was trying to argue by saying, "I smoke for the glory of God."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This Brethren brother then put up a big signboard across the street which said, "C. H. Spurgeon says he smokes for the glory of God." That forced Spurgeon to give up smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Spurgeon lost his argument in the matter of smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many times we try to argue with the Lord by saying that we have the peace to do something, but eventually we lose our case.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you will not lose the case with the Lord in this age, I am sure that in the coming age, you will lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I say again that this is not something legal.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have no legality, but we have the grace within.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His grace is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Just say, "O Lord" from a sincere heart and mean business with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then He will come in to take away the evil things and all the things that are not of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Anything that is not a profit to us mentally, physically, or spiritually is a waste, and that is something condemned by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When you say, "O Lord Jesus," be honest and mean business with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You will see what will happen to you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I hope that you would go to the Lord and put this fellowship into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Call on the Lord over every item in your daily life, and see what the Lord will say to you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then you will see not only the growth in life but also the transformation in life.</S>
