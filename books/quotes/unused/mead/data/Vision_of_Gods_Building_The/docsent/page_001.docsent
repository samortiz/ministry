   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To fulfill His eternal purpose God must accomplish two categories of work: the work of creation and the work of building.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture opens with God's creation and finishes with His building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's creation is for His building, and God's building is the ultimate consummation which fulfills His purpose in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The principal means for accomplishing God's creation is His divine power.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the main element utilized for God's building is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We were born into God's creation, but we are reborn for God's building, which is the church, the ultimate consummation of which is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This building is of life, by life, and with life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Regeneration in life is the beginning, growth in life is the continuation, and maturity in life is the consummation of life for this building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, in the New Jerusalem, God's ultimate building, there is a river of life flowing for those who participate in God's building to drink, and the tree of life growing in the river of life for them to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These signify that the building of God is produced, nourished and sustained by God Himself and with God Himself in Christ as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, for us to partake of God's building, there is no other way but by life and with life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Life and building are the two key words in the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Life is God in Christ as the living content, and building is the corporate expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What a pity that both life and building are almost altogether neglected by today's Christianity!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For the proper church life, both must be fully recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In recent years the Lord has begun this recovery in the U.S.A. We have full assurance that He will swiftly accomplish it to the uttermost for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The following chapters are messages given in the winter conference of 1964 at Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are maintained in the simple spoken form.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May the Lord use them for the building up of His seeking ones.</S>
