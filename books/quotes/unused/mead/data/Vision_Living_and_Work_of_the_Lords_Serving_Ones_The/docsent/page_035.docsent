   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOVING ALL THE BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now that we are clear concerning our ground and concerning the situation in Christianity, we will consider what kind of attitude we should have toward all God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If our attitude is wrong, our testimony will also be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, we should love all God s children, considering them as brothers and sisters in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible says that we should love the brothers; it does not say which kind of brothers we should love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible does not say that we should love only the brothers who are meeting with us, the brothers in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible simply tells us to love the brothers Rom 12:10; 1 Pet 1:22; 1 John 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have a love for sinners; we love them and want to preach the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We also love the brothers; we love them and desire to fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should have only these two kinds of love: a love for the sinners and a love for the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is not a third kind of love.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As long as a person is regenerated, we should love him, regardless of whether he insists on baptism by sprinkling or baptism by immersion, or whether he insists on a vegetarian diet or a meat diet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whether or not a person stands on the proper ground of the church depends on the truth and light he receives from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, even if he does not stand on the proper ground, we must still love him with the Lord s love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, we must be clear that we cannot join an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not because we are proud or exclusive, but because we are restricted by the truth that the Lord has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are restricted; we are not free.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As slaves of the Lord, we can do things only according to the light that He has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, we must be clear that we fellowship with all believers, but we will not join any organization, any divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must have faith in the Lord that this does not mean that we are proud or exclusive but rather that we are standing on the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In doing anything, it is necessary to have a ground, without which it will be easy to lose the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our ground is the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we cannot have any association or cooperate with any group that is in division.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our conscience will never allow us to ask any organization to join us in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, we are willing to pray for all sinners to be brought to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>SPEAKING THE LIGHT OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>AND THE NOURISHMENT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should speak the riches we have obtained to all God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many riches have been released among us through the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These riches in life and in truth are not only for us to enjoy but also for all God s children to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They are the common possession of all God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should therefore speak these possessions so that others may also inherit them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because of their blindness, some believers cannot receive these truths and even oppose these truths.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not blame them; instead, we should spread these truths.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord s recovery needs to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, we should speak forth the light that we have gained in the truth and in life so that all the Lord s children may have the same light, the same nourishment, and the same supply.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether or not they will take this way is up to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not force anyone to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some groups accuse us of going out to steal their sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In response to this we should say that the truths that the Lord has given to us are very rich, but we are not building up our own group; instead, we are spreading the riches of the Lord s truths to all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>LEARNING TO DISTRIBUTE THE RICHES</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One brother said that those in Christianity are like the prodigal son who left home and that we encourage them to continue wandering, instead of returning home, by our giving them food.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He said that he would rather let them starve until they have the feeling to come home.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This thought is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whether or not a prodigal son returns home does not depend on our giving him food.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It depends on whether God, through the Holy Spirit, has given him a heart of repentance Luke 15:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If God does not give him a heart of repentance, even if he is starving, he will not return.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must not have a narrow heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the contrary, we should speak what is in the Life-studies to others and read the Recovery Version of the Bible with them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If they do not understand, we should try our best to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is a scarcity of the truth and of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, the Lord s recovery is like Joseph s storehouse Gen 41:56-57 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not keep the riches in the storehouse.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is our responsibility to distribute the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not worry that others will not take the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should believe that if a believer receives life and the truth, sooner or later he will seek after the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At that time, we should present the matter of the church to him so that he can choose the way he wants to take.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A believer may choose to take this way, or he can remain where he is and serve the Lord according to the light he has received.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If he chooses to remain where he is, we will not condemn him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These points explain the attitude we should have when we go out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we maintain such an attitude, we will bear a proper testimony among God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whether we are speaking for the Lord or preaching the gospel, we will be full of life and the life supply, and others will realize that we uphold the truth and practice the truth.</S>
