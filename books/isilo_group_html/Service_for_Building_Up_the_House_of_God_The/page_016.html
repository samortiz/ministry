FULL-TIME SERVICE TURNING INTO EMPLOYMENT</h2>
<p>The second danger we must guard against concerns the serving ones. We must not consider our full-time service to the Lord to be a form of employment. A serving one might have such a concept. The saints may also have the concept that there are different forms of employment&mdash;some people are teachers, some are doctors, and some are full-time serving ones. This erroneous concept turns serving the Lord into a form of employment, and it implies that only those serving full time are serving the Lord but that the working saints are not serving the Lord. Serving the Lord is not a career or a profession. Every believer should serve the Lord. Those who serve the Lord full time should not regard serving the Lord as employment.</p>
<p>Over the years many saints have given up their studies and careers in order to serve the Lord full time. As a result, there is a tendency to view this service as employment. Such a degraded concept may cause us to lose the brightness of our testimony that we have received from the Lord.</p>
<p>Such a degraded concept has two issues. First, the saints will regard serving the Lord as a means of livelihood. Second, those who serve the Lord will lose the spiritual burden and will depend on the arrangements made by the work.</p>
<p>A teacher must accept the classes assigned to him. He must teach the students when it is class time, and when class is over, he is free. On the weekend he can do as he wishes, but he must return to teach his class on Monday. This is what it means to be employed. If in spiritual matters concerning the church and the work, a serving one merely accepts what is arranged, his service is a form of employment. A serving one should not only accept responsibilities but must also have a burden for the saints and a burden to save souls.</p>
<p>First Kings 3:16-28 is an example. Two women were quarreling over who was the mother of a child. Solomon was truly wise; he said, &ldquo;Divide the live child between the two, and give half to one and half to the other.&rdquo; The real mother immediately said, &ldquo;Give the live child to her, and do not by any means kill him!&rdquo; Solomon then was clear that she was the real mother. The other woman said, &ldquo;He shall neither be mine nor yours; divide him.&rdquo; This made it clear that she was not the mother.</p>
<p>From the tone of many of the full-time serving saints, we can tell that their &ldquo;motherhood&rdquo; has become a form of employment. They are &ldquo;false&rdquo; mothers. They are not burdened to preach the gospel, they are not burdened for the souls of men, and they have no feelings for the church or for the saints. These serving ones have a job. Although this may not have been their intention, they have fallen into such a state.</p>
<p>There are two ways by which we may know whether our service has become a job. If our service is merely a way to make a living, it has become a job; and if we do not have a burden, our service has become a job. As serving ones, we should care for our burden and forget our livelihood. This is the way to maintain our position of being called. We have been called to serve God. We should be burdened for the Lord&rsquo;s work, the church, the saints, the souls of men, and the Lord&rsquo;s commission. We are not consumed by our living; rather, we have placed that in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. This is the attitude of a serving one. We must guard against the danger of our service becoming a form of employment.</p>
<p>The churches and the saints also face the danger of regarding the full-time serving ones as employees. A brother once said, &ldquo;If the full-time serving ones are not willing to serve, who will serve?&rdquo; These words seem to say, &ldquo;We hired the serving ones to do this. If they will not do it, who will?&rdquo; Even though this was not said, the words bear such a flavor. The brothers and sisters who serve the Lord full time should not have such a wrong concept, and also the brothers and sisters who do not serve full time should not have such a wrong concept. Such a concept should not exist among us. The serving ones should have the desire to serve the Lord, to care for the saints, and to save souls. Among us there is no distinction between those who are serving and those who are not serving. If there is a distinction, our service has become a form of employment, and we have fallen into degradation. This is a danger that we must all guard against and reject.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Service for Building Up the House of God &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
