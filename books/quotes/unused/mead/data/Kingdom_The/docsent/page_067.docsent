   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Peter received a new name, signifying a new element, and a new being.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be transformed is not simply to be changed outwardly; it is to have a new element added into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Transformation brings in a new element and eliminates the old element.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be transformed is to be both charged and discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all need to be charged with Christ, just as a transformer is charged with electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When Christ is charged into us, He will discharge many old things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this way we will be renewed and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Transformation is not merely to have an outward change or correction.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the process of transformation a new element is added to replace the old.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As this process continues, we become new and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is exactly what Peter experienced; the old clay Simon was discharged, and Peter became a precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the local churches today we are all under the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Day by day Christ is charging Himself into us, and He is discharging and carrying away all the old elements.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This process of charging and discharging is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Throughout the past years I have seen some amount of transformation, especially with the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many young people in the local churches have been transformed without regulation or outward correction.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although no one tried to teach them or change them, they were transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some new elements of Christ have been charged into them, causing a discharge of the old elements.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The transformation is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Matthew 13 we see the sower, the seed, the growth, and the transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The vegetables are transformed into minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although we are wheat, we can become precious stones and pearls by transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both precious stones and pearls are transformed items.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Matthew 13 we cannot see the purpose of growth and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For this, we need to proceed to Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this chapter we find a very significant statement: "You are a stone" Matt 16:18, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>. It is not sufficient just to recognize that the Lord Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must also realize that we are stones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is very good that we know Christ, but we must also know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sisters, are you stones?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am afraid that tomorrow morning you may find that it is very easy to shed some tears.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When you are about to cry you should remind yourself that you are a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, a stone will never lose its temper.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brothers, are you stones?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What will you do if your wife gives you a difficult time tomorrow morning?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Will you lose your temper?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you lose your temper, it indicates that, at least to a certain extent, you are not yet a stone you are still clay.</S>
