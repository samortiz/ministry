   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Judaistic teachings, that is, the teachings that turn believers back to the Old Testament to the keeping of the commandments of the law, cannot solve the problems of life, death, salvation, and perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the age of the law, there was never the assurance of salvation, and there was never the justification of man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although the law says that "if a man do he shall live by them" Lev 18:5 , yet it also says "there is none that doeth good, no, not one" Psa 14:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That is all that the law could do.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Actually, it was predestinated to be so: "Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may fall under the judgment of God" Rom 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God desires to give grace to man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, before grace can be preached, man must first be rounded up under sin and must have nothing to boast about or depend on, so that he has no other way except to receive God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the function of the law is to test man, to expose man's sin, and to put man under sin Gal 3:19; Rom 3:19; Gal 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It paves the way for grace to come in Gal 3:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The law itself cannot save man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It only paves the way for grace to come in. This proves the uselessness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The establishment of the New Testament is a proof of the inability of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The law lords it over a man as long as he lives Rom 7:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as man lives, he has the responsibility to fulfill the commandment in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As long as a man is not yet dead, once he transgresses the law, he will come under the judgment of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"For whoever...stumbles in one point has become guilty of all" James 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A little oversight amounts to the breaking of all the law and destines him to perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All those who are under the law live and walk in fear and suspense.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They do not know when they will die.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, they do not know when they will sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As long as they are alive, they can still fall under sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, to them, before they die, there is always the possibility of condemnation and hence perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The matter of eternal life and condemnation to them can only be finalized after one is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What a frustrating life this is!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every day one lives in fear and trembling, with eternal fire waiting by his side.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Salvation is not a concrete fact, but a remote hope.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These then are the "blessings" that the law at its best can give to man!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The law cannot draw man close to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It makes man fearful of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the age of the law, the veil was not opened.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the age of grace, the veil is rent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The law says: "Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live" Exo 33:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Grace on the other hand says: "He who has seen Me has seen the Father" John 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Old Testament age, no one could come directly to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The priests were a special class of people between God and the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the Israelites wanted to draw near to God, they had to do it through the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God was behind the veil, and there was a separation between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only the special class could draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All other common people who would come near would be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How different it is from the foundation laid in the New Testament!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By the blood of the Lord Jesus, we have passed the veil to enter the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The relationship between us, the saints, and God is direct.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are all priests Rev 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The characteristic of the New Testament is that we "walk in the light as He is in the light," and that we "fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin" 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Israelites were God's earthly people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God dealt with the Israelites in the principle of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such things as circumcision, the Sabbath, the sacrifices, and the feasts were all things according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Israelites became Israelites through their birth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They had many things of which they could boast in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Gentiles were like dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is absolutely contrary to the principle of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Through the cross, God has condemned the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To God, it is no longer a matter of birth, but of rebirth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The distinction of the flesh has ceased: "Both Jews and Greeks...are all under sin...for there is no distinction" Rom 3:9, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those who were born as Israelites in the Old Testament cannot be compared to those who are regenerated today, who receive eternal life and justification.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The people of God could perish eternally, while those who were not the people of God could have eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That was the result of the way of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Actually, grace and the law can never be mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is impossible for the Old Testament to be mixed with the New.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Judaistic Christians, through their worldly concepts and ideas, considered that the principles of the law and of grace should be mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As a result, they led others into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Judaistic teaching replaces the peace accomplished on the cross with a condition of the law that is past and a shaky uncertainty concerning the future.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this Judaistic gospel, the assurance of salvation is but a conjecture: "How can one know that he is saved before he dies?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even if a person has become one of the people of God, when he sins and fails, will he not be lost again?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is of course good to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yet one must have works also.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Otherwise, he cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is true that works do not save a person, but faith must have works added to it before it will save a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whenever works are missing, a person will go back to perdition."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Under such a Judaistic teaching, who can have peace?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Everywhere is dreadful uncertainty: "I have indeed believed in the Lord Jesus, but I dare not say if I am saved."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>"I am only doing my best to do good, with the hope that God will be gracious to me."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This kind of erroneous teaching leads man to doubt the promise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>To these teachings, all the assured future and all the present joy of the gospel are uncertain and unstable.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Has not Christ Himself said: "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill" Matt 5:17 ?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, to these ones, a Christian should trust in God's grace, but should also keep the law: "One should do his best to keep the law and should look to God's mercy for what he comes short of.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is true that one is saved through believing in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, if one fails and breaks the law, he will be a man of perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Sabbath and other similar things are what Christians ought to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is right to keep them; but if one fails to keep them, he should ask for the Lord's grace."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We cannot imagine what this kind of half-law-half-grace teaching will lead man to.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Law and grace are two principles that can never be reconciled Rom 11:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>To put the new wine in the old wineskin will only damage both.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But the greatest damage will be for those who want to have the new wine.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We Gentiles were those without the law: The "Gentiles, who have no law...they have no law" Rom 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>After we have believed in the Lord, we have not been transferred into the rule of the law: "You are not under the law"; "whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law" Rom 6:14; 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Hence, the law never has anything to do with us, the Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>For us to come under the subjection of the law is to fall from grace and to despise the redemptive work of the cross.</S>
