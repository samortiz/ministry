<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Regions of the Work<br>Not Dividing the Churches</H2><P>The regions of the work should not divide the churches. There were regions in Paul's time, the Jewish and the Gentile, but they never divided the churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Churches in the Gentile World<br>Having Fellowship<br>with Those in the Jewish World</H2><P>The churches in the Gentile world had fellowship with those in the Jewish world in solving the problems in teaching (Acts 15:1-34). Some taught circumcision as a term for eternal salvation. That was wrong. Paul, however, did not have the attitude of merely solving this problem in Antioch. Rather, he, Barnabas, and some others went to Jerusalem to get the problem solved by all the churches. That decision eventually became an epistle written by the apostles and elders. This epistle was not designated as being written by the Gentile and Jewish apostles and by the Gentile and Jewish elders. Acts 15 says that it was written simply by the apostles and the elders (v. 23), including the apostles and elders of both the Jewish and Gentile churches. They were considered as one. We have to see this.</P><P>The churches in the Gentile world also had fellowship with those in the Jewish world in supplying the physical need (Rom. 15:25-27). The apostle Paul was endeavoring to raise up financial help, physical help, from the Gentile saints for the Jewish saints. In this fellowship they were considered as one, but I do not think our attitude today is like this. Sometimes we help other churches, but there is the consideration that we have to take care of the need of the local churches in our area first. If we have some surplus, then we will consider giving something to other churches. But Paul's practice was not like this. Paul knew that the saints in Macedonia were in poverty, yet he still encouraged them to give. Their giving was their fellowship of concern to help the churches in the Jewish world.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Paul, Who Worked in the Gentile World,<br>Being Concerned for the Church in Jerusalem</H2><P>Furthermore, Paul, who worked in the Gentile world, was concerned for the church in Jerusalem (Rom. 16:1-4; Acts 19:21; 20:16; 21:12-13, 17-19). He had a heavy burden to help the church in Jerusalem to enter into God's New Testament economy. Although the Spirit inspired the saints to warn him not to go to Jerusalem, he said that he did not care for his life. He had purposed in his spirit to go there. No doubt, he went there with a burden to help the saints get out of the law in the Old Testament economy and enter into the New Testament economy of God to have the church. This shows us again that the regions of the work should not divide the churches. I called a number of urgent elders' meetings beginning in 1984 because I realized that there was the tendency of division among us. If we know the Body of Christ, however, we cannot be divided.</P>
