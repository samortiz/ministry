   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE LEAVEN AND THE HARLOT Scripture Reading: Matt 13:33, 45, 46; Rev 17:3-5; 19:7, 8; 21:10, 11, 18, 19a; 22:1; 21:6; 22:17 LEAVEN HID IN THE MEAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament, from the first book to the last, there are always two main things revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These two matters are clearly set before us in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One of them, on the one side, is the leaven taken by the woman and hid in the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must see clearly that this leaven was not merely put into the meal, but "hid" in the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The meal is visible and apparent, but actually a corrupting, filthy, and defiling element is hidden within it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is observed by our visible perception is the meal; it is more difficult to discern that leaven is hidden within it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You may say, "Look, is this not meal?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Is this not good for food?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yes, but listen, some thing corrupting, damaging, filthy, worldly, and sinful, is hidden within it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>May the Lord open our eyes, not just to see apparently, but to see discernibly that which is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The meal is indeed good for food; it is the very thing that God is after.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No one has any problem with the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But we must see what is hidden within the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And who put the leaven into the meal?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Of course, not God, neither the church, but a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And who is the woman?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Roman Catholic Church, the great harlot and mother of all harlots.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am greatly concerned that, after speaking so much concerning religion and Babylon and linking these matters with the Christianity of today, you may say, "That is too much.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Are there not many good works for the Lord in Christianity?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Have there not been many who have gone to the mission fields and helped people know God?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Have there not been many ministers who have helped others grow in Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yes, undoubtedly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But consider this parable spoken by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord refers to meal, real meal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But we must see that within this meal, hidden to the natural sense, is a certain element called leaven inserted by an evil woman.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the entire Bible, both in the Old Testament and in the New, leaven is set forth as a corrupting, damaging, evil element.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The meal is good; the meal is the thing that God is after.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But within this God-blessed substance is something sown which is sinful, devilish and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all must see this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no argument.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must certainly admit that in today's Christianity there are many good works.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can even say the same for the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But within these good works is a subtle element.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Oh, the devilish subtlety in this matter!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Something of the devil, something of Satan, something of the enemy has been put into the meal in a subtle way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>People today only see the meal; they are quite blind to the leaven.</S>
