In order to see this picture, we must pay attention to the principles, that is, the main items in this picture
We must see the principles in this clear picture if we are to be able to understand what is in the Lord's mind and what He is seeking
It seemed that Genesis 1 contains a full record of the creation and recovery of the earth, from the first day to the seventh
Although this is true, we now know that the second chapter of Genesis is something much more than mere details
If we can see the seven major figures that are contained within this picture, it will become clear and complete to us
All the books of the Old Testament and the New Testament reveal the correct meaning of each of these figures, item by item
The Lord Jesus tells us in John 7:38-39 that if any man believes into Christ, out of his innermost being will flow rivers of living water
On the shoulder pieces of this ephod were two onyx stones on which were engraved the names of the twelve tribes of Israel
Peter 2:5 says that we are both a holy priesthood and the living stones which are being built up as a spiritual house to the Lord
In 1 Corinthians 3, the apostle Paul tells us how to build the church and with what material we should build it
Paul says that we must be very careful as to whether we build with gold, silver, and precious stones or with wood, grass, and stubble
Rather than building the church, the building of God, with the negative things, we must build with gold, silver, and precious stones
The city proper is of gold, the wall of the city and its foundations are of precious stones, and the twelve gates are twelve pearls
The holy city, New Jerusalem, built of the three kinds of costly materials, is actually the bride, the wife of the Lamb
At the end of the Scriptures, God has gained a group of people who are pure gold, precious stones, and costly pearls in His sight
Once you receive this life, it will work within you and transform you from a man of clay into something precious'
At that time we will be fully transformed into the image of the Lord from the center to the circumference of our being
Now we must go on to see how this man of clay can be transformed, figuratively speaking, into gold, pearls, and precious stones
Since we are all Adam-men of clay-we need to be transformed by having another element-Christ-added into our being
Perhaps the reason you still hesitate to call yourself Christ is that since you have only recently believed there is not much Christ in you
The moment we believed in the Lord Jesus and accepted Him as our Savior, the Lord Jesus came into us as the Spirit
Although formerly we were only men of clay, Christ has been put into us and become mingled and blended with us
Just as tea is no longer just water but tea-water, since we have received Christ into us, we are no longer just men-we are Christ-men
Since Christ has been added into us, a spiritual reaction has taken place within us in the same way that a chemical reaction takes place
By being mingled and blended with Christ in regeneration, we were transformed from men of clay into men of gold, pearl, and precious stones
Because he had such a close, intimate relationship with his son, his emotions, a part of his soul, were very much involved with him
Barber once wrote a hymn in which she expresses a similar thought: 'Let the spirit praise Thee, / Though the heart be riv'n'
Because the spirit and the soul are distinct, although our soul may be in one condition, our spirit can be in a very different condition
We see a principle: In order to contact something in any of these three worlds, we must use the corresponding part, or organ, of our being
When we have a cold, our nose's function is hindered, and we cannot smell, even though odors are still present
There is a God and this God is Spirit but because human beings in general do not know how to exercise their spirit they ask Who is God
These questions are as foolish as those of a man who, having closed his eyes, questions the existence of color
God is here, but we cannot use our eyes to see Him, our ears to hear Him, or our nose to smell Him, because they are the wrong organs
Her suffering was not caused by the drink itself; she suffered because the wrong organ was used in her attempt to drink it
Because they use the wrong organtheir soulthey cannot find God for God is not in the psychological realm and therefore cannot be found there
Having a clearer understanding of the three parts of man, we can now consider into which of these three parts the Lord Jesus has come
Now that Christ is in our spirit, we must consider what is taking place in our soul, that is, in our mind, emotion, and will
Even though we have the image of God, in our natural state we have nothing precious within us; we are only men of clay
Gods intention is to transform us men of clay into His image in a full way so that we will be as precious as gold pearls and precious stones
From that time onward, as long as we cooperate with Him, He will increase within us and spread from our spirit into our soul
On the day He returns, even our physical body, the very outer part of our being, will be saturated with His element
In the previous chapter, we saw that as God-created human beings we have three parts: a physical body, a soul, and a spirit
With the mind we think, with the emotions we sense joy and sorrow as well as other feelings, and with the will we make decisions
Our need is for Christ to increase within us all the time, that is, to spread from our spirit into the three parts of our soul
When we are transformed into His image, we will think, feel, and decide just as Christ thinks, feels, and decides
When our entire soul has been transformed into the image of Christ, we human beings will have the image of Christ in our daily life
In a great many believers, there are scarcely any signs that Christ has entered into their mind, emotion, and will
Although the Lord is in this brother's spirit, he remains slow because the Lord has not yet spread into his soul
The situation of such persons indicates that although they may be transformed in their spirit, in their soul they remain quite natural
These two preachers were two different kinds of persons; one was slow in nature, and the other was fast in nature
The preacher who was slow in nature insisted that the Lord was slow, and the one who was fast in nature insisted that the Lord was fast
By this we can see that regardless of our individual characteristics, our soul is natural and must be transformed
He wants to spread from our spirit into our mind, from our spirit into our emotion, and from our spirit into our will
The Lord's spreading into the different parts of our soul can be likened to the fingers of a hand entering into the fingers of a glove
After this gradual spreading of Christ within our being has taken place, we will be able to say that we have the mind of Christ
For a Christian to grow means that Christ continually expands from his spirit into his mind, emotion, and will
After her husband's death, although we went to fellowship with her, she could not listen to us and could only weep bitterly
In her we saw a person who no doubt had the Lord in her spirit but at that time did not have the Lord in her emotion even to a small degree
The soulish man, with his natural mind, emotion, and will, must be transformed by being put to death and resurrected
Sometimes it may be that immediately after praying in the morning, you recall what a brother said to you the day before
If you go along with this thought and give it ground in you, it proves that your mind has not yet been transformed
It indicates that your mind, like an empty finger of a glove, does not yet have the content for which it was created
When you are about to be happy and laugh, it is best not to laugh too much and instead learn to tell yourself to stop
When you are happy, the image of Christ will be in your happiness, and when you love something, the image of Christ will be in your love
If we pray in this way, it is an indication that we have forgotten that we have Christ within us and are not applying Him
Matthew 16:24 says, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me'
Whether you are a person who is too fast or too slow in your nature, you must put yourself under the death of the cross
If we have a car with gasoline and we ask the Lord to help us push the car, the Lord will respond, 'Do not be so foolish
Messages and doctrines are very good, but they only present to us a very beautiful 'building' while giving us no 'entrance' into it
God has a mind, emotion, and will , and because He created us in His image, He also gave us a mind, emotion, and will
The image of God in which we were created, however, is simply outward and is not the image which Paul refers to in 2 Corinthians 3:18
Until we have been regenerated by the Lord coming into our spirit to be our life, the image we share with God remains superficial
As the Lord dwells within us He gradually transforms us by becoming the content of our inward being particularly our mind emotion and will
Today God is waiting for a chance to spread into every part of our entire being so that we may be transformed into His image in a full way
We must cooperate with God's desire by practicing to give Him a free way to spread Himself into every part of our being
To walk in the vanity of the mind is to be under the rule, direction, and control of a mind that is full of vanity
We must realize that it is possible for us to remain under the control of the old man even after we have been regenerated
If we will simply be renewed in our mind and transformed into the Lord's image, so many things in our Christian life will become easy to us
After a husband and wife have loved each other for an extended period of time, they are of the same mind, attitude, and desire
If she never thinks, acts, and does things as he does, that is a sign that the love she has for him is probably not real
Our indwelling Lord is waiting for us to be renewed, transformed, into His image by Himself with His resurrection life
Regarding our will, when we decide to do something, it will not be just we ourselves who decide; Christ within us will decide
Although we will still be ourselves, within us another person, Christ, will be in the process of being formed within us
We must submit our mind to the Lord's mind, our emotion to the Lord's emotion, and our will to the Lord's will
If we love the Lord in such a way, we will give Him the liberty, ground, and opportunity to occupy one part of our being after another
Our problem is that although we have been regenerated and have a heart that loves the Lord, we do not love the Lord to the fullest extent
If we love the Lord in this way, we will give Him much liberty, ground, and opportunity to deal with us regarding our mind
We must love Him so that gradually our mind can be renewed filled saturated and mingled with the Lords mind that is with the Lord Himself
When we think and consider things, people will sense that within our thinking and consideration there is the savor of Christ
If we remain in constant fellowship with the Lord, we will give the Lord much opportunity to take possession of our mind, emotion, and will
According to the same principle, if we pray, we will automatically exercise our spirit, because to pray is to exercise the spirit
Even though many times when we begin to pray, we are not in the spirit, after maybe five or ten minutes we get into the spirit
If we exercise our spirit by praying in this way our entire being will be gradually renewed and we will be transformed into the Lords image
Learning Christ is not objective-it is not simply taking the Christ who is outside of us and following His example
For us to learn Christ means that His mind becomes our mind, His love becomes our love, and His heart becomes our heart
In the next verse, Paul says 'If indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus'
If we love the Lord to the uttermost, He will gain the ground in us and have the full liberty to occupy our entire being
In the physical realm, the parts of our body that we exercise the most become strong, and the parts we rarely use remain weak
The reason that many of you are weak when you come to the prayer meeting and the Lord's table meeting is that you rarely pray
When our mind is occupied by the spirit, which, as we have seen, is expanding into our mind, we will have the spirit of the mind
When our spirit expands into our mind, our mind will no longer be occupied with vanity but will be occupied with the spirit
We will be delivered from all sinful things transferred into the kingdom of His marvelous light and transformed into the image of the Lord
The law of sin in the members of the body fights against and defeats the law in our mind and brings us into captivity
In the body there is the law of sin, in the mind there is the law of good, and in our spirit there is the law of life
Once it has defeated the law of good, the law of sin always brings us into captivity and makes us do what we hate doing
We cannot help it; we do the things we do not want to do because we have been captured by the law of sin in the members of the body
Because this law is of the Spirit of life and the Spirit of life is in our spirit, the law of the Spirit of life is in our spirit
Because the law of sin in our flesh is stronger than the law of good in our mind, the latter is always defeated by the former
We cannot say that just because we are creatures of God, we do not have anything to do with the life of the devil
When Adam ate of that tree, he not only committed an act of sin; he also received the life of Satan into his being
Disobedience is a small concern compared to a much greater problem which has arisen-the deadly poison is now inside the child
Praise the Lord that when we received the Lord Jesus as our life, the Holy Spirit came into our spirit, bringing the divine life into us!
We must realize that these three lives-the human life, the satanic life, and the divine life-are all related to us
Although we can confine a bird to a cage and thereby keep it from flying, the moment we set the bird free, it will fly
With the human life there is a law, with the satanic life there is a law, and with the divine life there is a law
When Adam took the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he took something of that tree into his body
When, however, the soulish life is put to death, the body of sin is made 'jobless,' for there is nothing left for it to do
Since people use their body when they gamble, only when their soul-life is killed will their gambling bodies cease gambling
If those gamblers were stripped of their soul-life, the sinful members of their bodies would no longer be able to gamble
The gamblers' bodies will never be able to be freed from gambling until their soul-life, the life of the old man, has been put to death
Everyone who has been stirred up by the Holy Spirit has the intention to live and act according to the law of God
In order to be delivered from the law of sin, we must forget about the law of God and give up the law of good in our mind
It is at that very moment that he will experience the law of sin rising up within him to fight against his keeping the law of God
We need to forget about the law of God, give up on the law of doing good, and realize the fact that the divine life is within us
Once we align ourselves with this law, we will be full of rest and satisfaction and will be humble automatically and unconsciously
Such a living corresponds absolutely with the law of God and fulfills the requirement of the law of God perfectly
You will have a daily living that perfectly corresponds to the law of God and absolutely fulfills all its requirements
The first section of Romans speaks of God's redemption, and the second part deals with God's deliverance in Christ
As a consequence of our committing these sins, we are condemned by God according to His righteous and holy law
Because of Christ's redeeming death, we have been redeemed and released from the condemnation of God's righteous and holy law
We have been justified by God and are therefore no longer under God's condemnation according to His righteous and holy law
Whereas His redemption is objective to us, His delivering us is subjective and more vital and important to us in our experience
If there were only the redemption of God, there would be no way for us ever to be delivered from the sinful nature that is within us
These four figures also form two pairs that oppose one another: Christ versus Adam and the Spirit versus the flesh
We can begin to answer these questions by asking another pair of questions: Where is Adam today, and where is Christ today?
The reality of the fifth chapter of Romans is therefore in the seventh, and the reality of the sixth chapter is in the eighth
In the same way, although Romans 6 gives a record of Christ, we must go to the eighth chapter to find the reality of Christ-the Spirit
We are redeemed and justified by God, yet if there is the redemption and justification of God and nothing more, God remains outside of us
The book of Romans stresses the point that God the Spirit is now in our spirit to be the living deliverance to us
Whereas in Adam we inherit sin, in Christ we inherit righteousness ; and whereas in Adam we inherit death, in Christ we inherit life
By death we are able to be transferred out of Adam, and by resurrection we are enabled to be transferred into Christ
Our transfer from the realm of Adam into the realm of Christ can be accomplished only by a process of death and resurrection
If we are united with Christ and are identified with Him, what He experienced in the past will be our experience, our history
Because this is the fact, the apostle Paul could proclaim that 'our old man has been crucified with Him,' that 'we have been buried
Today it is possible for events that take place in America to be seen on television in the Far East at the same moment they take place
In our history, in addition to the cross of Christ and the death and resurrection of Christ, there is the history of Moses
We may pray for the Lord to help us keep such laws as doing good, honoring our parents, submitting to our husband, and loving our wife
Whether it is obeying our parents, loving our wife, or submitting to our husband, we must never do these things outside of Christ
There is no obligation for dead people to keep the law, because, being dead, they have nothing to do with the law
Always remember that if you are trying to keep the law, you are in the flesh, which means that sin will revive and you will die
While it is good to die in the sense that we have died with Christ , it is not good to die as a result of sin reviving
The Lord has to open our eyes so that we can see that we are dead persons who have nothing to do with sin and the law
Just remember that you have died and resurrected with Christ and that now the Spirit of the Lord lives within your spirit
The strongest, most powerful law, the law of the Spirit of life within you, will take care of you and will bring the victory to you
For when we were in the flesh, the passions for sins, which acted through the law, operated in our members to bear fruit to death
For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit
Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be
He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to God
We know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose
In the previous chapter we learned that in Romans chapters 5 through 8 there are four important figures Adam Christ the flesh and the Spirit
We no longer have anything to do with the law, for we have been made dead to it and have been discharged from it
We must forget about the law and instead have fellowship with the Spirit, go along with the Spirit, and align ourselves with Him
You have been discharged from the law, so you should no longer think and behave as if you continue to be employed by it
As such, he may suggest to us that we should love the brothers, do good, and try to have a right way of living
Whenever the thought comes to you that you should love the brothers or be humble, you must right away say, 'Satan, go away!
His intention, His eternal purpose, is to produce many sons so that His only begotten Son would become the Firstborn among many sons
Is it your idea that the meaning of being a Christian is to be a person who keeps the law and does good in order to please God?
In other words, if you are trying to be a 'good Christian,' in actuality you are not trying to be a man of Christ but a good man of Moses
If this is your case, in regard to your living you are a Christian in name only, for in reality you are trying to be something else
Most of us could have said only that as those who had been saved by God, our duty was to be good Christians who did good and kept the law
May the Lord open our eyes to see that the eternal purpose of God is not that we would do our best to keep the law
If you pray in such a way, it shows that instead of being conformed to Christ's image, you are trying to be a good man of Moses
To pray in this way is to live according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead of by the tree of life
Simplify the whole situation by realizing that the Spirit of the Son of God dwells, works, and acts within you all the time
Simplify yourself to just one item: knowing the indwelling Spirit of Christ and keeping in contact with Him moment by moment
The tree of the knowledge of good and evil is complicated, for with it there are many things, including good, evil, death, and knowledge
Rather than doing a lot of things to complicate ourselves, let us pay attention to the working of the Holy Spirit within us
Romans 8:2 says that the law of the Spirit of life has freed us in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death
In order to appropriate that current and cause the lamp to shine, there is no need for us to do anything beyond simply switching on the lamp
As we talk with the brother, the Lord will be with us, and we will talk, fellowship, and act in the mingled spirit
There is no need for us to struggle to bring down an object that we have thrown upward; the law of gravity will bring it down for us
When we align ourselves with the Holy Spirit, our mind is filled up by the Spirit and controlled by the Spirit
Sometimes our mind is not a mind of the Spirit but is instead a mind of trying to do good-a 'mind of love' or a 'mind of humility'
When our mind is occupied, directed, and controlled by the Spirit, we will experience and sense the reality of life and peace
What we say when we pray out of our own knowledge cannot come close to matching what we utter when the Holy Spirit prays within us
In this illustration we are the pot the Holy Spirit is the water and all things including our spouse children and circumstances are the fire
Rather, His goal in giving us all things is that we would be conformed to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God
The eternal purpose of God is that we would be conformed to the image of His Son that His Son would be the Firstborn among many brothers
These 'all things' outside of us cooperate with the Holy Spirit within us to work together and conform us to the image of Christ
It would not be good if after a number of years we have only a larger mentality and a greater degree of Christian knowledge and doctrine
