<p>Our being should also correspond to the Spirit. Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&rdquo; The Spirit in our spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God. We know that the Spirit is witnessing in this way because when we pray, the Spirit leads us to call God, &ldquo;Abba, Father&rdquo; (v. 15). First Corinthians 12:3 says, &ldquo;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; When we pray, sometimes we call God our Father, and at other times we declare that Jesus is Lord. We call and declare this because the Spirit is in us.</p>
<p>When a believer prays to the Lord, he often addresses Him as Lord, and when he turns to God, he often addresses God as Father. We come to Jesus as our Lord and to God as our Father because the Spirit is in us. No one calls another person father in a casual way. Even when we force ourselves to address someone in this way, we do not have a pleasant sense within us. However, when we spontaneously address our father in the flesh as father, we have a sweet inward sense. In the same way, I believe that all the brothers and sisters spontaneously have a sweet inward sense when they call God their Father. The sweet inward feeling that we have when we call, &ldquo;O Father,&rdquo; is the witnessing of the Holy Spirit with our spirit.</p>
<p>A brother once asked, &ldquo;What does Romans 8:16 mean when it says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God?&rdquo; Another brother responded by asking him if he was married. When the first brother said that he was married, the second brother asked, &ldquo;When you went with your wife to meet her parents for the first time, what did you call your father-in-law?&rdquo; The first brother thought for a moment and said, &ldquo;It was a difficult situation. When I first met him, my wife called him &lsquo;Dad&rsquo; as soon as she saw him. I called him &lsquo;Dad&rsquo; as well but rather reluctantly, and my face turned red.&rdquo; Then the second brother asked, &ldquo;When you call your own father &lsquo;Dad,&rsquo; does your face turn red?&rdquo; When the first brother said that his face did not turn red, the second brother said, &ldquo;That is because your heart is witnessing that you are your father&rsquo;s child. In the same way, when we pray to God, we are able to call Him Father without any sense of embarrassment because the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are His children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let me relate another story. One day a few of us knelt down to pray with an unbelieving friend. We were praising God in our prayer, saying, &ldquo;O Father, we praise You. Thank You for being our gracious Father.&rdquo; When we finished praying, the unbeliever said, &ldquo;I think that it is good to believe in Jesus, but I cannot pray like you. When I heard you calling God your Father, I was uncomfortable. Why were you not uncomfortable as well?&rdquo; His comment proved that the Spirit was not in him and that he had not yet been born of God to be a child of God.</p>
<p>The Bible is not merely a book of words; the words in the Bible are the pledge of our inheritance in Christ. Moreover, the Spirit is a living pledge in us, enabling us to know with certainty all the things promised by God in Christ. Hence, we should read the Bible diligently and follow the Spirit faithfully. The Bible in our hand is the word of the Spirit, whereas the Spirit in us is the Spirit of life. These two correspond to each other. As we read the Lord&rsquo;s words, the Holy Spirit moves within us to touch us, and the Spirit touches us by reminding us of the Lord&rsquo;s words. These two correspond with each other and enable us to be in life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> </body></html>
