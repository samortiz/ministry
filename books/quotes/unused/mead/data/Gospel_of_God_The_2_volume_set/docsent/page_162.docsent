   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Those who have faith do not need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who have faith are full of praises.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Never say that prayer is a sign of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Please remember that, on the contrary, prayer is a sign of lack of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All experienced Christians know that where there is faith, there is praise.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One hymn Hymns, #690 says:</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hear the message from the throne,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Claim the promise, doubting one;</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God hath spoken, "It is done."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Faith has answered, "It is done."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Prayer is over, praise begun.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hallelujah, "It is done."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You cannot say, "It will be done."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All those who say it will be done do not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God said that everything is done.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You also must say that everything is done.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God said that He has accomplished everything, and I believe in this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is all that matters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The greatest problem today is that when you go to many denominations, you meet hundreds of church members who say that they believe that Jesus will save them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They believe that Jesus will and can save them, but this is not faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is hope.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To do this is to annul the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, if I give this book to Brother Hu and he says, "I believe that you will give it to me tomorrow," this is not politeness but an insult to me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today God has sent His Son to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we still say, "Please save me," what is this?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What we ought to say is, "God, I thank You because You have taken care of all my sins on the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>My friends, a sinner cannot be saved by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A sinner can only believe that Jesus has saved him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Faith is not a merit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Never consider faith a work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some say that they do not know if their faith is strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God has made faith so simple for you, but man has made a simple thing very complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose I have a brother who is short of money and has become very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now I want to give him some money.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I tell him, "You do not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You cannot afford even to work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here, take this money and go."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By doing this, I am making the matter most simple.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, suppose his mind is very complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suppose he would ask, "If my brother is going to give me money, should I take it with my left hand, or should I take it with my right hand?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Should I take it at noon, or should I take it in the afternoon?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Should I take it standing up, or should I take it sitting down?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He wants to study how he can take it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This would be the greatest mistake in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While I was in Cheefoo, I met a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I told her that if she would believe, she would receive.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She said, "I have been doing this for a week.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I still do not know how I can believe.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I do not know if this is the right way or that is the right way to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I do not know if my faith is strong enough."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I told her that God has accomplished all the work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She only needs to believe in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But she was too analytical.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She made faith a work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thank the Lord that it is the simplest thing on earth to receive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We do not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It does not mean that nothing has to be done.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It only means that the Lord Jesus has done everything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God says that He has died.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I say that I believe He has died.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God says that the Lord Jesus has resurrected and become a proof.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I say, "Yes" and agree that His resurrection has become a proof of my justification.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He says that my sins are forgiven, that He has saved me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I will not wait.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I believe, and the matter is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When I believe, I have received.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is all.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have passed from death to life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is no need to feel anything or to wait for any peace or joy to come.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A few years ago, I preached the gospel to one person.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He told me that he believed in the Lord Jesus, that he believed that he was a sinner, and that he believed the Lord Jesus had forgiven his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But he had a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He did not feel that the Holy Spirit was working mightily in him like he thought He was working in other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I asked if his sins were forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He answered, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I asked him why.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He said that he did not feel the Holy Spirit working in him yet.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I said, "My friend, you are absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Bible does not say that whoever feels that he has believed in the Son of God has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We do not believe by our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Rather, we believe by the Word of God."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When a person gives this book to me, I do not have to feel anything.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I only have to believe in his word.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Salvation is without any condition.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There is, however, the proper procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The procedure of salvation is not work; it is simply to believe and to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Whatever God says, I say the same.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Thank the Lord that His grace is sufficient for us.</S>
