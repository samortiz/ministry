   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CRUCIFIXION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to the second major step of Christ: His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us at the outset consider why it was necessary for Christ to be crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was the manifestation of God and the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He lived a life full of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There was nothing sinful, nothing wrong about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His was a life in which only God could be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yet, according to God's eternal purpose He had to die.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before I was saved, I heard that because we are sinful, Christ must die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is true, but there are more important reasons why Christ had to die.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May the Lord grant us to see them more fully.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE FIRST REASON FOR CHRIST'S DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are at least three reasons why Christ had to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, man was fallen, and creation was corrupted by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, both man and creation must be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man is contradictory to the holiness and righteousness of God and has "come short of the glory of God" Rom 3:23 , and creation is subject to vanity under the bondage of corruption Rom 8:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man and creation must be dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let us look at it from another direction.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God had a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Satan came in to frustrate and stop God's plan from being accomplished, but he could never succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He can frustrate and delay, but he can never stop God's eternal plan from being realized.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God will certainly accomplish what He has purposed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So the question is, how would God accomplish His eternal purpose when man was fallen and creation corrupted?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The answer is by redemption through judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That is why Christ had to die on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That is why He had to be judged on behalf of fallen humanity and the corrupted creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through judgment God could redeem fallen humanity and recover the corrupted creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, the death of Christ on the cross is on one hand the judgment of God, and on the other hand redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Herein lies the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God seized hold of the work of Satan and turned it to His own account.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all know that we were sinners Rom 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We were born sinners, for we are children of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this country, the children of foreigners born here are automatically Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They do not need to be naturalized; they are born Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>So it is with us we were born sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No matter how good our parents were or how good we are, we are all sinners by birth and we "all have sinned" Rom 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God must judge sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But where and by what were we judged?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to be redeemed, but where and by what were we redeemed?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must answer these questions before God and to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must have full assurance that we have already passed the judgment of God and have been redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must be able to say that this day we are free from God's judgment and redeemed by Him!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brothers and sisters, not only were we judged two thousand years ago on the cross in Christ, but we were likewise redeemed then by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ, by His death, was judged on our behalf 1 Pet 2:24; 3:18 , and by this judgment God has redeemed us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whatever God judges, He is able to redeem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God only redeems that which He has judged.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No sinner can be redeemed without the judgment of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But, praise the Lord, since Christ suffered the judgment, He likewise accomplished redemption for us Heb 9:12; Rom 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The moment we were judged in Christ on the cross, we were also redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God judged both sinful man and the corrupted creation and at the same time redeemed them back Col 1:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because God needs both humanity and creation to fulfill His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is why Christ had to die.</S>
