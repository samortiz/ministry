   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN BEING MADE FOR GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Just eating and sleeping is not God s original intention for man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to a Chinese saying, man is the spirit of all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In God s creation man was originally noble, extraordinary, and special.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now, however, everyone groans about the meaninglessness of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Originally, man was full of purpose, but since he lost his original position and function, he has also lost his purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man was made by God for God; this gave great meaning to man in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, man has become alienated from God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He does not know God, does not have God, and does not believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without God, man is left with a sense of vanity and meaninglessness related to his human life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man is like a light bulb that cannot shine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The function of a light bulb is to be placed in a lamp so that it can shine and fulfill its function of illumination.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a light bulb is placed in anything other than a lamp, it will be useless, and its inability to shine will make its existence superfluous.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is man s condition without God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man is made for God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If he is not for God, his life is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a man puts on beautiful clothing, he will eventually feel meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a man has a good family, he will eventually feel meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even a high position will not take away a sense of meaninglessness because a high position is not the reason for man s existence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only when a man touches God does he have a sense of meaning, joy, strength, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Man is a single-purpose item.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was made solely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, when a man has God, he does not have a sense of vanity; instead, he has satisfaction, joy, and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>HAVING SATISFACTION, JOY, AND PEACE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>WHEN MAN HAS GOD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the problems of human life are due to not having God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whatever man relies on will always be a source of sorrow and vanity Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>1:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There was a mother who gave birth to a child, and she named him Little Treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When he was young, the mother would lovingly call him Little Treasure!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Little Treasure!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As he grew, Little Treasure began to cause her to be full of sorrow and tears.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When she was asked about the reason for her tears, she said, Little Treasure is growing up and is no longer obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I heard this, I laughed inwardly, saying, Little Treasure has become Annoying Treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Another sister also treasured her son, but when her precious son was married, he no longer seemed to care as much for his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The mother wept every day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we visited her, she said, My dear son no longer loves me; he is always with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I told her, Your strong love for your son is the source of your pain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the child of another mother suddenly died, the mother was broken-hearted and wept over the coffin, crying, I wish that I could go with you, my dear child; you have ruined me!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She experienced such great pain because she loved her child apart from God and because her love was excessive.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There was a highly educated sister who taught in the university and accumulated much wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She did not spend much money on food and clothing, but she exerted every effort to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, she did not know where to put her money.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She felt that it was unsafe to entrust her money to friends or to deposit it in Chinese banks.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, she put her money in a foreign bank in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One day, however, this bank suddenly closed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the sister heard the news, she almost became insane with grief.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Money truly destroyed her.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should be cautious.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Wives must be cautious, and husbands must be cautious.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everything that we depend on can be a source of vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a wife depends on her husband, he will bring her vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a husband depends on his wife, she will bring him vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only when we depend on God will we have satisfaction, joy, and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Before World War II there was a rich man in Shanghai who had a nice house and a nice car.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He also had a doorkeeper.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The rich man was under stress every day, and he could not eat or sleep well.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When he asked his wife about the reason for his stress, she could not give him a reason.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Eventually, he said, The only one who eats and sleeps well is my doorkeeper, because he has no money.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Since he has no money, nothing matters to him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The wife did not believe her husband, so he said, If you do not believe me, I will make him lose all his sleep tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then the rich man gave five hundred dollars to the doorkeeper.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Throughout the day the doorkeeper considered how to spend the five hundred dollars, but he could not decide what to do with the money.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When he could not decide, he wrapped up the money, put it under his pillow, and tried to go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, he would repeatedly feel the money and then look at it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Eventually, he did not sleep well the whole night.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the rich man heard about his lack of sleep, he told his wife, Money also has made me unable to eat or sleep well.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This does not mean that money is useless; rather, the problem is that we set our heart on money.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We suffer because we love money instead of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We need to see that money is vain and that a heart set on vanity can only be vain.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is true of everything, not just money.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As long as we stay away from God and set our heart on anything that is vain, we will be empty and miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we love God, we will have God, but many do not have God because they do not love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the reason for their vanity and misery.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As long as we do not want God and do not have God, we will have a sense of vanity related to our family.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Similarly, organizations, societies, and countries are vain.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Without God, families, organizations, societies, countries, and even the whole world will be a source of vanity and misery.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If there is no God, there can only be vanity and misery.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Since man was made for God, man can be satisfied, joyous, and peaceful only when he has God.</S>
