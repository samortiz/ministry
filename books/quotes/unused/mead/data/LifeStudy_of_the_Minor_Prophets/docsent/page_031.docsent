   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS MESSAGE TWELVE ON JOEL 3 THE CONTENT 2 Scripture Reading: Joel 2:12 3:21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Joel is a short book of three chapters, but it covers human history from 606 B.C. to the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A major revelation in Joel is that God has raised up four empires symbolized by four kinds of locusts, beginning with Babylon and continuing with Medo-Persia, Greece, and the Roman Empire, to devastate the one small nation of Israel, God s elect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today this devastation is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Along the way, while such a history was proceeding, God poured out Himself as the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended One, the processed and consummated Triune God as the Spirit, upon the believers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That outpouring produced the church and began the age of mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everything concerning the church is a mystery, and this mystery is the manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we are here in the church doing things in a mysterious way to usher in the final appearing of Christ to bring in the age of restoration, the thousand-year kingdom, which is the prelude to the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the revelation in the book of Joel</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us now go on to consider further the content of Joel in 2:12 3:21.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this portion we have the turn of Jehovah to His elect, Israel 2:12-32 , the judgment of Christ upon the nations 3:1-15 , and the victory of Christ with His overcomers over the nations and His reign among Israel in the age of restoration 3:9-13, 16-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE TURN OF JEHOVAH TO HIS ELECT, ISRAEL A. Wanting Them to Turn</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>to Jehovah Their God</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jehovah wanted His elect to turn to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verses 12 through 17 of chapter two reveal in what way they should return to their God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With All Their Heart</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jehovah wanted His elect to turn to Him with all their heart v. 12a .</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With Fasting, Weeping, and Mourning</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He wanted them to turn to Him also with fasting, weeping, and mourning v. 12b .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rending Their Hearts</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>and Not Their Garments</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In returning to their God, Jehovah s elect should rend their hearts and not their garments v. 13 . They should do this so that God would turn, repent, and leave a blessing behind Him a meal offering and a drink offering v. 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The meal offering and the drink offering are blessings to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem and the temple, Israel lost the place appointed by God where they could offer their offerings to God Deut 12:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Also, God s army of locusts destroyed the produce of the land, leaving no grain to make a meal offering and no grapes to make wine for the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, Israel lost both the ground and the materials to offer the meal offering to feed God and the drink offering to cheer God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today both God and Israel are still suffering the loss of this blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Blowing a Trumpet in Zion</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Joel 2:15a Jehovah says, Blow a trumpet in Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To blow a trumpet is to make a declaration in a triumphant spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sanctifying a Fast</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 15b goes on to say, Sanctify a fast.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This fast was not to be common; rather, it was to be sanctified, separated for God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Calling a Solemn Assembly</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jehovah also wanted His elect to call a solemn assembly: gathering the people, assembling the elders, and letting the bridegroom go forth from his chamber and the bride from her canopy vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>15c-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such an assembly is a great blessing, something that should not be missed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Letting the Priests Weep</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 17 says, Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, / Weep between the porch and the altar, / And let them say, / Look with pity, O Jehovah, upon Your people; / And do not give Your inheritance over to reproach, / That the nations should rule over them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>/ Why should they say among the nations, / Where is their God?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The porch and the altar were outside the temple, and between the porch and the altar the priests were to weep for Israel s having lost the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, the people, having been brought back to God, had the ground to enjoy the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They had the altar, ordained by God, where they could offer what God desired for His satisfaction.</S>
