   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE SENSE OF LIFE AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us review what we received through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE LIFE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, we received the life of God through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This life includes God s nature and resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once we receive the life of God, we have the nature of God, which is related to God s attributes, and the resurrection power of God, which is related to His actions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, those who have the life of God spontaneously can be what God is and do what God does.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What God is and what He does come out of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since this life is in us, it enables us to live out the image of God and to live out God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second, we received the law of life through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The law of life is the innate ability of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every kind of life has an innate ability, which is its natural capability.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This innate ability or capability is manifested according to a natural law, the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to remember these terms: innate ability, capability, and law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The innate ability of life, the natural capability of life, or we may say, the law of life, regulates us from within according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every living creature has a law within its life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The higher the life, the stronger are its law, its innate ability, and its natural capability.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because the life of God is the highest life, the innate ability and the natural law within God s life are the strongest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The way that a hen lives and lays eggs is not controlled by an outward law given by man but by the innate ability of its life, which is a natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The law of life within a hen enables it to live a hen s life and lay eggs regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not only the case with animal life but also with plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, an apple tree will bear apples when it grows to a certain stage.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not the result of outward regulations and demands but of an innate ability or capability of life, that is, its natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A NEW HEART</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Third, we received a new heart through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A new heart is related to both nature and innate ability.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In regard to nature, our heart was hardened; it was as hard as stone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But now it has been softened, and it is as soft as flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our heart has been changed from a heart of stone into a heart of flesh Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>36:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our heart was hardened in the past because of the fall; it was as hard as stone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was stubborn toward God, rejected God, opposed God, and forsook God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, it was a heart of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, at the time of our regeneration, God caused our heart to repent of sin and become soft toward Him; hence, our heart of stone became a heart of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our old heart was as hard as stone, but the new heart that God has given us is a soft heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the innate ability of our new heart, our heart now inclines toward God, loves God, and desires God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All our inclinations, affections, delights, and desires toward things are functions of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before we were regenerated, our heart inclined toward sins, desired the world, and loved lustful things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, when God regenerated us, He renewed our heart, causing it to incline toward God, delight in God, desire God, and love God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A NEW SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Fourth, we received a new spirit through regeneration v. 26 . We need to pay attention to the nature and innate ability of our new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The nature of our new spirit is living; our new spirit is our old, deadened spirit which has been renewed and enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man was damaged by the defilement of sin because of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, the human spirit lost its function toward God and became deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, when God regenerated us, He put His life into our spirit and quickened our spirit, making our spirit alive.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way, our deadened spirit became a new and living spirit; this new, living spirit has been restored in its function and use toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The innate ability of our new spirit allows us to touch God, contact God, know God, and taste God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must be clear about the different functions of the heart and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The heart enables us to adore God, love God, and desire God, but it does not enable us to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our heart has the desire but not the ability to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The ability to contact God rests with our spirit; we can contact God and touch God only by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Concerning the things of God, our heart has a willingness, but only the spirit has the necessary ability.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When our heart is willing and our spirit is exercised, we can contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On one hand, if we have an able spirit but an unwilling heart, we will not be able to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the other hand, if we have a willing heart but an unexercised spirit, we still will not be able to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, we must clearly understand that the heart is related to willingness and the spirit to ability.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We often say that someone does not have a heart for God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By this, we mean that he is not willing to receive God and does not desire God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When a person has a heart for God, he is willing to receive God and desires God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the first step.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The second step is to exercise the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is not enough for a person to have a heart and use only his heart; he must exercise his spirit as well.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many Christians have a heart for the Lord, but few exercise their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is precious when a brother or a sister has a heart for the Lord and loves the Lord, but it is even more precious when they exercise their spirit to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The heart needs to be moved, and the spirit needs to be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The heart is related to emotion, and the spirit is related to ability.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is not enough simply to have a heart; we must also learn to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, in order for a person to exercise his spirit, he must first have a willing heart.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If he is unwilling to seek and love God, he will not be able to exercise his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is because our heart is the base, and our spirit acts according to the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We can exercise our spirit only when we love God and desire God with our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We emphasize learning to exercise our spirit because it is relatively simple to have a willing heart.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As long as we do not allow anything other than Christ to occupy our heart, we can love God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, we need to be trained in different aspects related to the spirit, because this involves matters that are not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We need to be clear about the different functions of our heart and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God s renewing of our heart is for our heart to be softened, and His renewing of our spirit is for our spirit to be enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is the reason He gives us a new spirit in addition to a new heart.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If a person merely has a willing heart, he will still not be able to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In order for him to contact God, he must exercise his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We may desire God but still not contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We can contact God only when we exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the reason God gives us a new heart and a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>My heart may be willing to pick up an object, but if my hands do not cooperate, I will not be able.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This can be compared to having a desire but not the ability to achieve it.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In order to contact God we need our heart in addition to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Our heart is related to willingness, and our spirit is related to ability.</S>
