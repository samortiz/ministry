   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Ambition</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Nee also suffered from the brothers' ambition for position.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Among the first three brothers to come into the church in Shanghai in the very beginning, one was very ambitious to be a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Due to his ambition he caused a great deal of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually, in 1948, after being in the church for twenty years, he left.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He began a meeting in his home with a traveling preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That traveling preacher later wrote a long article against Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This also caused him to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That was just one case.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A number of Chinese preachers throughout the past fifty years passed through the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They came to the meetings expecting to be placed in some position.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But Watchman always made it clear that the church was not an organization and that no positions were available.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When asked concerning position he would say, "Who would give me a position?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no position.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is an organism."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some came and met with the church for a time, expecting to receive some post in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, however, when they discovered that they could not obtain what they were after, they left and became opponents.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>F. Rebellion and Attack</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rebellion of the brothers and sisters was another source of suffering to Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A brother co-worker committed immorality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Watchman assisted the church in that co-worker's locality to excommunicate him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He in turn rebelliously attacked Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>During World War II, after the Japanese army occupied Shanghai, that co-worker sent mail to Watchman of such a nature that if the contents had been disclosed or discovered by the censors it would have caused much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What an evil attack that was!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through the years a number became rebellious and attacked him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The most serious case centered around his involvement in business and involved the saints in Shanghai in 1942.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Most of the brothers and sisters, including the co-workers and elders, rebelled against him and attacked him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was the greatest cause of suffering to him and forced him to discontinue his ministry for six years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That was a severe and long suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through all these sufferings, however, he learned the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These sufferings not only assisted him in trusting the Lord; they also worked for him in dealing with his flesh, his self, his soul, and his natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In my own personal knowledge of him, the final experience he learned through his sufferings, when his ministry was terminated for six years, was that of the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He never passed on mere teachings and doctrines; his messages contained the reality he acquired through the experience of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The experience he acquired through suffering served as a great help to all of us and became a rich heritage to all the churches in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This rich heritage was acquired by him at a high price.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His sufferings also helped him to receive revelations from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Often through a certain kind of suffering, he received a certain kind of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His sufferings often became the Lord's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was purified, dealt with, torn down, and constituted by the Holy Spirit with the divine life through his sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through such experience of suffering, he was equipped and positioned to receive the Lord's revelation.</S>
