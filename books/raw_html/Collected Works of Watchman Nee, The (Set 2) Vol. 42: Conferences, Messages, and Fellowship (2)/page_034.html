<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY</h1><h1 class="title">TALKS</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: October 17, 1936, afternoon<br />Place: In the dormitory, Kulangsu, Amoy</h1><h2 class="head1">A LIFE IN THE EMOTION VERSUS A LIFE IN THE SPIRIT</h2><p>The Christian life should not have any period of spiritual coldness. However, in order to teach us the function of faith and the will, in the practical experience of our spiritual life, God often allows spiritual depression to come to us. When our faith is put to the test, the outward, burning sensations may be gone, but we should not be discouraged. A Christian life is full of joy during times of abundance, and it is at least full of peace during other times. It is wonderful to have special joy and happiness, but it is not abnormal if one does not have these feelings some of the time. When these feelings are gone, an inward peace should be sustained. It is not necessary for us to constantly feel a sense of enlightenment and joy. It is more important to be without barrier or burden in our spirit and to have no nagging feeling that God is far from us. If there are such barriers, they must be removed.</p><p>On the one hand, it is easy to develop barriers between us and God. These barriers can be removed, and the way to remove them is by foot-washing. On the other hand, there is nothing unusual about not having third-heaven, supernatural feelings of elation. We should not seek for these supernatural experiences all the time. The first time you pass through a big crisis, you may have some supernatural sensations. If you have such an experience, you should thank the Lord. But such an experience will not last for long. For example, when you were first saved, when you first experienced the overcoming life, or when you first consecrated yourself, you may have been extremely exuberant. But these feelings do not remain with you forever. On the one hand, we have to remove all barriers in our fellowship with the Lord, and on the other hand, we have to live by faith when this special joy is absent. Special and extraordinary joy is like the over-intoxication of wine, whereas the freshness of life is like the invigoration of spiritual energy.</p><p>The Bible says, "Always rejoice" (1 Thes. 5:16). This is a matter of the will, because this is God's commandment. For example, when you get up in the morning, your heart may not be full of joy. When you read this verse, you should exercise your will to rejoice. The same is true when the Bible says, "Be strong." You can respond to God's Word by saying, "Today I will be strong." God's commandment requires only man's "amen." Once you hear God's word and you turn it into an "amen," you will receive what you said "amen" to. If you say, "Lord, I thank and praise You. I will rejoice," you will immediately have the experience of joy. Every kind of emotion in your life is sustained by the will. Other aspects of your life may require other things.</p><p>Sometimes we feel cold and sometimes we feel hot when we pray. None of these feelings matter. As long as we are clear within, and as long as we have a little revelation in the depth of our being concerning God's will, we should pray. Although many of our prayers seem to be "cold" and "indifferent," God often answers our "cold" and "indifferent" prayers. I often pray in a "cold" way for an hour to two, but I know that God answers my "hot" prayers as well as my "cold" prayers. Our submission to God's will is not based on our inward coldness or hotness, but on our obedience. We have to pray to do God's will, and it does not matter whether or not we have the knowledge or the feeling. God does not necessarily answer our zealous prayers. Yet I know that God has answered my "cold" prayers many times.</p><h2 class="head1">THE INWARD LEADING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>The greatest blessing of the New Testament is that man can know God's will inwardly. A brother once asked, "Can I do a certain thing? I cannot find a clear answer from the Bible, and I have asked many people. Some say that I can do it, while others say that I should not." I said, "Let us put aside what the Bible says for now. Do you have the Holy Spirit within?" He said, "Yes." I then said, "Since the Holy Spirit is within you, is He not able to instruct you in anything?" Many times, it is not the Spirit who fails to instruct us, but we who fail to seek His leading. We have not looked to Him, but have instead sought help from others. In doing a certain thing, we may have thought through the whole process and have the right doctrine and consent of everyone backing us up, but it is still possible to be wrong. We have to believe that the Spirit never forsakes His duty. He resides within us for the purpose of instructing us. Personally, I believe that even when we do not read the Bible, the Spirit will still instruct us. (I am not saying that we should not read the Bible. I am saying that we have to take care of the inner voice.)</p><p>One of my sisters was saved about three months ago. Two months ago, she had an experience. My brother-in-law took her to a holy communion in the denominations. Before she was saved, she did not feel anything when she went. After she was saved, she was uneasy when she joined the communion. She thought, "The Bible has not said anything about this. Why do I not have the peace?" Later, she found that there were unsaved ones among them taking the communion. When she tried to go again, she again had no peace. She tried to give herself an excuse, saying, "I am taking the communion for myself. Others are responsible for their own conduct." She took the communion again, but after she returned home, she felt very uneasy again. Although she had many reasons, the leading of the Spirit within would not go along with her. She knew that she had done the wrong thing. When she read the Word and prayed, the Lord showed her that it was wrong for her to partake of that kind of communion. Later, my brother-in-law got into a big argument with her and accused her, saying, "You have just been fooled by your brother." When I heard this, I told him, "I have never spoken with my sister about this matter. I had the same feeling when I was praying for her. She was following the leading of the Spirit." We cannot follow our own thoughts and reasons; we should follow the small voice of the Spirit within.</p>
