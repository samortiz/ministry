	 <h2 class="head1">THE PROPAGATION OF THE FIRST MAN, ADAM</h2>
<p>God created a man, who became old, and He also prepared a man, who became new. In man&rsquo;s eyes there have been thousands upon thousands of people after Adam, including Abel, Seth, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and David. In God&rsquo;s eyes, however, there have been only two men throughout the history of man: Adam is the first man and Christ is the second man. First Corinthians 15:45 and 47 speak of the first man, Adam, who is out of the earth, and the second man, Christ, who is out of heaven. Christ is called the last Adam. Other than these two, there is no third man. Every man after Adam but before Christ is part of the first man, Adam. Any man who has been born after Christ but who has not believed into Christ is also only a part of the first man, Adam. Only those who have been born after Christ and who have believed in the Lord are part of the second man, Christ. Those who have believed in the Lord and who are saved have been transferred into Christ.</p>
<p>Every believer is both in Adam and in Christ. From the standpoint of our experience, we can also be in the self. For example, when a brother prays in the morning, he can be in Christ, but if his prayer is interrupted by his wife, he can easily find himself in Adam. If he draws from his cultural upbringing to control his temper, he will be in the self. At first he is in Christ; as soon as he is interrupted by his wife, he is in Adam; and once he draws upon his cultural upbringing to control his temper, he is in the self. This is our experience. I have been saved for sixty years, but I have not completely put off Adam.</p>
<p>Acts 17:26 says that God &ldquo;made from one every nation of men.&rdquo; This means that God created one man; He did not create two men, much less billions of men. Rather, He created Adam, blessed him, and told him to &ldquo;be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth&rdquo; (Gen. 1:28). This speaks of the propagation of Adam. Propagation is a natural law of God for men. Once a person is married, there will be propagation. When I was saved sixty years ago, I was not married, but after being married, more than thirty people have been propagated through my children and grandchildren. All these people are &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; in my &ldquo;kingdom&rdquo;; they are my propagation.</p>
<p>Today Adam has been propagated to become a great kingdom; all the people living in the world are citizens of his kingdom. This truly is a fulfilment of God&rsquo;s words concerning being fruitful and multiplying and filling the earth. Many families in China take pride in the fact that multiple generations live in the same house as a big family, but strictly speaking, the only big family is Adam&rsquo;s family. From Adam to Jesus there are seventy-seven generations, and from Jesus until now there have been many more generations. This propagation is tremendous.</p>
<p>To be fruitful and multiply is to propagate, to increase; to fill the earth is to spread. Increasing and spreading correspond with human history. For example, the Chinese race moved from the Middle East eastward, passed the Pamirs, and reached China. The Bible tells us that Adam was created in the region of Mesopotamia, which is in close geographic proximity to Europe, Asia, and Africa. From Mesopotamia, mankind spread eastward to Asia, southward to Africa and westward to Europe. Mankind increased and then spread in four directions to fill the earth. When Columbus discovered the Americas, the whole globe became the territory for the increase and spread of the first man, Adam, through his descendants.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPAGATION OF THE SECOND MAN, CHRIST</h2>
<p>The first man, Adam, is a type of the second man, Christ. The propagation of Christ began in Jerusalem, which is also a place where Europe, Asia, and Africa meet. In Acts 1:8 the Lord said to the disciples, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s witnesses are His propagation. Every believer of Christ is a witness of Christ, and every witness is Christ&rsquo;s propagation, just as every grain of wheat is the propagation of the original grain.</p>
<p>Spiritually speaking, every believer should be a witness, having the spirit of a martyr, not loving the world, and being able to sacrifice his life for the Lord. If we are willing to die for Christ, forsake the world, and not care for anything, we will be the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses and His propagation. In this way Christ will increase.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is not enough for Christ merely to increase; there is a need for Him to spread. The Lord wanted the disciples to increase in Jerusalem, but He wanted them also to spread to Judea, to Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth. Paul mentioned that he not only wanted to go to Rome but also to Spain (Rom. 15:28-29). At that time Spain was equivalent to &ldquo;the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; By the time Columbus discovered the new continent, the uttermost part of the earth to the west was not Spain but the west coast of the United States. Although the Lord did not tell the disciples that the earth is round, He wisely charged them to spread to the &ldquo;uttermost part of the earth,&rdquo; which means that the gospel has to be preached throughout the entire known world.</p>
<p>History tells us that mankind has progressively filled the earth through the footsteps of Christians preaching the gospel. The growth and development of politics, military affairs, culture, and trade all reflect the influence of Christian &ldquo;footsteps.&rdquo; The preaching of the gospel by Christians to the uttermost part of the earth has resulted in the map of the world being continually redrawn. Christians sailed from Spain to the east coast of America, and from there they spread to the west coast. Eventually, the spread of mankind has circumscribed the globe.</p>
<p>Throughout subsequent generations Christians have circled the globe many times in order to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s commission concerning &ldquo;unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; In light of the Lord&rsquo;s charge to increase and spread, we are negligent in responding to His commission because we are so set and settled. Hence, I have no burden to give you some teachings; I only want to fellowship about our way of practice. From the day that God created man, He had no plans for us to stay in one place permanently. Even I travel back and forth across the Pacific Ocean because of the Lord&rsquo;s commission.</p>
<p>Since God &ldquo;made from one every nation of men&rdquo; (Acts 17:26) and told man to be &ldquo;fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth&rdquo; (Gen. 1:28), men must move in order to fill the earth. <em>Fill</em> in Hebrew means &ldquo;occupy to the full.&rdquo; God views the earth as being empty unless man occupies and fills up its space. Today there are twenty million people on the little island of Taiwan; it is being &ldquo;occupied to the full.&rdquo; If we lift up our eyes and see, we have to admit that even though the population of the world is great, there are many places that are still empty. For example, I once traveled by car from Los Angeles to Texas. Along the way we saw unlimited stretches of land with very few towns; it was mostly unoccupied land. It is a pity that nations in the world pass laws to restrict immigration. Although this may frustrate God&rsquo;s &ldquo;policy,&rdquo; He is still the sovereign Lord. Jesus is the Ruler of the kings on earth, and several presidents of the United States have amended immigration laws to allow, for example, more Chinese to immigrate to the United States.</p>
<p>The God whom we serve is truly the Ruler of the heavens and earth. I believe that one day every piece of unoccupied land will be filled with men. We should not worry about there being too many people. If every country would open up, there would be no sense of being overcrowded. The United States is very big, but the empty land in Brazil is even larger than the empty land in the United States; there are many more trees than people living along the Amazon. The Lord will eventually have a way to cause Adam&rsquo;s race to fill the whole earth.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s word stands firm in heaven forever (Psa. 119:89); this fact is beyond argument. No other book in this world tells us that men should be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth; only God&rsquo;s Word tells us this. After He created man, He simply said, &ldquo;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth&rdquo; (Gen. 1:28). These words describe six thousand years of human history. More than eighty years ago I was born in Tunghsiang, in a village of not more than ninety families, in Penglai County of the province of Shantung. Never in my dreams did I think that I would come to the United States with my family. This was not of me; it was God who blew a great wind. God said that men should be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth; no one can change God&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>Everything of the old creation is a type of the new creation. Just as the propagation of Adam was fruitful and filled the earth, the propagation of Christ should also be fruitful and fill the earth by increasing and spreading to every place. Sometimes Christians sigh when they compare the number of people in the world with the number of believers, but we should not be disappointed. Eventually the believers of the Lord will prevail. In the future the Lord will definitely open up the United States and Brazil, and eventually He will come Himself to take over the world. He will judge those who should be judged. At that time the earth will be His, and His propagation will fill the earth.</p>
