[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in three conferences given in the spring of 1980.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE GOD INCARNATED TO BE OUR REDEEMER AND OUR LIFE Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14, 16, 17, 29; 3:14-15; 12:24; 1:12-13 THE TWO MINISTRIES OF CHRIST
[4]  The New Testament reveals to us that Christ has taken two major steps.
[5]  The first was His incarnation, which opened the way for Him to fulfill His earthly ministry.
[6]  By these two ministries, His earthy and His heavenly, Christ has accomplished His divine commission.
[7]  No other books in the Bible tell us that the church is the Body of Christ; that this Body is the center of God's eternal purpose; and that God's purpose is not only to redeem His fallen people but also to regenerate them and make them the Body of Christ to express Christ.
[8]  There are three major problems that needed to be taken care of.
[9]  It is John who tells us that our Christ was God; that He became a man to bring us reality and grace; that for us to receive Him He died on the cross as the Lamb of God to take away our sins; as the brass serpent to destroy the Devil; and as the grain of wheat to release the divine life into many grains, children of God for the Body of Christ.
[10]  CHAPTER TWO CHRIST, AS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE FATHER, BECOMING THE INDWELLING SPIRIT THROUGH DEATH AND RESURRECTION Scripture Reading: John 14:8-11, 16-20, 23; 15:4-5; 16:13-15; 7:37-39; 20:22 LIFE AND SPIRIT
[11]  In these first twelve chapters of John there are nine cases presented to us.
[12]  These cases demonstrate that Christ is able to meet the need of anyone, from whatever segment of society he may come and however hopeless he seems.
[13]  What is born of the divine Spirit is the human spirit v. 6 . By believing in this dear Christ, we are regenerated; this second birth, in our spirit, makes us children of God.
[14]  The fourth case was of the man who had been lying sick and impotent for thirty-eight years John 5:2-9 .
[15]  With John 14 a change comes in. The Lord told the disciples He was going away v. 2 . This news was disturbing to them, for they enjoyed being with Him.
[16]  He went on to tell them that it was better for them that He went away.
[17]  Suddenly Jesus was standing among them and saying, "Peace be to you"!
[18]  His words were few, but He breathed into them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .
[19]  CHAPTER THREE CHRIST AND THE BELIEVERS BECOMING ONE ORGANISM Scripture Reading: John 15:1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 16 THE VINE AND THE BRANCHES
[20]  John 15 is a most mysterious chapter, yet because the illustration is so simple, we may not really catch its significance.
[21]  The Lord Jesus said, "I am the vine, you are the branches" v. 5 . Such a statement implies that He and we are one tree.
[22]  How can we fulfill the Lord's word to abide in Him that He may abide in us?
[23]  They neglect this crucial, spiritual matter of abiding in Christ and letting Him abide in us.
[24]  If we had not been grafted into Christ and had Him worked into us, we would still be fallen persons.
[25]  TURNING FROM DISTRACTIONS TO THE SPIRIT Distracted by Religion
[26]  We need this reminder to turn our whole inward being to Christ.
[27]  Because we have a background of Christianity and a knowledge of the Bible, we know what is right and what is wrong, what we should do and what we should not do.
[28]  He is not only Lord over all in the heavens, King of kings, and Head over all things; even while He is there on the throne, He is simultaneously the Spirit in our spirit.
[29]  If you abide in Him, you will bear much fruit John 15:5, 8, 16 .
[30]  Expressing Christ in your daily life depends upon your fully realizing that you are one spirit with Him.
[31]  John 14 through 16 records the Lord's words to His disciples on His last night on earth.
[32]  In John 17 the time was at hand for the Lord Jesus to die and then be resurrected.
[33]  Nevertheless, we do thank the Lord that in spite of the divisions these past centuries, there have been a few sincere, faithful seekers of Him in every generation who would let lesser things go and come together to be one in Him, one in the Spirit, one in the Father.
[34]  THE TRIUNE GOD AND THE BRANCHES IN JOHN 15
[35]  John 15 is even more glorious than chapter fourteen!
[36]  When we come to John 15:26 the Spirit is brought in. "When the Comforter comes, Whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality Who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me." The Greek preposition translated twice here as "from" has no precise English equivalent.
[37]  THE ONENESS OF THE BELIEVERS IN JOHN 17 In the Father's Name and by His Life
[38]  The Son has been given authority to impart eternal life to all those whom the Father gave Him v. 2 . Now He prays, "Holy Father, keep them in Your name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are.
[39]  When I was with them, I kept them in Your name which You have given Me, and I guarded them" vv.
[40]  CHAPTER FIVE THE ISSUE OF LIFE THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: John 2:16-22; 3:26-30; 10:16; 11:52; 12:24; 14:2, 3; 15:5, 12; 17:11, 21-23
[41]  The Gospel of John is a book of life.
[42]  Christ came that we might have this life and might have it abundantly John 10:10 .
[43]  "And I have other sheep which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one shepherd" John 10:16 .
[44]  John 10, besides telling us of the one flock, also says that Christ came that we may have life "and may have it abundantly" v. 10 . The life that the Lord came to make available goes hand in hand with the church.
[45]  But when we receive life from Christ and that life grows in us so that we enjoy life more abundant, there wells up within us the desire for the church life.
[46]  "In My Father's house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
[47]  And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you also may be" John 14:2, 3 .
[48]  The Father's house, we know from 2:16, was the temple, which today is the church, the house of God.
[49]  That the church today is the Father's house we know from 1 Timothy 3:15: "But if I delay, that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth."
[50]  Most Bible teachers interpret the Lord's words in verse 3, "I am coming again and will receive you to Myself," to refer to His second coming.
[51]  However, in verse 18 the Lord again says, "I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you."
[52]  Then He adds, "Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you shall live also.
[53]  In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you" vv.
[54]  In John 17 the word one is used four times vv.
[55]  CHAPTER SIX LIFE BEING A PERSON FOR US TO LIVE Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:1-3a; 3:14-15; 4:9; 5:4, 11, 12, 13, 16a THE MINISTRIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT
[56]  The twenty-seven books of the New Testament are largely a record of four ministries: Christ's earthly ministry, His heavenly ministry, Paul's completing ministry, and John's mending ministry.
[57]  How much greater and far-reaching is this than His earthly ministry!
[58]  Paul did tell us that the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, the household of God, the house of God, the kingdom of God, the bride, and the warrior.
[59]  Both John and Paul taught that Christ is a Person for us to live.
[60]  John's presentation, however, is stronger than Paul's. Yes, Paul did say, "Christ our life" Col 3:4 ; "it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me" Gal 2:20 ; and "to me to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 .
[61]  Notice John's language in 1 John 1:1-3a about life: "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us; That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us."
[62]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 John 5:20; 1:2-7; 1 Cor 1:9; 2 Cor 13:14; Phil 2:1 JOHN'S EMPHASIS ON LIFE
[63]  "And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ.
[64]  It is a strong declaration that Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God and who has come, is the true God and eternal life.
[65]  Then, at the end of the Epistle, we have this verse quoted above, which tells us that the very One who has come to us and in whom we are is the real God and life eternal.
[66]  Though Paul wrote fourteen letters in all, and though he did tell us that Christ is our life, he was not as emphatic as John here in declaring that this very Person is life to us.
[67]  Dear saints, be deeply impressed that Jesus Christ is your life.
[68]  God does not want you to improve your behavior; He wants you to live Christ.
[69]  He does not want you to begin loving your wife and no longer hate her; He wants you to live Christ.
[70]  We live Christ by fellowship; that is to say, we live Him by His moving in us.
[71]  When the life within, which is Christ Himself, moves, that moving is fellowship.
[72]  CHAPTER EIGHT OUR MUTUAL ABIDING WITH GOD Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:6, 28; 3:24; 4:4, 13, 15, 16; John 14:23; 15:4-5; Eph 3:17 MYSTERIOUS WRITINGS
[73]  His Gospel, for example, begins: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
[74]  Philippians 2 says that He was in the form of God yet did not "regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself."
[75]  We can abide in Him, making Him our dwelling place.
[76]  He can abide in us, making us His abode.
[77]  CHAPTER NINE THE REACHING OF THE ANOINTING Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:20, 27; John 7:38-39; Exo 30:23-25
[78]  The anointing is another mysterious matter revealed in John's first Epistle.
[79]  In previous messages we have covered the matters of life, fellowship, and mutual abiding.
[80]  Now we come to the anointing, which John tells us we have received 1 John 2:27 .
[81]  When I was young, in my study of the Bible I was puzzled by John 7:39, which says: " But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified " KJV .
[82]  A few days ago I had a painful toothache.
[83]  When we call on His name, we have the sense that we have had a refreshing drink.
[84]  Throughout the day, if we call "O Lord Jesus!" a few times, we shall have a good drink.
[85]  Romans 10:9 says, "That if you confess with your mouth, Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from among the dead, you shall be saved."
[86]  CHAPTER TEN OUR SPIRIT BORN OF GOD AND THE SEED OF GOD IN IT Scripture Reading: 1 John 3:9; 5:4a; John 3:6b; 2 Pet 1:4
[87]  In this message we come to the fifth mystery in 1 John.
[88]  We began with the mystery of life, the divine, eternal life which is in reality the Triune God Himself.
[89]  Then we spoke of fellowship, that is, the life moving in us to bring God and us into oneness.
[90]  "And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[91]  Our spirit was created by God as the organ for us to receive Him.
[92]  In our regenerated spirit there is now the Spirit of God and the life of God.
[93]  In belief you have God in you, even the Spirit of God and the life of God; but in experience you do not have the adequate realization of them.
[94]  CHAPTER ELEVEN MINISTERING LIFE TO THE SINNING ONE Scripture Reading: 1 John 5:16-21 THE BASIC THOUGHTS IN FIRST JOHN
[95]  When an author decides to compose a writing, he has some basic thoughts in mind as to what he plans to cover.
[96]  I believe that when the Apostle John wrote this Epistle, the basic matters which he wanted to share were the very items we have covered in our previous messages.
[97]  He wanted to remind his readers of the part within them which was not only created by God but also regenerated by His Spirit with the divine life.
[98]  If one sees his brother sinning, John writes, "he shall ask life for them that sin not unto death" 1 John 5:16 .
[99]  Notice that 1 John 5:16-17 speaks of a sin not unto death and of a sin unto death.
[100]  "We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not" v. 18 . Our spirit and the life which is the Lord Jesus Himself ministered to us as a life supply will overcome sin, death, the world, and the evil one.
[101]  CHAPTER TWELVE CHRIST'S HEAVENLY MINISTRY IN GOD'S ADMINISTRATION Scripture Reading: Rev 1:12, 20; 5:1-7
[102]  Paul's ministry was completed in the late A.D. 60s when he was martyred.
[103]  From what Paul tells us in Colossians 1:25 we know that Paul's stewardship which he received from God was to complete the Word of God.
[104]  In Colossians he presents Christ as the portion of the saints 1:12 ; the image of the invisible God 1:15 ; the Firstborn of all creation 1:15 ; the Firstborn from among the dead 1:18 ; the mystery of God's economy, Christ in us, the hope of glory 1:27 ; the mystery of God 2:2 ; the embodiment of God 2:9 ; the Head of all rule and authority 2:10 ; the body of the shadows of all positive things 2:17 ; our life 3:4 ; and all in all in the new man 3:11 .
[105]  Those in the world do not know what is going on behind the scenes regarding God's government.
[106]  THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN THE WRITINGS OF PAUL AND JOHN
[107]  Both Paul and John speak of the indwelling Christ.
[108]  Paul tells us, "Christ in you, the hope of glory" Col 1:27 ; "it pleased God to reveal His Son in me" Gal 1:15-16 ; and "it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me" Gal 2:20 .
[109]  To say, as John does, that Christ is the vine and that we are the branches, that we are to abide in Him and have Him abide in us, is to speak in a specific, particular way.
[110]  The explanation again comes from John 15, where we are told, "Abide in Me and I in you" v. 4 because "apart from Me you can do nothing" v. 5 . How can we do all things in the One who empowers us? It is by abiding in Him.
[111]  I trust we can all say that we are enjoying the indwelling Christ, the hope of glory; that we are experiencing Him as the all-inclusive One; and that we are in the church, the Body, the new man, the temple.
[112]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN CHRIST'S HEAVENLY PRIESTHOOD MINISTERED TO THE CHURCHES FOR THE PRODUCING OF OVERCOMERS 1 Scripture Reading: Rev 1:12-18; 2:1, 7, 8, 10-12, 17, 18, 26-29; 3:1, 5-7, 12-14, 20-22
[113]  The book of Revelation opens the heavens to show what Christ is now doing there.
[114]  Though we are here on earth, we can see what is going on in the heavens.
[115]  When we come to the last part of a writing, we know that we have the final word of the author.
[116]  Yes, He still walks in the midst of the churches.
[117]  The churches, however, are on the earth, whereas the One walking is not the earthly Jesus.
[118]  In His eyes every church is a golden lampstand.
[119]  Yet if you read the seven epistles to the seven churches, you will see how poor some were.
[120]  How is it possible for every local church to be an embodiment of the Triune God as the lampstand?
[121]  His walking in the midst of the churches is His functioning as the heavenly High Priest.
[122]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN CHRIST'S HEAVENLY PRIESTHOOD MINISTERED TO THE CHURCHES FOR THE PRODUCING OF OVERCOMERS 2 Scripture Reading: Rev 1:12-18; 2:1, 7, 8, 10-12, 17, 18, 26-29; 3:1, 5-7, 12-14, 20-22 OUR WALKING AND SPEAKING HIGH PRIEST
[123]  When we read Revelation, we should consider the first three chapters together.
[124]  The first chapter clearly depicts Christ as our High Priest, wearing the priestly robe which signifies that He is ministering of Himself and of the divine nature and life into us.
[125]  If you separate this chapter from the next two, you will not easily realize that what these two chapters cover is the real priestly service.
[126]  In the last epistle, the one to Laodicea, there is lukewarmness Rev 3:15-16 .
[127]  "I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish you were cold or hot.
[128]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN CHRIST'S HEAVENLY ADMINISTRATION IN GOD'S UNIVERSAL GOVERNMENT Scripture Reading: Rev 1:5a; 4:1-2; 5:1-8; 6:1; 7:2-3; 8:1-6; 10:1-3; 18:1-2; 19:11-16
[129]  In the verses above, Christ is revealed as the heavenly Administrator in God's universal government.
[130]  It may seem that this administration has nothing to do with us; actually it concerns us very much.
[131]  Now we shall see that His priesthood requires His rulership in order for this ministry to the churches to be carried out.
[132]  "Grace to you and peace from Him Who is, and Who was, and Who is coming, and from the seven Spirits Who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth."
[133]  We have seen many similar cases which demonstrate how the rulership of Christ matches His heavenly priesthood.
[134]  In Revelation 4 and 5 Christ is again presented to us.
[135]  "After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things.
[136]  In the next chapter He comes as the Commander of the heavenly army 19:11-16 .
[137]  He is called The Word of God v. 13 , the King of kings, and the Lord of lords v. 16 . He comes to execute God's government by fighting.
[138]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN CHRIST'S HEAVENLY MINISTRY IN SUSTAINING THE OVERCOMING OF THE SAINTS Scripture Reading: Rev 7:9-17; 12:1-5; 14:1-5; 15:2-4; 17:12-14; 19:7-9, 14; 20:4-6 THE CHURCHES AND THE NEW JERUSALEM
[139]  The book of Revelation begins with Christ walking in the midst of the churches and concludes with the New Jerusalem.
[140]  What the churches are today for God, the New Jerusalem will be for Him in eternity.
[141]  Nothing holds back God's chosen ones as does religion.
[142]  From Revelation 4 through 20 we have seven cases which portray this heavenly Priest ministering the divine element into His lovers and seekers.
[143]  While these middle chapters mainly deal with His rulership, these cases are concerned not with that but rather with His sustaining ministry to the overcomers.
[144]  In Revelation 12:1-5 there is the description of a strange sign: "A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars; and being with child, she cried out, being in travail and in pain to bring forth.
[145]  "And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.
[146]  And they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who have been purchased from the earth.
[147]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN CHRIST'S ETERNAL MINISTRY IN SUPPLYING THE NEW JERUSALEM Scripture Reading: Rev 21:1-7, 9-11, 22-23; 22:1-5, 13, 17 THE NEW JERUSALEM
[148]  The last two chapters of the Bible are profound.
[149]  When he awoke, "he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven" v. 17 . He called that place Bethel, the house of God v. 19 . But Jacob's experience of the house of God was only a dream.
[150]  Strange as it may seem, this tabernacle is also called the bride, the wife of the Lamb Rev 21:9-10 .
[151]  So far we have made reference to God the Father 21:22 and to Christ the Son, the Lamb v. 22 . Where can we find the Spirit mentioned? Revelation 22:17 tells us, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! Let him who hears also say, Come! Let him who is thirsty also come; he who wills, let him take the water of life freely." Thus in these two chapters we have the Triune God mentioned.
[152]  With this background we are prepared to see that in eternity Christ will still have His ministry.
[153]  Revelation 21 and 22 show us His eternal ministry.
[154]  By then His ministry is no longer in the heavens because the New Jerusalem, where He will minister, has come down out of heaven.
[155]  There will also be the kingship, for "they shall reign forever and ever" 22:5 .
[156]  We are the sons of God, enjoying His life.
