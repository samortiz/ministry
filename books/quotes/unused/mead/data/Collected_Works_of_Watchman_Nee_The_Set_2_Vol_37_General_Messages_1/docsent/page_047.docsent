   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRUTH SETTING US FREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do we not have the truth already?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yes, but a question immediately arises.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why is there a vast difference in what we are before the Lord and what we are in the world?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The work of the cross is finished, but we are still not victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus has changed us into one kind of person, yet on earth we still appear as another kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that our condition does not match the truth that we hold onto before God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is our problem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We often do not know what the truth is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We come to God according to our own feelings and experiences rather than according to God's truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must realize that God's truth is contrary to our feelings and experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The one issue we have to resolve is which of the two is real.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is the Lord's accomplishment for us before God more real, or are our own feelings and experiences more real?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Which of the two is more real?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the question.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are often bound because we do not see what is real, what is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once we see the truth, the truth sets us free; it liberates us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us mention a few things to illustrate what it means for the truth to set us free.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We will begin with salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose someone hears the gospel and realizes that the Lord Jesus has died on the cross and shed His blood to forgive his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He believes in the Son of God for the forgiveness of his sins, and he receives the Lord into him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When others ask whether he belongs to the Lord, he says, "Yes."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is bursting with joy within.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, three or five months later, he may feel a little sick, and troubles and difficulties may arise in his family.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then his joy is gone; it seems as if joy has departed far from him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He feels as if he is no longer saved and is no longer a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If others ask him whether he is a Christian and whether he is saved, he may answer, "I am quite bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have lost my former joy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not know where the Lord Jesus is anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not know what to say about this."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What would you say to him at this time?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you know God's truth, you would tell him, "You may feel that you are not saved, but in fact you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In reality you are saved."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From what side are you looking at the matter?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you look at it from his side, you may feel that he is not yet saved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if you look at it from the side of the Lord's work, you will say, "Brother, there is no change; you are still saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You are saved when you feel hot, and you are still saved when you feel cold.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Your feeling may change, but the work the Lord has accomplished for you and what God has given you will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You have to look at it from His end."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord says, "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When a man's eyes are opened to see that he has obtained reality and truth before God through the work of the Lord, he will be free and he will be liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must remember that we are not freed according to our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only one thing frees us: the reality which is before God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There was a brother who had definitely repented to the Lord and was a regenerated believer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After awhile, however, his inward feelings became different; he felt quite grievous, and he thought that he would surely perish.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Another brother came along and said to him, "How do you know that you are going to perish?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He said, "I am not the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I feel cold within.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Neither my prayer nor my reading of the Bible is doing me any good."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The other brother said, "That is the condition on your side, but let us consider a few questions from God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Has the work of the Lord Jesus been discounted?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"No."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"Has the Lord's work changed from what it was before?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"No."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"Has His work been annulled before God as if the new covenant were dissolved?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"No."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"All right, we are sure that there is no change on His side.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, according to truth and according to reality, you have not become unsaved before God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What has changed is your own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You may feel that you are saved, and you may feel that you are not saved, but when God says that you are saved, will He change?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You have to remember that salvation is a question of truth; it is not a question of feeling."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When he heard this, he responded with tears, "It does not matter how confident I am; whatever I say or feel means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If God says that I am saved, then I am saved."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the truth setting us free.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Spiritual reality liberates a man from his own feelings; it frees him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Let us go one step further to see how the truth sets us free.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God's Word shows us that when the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He bore our sins, regenerated us, and saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God's Word also shows us that when the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He put us into the Lord Jesus, and our old man was crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord's death was not the death of an individual; it was a corporate death.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When He died on the cross, we died in Him also.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Through His accomplishment, we became dead.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is truth, and this is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, before we see this truth, we are bound.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we look at ourselves, we still find our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we touch our feelings, we still find our weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All the undesirable things we have from head to toe are still with us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The question now is: Are our experiences and feelings more real, or is the Lord's work more real?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many people are weeping as if nothing is more real than their bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But God's Word shows us that only one thing is real, that is, the accomplishments of His Son Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our old man is crucified with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we do not see this truth, we will become a slave to our temper and will be bound by our experience and feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What can set us free?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Only the truth can set us free.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Only reality can set us free.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we live by our feelings and experiences, we will fail again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But if we see the fact of our crucifixion with the Lord, we will be set free.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Let us consider another matter: the victory of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There was a brother who was under Satan's attacks for a few months in body and in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He tried all he could to pray and resist them.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He even exhausted himself in prayer and resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Yet for three months straight, despite his resistance and prayer, he was still under the attack.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>One night he prayed to the Lord, "I cannot resist any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>My power of resistance is exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I cannot pray anymore, my strength to pray is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Lord, show me where the root of the problem lies."</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God opened his eyes and gave him a word.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He had heard that word before, but when he had heard it previously, it was like seeing men as trees.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Now he became clear.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The word was: "Is Satan worth such resistance from us?"</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He had never before thought that one could be wrong for resisting Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>On that day, he saw the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>What is the reality?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The reality is that the Lord Jesus has overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>When we are joined to Him, we also overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is not that the Lord Jesus is about to overcome, and we cheer Him on.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The truth is that He has overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It is not that Satan will be defeated, and we pray for the Lord to defeat him.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Thank and praise the Lord that Satan is already defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It is done; it is not something to be done.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Once that brother saw this truth, the attacks stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Everything became quiet, and all the problems were over.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This is the reality setting men free.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This is the truth setting us free.</S>
