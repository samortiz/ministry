   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PART TWO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHRIST AND THE PRIESTHOOD CHAPTER EIGHT THE EXPERIENCES OF THE PRIESTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the relationship between Christ and the priesthood?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we say Christ we mean the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is the very embodiment of the Triune God, our Savior, and He is also our life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is everything to us, for He is so all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The priesthood has much to do with such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the types revealed in the Old Testament, the relationship between the priesthood and Christ is clearly manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Briefly speaking, they may be classified into several categories.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS THE OFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The work, ministry, and commission of the priesthood are all in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is the very ministry of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the priesthood takes care of nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First of all, the priesthood takes care of all the offerings Lev 6:8 7:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the offerings typify the different aspects of what Christ is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the standpoint of experience, the trespass offering is first, the sin offering second, the peace offering third, the meal or food offering fourth, and the burnt offering fifth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some parts of these offerings are the wave offerings and some parts are the heave offerings Lev 7:29-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The priesthood must take care of these offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, to partake of the priesthood today means that we must experience Christ as all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only when we have experienced Christ as these offerings can we minister them to others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, we must experience Christ as the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are sinful and have many transgressions before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How can God forgive all our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He can forgive us only by Christ s death on the cross as our trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the story of our salvation: when we first trusted in Christ, we realized that we were sinful, with many trespasses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then when we confessed to the Lord, we realized that Christ on the cross bore all our trespasses before God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is our trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After we were saved, we soon discovered that it is not simply a matter of the sinful things we do or have done, but the very nature of sin within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Capitalized Sin is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We not only have the sinful deeds without, but also the sinful nature within.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We knew that Christ died on the cross to deal with all the sinful deeds committed before God, but now we realize that the sinful nature is within.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans 7 calls this nature Sin that dwells in me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then the Lord reveals to us that by dying on the cross He has not only dealt with our sins, but also our Sin!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that He is not only our trespass offering, but also our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Trespasses are something without, but Sin is something within.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we must learn to experience Christ not only as our trespass offering, but also as our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After the experience of these two offerings, we enjoy Christ as the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Peace always depends upon dealing with all trespasses as well as dealing with Sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we still have trespasses which are not yet forgiven and dealt with, we can never have peace within!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, if we have not dealt with the capitalized Sin within us, we cannot enjoy peace within.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After both our trespasses and our Sin have been dealt with by Christ, we can enjoy Him as our peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Following our experience of Christ as the peace offering, we find that He is also the meal or food offering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that Christ is our food and constant satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The burnt offering follows the food offering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The burnt offering is the food for God!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is not only our satisfaction, but also God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is not only our food, but He is also God s food.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Much time is needed to realize and experience all these offerings, especially by young Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many young Christians today do not know much about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Have you experienced Christ as your trespass offering?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No doubt you have, but what about the second offering?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Have you ever experienced Christ as the sin offering?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Not many Christians have had this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some Christians may have experienced Christ as the peace offering, but what about the meal offering?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>So many Christians are simply short of these experiences!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They are lacking in the experience of Christ as their daily food as seen in the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ is our food, and we must learn to enjoy Him as our satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Gradually, we will discover that Christ is not only our food, but also God s food and God s satisfaction, for He is the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I believe that at the Lord s table some of the brothers and sisters have had some apprehension and realization that their sins are forgiven, and they have been very grateful to the Lord for His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Others have apprehended something deeper than this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They have realized that their sinful nature has been dealt with by the crucifixion of the Lord on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They have sensed that they were released and set free from Sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They were experiencing Romans 8 there is no condemnation because in Christ the law of the Spirit of life has set them free from the law of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ has dealt with their sinful nature, so by His death they can be set free from Sin which dwells in their body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I also believe that at the Lord s table some of the brothers and sisters have had the sense of enjoying the Lord as their peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What wonderful peace within!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>And others may have the feeling of satisfaction, for the Lord is their food, their meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A few may realize that the Lord is the satisfaction not only to them, but also to God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Christ is the meal offering to them and the burnt offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must experience all these offerings in such a way; then we will be in the real priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christ is so much to us!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He is the trespass offering, dealing with our sinful deeds; He is the sin offering, dealing with our sinful nature; then He becomes our peace and satisfaction as well as the satisfaction to God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must also learn to experience Christ as the wave and heave offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Firstly, we must experience Him as the resurrected One as the wave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He is waving, that is, He is so living!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He has been resurrected; thus, we must know the power of His resurrection as the living One who is waving within us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>No Christian should be so quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We all must be very living.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we know Christ as the resurrected and living One, we cannot be still!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We cannot be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We will be waving, and full of energy.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We will not come to the meetings so quietly.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we do, it probably means that we are a little bit dead.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, the One within us can never be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He is the living One!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When He came back to speak to the churches in the book of Revelation, He told them, I am...the living One...and behold, I am living forever and ever...</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Rev 1:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>His church should be neither dead nor deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>His church must be living and waving all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We must learn to enjoy this waving Christ, for He is our wave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Then Christ is our heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He is not only the resurrected One, but also the ascended and transcendent One.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He has ascended to the heavens, and He is transcendent far above all.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We must experience Christ as such a One.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Many times, different brothers and sisters have said to me, Oh, brother, I m finished.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I m through!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>They were very depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If this is true of us, we can never minister Christ to others as the heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We need to experience Christ as the ascended One.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He is so transcendent that nothing can oppress, depress, or suppress Him!</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>For us to be in the priesthood, we must experience these aspects of Christ and then help others to experience Christ in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>As the real priesthood, we must first take care of all the offerings before we can help others to realize that Christ is their trespass and sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We must also help them to experience Christ as their peace, and as their food and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>They must see that He is not only their satisfaction, but God s satisfaction as well.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Also, they must be helped to realize the resurrected Christ as their wave offering and the ascended Christ as their heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When the Apostle Paul was put into prison, he experienced both the wave and the heave offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Just because he was in prison did not mean that he was through.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>He was so energetic, so waving, because he had the living Christ within him as the wave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>He even tried to sleep, but the waving One within him did not agree, so he sang hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>He was not in prison; he was in heavenly places.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>He was not in jail; he was in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>He was so transcendent, experiencing Christ as his heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Sometimes our home becomes a kind of jail.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>It is our home sweet home, yet it becomes a prison to us.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If this is true, it proves that we do not know how to experience Christ as our heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Many times in my experience the surrounding circumstances have been just like a thick wall.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>There was no entrance and no window.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>But I could say, Lord, all these surrounding circumstances are like many walls, but, hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>I have a window upwards.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>I am in the ark, and the window is open toward heaven referring to the window in Noah s ark in Genesis 6:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We must learn to experience Christ as our heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Only through the enjoyment of these offerings can we be in the real priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>But, as most of us know, the offerings are just in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>We may say that they are quite good, deep, and spiritual, but they are still in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>We are still at the brass altar and not yet in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>These offerings are the outward experiences, not the inward.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>They are still superficial and not so deep.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>When we realize this, we see how poor many Christians are today.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Most of them have not even experienced all the items of these offerings; even those who have are still in the outer court.</S>
