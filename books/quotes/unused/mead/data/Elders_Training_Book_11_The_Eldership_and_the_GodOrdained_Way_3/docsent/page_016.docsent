   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We may be aware of the temptation extended to Eve by Satan, but we may not realize that every day we are under the temptation to contact others in the realm of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must be full of discernment but outside of the realm of good and evil without criticizing, despising, and judging others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are in the spirit, full of life, we will be full of discernment, but we will have no criticizing, despising, or judging.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We will simply minister life to those whom we contact.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We will be able to minister life to anyone who comes to us because we will not care to remain in the realm of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is not easy, especially when a case between two parties comes to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In such a case the elders often measure and weigh the case to see who is right and who is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the elders determine that one of the parties is wrong, they may condemn him inwardly, and in their talk with him they may not be able to avoid criticizing and judging him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This spoils the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The elders may then ask the other party to exercise his patience while they do their best to help the first person to have a change and be adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such a way of speaking with the two parties is in the realm of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No life is ministered to either person under the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, the negative situation may be intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are humble and see our past in the light of this word, we will realize that many times we have fallen into this temptation and did not do anything to help the church in life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we know the devices of Satan, we will not intensify a negative situation and cause it to be built into a worse issue.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, we will help both parties to realize that they are short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This will help them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whether or not we can do this depends on whether we are persons in the realm of good and evil or in the realm of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must not care for anything good or anything bad.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must only care for Christ as life to us through the dealing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we will be able to minister Christ as life to whoever comes to us.</S>
