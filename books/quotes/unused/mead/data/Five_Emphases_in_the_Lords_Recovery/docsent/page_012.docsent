   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we would like to continue our fellowship concerning the second emphasis in the Lord's recovery Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In particular, we want to see more concerning the biography of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ Having the Preeminence, the First Place, in All Things</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the centrality and universality of God, Christ must have the preeminence, the first place Col 1:18b .</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ Having Been Given to Be the Head over All Things to the Church</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ephesians 1 also tells us that God has given Christ to be the Head over all things to the church v. 22b . The preposition to indicates a kind of transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whatever Christ is, is transmitted to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whatever Christ, the Head, has attained and obtained is transmitted to the church, His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this transmission, we enjoy the fullness of the Godhead and His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God Incarnated to Be a Man</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ was God, and one day He became a man in incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Incarnation is God coming to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The almighty God became one with man according to the human principle of conception and birth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God took this way to become a man about four thousand years after He created man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Four thousand years after His creation of man, He came into the womb of a virgin named Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The almighty God, the Creator of heaven and earth, came into the womb of a virgin and stayed there for nine months.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Jesus is the connection, the linking, of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jesus means Jehovah the Savior.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the complete God connected and mingled with the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This wonderful person is very particular.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is not merely God or merely man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is both God and man, so He is called the God-man.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His incarnation not only made Him a man but also brought God into man.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After He lived thirty years in Nazareth, He came out to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When He came out, He was a great attraction, like a big magnet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While He was walking on the seashore of Galilee, Peter, Andrew, James, and John were drawn to Him Matt 4:18-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They left their occupations and followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They were attracted by the Lord as the great light in the darkness of death v. 16 and followed Him for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens in the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although He was such an attraction, He did not possess any outward beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was not a handsome man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Isaiah said that He had "no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him, / Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him" 53:2 and that "His appearance was marred more than that of any man, / And His form more than that of the sons of men" 52:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even though He did not have a handsome appearance, something within Him was like a magnet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the disciples saw Him, they were drawn, attracted.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may also say that they became "addicted" to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today I can declare that I am addicted to Jesus, and many of us are the same.</S>
