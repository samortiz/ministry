   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR THE GROWTH IN LIFE 12 Scripture Reading: Matt 16:21-26 THE DISPOSITION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our disposition is what we are by birth, our natural makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In our experience, our disposition is found in the "I," the old man, the self, and the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although there are no verses in the New Testament that clearly define the disposition, its significance is implied in certain portions of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Galatians 2:20 says, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this verse, the disposition is implied by the old "I," which has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Matthew 16:21-26 and Luke 9:22-25 the disposition is implied by the self Matt 16:24; Luke 9:23, 25 and the soul-life Matt 16:25-26; Luke 9:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Matthew 16:22 Peter rebuked the Lord Jesus according to his disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Peter's disposition was mainly expressed in his quickness and in his taking the lead to express himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Peter, as the spokesman of the twelve disciples, took the lead to express himself on many occasions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>None of the other disciples exceeded Peter in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We each have our own disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to our disposition, we also may be quick to express ourselves as Peter did.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the other hand, according to our disposition, we may be persons who rarely say something to express ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our disposition is the most difficult part of our being to deal with, and often there is a particular part of our disposition that is the hardest to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It seems that a mountain can be moved more easily than certain parts of our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our disposition is a part of our self.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As Christians, we have to live Christ by rejecting our self.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must learn to act against our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our Disposition, Our Growth in Life, and Our Usefulness in Service</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to my observation over many years, the real enemy of our growth in the divine life is our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our disposition is also the factor that spoils our usefulness in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Shortly after I was saved, I received the vision of the Lord's recovery through the writings of Brother Nee, and I left the denomination with which I was meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 1932 the Lord raised up a church in my locality, and in 1934 I began to work with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since that time, as one caring for the church and the work, I have had contact with many people and have come to know them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have learned that many saints eventually stopped growing in the divine life and could make no further progress.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For the first few years of their Christian life they grew in the divine life very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually, however, their growth stopped due to a particular, peculiar aspect of their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They had given up the world and had sacrificed many things for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They also listened to the messages and loved them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, a particular, peculiar aspect remained in their being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That part of their makeup became a stronghold that held them back from making progress in the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is little possibility for such saints to progress.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some saints have not grown in life for fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have also seen some very promising saints who loved the Lord, sacrificed for Him in many ways, received a high education, and had much experience in sufferings and in the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a rule, such ones are very useful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, because of a particular, peculiar aspect of their makeup, their usefulness was annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They did not insist on holding onto this aspect of their being; it simply remained in them and spoiled and stopped their usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our particular traits can be compared to the grain in a piece of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A carpenter prefers to use wood that has an even grain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the carpenter finds a piece of wood with an irregular grain, he will not use it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A piece of wood may be of good quality, but if it has a knot or a burl, it cannot be sawed easily; it is not useful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Christians who do not have any peculiarity, any peculiar traits, are the ones who grow the most and the fastest.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Likewise, the brothers and sisters who are the most useful are the ones who do not have any peculiar traits.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the service, the ones who are the most useful are the ones who always reject and deny what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have been observing the situation in the church for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I was with Brother Nee, I saw a number of cases of rebellion, and in Taiwan and the United States I have seen several such cases.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we would diagnose these cases of rebellion, we could see that the source of the rebellion was the disposition of the persons involved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>With almost no exceptions, the cause of each person's involvement in rebellion was their peculiar traits.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the one hand, many of the dear saints who have been involved in a rebellion were very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the other hand, there was a "burl" within them, causing something negative to grow and accumulate.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The "burl" eventually annulled their usefulness and led to rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many other dear saints, however, have not rebelled, but they were more useful in former years than they are today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They have remained in the church, but their usefulness has been annulled by their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the Christian life and in the work, disposition is a great negative factor.</S>
