   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUBDUING THE WILL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What then is salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Salvation is nothing other than God saving man out of himself and into God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Salvation has the aspects of termination and union.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It terminates the self and unites God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Any way of salvation that does not have the goal of saving man from himself and into union with God is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a method of salvation cannot save man from himself and into union with God, it is only empty words.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Real spiritual life is the severing from that which is of the animal and entering into that which is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everything that belongs to the creature must go; the creatures should only enjoy all that the Creator is in the Creator Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The creature must become nothing before real salvation can be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Genuine greatness does not depend on how much we have; it depends on how much we lose.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Genuine life can only be seen in the losing of one's self.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the natural disposition, life, and activities of the creature are not totally done away with, there will be no place for God's life to be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our "self" is often the enemy of God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we do not lose the intentions and experiences that are for ourselves, our spiritual life will suffer great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What is the self?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is one of the most difficult questions to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although we cannot answer the question one hundred percent accurately, it may be more or less accurate to say that the "self" is the "self-will."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The essence of man's self is just his will because the will reveals how the man actually is, what he actually wants, and what he is willing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Except for the work done in man by the grace of God, all that man has, whether he is a sinner or a saint, is completely opposed to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The disposition of created man is always natural, and it is never of the same kind as God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Salvation is nothing other than saving man out of his fleshly, natural, created, animal, and selfish will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should pay attention to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In addition to God giving us a new life, the return of our will to God is the greatest work of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God gives us new life for the purpose of turning our will back to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The gospel is to lead us to a union with God in our will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Otherwise, the gospel has not achieved its mission.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God does not intend to save just our emotion or our mind; He intends to save our will because once the will is saved, the rest will be included.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To a certain extent, man may unite with God in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He may also share the same emotion with God in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the most important and the most complete union with God rests in the union of man's will with God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This union of the will includes all the other union of man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the mind or the emotion is united with God, but the will is not, this union is still short.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since our whole being moves according to our will, our will is clearly the most powerful part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Noble as the spirit may be, it too submits to the governing of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We will see this in a moment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The spirit is not sufficient to represent the whole being, because the spirit is the part where man has fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The body is not sufficient to represent the whole being either, as it is the part where man contacts the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the will stands for the attitude, opinion, and condition of man's true self; therefore, it is has the power and sufficiency to represent the whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the will is not joined completely to God, other unions are shallow and empty.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the will that governs our entire being is in complete union with God, our entire being will be totally submissive under God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are two unions between God and man; one is the union in life, the other is the union in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The union with God in life is through receiving of the very life of God at the time of our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just as God lives by the Holy Spirit, we also should live by the Holy Spirit from now on.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the union in life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that God and we have only one life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is inward.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, the will expresses this one life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why there is still the need for the union of the will outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The union of our will with God means that God and we have only one will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These two unions are mutually related and dependent.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At this moment we are only speaking about the union of the will because the other is beyond our present scope.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The union of the new life is spontaneous because the new life is the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, the union of the will is more difficult because the will belongs to us.</S>
