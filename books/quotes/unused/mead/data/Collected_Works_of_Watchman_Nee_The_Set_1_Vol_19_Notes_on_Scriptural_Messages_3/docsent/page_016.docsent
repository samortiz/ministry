   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>It is most interesting to see the journey that the Israelites took in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Recall the fact that the Israelites' journey from Egypt to Kadesh took only two years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is recorded in Exodus 12 to Numbers 13.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Due to their unbelief they did not enter into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They journeyed another thirty-eight years before they entered into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those two years of journeying were normal but the thirty-eight years were just a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From Mount Horeb they circled around until they returned to the original place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have also seen from the book of Deuteronomy that from Mount Horeb through Mount Seir to Kadesh-Barnea was a journey of only eleven days but it took them thirty-eight years to finish it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This circle was so large that they made their eleven-day journey in thirty-eight years!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was not three years or five years.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the time they circled around; there was no beginning and no end. This is the experience of many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some problems can be solved in three to five days, but they wait three to five years and the problems remain unsolved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to our knowledge, from the time Paul went to preach in Corinth to the time he wrote 1 Corinthians there was a span of only a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In that time, Paul hoped that they would become spiritual and grown-up men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Seeing that they remained as infants after these years disappointed Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It seems that he was saying, "It has been so long; it is already a few years!"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From this we see that, according to Paul, being a spiritual man does not require a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not right to take three to five years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, what is our point of view?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we see that a believer is living a foolish life, we make excuses for him, by saying, "Since he has only believed in the Lord for three or five years, how can he do what he is supposed to do?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, Paul's view was totally different.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After one year, a person should have the stature of a one-year-old.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He should not take three to five years to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Three to five years after salvation is enough for a person to become a grown-up spiritual person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Unfortunately, in these days there are many fifty-year-olds who are still babies.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They have never consecrated themselves and do not know what is meant by walking on the right path, seeking after God's will, or fellowshipping with God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They cannot help others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They read the Bible but do not have any light; they do not know how to lay hold of God's promises.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many have taken thirty-eight years to go through an eleven-day journey.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These are the days that are forgotten and lost.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every time I think of this matter, I become sorrowful and find the thought unbearable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, I still thank the Lord who gives me comfort in my despair.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Joel 2:25 He said, "I will restore to you the years/That the swarming locust has eaten."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thank the Lord that He still has a way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may be sixty years old this year and have wasted thirty or forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You may say, "What should I do about this today?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I do not have a chance any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How much longer do I have to live?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My strongest years have already been eaten up by Satan."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What has been lost will never come back.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is like what Mr. Gladstone, a very famous politician in England, said in his old age to a young missionary, "Sir, you are still young.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I give you my blessing for going again to preach the gospel in the foreign countries.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Unfortunately, I am already old.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although I have succeeded to become the most important man on the political stage, and although I have been a pillar and have spent much time and energy for England, I regret the time spent in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If I had three lives, I would spend every one of them to preach the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today I am unable to do so because the strongest and the best time of my life has been eaten up.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, I encourage you to run for the Lord and gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once there was a young girl who fell into sin and contracted tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She was dying in the hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>An old servant of the Lord preached the gospel to her, telling her that the Lord Jesus had borne all her sin and persuading her to confess her sins, repent, and accept Jesus as her Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At first this girl resisted.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>She wondered how the Lord could forgive a sinner like herself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, after she accepted the Lord, she was saved and became very happy, and peace filled her heart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After a few days, this old servant went to see her again.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He was surprised to find her with a very sad face and very sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The servant asked her, "Why?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not let Satan cheat you."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>She said, "No, I know that my sins have been forgiven."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"Then why are you so sorrowful?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>She answered sadly, "My years and days are almost finished.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am lying here, and I am about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When I stand in front of the Lord, the Lord may reckon me as saved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But what do I have to bring to Him?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I can only tell the Lord that I have come empty-handed!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How can I face my Lord with empty hands?"</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Truly, if the Lord takes you today, what do you have to bring to Him?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Have you ever saved a soul?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>That is why this sister was very sad.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The old servant said to her, "Sister, do not worry.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I will take what you have just said and will write a song right next to your bed to encourage others to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this way, all those who preach the gospel and save souls because of this song will share their rewards with you."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He wrote the now well-known song: "Must I go, and empty-handed,/Thus my dear Redeemer meet?"</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Because of this song, many were touched to go out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>That is what the Lord means when He says, "I will restore to you the years/That the swarming locust has eaten,/The licking locust and the consuming locust and the cutting locust."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, let us testify for Him today, serve Him, and recover the zeal which was in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Ten years of a man's life on earth may be counted for only one day.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But then one day may also be counted as one thousand days.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>David said that a day in the Lord's courts is better than a thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Therefore, our service is not in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The days in heaven are not measured by twenty-four hours.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is spiritual accounting.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The way we reckon a day is not necessarily the same way God reckons it.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>All those who are for the Lord are in the light; everything that does not have the Lord is filled with darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The most tragic verse in the whole Bible is John 13:30: "Having taken the morsel, he Judas went out immediately; and it was night."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is a very dark verse.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Judas went out and left the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is forever a dark night when one betrays the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>From that day on, that man never saw day again; he never saw daylight, and everything for him was darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is a very dangerous thing to leave the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Whenever a person leaves the presence of the Lord, it is darkness for him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Therefore, let each one of us consider how we are going to spend the rest of our days!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>May we not lose our days, but spend each day as a thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We should go on day by day and should never stop.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Every step of our walk should be in the light of God's will, and we should not delay any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If we have fallen, we should rise up again right there.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Let us remember that the fallen time is the lost time.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Concerning the ministry on the Notes on Scriptural Messages, I need to clarify a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Most of the manuscripts are notes on messages.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Although I spent some time in correcting it, the contents and style are like the spoken form.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we intended to publish it in book form, we would have made it easier to understand, and fewer phrases would be missing.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>However, I can only admit that it has been impossible to rewrite them because of my busy schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Therefore, please excuse any mistakes found in structure and style.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>March 24, 1934</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Shanghai</S>
