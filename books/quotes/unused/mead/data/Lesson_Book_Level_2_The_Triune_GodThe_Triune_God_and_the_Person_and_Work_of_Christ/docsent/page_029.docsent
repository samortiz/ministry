   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST BEING MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible also reveals to us that Christ is not only God but a man as well.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Throughout the four Gospels, Christ called Himself "the Son of Man."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Satan came to tempt Him in the wilderness, Christ replied that man shall not live on bread alone Matt 4:4a .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Acts 2:22, Peter calls Him "Jesus the Nazarene, a man demonstrated by God to you."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Timothy 2:5 says, "For there is one God and one Mediator of God and men, the Man, Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hallelujah, He is so wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In previous lessons we saw that Christ is the complete God, the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In later lessons we shall see that He is also a genuine man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why Christians have called Him the "God-man."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>CHRIST BEING THE CREATOR</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is the Creator of all things Gen 1:1; 2:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since Christ is God, He surely is also the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This fact is clearly revealed in the Scripture: "And, You in the beginning, Lord, have founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands" Heb 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being" John 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Through Whom are all things, and we through Him" 1 Cor 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"Because in Him were all things created in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him" Col 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Through Whom the Son also He God made the universe" Heb 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These verses clearly tell us that Christ is the Creator of all things; all things have been created and have come into being through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>CHRIST BEING A CREATURE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man is a creature Gen 1:27; Acts 17:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since Christ is a man, surely He is also a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is revealed in Colossians 1:15, which says the Son is "Firstborn of all creation."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This verse tells us in plain words that Christ is created because it says that He is the Firstborn of the creation, the First of all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Revelation 3:14 also tells us He is created.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this verse Christ calls Himself "the beginning of the creation of God."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is the chief of the creation, the First One of all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some people teach that Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn before all creation and that He is thus not a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But this is not what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you are the first-ranked student of your class, aren't you still part of your class?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>So Christ is part of the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is a creature because He became "flesh" John 1:14 , took part of "blood and flesh" Heb 2:14 , was born a "child" Isa 9:6 , and became a "man" 1 Tim 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"Flesh," "blood and flesh," "child," and "man" these surely indicate creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Are not "flesh" and "blood and flesh" created things?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Are not "child" and "man" created things?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course they are!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, since Christ became these things, how can we say that He is not a creature?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we acknowledge that Christ is a man, then we must admit that He is a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we deny that He is a creature, then we deny that He is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>People have been wrong throughout the centuries, but the Bible has never been and never will be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not change the eternal Word of God to make it fit our thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our concepts must line up with the truth of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>V. CHRIST'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is crucial to see the Person of Christ because all of His work depends upon who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ can be our Savior because He is such a wonderful Person He is God, the Creator, and a man, a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He could die as the Lamb of God for our sins because He is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His work of redemption is eternal in time and space because He is the eternal God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As God He can also put His divine life into us that we could fulfill His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hallelujah for such a Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Praise Him for who He is and for the work He has accomplished!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>QUESTIONS What is a heresy?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Why is it heretical to say that Christ was a man who later became God?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Which verses show that Christ is the creator?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Which verses show that Christ is God?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Which verses show that Christ is a creature?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Quoted Portions from Lee/LSM Publications Concerning the Person of Christ, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>19-47.</S>
