   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE SIXTY-NINE SUNDRY ORDINANCES OF THE LAW Scripture Reading: Exo 22:28-31; 23:14-19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible is a very sweet book.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have a sweet taste when we read many portions of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalm 119:103 declares, How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, when we read Exodus 21:7 23:19, we may not sense any sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Did this portion of Exodus taste sweet to you when you read it last?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we get into the depths of these chapters and touch the spirit in which they were written, we shall realize that this part of the Word also is very sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible was not only inspired by the Spirit; it was also written with a particular spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is especially true of the laws and ordinances in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even with respect to the secular law of a country, people speak of the spirit of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How much more is there a certain spirit in the law and ordinances decreed by God!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we touch the depths of 21:7 23:19, we shall have a sweet taste.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, although it is easy to touch the body of the Word outwardly, it is often rather difficult to touch the spirit of the Bible inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To read only the letters in black and white is to touch the body of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must exercise to go deeper and touch the spirit of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible as a whole was revealed by God according to His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, especially in the Old Testament, the divine revelation is given according to the situation of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, when I read the book of Exodus as a young man, I was troubled by the fact that God in His law did not abolish slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I also wondered why slaves did not have rights equal to the free.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I asked why the law given by God and all the ordinances decreed by God still allowed such inequalities to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are told that if an ox killed a slave, the owner had to pay a smaller amount than if the ox killed a free man 21:28-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that a slave did not have the same rights as a free man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some may even doubt that these ordinances were revealed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They may regard them simply as Moses own ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, 21:1 clearly says, Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them lit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>. All the ordinances in chapters twenty-one through twenty-three were written by Moses according to God s dictation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, they were not devised according to Moses concept.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For this reason, we cannot dismiss them by saying that they are nothing more than an ancient way of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But since these ordinances were dictated by God, we may ask why something like slavery was allowed to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Questions like this remind us that it is not easy to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to know the Word, we need to know God s heart and also God s economy, purpose, and plan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The laws and ordinances of God in the Bible are written in a way that is very different from the way man-made laws are written.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Often men try to write something classical when they compose a law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>An attorney may even try to produce a classical writing on a particular case.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, chapters twenty-one through twenty-three of Exodus were not composed in a classical way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we read these chapters, it may seem to us that the ordinances are arranged in a rather unusual order.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, 21:15 says that he who smites his father or mother shall be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then verse 16 says that he who steals a person shall be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But then verse 17 speaks about one cursing his father or mother and being put to death for this offense.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why are verses 15 and 17 not put together?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why does verse 16 come between them?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we had composed this chapter, we probably would have put verses 15 and 17 together, followed by verse 16.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But God inserted a verse having nothing to do with parents in between verses which speak respectively of smiting one s parents and of cursing one s parents.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be sure, the arrangement here serves a definite divine purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We believe that every word of the Bible is God-breathed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we would appreciate Exodus 21 through 23 adequately, we must touch the depth of these chapters to sense the spirit in which they were written.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As we shall see, the spirit here is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No man-made laws of any nation or society have been written with the spirit found here.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How sweet is the spirit in which God s ordinances were composed!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have seen that the first six verses of chapter twenty-one, the first of the many ordinances concerning man s relationship with others, are related to slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The composition of these verses is not classical.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, according to the human concept, these verses are not altogether logical in their arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But the spirit that pervades them is very sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have pointed out that when given the opportunity to be free, a slave could say, I love my master, my wife, and my children.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I do not want to go out free.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What a sweet spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In His Word God does not care for a classical style of writing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead, He cares for sweetness of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In 21:1-6 we can see the spirit of a slave, the love of a slave, the obedience of a slave, and also the life of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How sweet is this ordinance concerning slavery!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I do not believe that we could sense any sweetness in any man-made law we might read.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, if we consider carefully all the ordinances in chapters twenty-one through twenty-three, we shall realize that every ordinance is sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For example, 23:4 says, If thou meet thine enemy s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Instead of wanting to return an animal belonging to an enemy, we may be tempted to praise the Lord for exercising His judgment on our enemy and for vindicating us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But according to this ordinance, an Israelite was to return a lost ox or ass to his enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Furthermore, according to 23:5, if an Israelite saw a heavily laden donkey belonging to a person who hated him, the Israelite was to stop what he was doing and relieve the animal of its burden.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He could not excuse himself by saying that he was too busy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He had to lay aside his own burden to release from its burden an ass belonging to a person who hated him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The New Testament teaches us to love our enemies Matt 5:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But this commandment is not as sweet in spirit as the ordinances in 23:4 and 5.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>According to these ordinances, on the one hand an Israelite had to return an ox or ass belonging to his enemy; on the other hand, he had to work with the very one who hated him to release that one s donkey from its heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In these matters an Israelite had to face his enemy personally.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I know of brothers who have given financial help to those who hated them, but they did not visit those persons.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, according to the ordinances here, an Israelite had to personally return the lost animal to his enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The more we consider these ordinances, the more we realize the sweetness of the spirit in which they were written.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Who would ever think that the laws of any nation would be composed in such a spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God s laws were not written according to man s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>On the contrary, they were dictated by God in His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As we have indicated, the ordinances in chapters twenty-one through twenty-three, as well as the ordinance concerning worship at the end of chapter twenty, all provide details to the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Certain details are added to each of the commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We have already pointed out that the ordinance concerning the worship of God in chapter twenty adds details to the second and third commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Furthermore, some of the ordinances are a supplement to the commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Let us now consider the sundry ordinances of the law in 21:7 23:19.</S>
