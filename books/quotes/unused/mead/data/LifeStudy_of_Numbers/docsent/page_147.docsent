   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. God's Statute of Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Moses brought the case of the five daughters of Zelophehad before Jehovah v. 5 , He said to him, "The daughters of Zelophehad speak rightly; you shall surely give them possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers and cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them" v. 7 . The Lord seemed to be saying, "Their request is right.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is pleasing to Me. I do not like to see one of My people dying without having a remembrance in the history of My people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The request of the five daughters is according to My desire."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The five daughters were given an inheritance among their father's brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There was, however, a binding term.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This term, or condition, was that the daughters were not to marry outside their tribe 36:2-3, 6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may apply the type in 27:1-11 to our situation as believers today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Christ we have the right to inherit the divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to request our rightful inheritance, and God will approve this request.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, there is a condition that we must fulfill: we must not marry outside our "tribe."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our tribe today is Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verses 8 through 11 we have further aspects of this statute of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If an Israelite died and had no sons, his inheritance would be given to his daughters v. 8 . If he had no daughters, his inheritance would be given to his brothers v. 9 . If he had no brothers, his inheritance would be given to his father's brothers v. 10 . If his father had no brothers, his inheritance would be given to his nearest relative of his family v. 11 . This typifies that the possession of the enjoyment of Christ must be based on our relationship in life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The kind of relationship in life we have will determine the kind of enjoyment we will possess.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that the degree of our relationship in life determines the amount of our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The enjoyment of Christ may differ both in kind and in degree.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If our experience of life is high, then our enjoyment of Christ will also be high.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if our experience of life is low and very limited, then our enjoyment of Christ will also be low and very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The enjoyment of Christ is measured by our experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This portion of Numbers concerning the statute of judgment for the women's inheriting of the land actually concerns Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps you are wondering where we can see Christ and the church in 27:1-11.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These verses often refer to the inheritance, meaning the inheritance of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In typology, the good land signifies Christ, and the inheritance of the good land signifies our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, in these verses Christ is typified by the inheritance of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But where do we see the church?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church is signified by the father's house, which is mentioned in 26:2 and which is implied and assumed in chapter twenty-seven.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church today is the house of God 1 Tim 3:15 , and we who once were strangers and sojourners are now "members of the household of God" Eph 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all are members of our Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As members of the household of God, we have the real source of life and the channels, the means, of receiving life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although we have the right to enjoy the inheritance of the good land, in order to execute this right, we need the house and the channels.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Apart from the house and the channels, we cannot exercise our right of inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need the source and the channels.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The source is life, and the channels are the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many of us can testify that in the church we have received the divine life and have enjoyed the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The receiving of the divine life and the enjoyment of the fellowship of the divine life result in the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some dissenting ones, however, have a wrong concept concerning the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They claim that we should not care for any work but should care only for the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The kind of enjoyment promoted by them is unbalanced.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to John 15, the proper enjoyment of Christ is a balanced enjoyment, for it is related to fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The enjoyment of Christ that is without fruit-bearing is improper and unbalanced.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, this so-called enjoyment of Christ is wrong and unreal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible reveals that if we have the real enjoyment of the good land, we will have produce.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If someone claims to enjoy his inheritance of the good land but never has a harvest, we may rightly question what kind of enjoyment he is talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His enjoyment may be improper and even false, for it is an enjoyment without a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A timely harvest is the proof of our enjoyment of Christ as the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The typology in Numbers reveals that if we are to enjoy Christ as our inheritance, participating in the riches of Christ, we must have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to enjoy Christ, we must have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church life is somewhat related to our fellowship with those who are close to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Numbers 27:8-11 indicates that the possession of the inheritance, the possession of the enjoyment of Christ, is based on our relationship in life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Perhaps it is better to replace relationship, a human word, with fellowship, a divine word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our fellowship with the saints in the church is a kind of relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must have this relationship, this fellowship, if we are to have the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we lose our fellowship with the saints, we will also lose our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From this we see that it is risky and dangerous to give up the church life, as some dear ones have done.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Those who give up the church life with the fellowship of life spontaneously lose their right to inherit the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May we all be enlightened concerning this crucial matter and remain in the fellowship of life with the saints, the members of God's great family.</S>
