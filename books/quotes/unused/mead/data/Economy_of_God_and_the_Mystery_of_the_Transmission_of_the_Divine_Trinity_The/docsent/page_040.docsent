   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Paul's Prayer in Ephesians 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter three we see a very deep relationship and union, as well as a profound transmission, dispensing, and mingling between the Triune God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 14 to 19 say, "For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these few verses the emphasis is on the Father, the Spirit, and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapter one it is on the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; in chapter two it is on the Son, the Spirit, and the Father; and in chapter three it is on the Father, the Spirit, and Christ the Son .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both the sequence and the emphasis are clearly revealed in these chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter three the Father is the source; He initiates, directs, and manages.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Recognizing Him as the One who initiates, directs, and manages, the apostle Paul prayed to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In so doing, he took the right way and found the right door; he came before the Initiator, Director, and Manager and solemnly knelt down in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all know that we can pray at any time, in any place, and in any posture.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can pray while we are standing, lying down, stooping, or in any posture we like.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, of all the different postures, the most solemn one is to bow our knees.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is nothing special in simply kneeling down, but to bow our knees, however, is to kneel down in a solemn way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Bible, when God's people pray to Him, the most solemn posture is to bow their knees.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Bowing our knees means we humble our whole being before God and pray in a solemn way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Asking the Father according to His Glory</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What did Paul ask for when he prayed in such a solemn way?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can see that he asked the Father to do something according to His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is an immensely great matter!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have been meeting with the church and the saints for almost sixty years, and I have heard many, many prayers, but I have never heard a prayer asking God to do things according to His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today whenever we meet, we have prayer; almost every time we gather together, we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moreover, we encourage everyone to pray by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, have we ever prayed, "Lord, I pray that You would raise up the small groups according to Your glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Lord, establish the home meetings according to Your glory"?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Most of the time when we pray, we ask the Lord to do something according to His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes we are somewhat humble, so we may ask Him according to His mercy; at other times we are very close to Him, so we may ask Him according to His great love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes we may want to say something that sounds nicer, so we ask Him according to His holiness; other times we see something unpleasant and become angry, so we may ask Him according to His righteousness and justice; and sometimes we pay attention to power, so we may ask the Lord according to His power.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We probably have prayed to the Lord in all of these ways, but have we ever prayed according to His glory?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am afraid not.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is even doubtful that there is such a prayer anywhere on the earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The reason is that man does not have adequate knowledge of the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the Bible, the glory of God is God expressed in His divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, when a flower blossoms, it is glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the same way, when God is expressed, He is glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this sense, what Paul meant when he prayed "according to His glory" is: "Father, may You do things according to Your intention to have Yourself expressed!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, Paul's prayer is related to the dispensing and mingling of the Triune God for the purpose of obtaining a corporate expression of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This corporate expression is the Father's glory, and it was according to this glory that Paul prayed to God.</S>
