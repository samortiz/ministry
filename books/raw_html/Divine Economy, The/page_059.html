<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DIVINE ECONOMY<br>IN THE NEW JERUSALEM<br>AS THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION<br>OF GOD'S CHOSEN, REDEEMED,<br>REGENERATED, AND<br>TRANSFORMED PEOPLE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rev. 21:1-3a, 6-7, 9-12, 14, 18, 19a, 21-23; 22:1-2, 14, 17</H1><P>Thus far, we have seen that the Bible unveils to us that God's economy is His household administration to dispense Himself into His chosen people that we may partake of His life and nature and become the members of Christ for the formation of His Body that God may express Himself through this Body for eternity. In the last book of the Bible, which is the conclusion of the entire New Testament and even of the entire Bible, there are two great signs. At the beginning of Revelation is the sign of the golden lampstands, and at the end is the greatest sign, the sign of the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A FURTHER WORD ON THE LAMPSTAND</H2><P>In Exodus the lampstand signifies Christ Himself as God's embodiment (25:31-37). The lampstand in the temple signifies the enlarged Christ (1 Kings 7:49), while the lampstand in Zechariah 4:2 signifies the children of Israel as God's expression. Finally, in the last book of the Bible is the harvest of the truth concerning the lampstand. The lampstands in Revelation 1 signify the churches (vv. 12-13, 20). In Revelation there is not merely one lampstand but seven, and these lampstands are the local churches. In Exodus the lampstand was Christ as God's embodiment, and at the end of the New Testament the lampstands are the churches as the multiplied embodiment of the Triune God.</P><P>In this lampstand there are only two basic elements&#151;the gold and the oil. The gold is the solid form and the oil is the burning element. When these two are put together, there is a lampstand shining to express God in His Trinity with the Father's nature and essence, the Son's image and appearance, and the Spirit's expression. On the negative side, the priest snuffs all the negative things. On the positive side, the priest also functions to add more oil to the lampstand. Zechariah 4:12 tells us that the oil of the lampstand is golden oil. The two elements of the lampstand are the golden element and the element of the oil, but according to Zechariah these two elements actually are one. The oil itself is golden oil, which means that the gold flows as oil. When more oil is added into the lampstand, that means that more gold is added. The church as the lampstand is the solid embodiment of the Triune God with the sevenfold Spirit as the oil. Actually, the essence of the oil is the element of the gold.</P>
