   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Testimony of Voluntary Poverty</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During the time of the apostles, the disciples gave up everything to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In church history, there were tens of thousands of Franciscans who chose to live in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are often too careful concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are afraid that we will become too much.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, there are too many times in your life that you have done too much already.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you would not misunderstand me, I would say why not do it one more time and be a little bit too much in consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The founder of the Moravian movement, Count Zinzendorf, was an educated person, and he offered up all his material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The number of missionaries this group sent out ranks the highest among all missionary groups during the past few hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Brethren do not like to advertise themselves, but many among them also chose the way of voluntary poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Dealing with Mammon to Take Care</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>of the Church's Need</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Old Testament, when Rachel left Laban, she took the images with her, and she was condemned Gen 31:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today, Christians have to deal with mammon in the same way that they deal with idols.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A Christian should not have idols in his house.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same way, a Christian should not lay up for himself riches in his house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For God's children to lay up riches is the same as for them to touch idols.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today, there are too many needs in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At least there are three needs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, there is the need of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second, there is the need of the poor brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Third, there is always the need of the poor people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord's word says that the poor we have with us always Matt 26:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to take care of the needs in these three areas.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Money Having to Go</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>before One Can Experience Deliverance</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Mammon is more serious than idols.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the church is strong, it will take the stand of voluntary poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way, no false brothers will dare to come into the church, for once they come, they will have to sacrifice themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All those who come in through eloquence, intelligence, or wisdom will not be able to remain in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This will purify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When money goes out, a man is delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you want to remain clean, you have to let your riches go.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Bible, we can see the Lord's relationship with money through two cases.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first case was the paying of the poll tax Matt 17:24-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this case, we see that the Lord did not carry any money in His pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The second case was His entrusting the money to Judas John 12:6; 13:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In that case, we also see that the Lord's pocket did not carry money.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Judas was the only one suitable to carry money.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No Excess through Much Gathering,</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>and No Lack through Little Gathering</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul's principle was that those who gather much have no excess, and those who gather little have no lack 2 Cor 8:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the principle of coordination in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If those who gather much have excess and those who gather little have lack, it means that there is no coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Offering Up Everything,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Keeping Only What One Needs</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today, concerning the matter of offering, it is not a question of offering one-tenth or one-twentieth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is a matter of everyone being as frugal as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Other than his own necessities, he should offer up all the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Anything less than this is not up to the proper standard of serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Neither the Lord nor the church will want anything less than this standard.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everyone who serves the Lord has to forsake everything to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Other than providing for his own daily needs, a man should offer up everything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those who lay up riches for themselves are the servants of mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Consider the idol worshippers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How many procedures they have to go through!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They have to kneel down, to burn incense, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You have to realize that serving mammon is just as complicated as worshipping idols.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The book of Matthew says that where our treasure is, there is our heart also Matt 6:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Following that, it talks about the matter of laying up riches.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In order for our hearts to be saved, we have to be delivered from the laying up of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who have not been delivered from riches have not been saved in their hearts.</S>
