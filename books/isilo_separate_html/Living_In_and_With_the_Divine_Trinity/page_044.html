All these different titles&#151;the Lord, the Son, the Father, and God&#151;bear some significance. In order to understand what it means to abide in God, we need to read 1 John 3:22-24: "And whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and practice the things which are pleasing in His sight. And this is His commandment, that we should believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, even as He gave a commandment to us. And he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And in this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us." God is the One who gave the commandments. These commandments are that we have to believe in His Son and that we have to love one another. We need to have the faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and we need to have the love to love all the brothers. This is what it means to abide in God. This is a living that includes the main things of our Christian life. Our Christian life is a life that believes in Christ and loves the brothers. As long as we believe in Christ and love all other Christians as our brothers, we are complete. This means that we are abiding in God. We abide in God because we are keeping His commandments which charge us to believe in His Son and to love all the brothers of His Son. This is to have faith and love.</P><P>In 1 John we see that we need to abide in the Lord, in the Son, in the Father, and in God. This presents a full portrait of living in the Triune God. To live in the Triune God is to have a daily life in Christ as the organism of the Triune God, in the Lord with His headship, with His lordship, in the Son with His sonship, in the Father with His fatherhood, and in God with His commandments of believing in His Son and of loving all His other sons. This is what it means to experience the Divine Trinity in our daily life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>By the Spirit of God</H2><P>We abide in God by the Spirit of God (1 John 3:24b). Without the Spirit of God, there is nothing between us and God. The linking, the connection, between us and God, the Father, the Son, the Lord, and Christ, is the Spirit. This "linking Spirit" is in our spirit. If we are going to enjoy a life of abiding in God, we must exercise our spirit, turn to our spirit, touch our spirit, and use our spirit. Then we will touch the linking Spirit.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> </body></html>
