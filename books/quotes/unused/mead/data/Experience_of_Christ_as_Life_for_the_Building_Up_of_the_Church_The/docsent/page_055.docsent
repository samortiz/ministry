   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING ANOINTED WITH THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Romans speaks of sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All of these are carried out by the anointing of the Spirit, and the Spirit is Christ Himself 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some may ask, "Where is Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 10 says that there is no need to go to the heavens to bring Christ down or to go to the abyss to bring Christ up vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ as the word is in our mouth v. 8 . He has become the living word, the Spirit, to be in our mouth like the air, the breath, that can be taken into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ today is the compound air, the life-giving Spirit, and we have to breathe Him in.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 10 tells us the way to breathe Him in, that is, by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 12 says that He is rich to all who call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to participate in the Lord's riches, we have to call upon Him day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the priestly service in the tabernacle, the priests had to light the lamp and then burn the incense Exo 30:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The lamp signifies the Word Psa 119:105 , and the incense signifies prayer Psa 141:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever we come to light the lamp, we have to offer the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that whenever we touch the Word, we have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Praying should never be separated from dealing with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Dealing with the Word needs the real praying.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To light the lamp, you need to burn the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The simplest way to pray is to call upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we call on the name of the Lord, we get His person, and His person is the compound Spirit with all the ingredients of Christ's being and work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we mingle our reading of the Word with calling on the Lord's name in prayer, we will be anointed with the compound Spirit, and spontaneously we will become holy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today what we need is not the teachings but the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every part of the church life needs to be anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why we have to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more we call on the name of the Lord, the more we are anointed with Him as the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Under this anointing we have the reality of the tent of meeting, the tabernacle, and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to turn away from the doctrinal teachings and cleave ourselves to calling upon the name of the Lord that we may be anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to be renewed and revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The anointing is always fresh, but the teachings are always old.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to be freshly anointed with the Spirit continually by calling on the name of the Lord all day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By this anointing we are sealed with the Spirit 2 Cor 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, the anointing is the sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The seal is a mark that marks us out as God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How can people realize that we are people of God?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is only by the anointing, the sealing, of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we are under the continual anointing and sealing of the Spirit, we give others the impression that we are the people of God, that we belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you dye a white shirt again and again with blue dye, eventually everyone is clear that it is a blue shirt.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Similarly, if we are anointed with the Spirit continually, everyone will be clear that we belong to God, because we will be His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How can we know that we are saved?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more we are anointed, the more we are sure that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We doubt our salvation because we have not been anointed that much.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we are anointed, the more we have the mark of the Spirit as the living seal, causing us to bear God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, the more we are anointed, the more we receive the pledge, the guarantee, the enjoyment, the foretaste, of the Spirit 2 Cor 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we enter into eternity in the New Jerusalem, we will completely and eternally enjoy the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today we have the pledge, the guarantee, the foretaste, of this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are going to have a proper church life, to be built up together, and to serve the Lord as the priesthood, we need the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every part of the church life and everyone in the church life has to be anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We cannot have the building or the priesthood without being anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we are under the anointing of the compound Spirit, we have the priesthood and the service in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The way to be anointed is to call upon the name of the Lord continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The result is the building up of the tent of meeting, the dwelling place of God, and the priesthood in today's church life.</S>
