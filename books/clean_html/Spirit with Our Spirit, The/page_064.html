<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. To Carry Out the Renewing<br>of the Believers as God's New Creation</H2><P>The Spirit sanctifies us dispositionally to carry out the renewing of the believers as God's new creation (Titus 3:5; Rom. 12:2b; 2 Cor. 4:16). Titus 3:5 speaks of the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit. The renewing of the Spirit continues the washing of regeneration. In other words, renewing is a continuation of regeneration. When the Spirit sanctifies us, He not only corrects us but also renews us. To renew requires the addition of a new element. So the renewing is the continuation of God's new creation work, and renewing is a synonym for sanctification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Perform the Lord's<br>Transformation of the Believers</H2><P>The dispositional sanctification of the Spirit is to perform the Lord's transformation of the believers (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2b). Romans 12:2b says that we are to be transformed by renewing. Thus, renewing is a continuation of regeneration, and transformation is an issue of renewing. This shows that transformation is also related to sanctification. The dispositional sanctification of the Spirit is carried out by renewing, resulting in transformation. Both renewing and transformation are parts of the process of sanctification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. To Consummate in the Believers' Glorification</H2><P>In 1 Thessalonians 5:23, Paul expressed the desire for our whole being to be sanctified, that is, to be brought into glory in full. How much we are in the glory depends upon how much we have been sanctified. We are on the way of being brought into glory by the sanctifying work of the Spirit. The more we are sanctified, the more we enter into glory. Our being fully sanctified, not only in our spirit but also in our soul and even in our body, means our whole being has been reconstituted with the divine element. Our spirit, soul, and body will be reconstituted, sanctified wholly, and that will be our glorification.</P><P>Sanctification is the gradual process of glorification. The more we are sanctified, the more we are made holy and the more we feel that we are in the glory. When the Spirit corrects us, He supplies us and transfuses us with all the riches of Christ to sanctify us. Then we have the feeling that we are glorified. Thus, sanctification consummates in the believers' glorification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. To Complete God's Sonship<br>in Choosing the Believers</H2><P>Finally, the Spirit's dispositional sanctification is to complete God's sonship in choosing the believers. Ephesians 1:4-5 proves this. Sanctifying is sonizing. Sanctification is for God's making of sons. Sanctification issues in sonship, results in sonship. The sanctification which we enjoy is not only a change of our position but also a constitution of our disposition to sonize our entire being.</P>
