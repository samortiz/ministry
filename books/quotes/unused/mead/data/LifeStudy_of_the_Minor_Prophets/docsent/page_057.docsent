   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE ON MICAH 4 JEHOVAH S CONTENDING WITH ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE PROPHET S OBSERVATION AND EXPECTATION Scripture Reading: Micah 6 7</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter five Micah reaches the high peak of his prophecy concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then in chapters six and seven, which we will cover in this message, he descends to a much lower plain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His prophecy in chapter five is great, but his prophecy in chapters six and seven is not great but is very much according to the human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>JEHOVAH S CONTENDING WITH ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Micah 6 is a record of Jehovah s contending with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because contending is a matter of fighting by speaking, it is not pleasant for anyone involved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A. Taking Israel s History as a Base</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In His contending with Israel, Jehovah took Israel s history, from the time of the exodus, as a base vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 2b declares that Jehovah has a contention with His people and that He will dispute with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then He asks them to remember what He did for them in bringing them out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, / And from the slave house I redeemed you; / And I sent before you Moses, / Aaron, and Miriam.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>/ O My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab counseled, / And what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, / From Shittim to Gilgal, / That you may know the righteous acts of Jehovah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. Aspiring after Israel s</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Genuine Worship and Sincere Service</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verses 6 through 8 reveal that Jehovah aspired after Israel s genuine worship and sincere service.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Israel had been busy in the worship of God for centuries, but their worship was not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Much of what they offered was not offered to God but either to themselves or to their idols.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, in verse 6 the prophet asks with what he should come before Jehovah, saying, Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, / With one-year-old calves?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 7 he asks if Jehovah would be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of oil, and then he says, Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, / The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God would never require anyone to offer their children as a sacrifice, but the people of Israel actually did this in order to fulfill the requirements of their idols.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only idol worshippers would make sacrifices of their children.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here Jehovah was contending with Israel concerning their idol worship and their offering sacrifices to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For this reason, in verse 8 Micah prophesies, saying, He has declared to you, O man, what is good; / And what does Jehovah require of you, / But that you would execute justice and love lovingkindness / And walk humbly with your God?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>C. Stating the Cause and the Effect</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verses 9 through 16 we have the stating of the cause and the effect.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The cause is Israel s sins, and the effect is Jehovah s punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>V. THE PROPHET S</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>OBSERVATION AND EXPECTATION</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Chapter seven speaks of the prophet Micah s observation and expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His observation involved a close study and examination of the condition and situation of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His expectation was related to his attempt to find something with which he could encourage himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Much of what he says in this chapter is an expression of his natural sentiment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A. The Prophet s Observation of Discouragement</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, the prophet observed the condition and situation of God s chosen people and became fully discouraged vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In his discouragement he said, Woe is me!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For I am like a gathering of summer fruit / And like a gleaning of the vintage; / There is no cluster to eat, / Nor first-ripe fig, which my soul desires.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>/ The godly man has perished from the land, / And there is none upright among men; / They all lie in wait for bloodshed; / They each hunt their brother with a net vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Micah s observation of discouragement there is a lesson for us today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From Micah s experience we should learn not to look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we look at ourselves just a little, we will be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>B. The Prophet s Expectation of Encouragement</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In verses 7 through 20 we have the prophet s expectation of encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Actually, this was a matter of self-comforting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Micah wrote the things found in these verses in order to comfort himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, they were Micah s self-comforting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Taking the Lead</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>to Look for Jehovah and Wait for God</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After observing the poor situation of the people of Israel, the prophet took the lead to look for Jehovah and wait for God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although the condition and situation of God s people caused Micah to be discouraged, he could still say, But as for me, I will look for Jehovah; / I will wait for the God of my salvation; / My God will hear me v. 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Assuring Israel of Her Restoration</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In verses 11 through 13 Micah assured Israel of her restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>First, he said that there will be a day for the building of Israel s walls v. 11a . Then he went on to assure Israel, saying, In that day they will come even unto you / From Assyria and from the cities of Egypt, / And from Egypt even to the River, / And from sea to sea and mountain to mountain v. 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Asking Jehovah to Feed His People Israel</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In verses 14 through 17 the prophet asks Jehovah to feed His people Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Thanking God for His Forgiveness</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>of the Remnant of the People</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The prophet concludes by thanking God for His forgiveness of the remnant of the people vv.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Micah could not praise God that the condition and situation of His people were wonderful, for they had nothing that He could appreciate.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Instead, the prophet said, Who is a God like You, / Pardoning iniquity / And passing over the transgression / Of the remnant of His inheritance?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>/ He does not retain His anger forever, / For He delights in lovingkindness v. 18 . Here Micah seemed to be saying, O God, all we have is sin and iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We do not have anything to give to You.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But You are a God who pardons our iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is no God like You.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You are also very particular in that You do not retain Your anger forever but delight in lovingkindness.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Micah s praise here is centered not on the virtues of God s elect people but on God s attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Such a praise is very comforting.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In verse 19 the prophet continues, He will again have compassion on us; / He will tread our iniquities underfoot.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>/ And You will cast into the depths of the sea / All their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Once again, Micah confesses that the people have many iniquities but that God is a forgiving God and will tread their iniquities under foot and cast their sins into the depths of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Finally, Micah says, You will perform truth to Jacob, / And lovingkindness to Abraham, / Which You have sworn to our fathers / From the days of old v. 20 . Here we see Micah s hope and expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In a sense, Micah s word in chapters six and seven is good, but it cannot compare with his revelation concerning Christ in chapter five.</S>
