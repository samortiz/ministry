<h2 class="head1">THE LIVING AIR</h2>
<p>As the Spirit, He is so available that we may breathe Him in, and we may receive Him so easily. Then how do we breathe? The Bible says in Romans 10:12 that the Lord is rich unto all that call upon His name. So the way to breathe Him in is to call on Him: &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; This is why, whenever there is a person who will call on the name of the Lord Jesus, something happens. If you too will only call on His name, you will never be the same. It is not that you decide to correct yourself, but something happens within you, and you have some change. Sometimes the change occurs immediately. Sometimes it comes after a few hours or a few days. This is not a religion, and it is not something psychological. This is Jesus! When you call on His name to breathe Him in, He comes as a living Person into you. If the electrical waves in the air are real, Jesus is more real. Today, on the entire earth, Jesus as the life-giving Spirit is so real. Whenever a person anywhere on the earth says, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; he breathes in the living air. This is our wonderful Jesus!</p>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;Is not Jesus in heaven?&rdquo; Yes He is. But we must all know that the Jesus who is on the throne in the third heavens at the right hand of God is now so real as the Spirit on the earth. He is omnipresent. We cannot limit His location. He is everywhere, just like the air. And He is as available as the air to us. Right now, wherever we are, if we will call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; something will happen, and we will get something. And this something can never be rejected by us. Hallelujah! Jesus is so real, so living, and so available.</p>
<p>We have seen in the Gospel of John that in the beginning He was the Word who was God. Then He became flesh to be the Lamb of God to bear the sins of the world. And this He did. He accomplished redemption on the cross almost two thousand years ago. But that was not His ultimate purpose. His ultimate purpose was to get the bride. Yes, He did come to save us as sinners, but that was not His goal. His goal was the bride.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF THE BRIDE</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, the first mentioning of anything sets up a principle. The first mentioning of marriage is in Genesis 2. Here we have the marriage between Adam and Eve, and the first principle concerning the bride. It is so clear in this portion of the Word that the bride must come out of the groom. Eve was made with something taken out of Adam. A rib was taken from him; that was her source. With that rib, God builded a woman. Then this woman went back to Adam, and they two became one. This is the principle of the bride.</p>
<p>How then can Christ as the last Adam obtain His bride? When God created Adam, He brought all the animals to him. Adam looked at them and even named them, but he could not find his counterpart. Not one could match him. Not one was in his image. Then God put Adam to sleep, and out of his side He took a rib and builded a woman. Then when Adam awoke he looked at the woman and it seemed that he said, &ldquo;This is my counterpart. She is something out of me. She has my nature, she has my life, and she also bears my likeness.&rdquo; Now Adam was complete. Without Eve, he was only a half. When the two halves were put together, there was a whole. If as a man you don&rsquo;t have a wife, you are not complete. You are just a half. You need a wife to match you. A horse cannot match you; a bird cannot match you. It must be someone from the same origin as you are, having the same life and nature that you have. This is a principle.</p>
<p>Do you think that by our natural life we could be the other half of Christ? I cannot match Christ, and you cannot either. Then how will Christ get His bride? It must be something out of Him. We know that when He went to the cross, His side was broken, and out came blood and water: blood for redemption, and water for imparting life. It was through this that something out of Christ came into us. And it is by this element within us that God will build us up to be the bride of Christ. Something of Christ has come into us to make us His bride. We are one thing, but by Christ coming into us, we are made something else. Hallelujah! We all have something within us that has come out of Christ, and it is by this that we will be builded up and return to Christ as His bride.</p>
