<h2 class="head3">2. The Second Aspect</h2><p>The second aspect is the positional sanctification by the redeeming blood of Christ judicially (Heb. 13:12; 10:29).</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Third Aspect</h2><p>The third aspect is the dispositional sanctification by the Holy Spirit organically (Rom. 15:16; 6:19, 22). Regarding the three aspects of God&rsquo;s sanctification we need to remember three words: <i>initially, judicially,</i> and <i>organically.</i></p><h2 class="head2">B. In Our Position and in Our Disposition</h2><p>We are created by God in the particular sense that we are for Him. But we became fallen from God, and we were lost in our position (standing) and in our nature (disposition), becoming common, a very serious matter. Hence, in saving us, God sanctified us both in our position, in our standing before Him, outwardly and judicially, and in our fallen disposition inwardly and organically. We have covered God&rsquo;s positional and judicial sanctification on other occasions. What is covered in this message is God&rsquo;s dispositional and organic sanctification.</p><h2 class="head3">1. By the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Dispositional sanctification is by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 15:16). God&rsquo;s positional sanctification is to sanctify our outward standing before Him by the redeeming blood of Christ judicially; whereas God&rsquo;s dispositional sanctification is to sanctify our inward fallen nature by the Spirit organically through our spirit captivated by Christ.</p><h2 class="head4">a. In Our Disposition</h2><p>The Spirit sanctifies the believers in their disposition. The word <i>disposition</i> refers to nature. The word <i>nature</i> refers to the substance created by God. <i>Disposition,</i>a negative word, denotes our distorted and crooked nature. The nature, the natural substance, created by God was good, but in us, the fallen people, nature has become disposition&mdash;our distorted, crooked, perverted nature. Therefore, when referring to our fallen nature, we use the negative word <i>disposition.</i></p><h2 class="head4">b. With the Nature of God</h2><p>In God&rsquo;s organic salvation we are being sanctified in our disposition with the divine, holy nature of God (2 Pet. 1:4) that we may be holy unto God. God has chosen us to be holy (Eph. 1:4). For us to be holy means that we possess and partake of God&rsquo;s holy nature and participate in God&rsquo;s divinity.</p><h2 class="head4">c. With the Element of the Resurrection Life of Christ</h2><p>The Holy Spirit is sanctifying us also with the element of the resurrection life of Christ, which we received through the feeding. The more we feed on the Word, the more we receive the element of the resurrection life of Christ for our dispositional sanctification.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Wholly Sanctified</h2><p>The believers are being sanctified from their spirit, through their soul, and unto their body, so that their entire being can be wholly sanctified. First Thessalonians 5:23 indicates that sanctification begins from our spirit, spreads through our soul, and consummates with the sanctification of our body. In this way our whole being will be sanctified.</p><h2 class="head2">C. To Be as Holy as the Holy City, New Jerusalem</h2><p>Since all the believers will be the components of the holy city, New Jerusalem, all of them should be sanctified to be as holy as the holy city, the New Jerusalem. Unless we are made holy, we will not be qualified to be a part of the holy city, the New Jerusalem. As the holy city, the New Jerusalem is composed of holy believers.</p>
