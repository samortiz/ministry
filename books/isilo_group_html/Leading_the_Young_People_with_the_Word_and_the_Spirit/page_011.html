<p>Second, Christ is the origin of all things. Concerning the matter of origin, we should share some common knowledge concerning the universe. From all the theorems and laws in the universe, scientists and physicists know that the universe has only one source, not many sources. The laws and theorems discovered by the astronomers, geologists, and physicists prove that the universe came from a single source. We also know that the universe came out of a single source because it is very orderly and not chaotic. This is something that cannot be overturned. The more people study physics and other natural laws, the more they discover that the entire universe is one unified system. Under this system, there are numerous sub-systems, but none of them is in conflict with the others. If several people work on something together but are not of one mind, they will not produce something that is unified. However, the universe is a single unified system. This shows that the whole universe was created by our one God. Our Lord, the Creator, is the unique origin of the universe. We do not have two or more origins because there is only one Lord, one source.</p>
<p>Concerning this point, we should show the young people several verses. Romans 11:36 says, &ldquo;Because out from Him... are all things.&rdquo; <em>Out from</em> implies origin. This verse refers to God. However, God is Christ, and Christ is God Himself (John 14:7-11). To say that God is the origin of all things is to say that Christ is the origin of all things. Out from Him are all things, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being (1:3). All things come out from Him; He is the origin of all things.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 8:6 says, &ldquo;Out from whom are all things.&rdquo; This refers to God the Father; however, we know that Christ and the Father are one (John 10:30). Hence, to say that the Father is the source of all things is to say that Christ is the source of all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE LORD OF ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>Third, Christ is the Lord of all things. Since all things were created by Him and He is the origin of all things, He is the Lord of all things, the Sovereign over all things.</p>
<p>In Acts 10:36 Peter spoke to the household of Cornelius, telling them that Jesus Christ is Lord of all; that is, He is Lord of all persons and things. We should tell the young people that in the whole universe there is no other Lord besides our Lord Jesus Christ. Only Christianity identifies the One whom it follows as Lord. Buddhism does not say that Sakyamuni is Lord, only that he is Buddha. Islam does not say that Muhammad is Lord. Neither Confucius (Confucianism) nor Lao-tzu (Taoism) claimed that its leader is the Lord. It is remarkable that only the Bible says that Jesus is Lord. This is because He is indeed Lord of all. He is the Lord of all people and all things; besides Him there is no other Lord in the universe. As the Lord of all, He is the Lord of heaven and earth, the Lord of animals and plants, and the Lord of seas and oceans. He is your Lord, and He is also my Lord. Christ is the Lord of all things. All things were created by Him and came out of Him; hence, all things belong to Him. He is the Lord of all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE HEAD OF ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>Fourth, Christ is the Head of all things. Ephesians 1:22 says that Christ is the Head over all things. The Lord Jesus is not only the Lord of all things but also the Head over all things. All things take Him as their Head and as their end. Nothing is higher than Him, before Him, or above Him. He is the topmost and foremost One; He is the Head over all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING BEFORE ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>Fifth, Colossians 1:17 says, &ldquo;He is before all things.&rdquo; Christ is before all things. <em>Before all things</em> emphasizes the aspect of time. As far as time is concerned, He is before all things. Before all things came into being, He existed. All the young people should be able to recite this verse.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING ABOVE ALL</h2>
<p>Sixth, Christ is above all. This point emphasizes the aspect of space. In space Christ is above all; in time Christ is before all. John 3:31 twice speaks of Christ being &ldquo;above all,&rdquo; and Romans 9:5 says that He is &ldquo;over all.&rdquo; In the Greek language the two phrases denote different things. John 3:31 emphasizes position. According to position, Christ is above all. Romans 9:5 emphasizes administration. According to administration, Christ is over all. Christ administrates from above. This shows that Christ being above all is related to His governance of all things, not merely to occupying the highest place in space. John 3:31 shows that the Lord Jesus, the One who is in the highest heaven and who is above all, came to the earth, whereas Romans 9:5 emphasizes that He is the One who administrates over all because He is above all.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Leading the Young People with the Word and the Spirit &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
