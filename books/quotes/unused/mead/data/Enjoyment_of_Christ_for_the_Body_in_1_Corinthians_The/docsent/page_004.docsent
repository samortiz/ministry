   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO EATING AND DRINKING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN 1 CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:2a, 6, 9b, 11-12a; 5:7b-8a; 10:3-4, 16-17, 21; 11:23-26; 12:13b; 15:20; Rev 22:14, 17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the beginning of the Bible there is the tree of life for man s eating, and there is also a river that signifies the river of water of life Gen 2:9-10, 16; Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the New Testament the Lord Jesus told His disciples that they needed to eat Him and drink Him John 6:35, 48, 51, 54, 57; 4:14; 7:37-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the second of the Epistles, the book of 1 Corinthians, there are a number of verses related to eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Throughout the past centuries the matters of eating and drinking the Lord have never been as clear in this book as they are today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many expositions of 1 Corinthians say almost nothing about eating and drinking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, they speak concerning teachings and spiritual gifts, especially the gift of speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the verses in this book concerning eating and drinking are strong and strategic.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we read them, we can sense Paul s particular tone and utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we saw in the previous message, 1 Corinthians 1 tells us that the believers in Christ are those who call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to this chapter, we are the called saints, and God has called us into the fellowship of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In addition, we are those who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a two-way calling.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, God called us, and now we call on the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have not been called by God to be dumb; we have been called to call.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are the called ones and the calling ones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To call on the name of the Lord is to participate in Him as our allotted portion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ as our portion is the power of God and the wisdom of God as righteousness for our past vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>24, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since our past was so miserable, we need the Lord Jesus to be our righteousness so that we may be justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ as the wisdom of God is also sanctification for our present and redemption for our future.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is everything to us in relation to the three stages of time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ as our portion is fully adequate to meet our need.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then chapter 2 tells us how to participate in Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to realize that our portion today is the divine Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we must live in our spirit as spiritual men, not in our soul as soulish men vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>10-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A soulish man relies on his mind to think and to meditate.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is to use the wrong organ to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to stop our mentality and turn to our spirit, where Jesus is 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the way to touch the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not adequate for us simply to make up our mind to turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more we do this, the more we will remain in our mind and our will, which are parts of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moreover, the more we remain in our soul, the more soulish we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The best way to turn to our spirit to meet the divine Spirit as our portion for our enjoyment is to call, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not sufficient for us to simply talk about the need to exercise our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If this is all we do, our feet will eventually be out of function.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The way to exercise our feet is either to walk, run, or jump.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Likewise, the most prevailing way to exercise our spirit is to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a person receives only the teaching concerning the exercise of the spirit, one day when someone bothers him, he may think, I was told that this is the time to turn to my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now I should do it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, however, he may forget the teaching and speak a harsh word to that person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To merely have a teaching without applying it is the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we are troubled by something, we need to stop the exercise of our mind and say, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the best way to turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>BEING FED WITH CHRIST FOR THE GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 1 Corinthians 3:2 Paul says, I gave you milk to drink, and in verse 6 he says, I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All mothers know that the way to help their children grow is not by teaching them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The only way for a child to grow is for someone to feed him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul planted something in the Corinthians, and Apollos followed to water what Paul had planted.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then God honored the planting and the watering by causing the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Feeding brings in growth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is why we do not like to follow Christianity in the way of emphasizing teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Rather, we prefer to follow the apostle Paul to feed the saints, to minister food and nourishment to the brothers and sisters so that they may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the past years we have seen the saints grow day by day and year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the local churches the saints are always growing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I do not like to criticize anyone, but I must speak the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I was in Christianity for many years, and I observed that people remained the same year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some attend Sunday school every Sunday morning and remain under certain teachings for many years, but they do not have any growth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, attending even one meeting in the local churches causes us to be different.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>EATING CHRIST AS THE PASSOVER FEAST</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The only way to grow is by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Paul tells us that Christ is our Passover 5:7b-8a .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When many Christians speak of the Passover, they emphasize the applying of the blood Exo 12:7, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Few ever speak of the enjoyment of the passover feast.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To the children of Israel, the Passover was a great enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They not only put the blood on the doorposts, but they also ate the lamb with unleavened bread and bitter herbs v. 8 . This is why Paul says, Let us keep the feast 1 Cor 5:8 . He did not tell us to keep the ritual, the commandment, or the teaching; he told us to keep the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Christian life and the church life are a feast that we keep every day.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When many of us were in Christianity, we kept the fast, not the feast, because there was nothing there to eat, but in the church life we keep the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I have been on the way of the church life for over forty years, and it has always been a feast to me.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Some have criticized us for being beside ourselves in our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>To be sure, we are beside ourselves in our church feast 2 Cor 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After meeting with the saints, we are all joyful and filled.</S>
