   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CREATION OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 1 and 2 are very strange, wonderful, and mysterious in the revelation of God's creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a marvelous step in God's history.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's creation of the universe, with the heavens, the earth, and millions of items, is not as strange, wonderful, or mysterious as His creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to consider a number of the mysteries related to God's creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God Creating Man in His Image</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>and after His Likeness</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, God created man in His image and after His likeness Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that God made a duplication of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He made a copy of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He took a "photo" of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need a definite and accurate definition of God's image and God's likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's image refers to God's inner being, and God's likeness refers to God's outward form.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since God is invisible, how could He have a form?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Genesis 18 God appeared to Abraham in the form likeness of man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Three men came to Abraham, two of whom were angels, but the third One was Jehovah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>1-2, 22; 19:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even at Abraham's time, long before His incarnation, God came in the form of man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Abraham talked to God, and God had a meal with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That meal was cooked by Abraham's wife Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Abraham even served water to this wonderful Man for Him to wash His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God was there in the form of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to our "legal" mind, we would wonder how this could happen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God did not become incarnated to be a man until much later, as recorded in John 1:14.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But about two thousand years before Christ's incarnation, God appeared to man in the form of man already.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This shows us that no one can thoroughly understand the person of God in His Divine Trinity, but we can see all the points concerning Him in the divine record.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God has an inner being and an outward form.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His inner being is actually His image constituted with all His divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is love; God is light; God is holiness; God is righteousness; God is many items.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All these items are the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man was made according to the inner image of God's attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even after the fall, we human beings still have the image of all the attributes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's likeness is His outward form.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Abraham saw God in the form of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ezekiel and Isaiah also saw Him in such a form, sitting upon the throne Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1:26; Isa 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God appeared in the form of man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man's form is a copy of God's form.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's form is the original, and man's form is the duplication, the xerox copy, of God's form.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a part of the history of God, with which man is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In God's history, He made a duplication of Himself, a copy of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This duplication of God is for the expression of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Genesis 1 and 2 are not merely the story of man's creation, but a full record of God's history in making Himself a duplication.</S>
