   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE THE PRIESTLY GARMENTS 10 Scripture Reading: Exo 28:22-30; 39:15-21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that on the ephod worn upon the robe of the high priest there were two shoulder-pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the shoulder-pieces were two plates with six of the names of the children of Israel engraved on each plate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the front of the ephod the high priest wore a breastplate composed of twelve precious stones set in gold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On each of the stones was engraved the name of one of the sons of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, we have the robe, the ephod, the shoulder-pieces, and the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>CHRIST WITH THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ephod signifies the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It portrays Christ expressed in His divinity and humanity with His attributes and virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the ephod is a composition of the expression of Christ in His divinity, humanity, attributes, and virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then upon the ephod, upon the expression of Christ, there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both the shoulder plates and the breastplate symbolize the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, the church is symbolized as a testimony of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the function of the two shoulder-pieces, for two signifies a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, the two plates on the shoulders of the ephod signify the church as the testimony of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The breastplate composed of twelve stones set in gold symbolizes the saints as transformed precious stones built together in the divine nature of Christ to become one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the built up church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, the ephod with all that it bears, the three plates, is actually a picture of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a matter of great importance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is the ephod with all that it bears?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just as the three plates are the belongings of the ephod, so the church is the belonging of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without the three plates, the ephod would still be the ephod, but it would not have as much beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What beauty there is in the ephod with all it bears!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The three plates are simply the additional beauty of the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If these plates were removed, the ephod would still be beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But when the plates are added to the ephod, the ephod has much more beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The entire ephod with the shoulder plates and the breastplate is a portrait of Christ with His church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we consider Exodus 28, we need to lay hold of this picture in an all-inclusive way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that in these messages on the ephod we are speaking concerning Christ with what He is bearing, that is, Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not an easy matter to study the types in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is an especially difficult task to study the typology of the tabernacle, the priestly garments, and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Brethren are experts in the areas of typology and prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you have ever studied the writings of the Brethren, you will see that they pay much attention to the two areas of typology and prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am thankful to the Lord for the years I was with them and for what I learned from them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, I was never told that, in typology, the ephod with all it bears signifies Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The ephod is not merely a type of the glory of Christ or of certain of His virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yes, the ephod itself does signify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But what is borne upon the ephod, the shoulder plates and the breastplate, signifies God s redeemed people, for on these plates were engraved the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These names signify the redeemed people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this reason, the ephod with what it bears portrays Christ with the church.</S>
