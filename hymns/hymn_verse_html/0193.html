After remaining there for three days, he emerged to become a sign to that generation for repentance (Jonah 1:2, 17; 3:2-10). He was a type of Christ, who, as the Prophet sent by God to His people (Deut. 18:15, 18), would turn from Israel to the Gentiles, would be buried in the heart of the earth for three days, and would then be resurrected, becoming a sign to that generation for salvation.

Elisha behaved in a way which was very similar to that of the Lord Jesus in the Gospels, doing many gracious and sweet things (vv. 19-22; 4:1-6:7).<br>Elijah was a type of John the Baptist in convicting people unto death (Luke 1:17; Matt. 11:11, 14; 3:1-2, 6-11a). John the Baptist, who came before Christ, ushered in Christ, as typified by Elijah's ushering in Elisha, who was a type of Christ (Luke 4:27) in doing miracles of grace in life. Elisha was a type in the Old Testament who represented God's New Testament economy in grace. Grace is God doing everything for us by giving Himself to us as our enjoyment (John 1:1, 14-17).
