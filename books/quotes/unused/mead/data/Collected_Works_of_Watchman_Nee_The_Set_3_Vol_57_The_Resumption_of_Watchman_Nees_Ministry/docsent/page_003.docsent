   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOREWORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the mercy of God, the church in Shanghai experienced a great revival in 1947.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When news spread to other places, the churches in the provinces of Fukien and Kwangtung, together with the church in Hong Kong, invited me to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the same time co-workers from northern and southern China, together with co-workers from the West, decided to come together in Shanghai the following year for a co-workers' conference and to share the Lord's grace one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Toward the end of 1947 Sister Peace Wang, Sister Rachel Lee, and I went to Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we went to Canton, Swatow, and Amoy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Finally, in March 1948 we went to Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In all these places we held special revival conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the meetings in Foochow, we went to have some private fellowship with Brother Nee at his home according to a previously-arranged schedule concerning the future of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When news of this went out, thirty to forty co-workers around the Foochow area unanimously requested that they be included in this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With Brother Nee's approval, they all attended the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During these meetings, the need of "handing over'' oneself was brought out one day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Everyone enthusiastically agreed to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This subsequently brought in the recovery of Brother Nee's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother Nee took care of the need of the meeting in Foochow first, and then went with me in April to Shanghai to conduct the nationwide co-workers' conference.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother K. H. Weigh and his wife were in most of the meetings in various places, and the content of this volume is taken from their brief records.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was present in all the meetings throughout this period of the recovery of Brother Nee's ministry, with the exception of the first two meetings, and I even helped conduct the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I sat face to face with our brother and heard these messages with my own ears.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The light that was released was like the shining of the midday sun.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even though forty-three years have elapsed since then, there is a present need to let this light shine forth once again as the rising sun.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Under the Lord's sovereignty, we have the manuscripts of Brother Weigh and his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I read them again, every message was filled with the dawning light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What impressed me the most and rendered me the greatest help concerned the following eight points: 1 the knowledge and realization of the Body of Christ, 2 the knowledge and denial of the self, 3 the knowledge of and submission to the authority in the Body of Christ, 4 the knowledge and acceptance by the co-workers of the "line of Jerusalem,'' 5 the service and coordination of the whole Body of Christ, 6 the need and practice of handing over oneself with all one has, 7 the leading and coordination among the co-workers, and 8 the importance of the Holy Spirit in the service in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May the Lord grant us the mercy, the grace, and the blessing, that all the above points would be abundantly realized in our work and service of the Lord's recovery.</S>
