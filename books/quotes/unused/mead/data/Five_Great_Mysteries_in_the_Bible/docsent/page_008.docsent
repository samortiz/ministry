   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MYSTERY OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us come to see the second great mystery in the Bible, which is the mystery of man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Actually, the mystery of man is the mystery of you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the abstract, invisible, spiritual, living things are surely mysterious, but our human body is also mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our eyes are more complex than the most advanced cameras today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even the hairs of our body are mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the hairs in our body grow downward; only the hairs in our trachea grow upward.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some up and some down: what a mystery!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This mystery is very logical.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the hairs on our body were to grow upward, it would be inconvenient for us to take a bath or shower.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if the hairs in our trachea were to grow downward, we would be in trouble, because all the dirty things would go down and accumulate in the lungs; we would not even be able to cough out phlegm.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is this not marvelous?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first mystery in the Bible is the universe, and the mystery of the universe is God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man also is a mystery, and the mystery of man is God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must ask ourselves: Do we have God?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How much do we enjoy God?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just to have the name and understand the theory are not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You must enjoy God in reality as the meaning of your human life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>MAN BEING ACCORDING TO GOD'S KIND</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible shows us that God's creation of heaven, earth, and all things was from the lowest to the highest, with man being created last.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, all the living creatures that God created were each according to its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fish was according to the fish kind, and the bird was according to the bird kind; so then man must be according to mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But according to the revelation in the Bible, man is neither of the animal kind nor according to mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man is superior and is different from the insects, fish, birds, and beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man is of the same kind as God because man was created according to the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Like a photograph of God, man bears the appearance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But even though man was created according to God's kind and bears the image of God, he did not have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Genesis 1:26 says, "And God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Us here refers to the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit wanted to create man in Their image and after Their likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But when we reach verse 27, it says, "And God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The pronoun Us in verse 26 becomes a singular pronoun He.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is clearly Us in one verse, yet the next verse says He.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you continue to read the Bible, you will find the answer when you reach the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, Jesus Christ is the image of God Col 1:15 ; He is the effulgence of God's glory and the impress of God's substance Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, God's creation of man in the beginning was according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ may be likened to the molding pan used by women for making bread.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The molding pans used by the northern Chinese have seven different shapes: a dog, a tiger, a rabbit, a bird, a persimmon, a peach, and an apple.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you put the dough into the molds, you can make snacks of different shapes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is the mold, and we are the clay.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God created man with Christ as the mold.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, man had the image of Christ, but he did not have the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Why did God create man in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It was for the purpose that one day He could put Christ into man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This may be compared to making gloves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the pairs of gloves are made for the purpose that one day men could put their hands into the gloves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ is the content of man as a glove.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you do not have Christ within you, then you are an empty glove; you are deflated.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When you receive the Lord Jesus as your Savior, He enters into you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then you are no longer an empty glove, but you are filled and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Man was created according to Christ and for Christ, just as a glove is made according to the hand and for the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Without the hand, the glove is meaningless and empty.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Without Christ, man is empty and unsatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In creation, man had only the image of Christ but not the life of Christ.</S>
