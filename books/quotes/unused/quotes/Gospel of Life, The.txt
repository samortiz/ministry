The Bible reveals that the way for men to obtain this wonderful life is to receive Christ by believing into Him
The purpose of this Gospel is to show us that Jesus Christ as the eternal, divine life can meet every need of man
Man's basic need is not any material thing, nor is it to improve himself through moral teachings or religious practices
3All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being
19And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?
25And they asked him and said to him, Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?
29The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
35Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples, 36And looking at Jesus walking, he said, Behold, the Lamb of God!
They went therefore and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day; it was about the tenth hour
47Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him and said concerning him, Behold, truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile!
6Now there were six stone waterpots lying there, according to the Jews' rite of purification, holding two or three measures each
11This beginning of signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed into Him
12After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples; and they remained there not many days
16And to those who were selling the doves He said, Take these things away from here; do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise
23Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed into His name when they saw the signs which He did
17For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him
20For every one who practices evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his works be reproved
22After these things, Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He spent some time with them and baptized
36He who believes into the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him
5So He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob gave to Joseph his son; 6And Jacob's well was there
9The Samaritan woman then said to Him, How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman?
11The woman said to Him, Sir, You have no bucket, and the well is deep; where then do You get this living water?
12Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank of it himself, as well as his sons and his cattle?
21Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father
27And at this point His disciples came, and they marveled that He was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, What are You seeking?
36He who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto eternal life, in order that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together
38I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor
43And after the two days He went forth from there into Galilee, 44For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country
53Then the father knew that it was in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives; and he believed, he and his whole house
2Now there is in Jerusalem near the sheepgate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes
3In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, waiting for the moving of the water
6When Jesus saw this one lying there and knew that he had already been a long time in that condition He said to him Do you want to get well
10Therefore the Jews said to the one who had been healed, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your mat
13But he who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, there being a crowd in that place
16And because of this the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He did these things on the Sabbath
39You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me
43I have come in the name of My Father, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him
44How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that is from the only God?
7Philip answered Him, Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that each one may take a little
12And when they were filled, He said to His disciples, Gather the broken pieces leftover that nothing may be lost
14The people therefore, seeing the sign which He did, said, This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world
15Then Jesus, knowing that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him King, withdrew again to the mountain, Himself alone
16And when evening fell, His disciples went down to the sea, 17And they got into a boat and began crossing the sea to Capernaum
21Then they were willing to take Him into the boat; and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going
23But other small boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks
58This is the bread which came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread shall live forever
61But Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples were murmuring about this, said to them, Does this stumble you?
For Jesus knew from the beginning who were the ones who did not believe and who was the one who would betray Him
1And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for He would not walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill Him
10But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He Himself also went up, not openly, but as it were in secret
12And there was much murmuring about Him among the crowds some said He is a good man but others said No rather He leads the crowd astray
31But many out of the crowd believed into Him and said, Will the Christ, when He comes, do more signs than this man has done?
32The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent attendants to arrest Him
37Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink
38He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water
42Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes out of the seed of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?
45The attendants therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and these said to them, Why did you not bring Him?
50Nicodemus said to them , 51Does our law condemn a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing?
2And early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him, and He sat down and taught them
20These words He spoke in the treasury as He taught in the temple; and no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come
48The Jews answered and said to Him, Have we not spoken well in saying that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?
Abraham died, and the prophets too; yet You say, If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means taste death forever
2And His disciples asked Him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?
3Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but he was born so, that the works of God might be manifested in him
8The neighbors then and those who previously saw him as a beggar said, Is not this the one who used to sit and beg?
11He answered, The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash
24Therefore a second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner
30The man answered and said to them, Why here is an amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes!
41Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would not have sin; but now that you say, We see; your sin remains
3To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out
5But they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers
9I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture
29My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father's hand
33The Jews answered Him, We are not stoning You for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a man, are making Yourself God
40And He went away again across the Jordan, to the place where John was baptizing at first, and He remained there
2It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick
8The disciples said to Him, Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and You are going there again?
28And when she had said this, she went away and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here and is calling you
37But some of them said, Could not He who opened the eyes of the blind man also have caused that this man would not die?
Martha, the sister of him who was deceased, said to Him, Lord, by now he smells, for it is the fourth day that he is there
44And he who had died came out, bound hand and foot with cloths, and his face was bound about with a handkerchief
48If we let Him do so, all will believe into Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation
55Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover in order to purify themselves
1Then Jesus, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead
2Therefore they made Him a supper there; and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of the ones reclining at table with Him
10And the chief priests took counsel to kill Lazarus also, 11Because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed into Jesus
17The crowd therefore that was with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead testified
19The Pharisees then said to one another, You see that you are not doing anything worthwhile; behold, the world has gone after Him
21These then came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus
25He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life
29The crowd therefore which stood by and heard it said that there had been thunder; others said, An angel has spoken to Him
Walk while you have the light so that darkness may not overcome you; and he who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going
10Jesus said to him, He who is bathed has no need except to wash his feet, but is wholly clean; and you are clean, but not all of you
22Judas, not Iscariot, said to Him, Lord, and what has happened that You are to manifest Yourself to us and not to the world?
24He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me
2Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me
6If one does not abide in Me he is cast out as a branch and is dried up and they gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned
If they have persecuted Me, they will persecute you also; if they have kept My word, they will keep yours also
2They will put you out of the synagogues; but an hour is coming for every one who kills you to think that he is offering service to God
30Now we know that You know all things and have no need that anyone ask You; by this we believe that You came forth from God
3And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ
15I do not ask that You would take them out of the world, but that You would keep them out of the hands of the evil one
3Then Judas having gotten the cohort and some attendants from the chief priests and Pharisees came there with torches and lamps and weapons
4Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, went forth and said to them, Whom do you seek?
10Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear and the slaves name was Malchus
That disciple was known to the high priest and he entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest 16But Peter stood at the door outside
The other disciple, the one known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the maid who kept the door and brought Peter in
22And when He said these things, one of the attendants standing by slapped Jesus, saying, Is that how You answer the high priest?
They themselves did not enter into the praetorium, so that they would not be defiled, but might eat the passover
7The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to that law He ought to die because He made Himself the Son of God
19And Pilate wrote a notice also and put it on the cross; and it was written, JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS
25And there were standing by the cross of Jesus His mother and His mother's sister and Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary the Magdalene
26Then Jesus, seeing His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by, said to His mother, Woman, behold, your son
29There was lying there a vessel full of vinegar; therefore, they put a spongefull of vinegar on hyssop and brought it to His mouth
32The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other man who had been crucified with Him
35And he who has seen this has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he says what is true, that you also may believe
39And Nicodemus, he who had come to Him the first time by night, came also, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes of about a hundred pounds
40Therefore they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the custom of the Jews for burying
41Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever yet been laid
42Therefore because of the day of preparation for the Jews and because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus there
1Now on the first day of the week Mary the Magdalene came early to the tomb while it was yet dark and saw the stone taken away from the tomb
14When she said these things, she turned backward and beheld Jesus standing there, yet she did not know that it was Jesus
31But these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God and that believing you may have life in His name
4Now as soon as the morning broke, Jesus stood on the shore; however the disciples did not know that it was Jesus
When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment around himself, for he was naked; and he threw himself into the sea
14This was now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples after He had been raised from the dead
15Then when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?
24This is the disciple who testifies concerning these things and the one who has written these things and we know that his testimony is true
The following article, based on the Gospel of John, explains how you can live the life God desires you to live
The Gospel of John reveals that in Christ, the Word of God, is life ; that He came that man may have life ; and that He Himself is life
The life we have before we receive Christ is, at best, a temporary life; it is not a permanent life, an everlasting life
They know religion, but, because they are weak, they do not have the power to live out its standards or fulfill its regulations
Other people are hungry, craving for something to enjoy, while some are thirsting for something more than their human life can offer them
Finally, the last condition of all men is death, for they are in death and, at the same time, are on the road to death
Many times you feel that you are a hungry person; many times you are thirsty for education, for money, or for pleasure
You need the Lord as the bread of life to satisfy your hunger, and you need the Lord's living water to quench your thirst
The case of the Samaritan woman, a sinful and unsatisfied woman, reveals how much the Lord can satisfy such a person with His living water
The case of the weak man who had been sick for thirty-eight years demonstrates the enlivening power of the Lord's life
In the case of the hungry multitude which needed something to feed on, the Lord presents Himself as the bread of life
In the case of the thirsty people, the Lord assures them that He can quench their thirst by the flowing river of living water
Without regeneration, it is impossible for anyone to partake of the deliverance from sin or to receive spiritual sight
We need to examine very carefully the first case, the case of Nicodemus, which reveals man's need for regeneration
That such an experienced, educated, and elderly man would come to see someone much younger than he indicates his humility
In His conversation with Nicodemus, the Lord revealed that regardless of how good we are, we still need regeneration
Regardless of the kind of human life we have, as long as we do not have the divine life, we need to be regenerated
Many Christians are not clear about this fact, thinking that regeneration is necessary simply because we are fallen and sinful
Regeneration is not any kind of outward improvement or cultivation; neither is it only a mere change or con version without life
To be regenerated is to be born of God , and to be born of God is to have the life of God, that is, the eternal life
To be born anew is to be regenerated with the divine life, a life other than the human life received by natural birth
Although you may feel that you are good, you must admit that you do not have the life of God with His divine nature
Nicodemus was not on the line that would lead him to the New Jerusalem, but on the line that would take him to the lake of fire
When Nicodemus heard that he had to be born anew, he thought that this meant that he had to go back to his mother's womb and come out again
Even if you could be born anew in that way and be young again, after another sixty or seventy years you would be the same as you are now
Water is the central sign of the ministry of John the Baptist, that is, to bury and terminate people of the old creation
These two main concepts, water and Spirit, when put together, are the whole concept of the matter of regeneration
It means to be terminated by John's ministry through water and to be germinated by Jesus' ministry through the Spirit
Whenever a person repents, confessing that he is a fallen being who is good for nothing, that is the acceptance of John's ministry
There is no need, of course, for John literally to be present, for his ministry is in the New Testament already
Following repentance, everyone must believe in the Lord Jesus and accept His ministry of life in order to be germinated
Everyone, whether he is good or bad, needs to be terminated through water and then germinated with the divine life
Regardless of how much we can work or how good our work may be, we cannot be saved and regenerated by our work
It is by faith in the Lord, by believing in the Lord, that we receive forgiveness, the release from God's condemnation negatively
It is also by faith, by believing in the Lord, that we receive eternal life, the divine life of God, positively for our regeneration
After passing through death, by and in resurrection, the Lord has released His life and has become a life-giving Spirit
Now, in resurrection, He is the Spirit of life , with all the virtue of His redemptive work, waiting for us to believe in Him
It is by the way of believing in the Lord with His allinclusive redemptive work that we receive Gods life and are born of Him to be His sons
By believing in Him, we get into Him to be one with Him, to partake of Him, and to participate in all that He has accomplished for us
By believing into Him we are identified with Him in all that He is and in all that He has passed through accomplished attained and obtained
From chapter one to chapter twenty we see a man as the flesh who was the Lamb of God that took away the sin of the world
Eventually, He came back to the disciples to do simply one thing: to breathe on them and ask them to receive Him as the breath
In the beginning was the Word and the Word was God, and the Word was made flesh to be the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world
In the beginning was the Word and the Word was made flesh, and eventually the flesh was resurrected to be the breath for us to breathe in
He came back to the disciples, not as a great giant asking everyone to bow down to worship Him, but in a very silent way
We all know Christ in the first and second stages, but we do not know Him properly and accurately in the third stage
You have heard this, but we must know more adequately that Christ is not only in the Spirit, but Christ is the Spirit
Worshipping God by our spirit and in our spirit is the real drinking of the living water, which is God Himself
In verse 48the Lord said, 'I am the bread of life,' and in verse 57 He said, 'He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me'
The way is not only to drink God as the living water, but also to eat Christ, the embodiment of God, as the living bread
On the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles Jesus stood and cried out, saying, 'If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink
It does not come about from a few concentrated days of praying and fasting and then having something fall upon you from the heavens
Wherever you are, when you have a few minutes, open it and read a chapter or so, then pray over what you have read
There is little need for you to pray over your grades at school, or for your business to be successful, or for guidance when you go shopping
