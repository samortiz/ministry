JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT<br>AND JUDGMENT UPON MOAB</H2><P>In chapter forty-eight we see Jehovah's punishment and judgment upon Moab.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Nation Typifying the World of Fleshly Lust<br>That Corrupts and Frustrates God's Chosen People<br>through the Greedy Religionists</H2><P>Moab as a nation typifies the world of fleshly lust that corrupts and frustrates God's chosen people through the greedy religionists from following and walking with God in His holy way (Num. 25:1-5; Deut. 23:3-4; Rev. 2:14). It was Moab who hired Balaam, the Gentile prophet, to stumble the children of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Moab, the First Forefather of the Moabites</H2><P>Moab, as the first forefather of the Moabites, was born of Lot through incest with his daughter (Gen. 19:30-38). In the sight of God, the source of Moab was most evil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Moabites Not Being Allowed<br>to Enter into the Assembly of Jehovah</H2><P>The Moabites were not allowed to enter into the assembly of Jehovah even to the tenth generation (Deut. 23:3). However, a Moabitess by the name of Ruth became the mother of one of the prominent forefathers of Christ (Matt. 1:5b) because of her allegiance to Israel in the interest of God (Ruth 1:14-18). This indicates that although the Moabites were condemned, at a certain time God had compassion on them.</P>
