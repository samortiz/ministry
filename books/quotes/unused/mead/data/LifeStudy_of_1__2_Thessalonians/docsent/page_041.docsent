   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE TWELVE THE CARE OF A NURSING MOTHER AND AN EXHORTING FATHER Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 2:1-12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the book of 1 Thessalonians Paul does not speak of miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He does not say that the gospel came to the Thessalonians in miracles, wonders, and healings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we study this book carefully, we shall see that Paul's emphasis is on daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1:5 he says, "You know what kind of men we were among you for your sake."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead of emphasizing the supernatural and the miraculous, Paul takes his living as a factor for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, with respect to Christian living, he stresses three matters: turning to God from idols, serving the living God, and waiting for the coming back of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A NORMAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Throughout the centuries the human mind has been interested in things that are fantastic, miraculous, and supernatural.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, miraculous things do not last.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But a work that is carried out by a proper living will last.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's salvation enables us to live a normal life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a strong testimony of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christians should live a normal life, not a miraculous, supernatural life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, a proper life for the church life must be common, regular, and normal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such a life is characterized by turning to God from idols, serving the living God, and waiting for the coming back of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To have this kind of life means that nothing on earth occupies us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are free from all idols, from all things other than God, and we are occupied by the living God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This living God is testified in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have a life which testifies that the God whom we serve is living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, our goal, hope, and expectation are not related to things on earth, but are focused on the coming back of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A life with these three characteristics is a proper Christian life as a testimony to our God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These aspects of a proper Christian life are all covered in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE FOSTERING OF A HOLY LIFE FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first chapter of 1 Thessalonians covers two main points: the structure of a holy life for the church life and the origin of a holy life for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The structure is composed of the work of faith, the labor of love, and the endurance of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The origin of such a life is the preaching of the gospel and the acceptance of the word preached, an acceptance resulting in turning to God from idols, serving a living and true God, and waiting for the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now in chapter two we come to the third aspect of a holy life for the church life, the aspect of fostering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although the word fostering cannot be found in 1 Thessalonians 2, the fact of fostering can be seen in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here Paul likens the apostles both to a nursing mother and to an exhorting father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that the apostles were mothers and fathers to the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They regarded the believers as children under their fostering care.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Just as parents care for their children, fostering their growth, so the apostles cared for the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, in 1 Thessalonians 2 we see the fostering of a holy life for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verses 1 through 12 we have the care of a nursing mother and an exhorting father, and in verses 13 through 20 we see the reward given to those who foster believers in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because the apostles rendered such a care to the new believers, the apostles will eventually receive a reward from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First Thessalonians 2:1-12 surely is a word to new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In these verses we do not have much that is weighty or deep.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here we do not have profound doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, we have a word that can be compared to the way parents speak to young children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let us consider this portion verse by verse so that we may be impressed how to help new believers.</S>
