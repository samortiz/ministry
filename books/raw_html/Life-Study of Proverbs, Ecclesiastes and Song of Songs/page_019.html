<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>24. A Soothing Tongue versus a Perverse Mouth</H2><P>The tongue of the wise utters knowledge well, but the mouth of fools pours out folly (15:2). A soothing tongue is a tree of life, but perverseness in it is a breaking of the spirit (v. 4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>25. Hating of Bribes versus Being Greedy for Gain</H2><P>He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house, but he who hates bribes will live (v. 27).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>26. Taking the Lord as the Only Friend<br>versus Making Many Friends</H2><P>A man of many friends comes to destruction, but there is a true friend that sticks closer than a brother (18:24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>27. The Paths of Life versus the Ways of Death</H2><P>A number of proverbs contrast the paths of life with the ways of death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Paths of Life</H2><P>The paths of life involve fearing the Lord, trusting in the Lord, and taking refuge in the name of the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) Fearing the Lord</H2><P>He who walks in his uprightness fears Jehovah, but he who is perverse in his ways despises Him (14:2). In the fear of Jehovah is strong confidence, and his children will have a place of refuge. The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life, that one may turn aside from the snares of death (vv. 26-27). Better is a little with the fear of Jehovah, than great treasure and turmoil with it. The fear of Jehovah is the instruction of wisdom, and humility comes before honor (15:16, 33). By lovingkindness and truth iniquity is expiated, and by the fear of Jehovah men depart from evil (16:6). The fear of Jehovah leads to life, and he who has it will lodge in contentment; he will not be visited with evil (19:23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) Trusting in the Lord</H2><P>The plans of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from Jehovah. A man's heart devises his way, but Jehovah directs his steps (16:1, 9). He who gives heed to the word will find good, and blessed is he who trusts in Jehovah. The lot is cast into the lap, but everything it decides is from Jehovah (vv. 20, 33). There are many devices in a man's heart, but it is the counsel of Jehovah that will stand (19:21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) Taking Refuge in the Name of the Lord</H2><P>The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; the righteous man runs into it and is safe (18:10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Ways of Death</H2><P>There is a way which seems right to a man, but the end of it is the ways of death (14:12; 16:25).</P>
