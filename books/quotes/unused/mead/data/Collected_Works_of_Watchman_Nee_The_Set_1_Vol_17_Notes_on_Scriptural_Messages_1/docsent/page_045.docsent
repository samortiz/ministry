   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If a person has believed in the Lord and continues to sin without any hatred towards sin, this shows that he has not yet been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>An unregenerated person does not have life and is not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God has not only given us objective salvation, but He has also given us subjective salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If any man thinks he has a new life and is regenerated, yet continues to sin, his faith is not genuine, and he is not really regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's life causes us not to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, a believer does not have to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please grasp these words firmly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A believer not only has objective salvation, but also the subjective life that does not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No traveler would decorate and furnish his temporary lodging beautifully and perfectly only to stay for a few days or months and then leave it to go to another place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Men only decorate, furnish, beautify, and make comfortable a permanent home; no one would furnish a temporary lodging too well, because he will not live there for long.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I had a classmate who never dressed properly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His hair was very long, his face was not washed, his whole body was dirty, and he never put on proper shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Everyone said that he was eccentric, and those who walked with him were disgusted with him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Two years later I met him on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was clean-shaven and wearing a proper suit, and his hair was nicely combed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I hardly recognized him, and I said to myself, "Is this my ex-classmate?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We had been classmates for seven years; I knew that he dressed very poorly and did not care for his appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later he talked with me and asked me about life in some foreign countries and the etiquette of those countries.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I was really amazed that a most casual person wanted to start learning foreign etiquette.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I could not help but go to his uncle to ask the reason.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I found out that he was going abroad to study very soon.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was why he started to dress well and learn etiquette.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A person going to a foreign country to study would stay there for only two or three years; he would not stay there forever.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet this person would dress up in a suit, speak with an accent, care for manners, and inquire about life in a foreign country.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was only going there to study for a few years, yet he had such a good preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How about us believers who will in the future live eternally in the bright, glorious, beautiful, and excellent heavenly home?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Should we not all the more prepare and learn the heavenly life and manner?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Is there such a person who would purposely make Chinese long gowns when he is getting ready to go to a foreign country because he thinks that, after he is in the Western country, he will not have the chance to wear this kind of clothes anymore and that he must therefore take all the opportunities to wear them while he can?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Needless to say, we all know that there is not such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every believer knows that he is saved, and it will not be long before he will be back to his home in heaven where he will see his heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Would he still think, "There will be no more opportunity to sin in heaven, so while I am still on earth, I had better sin more and taste sins more.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I had better be bound by sins more and suffer the bitterness of sins more"?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do you think that this is reasonable?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is surely unreasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us realize that we will all go to the heavenly home and will dwell in that beautiful city.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since we are saved now, we should surely forsake the pleasures of sin and the lusts of the flesh; we should not allow these things to hinder us or obstruct our way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>May we know that since we are saved and have the life of God, we should express God's life and should let others know that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>May we testify much before man so that more people can be saved.</S>
