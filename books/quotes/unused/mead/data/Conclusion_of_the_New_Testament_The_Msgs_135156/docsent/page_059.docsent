   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b To Experience the Death of Christ Practically, Not Living Habitually according to the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To crucify the flesh by the Spirit is to experience the death of Christ in a practical way and not to live habitually according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we would be conformed to the death of Christ and thereby conformed to His image, we should not live habitually, that is, we should not live according to our habits.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because we are accustomed to living habitually according to the flesh, we need to be on the alert moment by moment and be careful about our habits.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to reject, abandon, set aside, our habits and live according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>4 Putting to Death the Practices of Their Body a By the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans 8:13 says, "If you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we live according to flesh, we are about to die spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, if by the Spirit we put to death the practices of the body that is, to mortify or crucify them we shall live in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 8:13 corresponds to 8:6, which says that the mind set on the flesh is death and that the mind set on the spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To live according to flesh primarily means to set our mind upon the flesh, and, likewise, to set our mind upon the flesh mainly means to live according to flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit, we need to set our mind on the spirit and walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we have our mind set on our spirit, our flesh will be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, by setting our mind on our spirit we put to death all the practices of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The genuine experience of the co-crucifixion with Christ is to be had in putting to death the practices of the body by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This does not happen once for all; it is a constant daily exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every practice of the body must be put to death by turning our mind to the spirit and setting it on the spirit. b Not Living Habitually according to the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit means that we do not live habitually according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This requires coordination with God through the exercise of our will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to make a strong decision and say, "Lord, I take sides with You.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I want to be conformed to Your death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Lord, have mercy on me so that I will no longer live habitually according to the flesh but set aside all the habits of my natural life."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the putting to death of the practices of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>5 Denying Their Self</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Matthew 16:24 speaks of denying the self.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Self is the soul life v. 25 with the emphasis on human thoughts and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Self, soul life, and opinion are three aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Self in essence is the soul life, and the expression of self is opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The soul life is lived out by the self, and the self is expressed through the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What the mind thinks or considers is an opinion, idea, or concept.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The mind's opinion, concept, or idea is the expression of the self, the embodiment of the soul life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because opinions are the expression of the self, we need to deny the self by applying the cross to our opinions.</S>
