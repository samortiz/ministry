   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRACTICAL WAY TO KNOW THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How then can we know the inner anointing in a practical way?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Knowing the anointing is very simple so simple, in fact, that it may seem hard to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we physically anoint someone with oil, that person no doubt feels or senses the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is the same with the anointing spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Holy Spirit is anointing us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a result, we constantly have a certain deep sense or consciousness within.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we take care of this sense, we will sense it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do not complicate this matter by asking, Is this the mind or is this the conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Is this feeling from my American or Chinese background?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you ask these questions, an otherwise simple situation will become very complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Realize that you have Christ as the Spirit within you as the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because He as the living One lives within you, He is always working, always anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that you constantly have a certain amount of inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you simply go along with that inner feeling, that will be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The way to know the anointing is therefore very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then you may ask, Could I be wrong in understanding this inner sense?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is here that we encounter the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If your heart is wrong, everything else will be wrong as well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If your motive is impure, then everything else will be foggy and cloudy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You must love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you love the Lord, the inner sense will be very keen.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Indeed, the more you love Him, the keener your inner sense will be.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this reason we must purify our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Matthew 5:8 says, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only when we have a pure heart will we see God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must have a loving and pure heart with a pure motive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A pure heart that has a pure motive is a heart that seeks God and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you seek something other than God, you will be foggy in your inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you would like to have a pure heart, simply tell the Lord, Lord, by Your mercy I seek nothing but You.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Lord, be merciful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Help me to be pure in my heart and pure in my motive so that I would seek just You and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you pray in this way, everything will be clear as crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everything will be transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then it will be easy to sense the Lord s guidance and His will step by step and moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If this is your experience, there will be no need for others to teach you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You will know.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1944 I took a long rest to recover from a serious illness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>During those two and a half years, I was kept away from my work and even my family.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I consequently became quite lonely and desirous of brothers with whom I could fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One brother who cared for me during this time and would often come to me and fellowship would frequently speak to me at length about his situation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Time after time, he came to me with a certain question.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His question was whether or not he should do a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When he asked me, I was led by the Lord not to teach him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I could only answer him with two words: You know.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I told him this, he immediately responded, Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I know.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although the brother came back to me many times and asked me whether or not he should do that thing, all I could say in response was, You know.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is the same in our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Is it not true that you already know what you should do?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You do.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you have a heart that loves the Lord with a pure motive, you know within yourself the Lord s mind and will.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I would say one hundred times that you really know.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The way to know the anointing is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As with all matters of the divine life, the experience of the anointing is quite profound, and no one can fully understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yet in another way, the anointing is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ lives within you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the one hand, He is life to you; as life He is the law that regulates your daily walk and your daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the other hand, He is the One who is always working within you and anointing you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Regardless of what you are going to do or where you are going to go, this inner anointing gives you a sense, a deep consciousness, a deep registration.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The only thing you need to do is love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Should you not have a heart loving the Lord, simply go to the Lord and pray, Lord, be merciful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Grant me a heart to love You.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Pray and consecrate yourself to Him not for the work but for Him to move and work within you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In whatever you are planning on doing, you have to be purified in your motive, seeking nothing besides the Lord Himself and His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is all you need in order to experience the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you practice this all the time, you will never stop growing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Not only so, you will never cease being filled with the Holy Spirit and being saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In this way, your whole being will be mingled thoroughly with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then you will have the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You will be transformed into the image of the Lord from glory to glory 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You will automatically and spontaneously be built together with others.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You will walk, you will work, you will live, and you will do things according to the guidance of the Lord and according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the proper way to experience the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I urge you not to take these matters as mere teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Teachings do not help.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This fellowship is at most a set of directions that point you toward the right way to practice and experience Christ as the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If you go on taking this way, I am fully assured that you will enter into an evermore glorious experience.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Regardless of what kind of situation the Lord may bring you into, it will be glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Thank the Lord for this simple way.</S>
