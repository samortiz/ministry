[2]  As has become manifest to Christian readers throughout the earth, Brother Watchman Nee was especially entrusted by the Lord with the burden to help the believers in the truth of God's full salvation.
[3]  In the spring of 1937 Watchman Nee delivered a series of twenty-six messages on the basic truths of the gospel of God to the church in Shanghai, China.
[4]  I will begin with a very basic foundation concerning the gospel.
[5]  Yet I hope that in every meeting we will advance a little.
[6]  If we want to know about the gospel of God and the salvation of God, we must first know what sin is.
[7]  If we want to differentiate clearly between sin and sins, there is one portion of the Scriptures which we must consider.
[8]  It is the first eight chapters of the book of Romans.
[9]  These eight chapters show us the full significance of sin.
[10]  Sin, according to the Scriptures, is said to be in the flesh; whereas sins are in our conduct.
[11]  Sin is a principle in us; it is a principle of the life we have.
[12]  Now we need to ask the question: Who is a sinner?
[13]  I know that some of the brothers and sisters here have been believers for over twenty years.
[14]  I have heard many say that Paul, in proving that everyone in the world is a sinner, mentioned in chapter three that all have sinned and have come short of the glory of God v. 23 . God seeks the righteous and finds none; He seeks those who understand and who seek after Him and finds none; all have lied and have turned aside vv.
[15]  They think that if we talk about being sinners, it means that we do not know the gospel that well.
[16]  We have seen the matters of sin, sins, and the sinner.
[17]  Among all the sins, there is one which tops the list.
[18]  There you have a prodigal son and his father.
[19]  This does not mean that the other sins are unimportant.
[20]  In the Old Testament, those who did not love God committed many other sins spontaneously.
[21]  Before we were saved, we did not feel the evil of sin.
[22]  Before we became Christians, all that we felt was the evil of the many sins.
[23]  The Bible shows us that there are three aspects of sin.
[24]  To put it another way, sin is in three places.
[25]  But as soon as man sins, there is the record of it before God.
[26]  If in the course of our lives we have transgressed the law, there is a record of our sin before God.
[27]  What do people do when their conscience wakes up and they realize that they have sinned?
[28]  As soon as their conscience catches up with them, they try to do good by performing good works.
[29]  We have seen that, on the one hand, there is the record of sins before God and that, on the other hand, there is the condemnation of sins in man's conscience.
[30]  Tonight we will consider God's love and grace, and we will also touch the subject of God's mercy.
[31]  God Himself is love, but when this love is applied to us, we find that "God so loved the world" John 3:16 .
[32]  Does the whole matter stop with God loving the world?
[33]  "God is love" speaks of God's nature; it speaks of God Himself.
[34]  Romans 5:8 says, "But God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
[35]  But, brothers and sisters, God's love does not stop here.
[36]  Since God is love, the matter of grace comes up.
[37]  Thank the Lord that in the love of God, there is not only grace, but another great item as well, God's mercy.
[38]  But we have to admit that mercy is more particularly an Old Testament word, in the same way that grace is more particularly a New Testament word.
[39]  In the New Testament there are also a few places where mercy is mentioned.
[40]  In most cases, mercy is mentioned in reference to the situation at the time.
[41]  Some may ask, "Since the love of God is so precious, why must there be mercy?
[42]  Ephesians 2:4-5 says, "But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in offenses."
[43]  Jude 21 says, "Keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life."
[44]  This verse shows us that today we should keep ourselves in the love of God.
[45]  Until the Lord comes again, that is, until He appears to us, we should await His mercy unto eternal life.
[46]  On the first evening we discussed the problem of sin.
[47]  Grace is nothing other than God's great work accomplished freely in His unconditional and boundless love for helpless, unworthy, and sinful man.
[48]  The first characteristic of God's grace is that it is not related to man's wrongdoings.
[49]  If you told anyone who has some consideration about God that God loved him and has given him grace, he would immediately wonder how this could be since he has committed so many sins.
[50]  My friends, if you want to be a magistrate, there is the matter of qualifications.
[51]  If you want to enter a school, there is the matter of standards.
[52]  If you want to be a doctor in a hospital, there is the matter of capability.
[53]  There is still another sentence in Romans which is very clear on this point: "But if by grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace" 11:6 .
[54]  Someone in my family once said that we should give a gift to a certain doctor at the end of the year.
[55]  When I asked why, I was told that two months earlier my two younger brothers were sick, and they were cared for by that doctor.
[56]  I believe all of us know the phrase by heart: "For all have sinned."
[57]  Two months ago, while I was in Hong Kong, the world tennis championship was there.
[58]  The tennis pavilion where the match was held could hold only five to six hundred spectators.
[59]  The Lord Jesus said, "And I give to them eternal life" John 10:28 .
[60]  I have heard many times that we have to do good and repay God's grace.
[61]  But I have to ask where in the Bible is there a verse that says that we have to repay God's grace?
[62]  We realize that man's position before God is that of a sinner.
[63]  Why would man say that he can be saved by the works of the law when he does not even know what he is?
[64]  It is because man does not know how evil he is; he does not know that he is fleshly.
[65]  Since man's conduct is against God, his lust is provoking him to sin, and his will is rebellious against God, there is no possibility for him to have the works of the law and be obedient to God.
[66]  Man thinks that he can be saved by the works of the law because he has never read the Bible or seen the light or the heavenly revelation.
[67]  If you want to know whether or not you can be saved by the works of the law, you need to first ask why God gave the law.
[68]  Paul says that God "has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to His own purpose and grace."
[69]  God's will is to dispense His grace, and this grace saves us.
[70]  He saved us and called us with a holy calling so that we may enjoy His glory.
[71]  Rather, it is God coming to accomplish something for us, and it is God giving us His grace.
[72]  You have to pay attention to one particular point here.
[73]  God simply said, "I will save and bless the world through your seed."
[74]  God did not say that Abraham's descendants had to be this or that, or that the kingdom to come forth from him in the future had to be this or that before he would have a seed and the world would be blessed.
[75]  The next verse says, "But to Abraham were the promises spoken and to his seed" v. 16 . God covenanted with Abraham through promises because it concerned the future.
[76]  What is already accomplished is grace; what is not yet accomplished can only be a promise.
[77]  Because the Lord Jesus had not yet come, we cannot say that God's covenant with Abraham was grace.
[78]  Paul was explaining why after four hundred and thirty years the law came in. Verse 17 says, "And I say this: A covenant previously ratified by God, the law, having come four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul so as to make the promise of none effect." Although God gave the law to man, the covenant He made four hundred and thirty years before could not be made of none effect.
[79]  In verse 19 Paul gives us the reason: "It was added because of the transgressions."
[80]  When I read the Bible, I marvel at the words the apostle used.
[81]  In these verses he did not use the word sin; rather, he used the word transgression three times.
[82]  Let us look at this chapter, beginning with verses 7 and 8, "What then shall we say?
[83]  Verse 12 continues, "So then the law is holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good."
[84]  Verse 19 ends in this way: "It being ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator."
[85]  The "it" here refers to the law mentioned above.
[86]  The law was not only added because of transgressions, but was also ordained by a mediator.
[87]  In the previous meetings we have seen that man has sinned and that God's salvation is based on the fact that man has sinned.
[88]  If man had not sinned, there would be no need for salvation.
[89]  Since man has sinned, God has given the law to show man that he has sinned.
[90]  Although God loves us and shows mercy on us and although He fully intends to grant us grace, there is one thing that makes it very difficult for God to do this.
[91]  There is one book in the Bible, the book of Romans, that tells us how God deals specifically with this one problem.
[92]  Let us read Romans 3:25-26, beginning with the second part of verse 25: "For the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred, with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus."
[93]  The coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to the earth was God's requirement in righteousness; it was not God's requirement in grace.
[94]  If there had been love without righteousness, the Lord Jesus would not have needed to come to the earth, and the cross would have been unnecessary.
[95]  If God said, "Since all have sinned, I will let you go this time; just do not sin again," there would be no need for a Jesus of Nazareth in the first place.
[96]  For us forgiveness is free, but for God there is no such thing as free forgiveness.
[97]  For Him, forgiveness comes only after the redemption from sins.
[98]  For example, if you break the law and the court requires you to pay a thousand dollar fine, you must pay the fine before your case will be dismissed.
[99]  We owe God "ten thousand talents of silver," but we have no way to repay.
[100]  Now God is doing the same thing for us.
[101]  Because He loves us, He cannot ask us to pay Him back.
[102]  But because He is righteous, He will not tell us that we have no need to repay at all.
[103]  Therefore, before the Lord Jesus came to the earth and was crucified on the cross, it would have been fine for God to refuse to save us.
[104]  But because God has indeed given us His Son and put our sins upon Him that we might be redeemed from our sins, God can do nothing else but forgive our sins when we come to Him through the blood of the Lord Jesus and through His work.
[105]  But after what we have seen concerning God's righteousness and the righteousness that the Lord Jesus has accomplished, Romans 3:19-26 is wonderful.
[106]  Verse 19 says, "Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may fall under the judgment of God."
[107]  Since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God v. 23 , how can we obtain God's grace? Verses 24 and 25 say that we are "justified freely...through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God set forth as a propitiation place." God has sent Jesus to redeem us from our sins and has set Him forth as a propitiation place.
[108]  This is the only way that Christians can have boldness before God.
[109]  Have you ever realized that inasmuch as love is precious, it is never that reliable?
[110]  Christ as "the end of the law" means that Christ includes everything that the law has.
[111]  In other words, God has not just given you ten thousand talents of silver; all the money in the world has been given you.
[112]  Today we declare two great messages to the world.
[113]  Both of them are what the world desperately needs.
[114]  One thing we have to know is that before the Lord Jesus died, it was unrighteous for God to forgive our sins, but after the Lord Jesus died, it would be equally unrighteous for God not to forgive our sins.
[115]  Without the Lord Jesus' death, God's forgiveness would be unrighteous on His part; He could never do this.
[116]  We should now ask, how is God's righteousness applied to us?
[117]  If God only loves us, He may spare us from the judgment of sins or may let us off easily, if that is something that He can do.
[118]  By the grace of God, we have seen in the past few evenings what God's salvation is.
[119]  The Bible says that God so loved the world that He gave His Son to us John 3:16 .
[120]  If God had not loved us and had not sent us the Lord Jesus, the most that the Lord Jesus could have done would have been to bring people back to Himself; He could not have brought people back to God.
[121]  For the sake of those with unclear concepts, I will say a word first.
[122]  In the Bible, there are two important doctrines, which are the bearing of sins and the ransom for sins.
[123]  Please do not think that I do not believe in substitution.
[124]  The redemptive work of Christ is God Himself coming to bear man's sin against Him.
[125]  In other words, if Jesus of Nazareth was not God, He would not be qualified to bear our sins righteously.
[126]  John 12:24 is a precious verse in the Bible.
[127]  It says that unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone.
[128]  A man like the Lord Jesus was just one grain before God.
[129]  The Lord died on the cross, but what is the significance of His death?
[130]  "He was oppressed, and it was He who was afflicted, / Yet He did not open His mouth; / Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter / And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, / So He did not open His mouth.
[131]  / By oppression and by judgment He was taken away; / And as for His generation, who among them had the thought / That He was cut off out of the land of the living/For the transgression of my people to whom the stroke was due?" vv.
[132]  Do you remember what the Bible says about the sixth to ninth hours?
[133]  The Jews could mock Him, and the Gentiles could chastise and shame Him, but the sun was beyond the Jews' control.
[134]  Since the Lord Jesus died on the cross and since God made Him the propitiation place, how can we be saved?
[135]  In the passage that we have read from Isaiah 53, notice that it says, "But He was pierced because of our transgressions; / He was crushed because of our iniquities; / The chastening for our peace was upon Him, / And by His stripes we have been healed" v.
[136]  We have already mentioned that the Lord Jesus died for us and for our sins Rom 5:8; 1 Cor 15:3 .
[137]  Although we say that the Lord Jesus has fulfilled God's righteous requirements, what does God have to say about this?
[138]  Many of us have had experience working in business.
[139]  Suppose you have a secretary who has proposed a plan to you.
[140]  After you look at the plan you may write "OK" on it.
[141]  Romans 4:25 says, "Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification."
[142]  It is wonderful that Romans 3 tells us that we are justified freely through the blood of the Lord Jesus and that Romans 4 follows by telling us that because we are justified, the Lord Jesus was resurrected v. 25 . His death is the basis of our justification, while His resurrection is the proof of our justification.
[143]  Since He died, we are justified; since we are justified, He resurrected.
[144]  We are justified before God because of His death, and He was resurrected because of our justification.
[145]  Last year when we were buying a piece of land, a few times I took the money to the bank myself.
[146]  Hence, today our faith is not in the blood of the Lord Jesus' redeeming us from sin.
[147]  Even a man as spiritual as Andrew Murray, who knew God so well, said that he did not know how much value there is to the blood of the Lord Jesus.
[148]  Even he said that when he went before God, he could only pray, "God, I do not know how much worth is the blood of Your Son before You.
[149]  The two verses that we mentioned earlier in 1 Corinthians 15 are very precious.
[150]  Verse 14 says, "And if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is vain; your faith is vain also."
[151]  If Christ has not resurrected, one will not know what has become of the things that he has believed in. Another wonderful thing is seen in 1 Corinthians 15:3 which says, "Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures." But in verse 17 it says, "If Christ has not been raised...you are still in your sins." Do not these two verses contradict each other? Verse 3 says that He has died for our sins.
[152]  Without the death of the Lord Jesus for us, we would not have been redeemed from our sins.
[153]  The Bible says many times that the Lord Jesus died for all.
[154]  But not once does it say that the Lord Jesus died for the sins of all.
[155]  Romans 5:18-19 says, "So then as it was through one offense unto condemnation to all men, so also it was through one righteous act unto justification of life to all men.
[156]  For just as through the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of the One the many will be constituted righteous."
[157]  At the same time, we must also differentiate between ourselves and our sins.
[158]  Romans 5:8 says, "While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
[159]  We have also seen how God through His Son Jesus died for us and for our sins, thus accomplishing the work of redemption Rom 5:8; 1 Cor 15:3 .
[160]  His work of redemption justifies us before God through faith in His blood Rom 3:24-25 .
[161]  If a person does not have the light of the Holy Spirit, it is possible that he can be like Judas, who saw his sin, was suffering and had no peace within, but would not see his own position before God.
[162]  Without the light, he would not see his position of perdition.
[163]  Man's feeling concerning sin goes only so far as to realize that he has done wrong.
[164]  He does not realize that he is a lost one before God.
[165]  But without the enlightening of the Holy Spirit, we will not admit that as a result of sin, we became lost persons before God.
[166]  Hence, although there is the love of the Father and the work of the Lord, there is still the need for the Holy Spirit to prepare man's heart.
[167]  He still has to work in man's heart so that man will receive all that the Lord Jesus has done.
[168]  One can say that the Lord Jesus is our objective Savior from God and that the Holy Spirit is our subjective Savior from God.
[169]  The Lord Jesus is the Savior who accomplished redemption for us outwardly, and the Holy Spirit is the Savior who accomplishes salvation for us inwardly.
[170]  What should we do now that the Holy Spirit has enlightened and we have seen our position?
[171]  The Bible shows us that not only does the Holy Spirit come to enlighten us and to show us our sins, our lost position, and our unrighteousness before God and men, but this Spirit is also sent from God and is poured forth upon all flesh for the purpose that man everywhere could be saved through His work Acts 2:17-18, 21 .
[172]  Let us read Romans 10:13: "Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
[173]  The subject of Romans 10 is on God causing the Lord Jesus to die and resurrect for us.
[174]  In the few verses prior to this verse, God asks if there is anyone who can bring Christ down from heaven to die for us and if there is anyone who can bring Christ up from the abyss to resurrect for us vv.
[175]  The characteristic of the Lord Jesus is His grace, and the characteristic of the Holy Spirit is His fellowship.
[176]  Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."
[177]  There is another thing that the Holy Spirit does and this concerns the Word of God.
[178]  Now we must see how the Holy Spirit conveys the work of the Lord to us.
[179]  The Lord's work includes all that He has done on the cross, in His resurrection, in His ascension, in His second coming, and in everything that He bestows upon us.
[180]  I do not want to enumerate in detail all the items of the Holy Spirit's work of fellowship.
[181]  I will only stress one thing: all of the work of the Lord Jesus is conveyed to us today through the Holy Spirit.
[182]  During the past few days, we have seen that all that man has is sin.
[183]  God has even sent the Holy Spirit to convict and enlighten us and to give us the strength to accept the work of God.
[184]  One of the most well-read and treasured books in the New Testament is the Gospel of John.
[185]  If one reads it carefully, he will see that John wrote this book with no other purpose than to tell us how man can receive life and be saved and how he can be delivered from condemnation.
[186]  The Gospel of John mentions eighty-six times that man receives life, is justified, and does not come into condemnation by faith alone and nothing else.
[187]  Hence, the Bible shows us clearly, adequately, and simply that salvation is not based on who man is, what he has, and what he has done.
[188]  The first question is whether man is saved through faith with the keeping of the law.
[189]  The strange thing is that man takes the law, which is there to prove his sin, to try to prove that he is righteous.
[190]  God wants us to know through the law that we have sinned, but we want to prove through the law that we are righteous.
[191]  Judaism says to the man in the flesh that in keeping the law he shall live.
[192]  But Christianity says he cannot live, for he cannot keep the law.
[193]  The problem today is that we cannot keep the law.
[194]  Please read again Galatians 2:16-17: "And knowing that a man is not justified out of works of law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we also have believed into Christ Jesus that we might be justified out of faith in Christ and not out of the works of law, because out of the works of law no flesh will be justified.
[195]  But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also have been found sinners, is then Christ a minister of sin?
[196]  The book of Galatians shows us that some in Galatia contended that even though man was justified through faith in the Lord Jesus, it was not enough; he still had to keep the law.
[197]  He said that if while seeking to be justified in Christ we have been found sinners, it meant that after we have believed in the Lord Jesus, we are still not justified, that we are still sinners, and must still keep the law before we can be saved.
[198]  "The works of law" is an expression we find in the Bible Gal 2:16 .
[199]  Since He wants to get all the glory, He did not leave one thing for us to do.
[200]  When we reach heaven, we will have to say that we are still helpless persons.
[201]  We are like the younger son in Luke 15.
[202]  One day we came to God and said, "God, give me the share of the estate that falls to me."
[203]  Philippians 2:12 says, "So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
[204]  Many have told us that Paul said explicitly in Philippians that we have to work out our own salvation.
[205]  If we are to work out our salvation, does that not mean that we have to do something?
[206]  There is one thing we have to be clear about.
[207]  It lies in the attitude Christians should have concerning eternal life and the kingdom of the heavens.
[208]  One never sees the questions of marriage and family come into play involving the matter of eternal life.
[209]  But the Gospel of Matthew says that some will not marry for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens.
[210]  God shows us that salvation is by faith and not by works.
[211]  Yet some who do not understand the words of the Bible have come to me, asking, "Is it not true that the book of James tells us clearly that a man is not justified by faith, but by works?
[212]  Verse 14 says, "What is the profit, my brothers, if anyone says he has faith, but does not have works?"
[213]  Notice that James does not say that this man has faith in God.
[214]  "If a brother or sister is without clothing and lacks daily food, and any one of you says to them..."
[215]  If you encounter a poor brother or sister and would not give all that you have to help him and care for him, but would only say that you believe for him and that he can go in peace if that is the kind of faith you exercised when you believed in the Lord Jesus, would such a faith save you?
[216]  Verse 18 says, "But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works."
[217]  If a vain and boastful person keeps on boasting, someone will eventually rise up and say, "You say that you have faith.
[218]  He who makes big promises and speaks empty words appears to have great faith.
[219]  If you have faith, you should take off your coat and let another put it on.
[220]  In verses 21 through 25, two examples are given.
[221]  In Genesis 15 God promised Abraham that He would give him many descendants.
[222]  Verse 22 says, "You see that faith worked together with his works."
[223]  Paul is bold to say that one can have faith alone, without works.
[224]  But James does not dare to say that one should have works alone, without faith.
[225]  If we see a person who believes that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God and that He was crucified for him, and believes in the gospel of God fully, yet will not give up such a business for fear that he would lose his livelihood, we have no way to tell if he is actually saved.
[226]  James was afraid that we would not be clear about the case of Abraham, so in verse 25 we see another illustration.
[227]  Finally, verse 26 says, "For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead."
[228]  Hence, we can say that our spirit is the spirit of our body.
[229]  In the past two messages, we have seen that the way of salvation on man's side is through faith, rather than the law or works.
[230]  Salvation is free, but because man's mind is full of the law and works, he never considers that God would give salvation to him freely.
[231]  The repentance that man talks about simply speaks of one thing: he is not willing to lower himself to the bottom rung.
[232]  He thinks that he should be at least one rung higher before God would grant him salvation.
[233]  The word repentance appears frequently in Revelation 2 and 3 in a particular way.
[234]  Revelation 2:5 says, "Remember therefore where you have fallen from and repent and do the first works; but if not, I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent."
[235]  The work of repentance is similar to the work of the law that we have discussed in the last few messages.
[236]  God's purpose is that man would receive His grace.
[237]  He does not know that he is condemned before God, that he is absolutely useless, and that he is, therefore, unable to receive God's grace.
[238]  Let us study a few passages to see what repentance is.
[239]  Acts 2:37-38 says, "And when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, What should we do, brothers?
[240]  And Peter said to them, Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."
[241]  Prior to this, Peter had said, "Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man shown by God to you to be approved by works of power and wonders and signs, which God did through Him in your midst, even as you yourselves know this man...you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to a cross and killed; whom God has raised up" vv.
[242]  We can now realize that this is a group of people who had received the word of God.
[243]  Since they had believed that much already, the apostle was able to tell them to repent.
[244]  We may ask that if they had indeed believed, why would Peter have said that they must repent and be baptized before their sins could be forgiven and the Holy Spirit be poured out?
[245]  If we say that they had not believed, then why were they so concerned after they heard God's word?
[246]  Acts 26:19-20 says, "Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, but declared both to those in Damascus first and in Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea and to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance."
[247]  If we read these two verses only, we would think that the only thing that Paul was preaching was repentance.
[248]  Paul confessed before King Agrippa's judgment that his work was to cause men to repent and turn to God and do works worthy of repentance.
[249]  But rise up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a minister and a witness both of the things in which you have seen Me and of the things in which I will appear to you; delivering you from the people and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me. Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, but declared both to those in Damascus first and in Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea and to the Gentiles that they should repent." Why do they have to repent? It is because the Lord Jesus has accomplished the work of redemption.
[250]  Another verse tells us that repentance is not only related to faith but is related to salvation as well.
[251]  Acts 5:31 says, "This One God has exalted to His right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins."
[252]  When we heard the preachers telling us of the evilness and loathsomeness of sin and the redemption of the Lord Jesus, we wanted to repent and believe in Jesus.
[253]  We were not sitting in a corner, telling ourselves how corrupted we were or what sinners we were.
[254]  Even if we were to repeat this over and over again, this speaking would not make us feel that we were sinners.
[255]  We have seen in the past few evenings that the way for a person to be saved is not through law-keeping, good works, or repentance.
[256]  Let me first say a few words lest you think that I do not believe in confession or restitution.
[257]  There are another two verses which seem even more obvious than 1 John 1:9.
[258]  They are Matthew 3:5 and 6, which say, "At that time Jerusalem and all Judea and all the surrounding region of the Jordan went out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins."
[259]  You may have heard of the great Welsh revival.
[260]  I had occasion to study in detail reports on that revival.
[261]  There are only three places in the New Testament which record this matter of confession of sins.
[262]  We come now to the third place, which is in Acts 19:18 and 19, which says, "And many of those who had believed came, confessing and making known their practices.
[263]  Let me say a few words concerning the practice of confessing sins.
[264]  We all know whom we have offended and defrauded before we were saved.
[265]  We come now to the fifth "not being."
[266]  They base their claim on Romans 10: "Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved" v. 13 . As a result, some believe that they must beseech God before they can be saved.
[267]  Second, man thinks that he must pray and plead before he can be saved because he simply does not realize that the Lord Jesus has come; He has died and resurrected, all of sin's problems are solved, and all obstacles to salvation are removed.
[268]  He came to make manifest in man what God and the Lord Jesus have accomplished.
[269]  It is absolutely impossible for a man to obtain the righteousness out of the law, because it requires him to be sinless in his thoughts, intentions, words, and behavior for every year, hour, minute, and second of his life from the time he was born.
[270]  If he breaks any one item of the law, he transgresses the whole.
[271]  Paul continued to define the meaning of "in your mouth" and "in your heart" in verse 9 by saying, "If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."
[272]  Each one of us has brought our mouth to this place.
[273]  Although the Word of God is abundantly clear, there are still those who like to argue against it.
[274]  They insist that confession is the way to be saved.
[275]  I wish to ask them, "If so, what will you do with Romans 10:8: 'The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart'?"
[276]  We have seen the problems God encountered when He prepared this salvation for us and how He completely solved all the problems of sin.
[277]  Although John 3 and other places may say what we have said, some may ask: "What about Luke 10?"
[278]  If that is the case, I would ask if any one of us has ever loved God this way, that is, with our whole heart, our whole soul, our whole strength, and our whole mind.
[279]  There is no one who loves God with his whole heart, his whole soul, his whole strength, and his whole mind.
[280]  Since the Lord said that he had to love the Lord his God with his whole heart, his whole soul, his whole strength, and his whole mind and to love his neighbor as himself, it would have been awkward for him to ask who God was.
[281]  The word about loving God with our whole heart, soul, strength, and mind, and loving our neighbor as ourself is not to help us to inherit eternal life.
[282]  It is only to show us the kind of persons we are.
[283]  If you have never heard a word about loving God, you would not know how important it is to love God.
[284]  If you have never heard anything about loving your neighbor, you would not know how important it is to love your neighbor.
[285]  This Samaritan came purposely to this half-dead man.
[286]  When he saw the man, he was moved with compassion, and he saved him with two things.
[287]  All the metals in the Bible have their meanings.
[288]  Finally, we have verse 37: "And he said, The one who showed mercy to him."
[289]  He answered that it is the One who showed mercy to him.
[290]  Some people say that a man cannot be saved without being baptized.
[291]  What is the difference between being saved and not coming into condemnation?
[292]  Please remember that condemnation is something strictly before God, but salvation is relative; it is something before God and something before man as well.
[293]  Whether I am condemned or not is a matter before God.
[294]  But whether I am saved or not has to do with God and has to do also with man.
[295]  Salvation is toward God and man; condemnation is strictly toward God.
[296]  I have said that baptism refers to a man's coming out of Adam and into Christ.
[297]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE WAY OF SALVATION FAITH GOD'S SALVATION BEING FOR EVERYONE
[298]  Over the past few evenings, we have looked at the things that man considers to be ways of salvation.
[299]  If we do not twist the Word of God but trust in it, we will see from it that none of those things are a condition for salvation.
[300]  In America there was a famous preacher named Dr.
[301]  I have used an illustration before, which I will use again for the sake of the many new ones with us.
[302]  If I have sinned, I should go to jail.
[303]  If we think that it is, we are wrong.
[304]  There is another matter related to faith in God's Word.
[305]  Perhaps you may ask, "Why would the Holy Spirit communicate to us all of God's work in His Word when we believe in this Word?"
[306]  The words in 1 John that we just read tell us what faith is.
[307]  Now we have to see how we have to believe.
[308]  At the same time, in the whole New Testament, there is only one place that tells us how to believe Mark 11:24: "For this reason I say to you, All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them."
[309]  If you ask someone if he has believed in the Lord Jesus and if he has been saved, and if he tells you that he hopes to be saved, then he surely is not saved.
[310]  Those who have faith do not need to pray.
[311]  In the last few messages, we saw that there is a distinction between sin and sins in man.
[312]  We saw how God loves us and gives His grace to us, how His grace is manifested in His righteousness, how the Lord Jesus has accomplished all the work for us, and what His death and resurrection have done.
[313]  All of the readers of the New Testament know that we are saved by grace.
[314]  Why does God have to give us eternal life?
[315]  Why does He have to give us the gift in His Son?
[316]  Most have probably read John 3:16 which says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life."
[317]  If while we were yet sinners, God loved us to such an extent that He gave us the life of His Son, is it possible that after we become Christians and are weak and short of God's glory that He would reject us?
[318]  Second, is our salvation an accident or a purposeful act of God?
[319]  Or is God purposefully seeking to find a man to whom He can give money?
[320]  It is a simple thing for us to make a decision because we change so easily.
[321]  One minute we can be in heaven, and the next minute we can be in hell.
[322]  The God whom we know and whom we worship cannot change what He has decided.
[323]  The Bible says that God is eternal; He is not like us, having a beginning without an ending.
[324]  He says that He is the beginning and the ending.
[325]  The third point that we need to consider is the salvation that God has given us.
[326]  What has God done for us, and what has He given us?
[327]  But the strange thing is that our relationship with Him begins with regeneration and ends with eternal life.
[328]  After Adam ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, God drove him from the garden of Eden and guarded the way to the tree of life with the cherubim and the flaming sword that turned every way v. 24 . Why did God have to surround the entrance to the tree of life with the flaming sword and the cherubim? Why did He not allow Adam to eat of the fruit of the tree of life? Genesis 3:22 says, "And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever." Here we see a picture.
[329]  When we were saved, not only did God regenerate us and give us eternal life; He made us one spirit with the Lord.
[330]  First Corinthians tells us that we have not only become one spirit with Christ, but we have become members of His Body 12:27 .
[331]  Hence, when an unbeliever is saved, not only has he received regeneration and eternal life from God, but he at the same time is joined to the Body of Christ to become a member of the Body of Christ.
[332]  If God saves us one by one in Christ, and if Christ died for us, washed away our sins, gave us eternal life, and caused us to have a life relationship with Him to become His members, what is our end?
[333]  When the individual Christians come together before God, they become a temple.
[334]  Every Christian is like a stone, and the church is the spiritual house that God is building.
[335]  Every Christian is a small stone built upon the Lord Jesus to become the temple of God and the habitation of God.
[336]  What does it mean for a Christian to have the Holy Spirit as the seal?
[337]  How does God know who belongs to Him and who does not?
[338]  The Bible says that we should not grieve the Holy Spirit Eph 4:30 .
[339]  Grief is the expression of love; anger is the expression of hate.
[340]  Last evening we saw a number of things that God has already done.
[341]  On the one hand, God puts His Holy Spirit in us as the seal to prove that we belong to God; on the other hand, God puts His Holy Spirit in us as the pledge, that we may know that whatever God will give us is guaranteed.
[342]  If a person were to lose his salvation after his believing in the Lord Jesus, what would he do with God's collateral?
[343]  For instance, I have a house which rents for fifty dollars a month.
[344]  Seventh, there is another reason why we will not lose our salvation.
[345]  In the Bible we see that a relationship exists between the Lord Jesus and God, and a relationship exists between the Lord and us.
[346]  There is a wonderful word in the Bible that says we Christians, the saved sinners, are the gifts given by God to the Lord Jesus John 17:6 .
[347]  We cannot blame only God for giving the Lord Jesus a token favor, but we have to also blame the Lord Jesus for not being able to keep those whom God had given Him.
[348]  In John 17:6, the Lord Jesus said to the Father, "I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world.
[349]  They were Yours, and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word."
[350]  The only reason that you come to the Lord Jesus, that you receive Him as Lord, that you trust in His redemptive work and in His resurrection as your proof of justification, is that God has given you to the Lord Jesus.
[351]  I thank God that formerly I was a sinner.
[352]  I, Watchman Nee, was not asking to be saved.
[353]  But unexpectedly, God brought me through and caused me to accept the word which I had formerly rejected.
[354]  God took me and gave me to the Lord Jesus.
[355]  It is precious to know from the Bible that the Lord Jesus is our offering, but it is more precious to know that He is our High Priest.
[356]  Many times I asked the brothers and sisters in various places what we would do if the Lord Jesus were not our Savior.
[357]  If the Lord Jesus were not our Savior, we would be through; there would be no way for us to be saved.
[358]  The Lord Jesus told us that His prayer is for all those who believe; it is for all those who belong to Him.
[359]  I am not saying that we should forget about the difficult passages in the Bible.
[360]  Suppose I leave a seal with Brother Ma because I have to take care of some matters.
[361]  If Brother Ma loses my seal, whose responsibility is that, mine or Brother Ma's?
[362]  It is true that I am partly wrong for trusting in Brother Ma; but the direct responsibility lies with Brother Ma because I have entrusted my seal to him.
[363]  If I handed myself over to God, and later I were to lose my salvation, indeed I would have made a mistake in trusting God.
[364]  But all who know God have to bow down and say, "We who are being guarded by the power of God through faith will definitely receive the salvation ready to be revealed at the last time."
[365]  No teaching in the Bible can have the sinners as its starting point; all teachings must have the Lord Jesus as the starting point.
[366]  It would be terrible if sinners were taken as the starting point; but if the Lord Jesus is taken as the starting point, things will be clear.
[367]  If we take the sinners as the starting point, the problem of sin will become obscure to us.
[368]  Besides the nine points covered already, there is still another point.
[369]  Of the nine points that have been covered, none can be overthrown by you, or even by God.
[370]  Some may say, "True, others cannot snatch us away, but I myself can go out."
[371]  For one to say this proves that his mind is fallen.
[372]  He does not know God's Word, and he does not know himself.
[373]  There was a Mr. Lin there who had a cat in his house.
[374]  We have seen on the positive side that all the work that God has done and all the grace that He has given us at the time we were saved cannot be annulled by the passage of time.
[375]  Once God has shown mercy to us, we are eternally under His mercy.
[376]  Before we consider some of the problems in the Scriptures, we have to consider one strong objection and doubt that some men raise.
[377]  I once heard an evangelist from Shanghai say that the teaching of "once saved, eternally saved" makes a person irresponsible, loose, and not very watchful.
[378]  One can only make such a statement because he does not fully understand the Word of God.
[379]  But there are many aspects of salvation which are subjective as well.
[380]  Salvation has not only solved the problem of sin before God, it has also solved many other problems inside us.
[381]  If a man thinks that he has received a license and a certificate to sin just because he now knows that he is eternally saved, and if such a one does not feel anything when he sins, has no sense of suffering, I doubt that such a one is a true child of God.
[382]  But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is out of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith."
[383]  Now let us spend some time to consider some portions of the Scriptures that seem to speak of perdition after salvation.
[384]  Before this, we have to know a few things.
[385]  On the one hand, God can never say that His sheep will never perish or lose their eternal life, and on the other hand, tell man that he will perish.
[386]  Hence, in the Bible, free gift and the kingdom are two entirely different things.
[387]  In the coming millennial kingdom, God will reward man in a particular way.
[388]  Let us consider Ezekiel 18:24 and 26, which say, "But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live?
[389]  All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die...When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die."
[390]  Now let us take a look at the New Testament.
[391]  Matthew 24:13 says, "But he who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved."
[392]  Galatians 5:4 says, "You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace."
[393]  When many read this verse, they think that, first, one can be separated from Christ, and second, one can fall from grace.
[394]  But we must realize that the book of Galatians is not on the subject of sin.
[395]  ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT 2 NO TEACHING CONCERNING ETERNAL DEATH
[396]  In this message, we will consider a few more verses.
[397]  First Corinthians 8:11 says in the King James Version, "And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?"
[398]  First Corinthians 8:4 to 7 say, "Concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one.
[399]  For even if there are so-called gods, either in heaven or on earth, even as there are many gods and many lords, yet to us there is one God, the Father, out from whom are all things, and we are unto Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we are through Him.
[400]  But this knowledge is not in all men; but some, being accustomed to the idol until now, eat the food as an idol sacrifice, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled."
[401]  In the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15, the prodigal said, "How many of my father's hired servants abound in bread, but I am perishing here in famine!"
[402]  Perishing here does not refer to the perishing of the soul.
[403]  Hence, this word does not refer only to eternal death, but to the killing of the body and to starvation.
[404]  James 5:19-20 says, "My brothers, if any one among you is led astray from the truth and someone turns him back, let him know that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save that one's soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins."
[405]  Some people also infer from these two verses that a saved person can perish.
[406]  Before we read verse 4, let me first tell you about this introduction.
[407]  Before the apostle wrote verse 4, he anticipated that these ones would ask, "If you say that we should not lay again the foundation, what then should we do if we sin again?
[408]  Please remember that the repentance here is the foundation spoken of in the first section.
[409]  The repentance here does not mean repentance in general, for in the previous verses there are six items of the words of the beginning of the Christ.
[410]  The meaning here is that after a man has believed in God and has been baptized, and after he has understood the coming judgment and the truth of resurrection, and has repented of dead works, he cannot repent again for what he has repented of.
[411]  The next part of verse 6 says, "Crucifying again for themselves the Son of God and putting Him to open shame."
[412]  Some have said that to fall is to crucify the Son of God again.
[413]  Here we have to consider again the four things mentioned in the Bible.
[414]  They are the four things that must be distinguished one from the other, which we mentioned earlier.
[415]  There are more words in the Bible like these.
[416]  They do not refer to the perdition of the saved ones.
[417]  Verse 20 says, "For if, having escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ but having again been entangled in these, they are defeated, the last state has become worse for them than the first."
[418]  Based on the words of verse 20, some have thought that these ones refer to the saved ones, because it says plainly that these ones have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ; surely such ones were saved.
[419]  In this message we will continue to look at the verses which seem to argue against salvation being eternal.
[420]  Second Peter 3:16 says, "As also in all his letters, speaking in them concerning these things, in which some things are hard to understand, which the unlearned and unstable twist, as also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction."
[421]  Some would argue after reading this word that Peter is telling us that Paul's letters were hard to understand, and that some who are unlearned and unstable, that is, untaught and unestablished, bring in their own destruction by twisting Paul's letters.
[422]  The first thing that we need to mention is the word "willfully."
[423]  In Romans 7, Paul says, "For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do" v. 15 . By this we know that Paul did not fall into sin accidentally.
[424]  To us, the sacrifice for sins is the Lord Jesus Christ; He is our sin offering.
[425]  Yet, the Jews were still not clear whether the Lord Jesus Christ or bulls and goats was their sacrifice for sins.
[426]  The Hebrew believers were Jews and had been in Judaism for years.
[427]  Now that they were Christians, if they still wanted to go back to Judaism, if they still wanted both, that is, if they wanted to stand on the ground of Judaism and also wanted to stand on the ground of Christianity, there would no longer remain a sacrifice for sins.
[428]  Therefore, after reading so many verses, we can know the meaning of the verse, "There no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins."
[429]  The portion of Hebrews from chapters seven through ten, with the exception of chapter eight, says that the work of redemption, once finished, is eternally accomplished.
[430]  If you do not want Christ, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins.
[431]  Hence, strictly speaking, this portion is not for us at all.
[432]  If some say that after a man receives the Lord Jesus and sins willfully, he will perish, this will contradict the context of the passage; it will also contradict the entire book of Hebrews.
[433]  Hebrews shows us that besides the name of Jesus Christ, "there is salvation in no other, for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved" Acts 4:12 .
[434]  After receiving the knowledge of the truth, and after having a clear knowledge that the Lord Jesus Christ is the God-ordained sacrifice for sins, if the Jewish believers forsake the assembling of themselves and reject Christ, and if they go back to Judaism to look for other sacrifices for sins, there will no longer remain any sacrifice for sins.
[435]  There is a big difference between punishment and discipline.
[436]  God's disciplining of His children is not His punishment upon them.
[437]  Even when God chastises them, this chastisement is not a punishment, but a discipline.
[438]  Discipline is with a definite goal, which is that we may partake of His holiness, that we may not live foolishly day by day.
[439]  After a Christian believes into the Lord Jesus, although he will never lose his salvation, he may receive severe chastisement from God.
[440]  The Corinthian believers did not respect the Lord's table meeting.
[441]  They did not respect the Body of the Lord, and they treated the Lord's supper loosely.
[442]  Now we want to see the third difference the difference between reward and gift, in other words, the difference between the kingdom and eternal life.
[443]  There are many Christians in the church today who cannot differentiate between the kingdom of the heavens and eternal life.
[444]  Therefore, we do not say that good works are useless.
[445]  However, we do say that good works are useless as far as salvation is concerned.
[446]  Now we need to see on what basis reward is given.
[447]  God's Word says that the reward is given because of work.
[448]  Just as the Bible says clearly that salvation is by faith, in the same way the Bible says clearly that reward is by work.
[449]  In the Bible, whether with the Lord Jesus, or with the apostles, the words they spoke concerning the reward and the kingdom were not spoken lightly, in the same way the gift and eternal life were not spoken of lightly.
[450]  When the Lord Jesus says in the Gospel of John that He gives eternal life to His sheep, He is speaking reality and not some empty words John 10:28 .
[451]  In the sermon on the mount, the Lord mentioned the matter of the reward many times because this portion concerns the kingdom.
[452]  Matthew 5:46 says, "For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?"
[453]  Matthew 6:1-2 says, "But take care not to do your righteousness before men in order to be gazed at by them; otherwise, you have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens.
[454]  Therefore when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be glorified by men.
[455]  Revelation 11:15 says, "And the seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever."
[456]  Verse 18 says, "And the nations became angry, and Your wrath came, and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to give the reward to Your slaves the prophets and to the saints and to those who fear Your name, to the small and to the great."
[457]  This verse clearly shows us that when the Lord becomes King and the kingdom of the world becomes the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, that is the time for giving the reward to the saints, to the small and to the great.
[458]  The time for us to be rewarded is when Christ comes again to execute judgment.
[459]  Peter tells us that judgment begins from the house of God.
[460]  In that day many will say before the Lord, "Was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power?"
[461]  Within one sentence, the phrase "in Your name" is mentioned three times.
[462]  This proves that these ones are the Lord's. The fact that they say, "Lord, Lord," proves that their standing is that of a Christian.
[463]  What the Lord Jesus is saying is this: "Many people are God's children.
[464]  They are saved and are the same as you are.
[465]  Another passage which some misinterpret as referring to perdition actually refers to the losing of the kingdom and the losing of the reward.
[466]  First Corinthians 9:23-27 says, "And I do all things for the sake of the gospel that I may become a fellow partaker of it.
[467]  If we want to receive the prize, what should we do?
[468]  "But I buffet my body and make it my slave."
[469]  The clearest passage in the Bible about the reward is 1 Corinthians 3:14-15: "If anyone's work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward; if anyone's work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved."
[470]  This shows us clearly what a Christian cannot lose and what he can lose.
[471]  We come to 2 Peter 1:10: "Therefore, brothers, be the more diligent to make your calling and selection firm, for doing these things you shall by no means ever stumble."
[472]  If one does not know the truth about selection, he will not see that this refers to the hope of the kingdom being firm.
[473]  CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO HOW GOD DEALS WITH THE BELIEVERS' SINS
[474]  DISCIPLINE IN THE KINGDOM 1 SUFFERING GOD'S DISCIPLINE IN THE COMING AGE
[475]  The Bible tells us that the Lord disciplines us because He loves us Heb 12:6 .
[476]  According to the Word of God, discipline is for cleansing.
[477]  Is this cleansing discipline from God restricted to this age only, or is it found also in the coming age?
[478]  From the Bible we know that death never changes anyone.
[479]  There is a second proof that the slave in Luke 12:45-48 is saved.
[480]  Verses 42-44 say, "And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and prudent steward, whom the master will set over his service to give them their portion of food at the proper time?
[481]  "For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad."
[482]  THE AGE OF THE NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH
[483]  And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
[484]  And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.
[485]  Furthermore, the word Lamb is never mentioned related to the kingdom.
[486]  The throne is of God and of the Lamb 22:1 ; the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of the city 21:22 ; and the Lamb is the lamp of the city 21:23 .
[487]  "But that he shall receive a hundred times as much now at this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions, and in the coming age, eternal life."
[488]  Hence, the eternal life spoken of here is the eternal life in the kingdom.
[489]  The eternal life in the kingdom is obtained through works.
[490]  It is acquired through consecration, through suffering and bearing reproach for the Lord.
[491]  We know that our God is a righteous God.
[492]  In the future, at the judgment seat, He will judge us according to righteousness.
[493]  Luke 6:37 says that if you do not pass sentence on others, sentence will not be passed on you; if you will not judge others, you will not be judged, and if you forgive others, you will be forgiven.
[494]  Verses 1 through 7 are the general words of the Lord.
[495]  The Lord Jesus expanded on this matter to point out that it is not only wrong to stumble others, but it is a serious and grave matter even to stumble yourself.
[496]  Following this, verse 9 says, "And if your eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the Gehenna of fire."
[497]  This shows us that if a saved person does not deal with his lust, he will not be able to enter into life, but will go into eternal fire.
[498]  Tonight I will speak a few frank and serious words.
[499]  No two brothers or two sisters who are at odds with each other can appear in the kingdom together.
[500]  In the coming kingdom, there will only be love and mercy; only those who love and show mercy to one another can be in the kingdom of the heavens.
[501]  If I am involved in an argument with a brother, and if the matter is not dealt with in this age, then in the future, either both of us will be barred from the kingdom, or only one of us will get in. It cannot be that both of us will enter in. It is not possible for us to have a problem with each other and yet reign at the same time in the millennium in the future.
[502]  "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'
[503]  But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart."
[504]  Now let us look at what other places in the Bible say concerning this matter.
[505]  There are similar passages in the Bible that speak of these matters.
[506]  Revelation 2:11 tells us that those who overcome will not be hurt by the second death, and Revelation 20:6 says that one group of people will not die again and that the second death will not have authority over them.
[507]  If such a person leaves the word of the beginning of Christ today and slips and falls, there is no repentance for him.
[508]  He cannot start all over again to believe in the Lord Jesus.
[509]  He has too much history with the Lord already.
[510]  A Christian is likened to a field, and his improper behavior is likened to thorns and thistles.
[511]  Suppose I have a five-acre piece of land.
[512]  Is it possible that after it has been burned by fire, only two acres are left and three acres are gone?
[513]  Concerning the way we study the Bible, I would like to mention a few things.
[514]  First, there is a group of people who believe only in grace.
[515]  If we do not turn today, we will have to wait until we are worthy to enter in. It is true that the Lord Jesus has saved us, but subjectively speaking, if we do not allow the Holy Spirit to work the Lord Jesus into us, God will have to chastise us that we may receive the benefit and be counted worthy to be with Him.
[516]  I am happy in my heart because I can preach the "heresy" of God's Word and I can oppose the "truth" in man's teaching.
[517]  Today we have to be clear before the Lord.
[518]  I do not know what theology is; I do not know what man's word is; I do not know what the tradition of the church is.
[519]  Once a person is clear about the biblical truth, he will see the heresy in Roman Catholicism.
[520]  The Roman Catholic Church takes a few verses and utilizes them for her own purpose.
[521]  But if we know the biblical truth, we will realize that the doctrine of purgatory annuls grace.
[522]  Thank God that, although I am a filthy sinner, through the Lord Jesus I am now saved.
[523]  When I die, I do not have to be purged any further, because salvation is not of me, but of the Lord Jesus.
[524]  We see that the Lord Jesus has offered Himself up once as a sin offering for our sins.
[525]  When the conscience was troubled in the Old Testament, one could always bring another bull or goat to offer a sin offering through the priest.
[526]  It tells us that the blood of bulls and goats did not do a complete job.
[527]  God reckoned that the work of bulls and goats was incomplete according to the conscience, because every time a person's conscience lost its peace, he felt that his sins had not yet been fully taken care of, and there was the need for further offerings.
[528]  The question now is this: What should we do if we sin again?
[529]  Satan will never stop his accusations against the Christians.
[530]  Revelation 12:10 tells us that he accuses the brothers day and night.
[531]  The Lord Jesus does not defend us by saying that the temptation was too great and as little children we could not handle it, and that therefore God has to grant us grace.
[532]  The work of the Lord Jesus as Advocate is for Christians.
[533]  WALKING IN THE LIGHT AS HE IS IN THE LIGHT
[534]  "But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin."
[535]  It is true that the Lord Jesus is presenting His blood and His accomplished work before God continually.
[536]  The apostle did not say that confession is praying that God would forgive our sins.
[537]  Confession means that we stand on the same ground as God does, admitting before God that our deed is indeed a sin.
[538]  There is a kind of cleansing in the Old Testament which is a type of the forgiveness of believers in the New Testament.
[539]  All offerings are for God, and thus their blood is to be poured out.
[540]  This is the only sacrifice whose blood is first sprinkled directly before the tabernacle and then burnt up.
[541]  This is a heifer, a female cow, signifying that this sacrifice was offered up for believers.
[542]  That means it is offered up for the redemption of sin.
[543]  Ashes are the final state of everything in the world.
[544]  I am not referring to the facts of chemistry, but to our everyday experience.
[545]  They are put into the living water Num 19:17 and become the water for impurity.
[546]  In Numbers 19 God shows us that if a man touches a dead body, he is defiled and must cleanse himself with the ashes of the red heifer.
[547]  John 13:3-10 says, "Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands and that He had come forth from God and was going to God, rose from supper and laid aside His outer garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself; then He poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.
[548]  Peter said to Him, Lord, do You wash my feet?
[549]  Jesus answered and said to him, What I am doing you do not know now, but you will know after these things.
[550]  Although we Christians are bathed once only, the Bible shows us that foot-washing happens many times.
[551]  Do not think that it is enough to have a bath once and be cleansed by the blood of the Lord once.
[552]  Do not think that we can get by loosely when we are defiled by the dirt on our way through the world.
[553]  The Lord said that if our feet are not washed, we will have no part with Him.
