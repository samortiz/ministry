<p>Everyone has an opinion, unless he is a stone. It is impossible not to have an opinion, and opinions have their place. We are pretending when we withhold our opinion. However, we must express our opinions appropriately and at the right time, or they will generate unnecessary problems. It is best to wait a day before we express an opinion so that we can be sure that we feel peaceful about expressing it. If we do not have the peace, we should not express our opinion; rather, we should wait until we have the peace.</p>
<p>When responding to mail, I often put my letter in an envelope without sealing it. Sometimes I wait two days before I mail a letter, and during the night I consider whether my wording was appropriate and my answers were proper. This is a great protection. I may wait even three days before mailing certain letters. During this time I pray and ask the Lord whether the decisions I made in the letter were correct. It is not wrong for us to have opinions, but we should not be too quick to express them. It is best to wait for some time. The Lord&rsquo;s Spirit will lead us inwardly, and we may even receive a confirmation in the environment.</p>
<p>We may feel that something is right and good, but if we are too quick to express our opinion, we may get a wrong result. According to a proverb, we should hold back half a sentence and not speak it even though what we want to say is at the tip of our tongue. Another proverb says, &ldquo;Diseases enter through the mouth, and misfortunes issue from the mouth.&rdquo; Proverbs 10:19 says, &ldquo;When there are many words transgression does not cease, / But he who restrains his lips is prudent.&rdquo; If we do not exercise restraint when expressing our opinions, we will get into trouble. We should, therefore, do our best not to speak too much, and we should not speak too quickly.</p>
<p>A co-worker who does not speak is being pretentious, or he is being a politician instead of a faithful, coordinating member of the Body of Christ. Members who coordinate faithfully must speak the truth and say what they have seen. However, they should be careful when they express themselves. For example, if we have an opinion while we are in a meeting with others, it is best for us to express it slowly or not at all. Most of the time we are wrong when we express our opinion quickly. Therefore, instead of expressing our opinion, it is best to wait. However, if we are clear, we should speak, but we should not be abrasive in our tone. Our speech should be seasoned with salt (Col. 4:6).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SISTERS NEEDING TO STAND FIRMLY<br />
IN THE POSITION OF A SISTER</h2>
<p>In their fellowship the brothers said that some sisters are too strong. Strong sisters are a lesson to the brothers. Our way of dealing with any situation is the cross. In Genesis 45, when Joseph&rsquo;s brothers were returning to Jacob, Joseph charged them not to quarrel on the way (v. 24). To quarrel is to argue, and when we argue, we express our opinion. The best way to overcome our opinions is to refrain from speaking, no matter how strong and stubborn others may be. The sisters may be strong when they express their opinions, but after two hours they are no longer strong.</p>
<p>However, the sisters need to remember that they are sisters. The Bible says that the man is the head of the woman (1 Cor. 11:3). Hence, the sisters must always remember that no matter how strong they may be physically, they are still sisters. Therefore, they should be gentle and exercise restraint when they speak. Instead of speaking eight sentences, they should speak only five. If the sisters can also lower their tone when they speak, others will not feel that they are too strong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BROTHERS TAKING THE LEAD<br />
BUT NOT LORDING IT OVER OTHERS</h2>
<p>Some brothers are faithful and diligent to take the lead. Sometimes they are not polite in their dealings with those around them, because they want everything to be perfect. This can cause them to be controlling and to rule over other saints. However, according to the Bible, the elders should only oversee; they should not lord it over others (1 Pet. 5:1-3). Hence, the brothers should only oversee and not rule over the saints. To rule over others is to lord it over them, to exercise lordship, and to enslave the saints. These things are wrong.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the sisters should cover their heads; on the other hand, the brothers need to take the lead. However, the brothers should lead the saints without ruling over them. The Bible says that the brothers should take the lead, and the Bible also says that the sisters are weaker vessels (3:7). The brothers must always be considerate of the sisters as weaker vessels, because they have weaknesses that the brothers do not have. Their weaknesses are according to God&rsquo;s creation. Hence, it is good for the brothers to consider how the sisters were created when they touch any matter related to the sisters. Even though the sisters are also human beings, they are different from brothers. They are different in their constitution and their nature. The brothers should not deal with the sisters as if they are dealing with brothers. In everything the brothers do, they must recognize that the sisters are weaker vessels.</p>
<p>We can hit a board of wood many times without breaking it; however, a pane of glass will break the first time we hit it. In the same way, it does not matter if a brother hits me, because I will not break. However, when we deal with a sister, we must first know her condition before speaking with her. In conclusion, it is proper for the brothers to take the lead, but it is wrong for them to assume the headship. There is only one Head&mdash;our Lord Jesus.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> </body></html>
