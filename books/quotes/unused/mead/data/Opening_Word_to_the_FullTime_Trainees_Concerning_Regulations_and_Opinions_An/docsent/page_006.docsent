   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AN OPENING WORD TO THE FULL-TIME TRAINEES CONCERNING REGULATIONS AND OPINIONS MESSAGE TWO OLDNESS AND OPINIONS VERSUS REVELATION AND OBEDIENCE Scripture Reading: Acts 10:9-16; 18:24-28; 19:1-5; 1 Cor 16:12; Acts 15:36-41</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous message, we saw that life grows by regulation toward maturity and function.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all have to realize that the proper regulation comes from revelation, and this kind of regulation that comes from revelation always brings us into the proper obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Regulation comes from revelation, and revelation brings us into obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only one kind of obedience can be counted worthy in the eyes of God, and that is the obedience that comes out of revelation cf.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Acts 26:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let us consider the case of Saul of Tarsus, who became the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was a strong character.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was not so easy to bring him to the right track.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The proper obedience is to get on the right track.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, he got on the right track, and that was his obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His obedience was not through man's doing, teaching, exhortation, or advice but through the heavenly revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the way to Damascus, he was met by the Lord, and he not only heard but also saw something Acts 9:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He later told us in Galatians that at that time a revelation came to him to reveal God's Son into him 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He did not just experience a kind of outward view, but something got into him as an inner revelation that knocked him down, that subdued him, that restricted him and got him on the right track.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this message I want to talk with you about oldness and opinions versus revelation and obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Throughout my many years in the Lord's service, in the Lord's ministry, I have seen many cases of oldness and even more cases of opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the church life among the saints, opinions are more prevalent than oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Oldness is terrible, but opinions are much more common among human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every human being is a constitution of opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All of us were born sinful and have been constituted with opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though it has been a while since you have been regenerated, your constitution still is probably full of opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE TROUBLE WITH ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The book of Acts tells us that the early church passed through a number of troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first trouble the church faced was the falsehood of a couple, Ananias and Sapphira 5:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They lied to the Holy Spirit, to the church, and to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They were judged for this sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE TROUBLE CAUSED BY LANGUAGE DIFFERENCES</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The second trouble was due to the matter of language.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some Jews who spoke Greek, the Hellenistic Jews, began to murmur 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This trouble was caused by language differences.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE TROUBLE OF PETER'S OLDNESS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The third trouble was with Peter due to his oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was the top one used by the Lord at his time, and he was the leading one both in the church life and in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was such a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when we read chapter ten of Acts, we realize that Peter was somewhat short, and his shortage was due to his oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was holding on to his old understanding of God's way because he was born, raised up, and taught as a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As Peter was praying, a trance came upon him and he saw a vision of a great sheet descending from heaven, full of unclean animals vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>9-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A voice came to him, saying, "Rise up, Peter; slay and eat!" v. 13 . This was not a voice that came from Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was a voice that came from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No doubt, Peter realized it was the voice of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But he still dared to tell the Lord something vice versa.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was so bold to talk to the Lord in a debating way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord said, "Slay and eat" and he said, "By no means, Lord" v. 14 . Peter was a bold one, but he was not bold in the right thing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord spoke this to him three times, but he did not let the Lord get through.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was stubborn in his oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without such a record in Acts 10, you could not imagine that Peter would be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He loved the Lord to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not forget that when he was debating with the Lord, he was not doing anything sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was on the housetop praying.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As such a godly person who was so much in the spirit, he was exercising to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was in such a good condition and atmosphere, yet there was the disobedience with him due to his oldness.</S>
