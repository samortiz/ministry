   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It will be the same in the coming kingdom, as prophesied in the book of Malachi: He will sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi and purge them like gold and like silver, and they will offer to Jehovah a sacrifice in righteousness.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Desiring this rich, fertile land, Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh begged Moses to give it to them.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the two and a half tribes had not gone on to fight for the rest of the land, they would not have been just.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, Gad provided the first part of the land for himself, and there a portion was reserved for the lawgiver.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This prophecy was fulfilled when Moses, the lawgiver, was buried there Deut 32:48-52; 34:1-6 .</S>
