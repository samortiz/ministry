<h2 class="head1">PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO QUALITY<br />THAN TO QUANTITY</h2><p>Greetings in the Lord to my elder brother, Cheng-hua:</p><p>I have read your letter and deeply feel that your word concerning the importance of quality over quantity is very important. When I was preaching the gospel in Tsingtao, I felt that there was no need to pull in so many. A great outward appearance with no inward reality harms the church. I am before the Lord in prayer! It would be a great blessing indeed for the brothers and sisters in Tsingtao to be graced by the Lord and be brought into the way of life. I feel that it is right for outward activities to cease. If they abound instead, they will only become hindrances. I have paid much attention to the cross in the past and feel that the cross has not worked deeply enough among us (in Tsingtao)! The separation of the soul and the spirit and our knowledge of the Lord are too insufficient! Thank the Lord! He has sent you here to Tsingtao. Many of the co-workers rejoiced at this. Emmanuel!</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Chang Tze-jieh<br />July 9, 1948</p><h2 class="head1">GOD OPENING A DOOR<br />FOR THE GOSPEL IN CHI MOUNTAIN</h2><p>I am preaching the gospel here in the Lord's name. Apart from individually preaching in homes on the Lord's Day on Hulu Island, there are already two home meetings. (Twenty to thirty people attend each meeting.) In addition to these meetings, there are also three or four meetings on the Lord's Day. God has recently opened a door for us in the Battlefield Hospital and the Railroad Hospital in Chi Mountain (between Hulu Island and Jinxi, twenty Chinese miles from Jinxi). May the Lord grant us mercy and grace.</p><p>If any brother or sister is coming to the Northeast, please send me a letter of introduction so that I can serve him or her before the Lord with hospitality and fellowship to fulfill my function as a member of the Body.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Lo Shi-ren<br />July 31, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: Chinese Farmers' Bank, Jinxi, Liaoning</p>
