   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ephesians 2 does not stop at the teaching that salvation is of grace and through faith; it goes on to teach about the nature of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"This" salvation is first "not of yourselves; it is the gift of God"; and second "not of works that no one should boast" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"This" refers to the great grace of salvation because the previous sentence speaks of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are also two types of "not" in salvation: first it is not of ourselves, and second it is not of works.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How clear this is!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Notice that salvation is not of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It does not matter whether you think you are more intelligent than others or more ignorant than others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It does not matter whether your morality is above others or below others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It does not matter whether you are very rich or penniless.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These things have nothing to do with your salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you receive God's grace, whether you are wise or foolish, moral or immoral, you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you do not receive, no matter what kind of person you are, you will still perish.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Salvation is not based on your condition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is based on God's free gift.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Salvation is not of works either.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It does not depend on what kind of person you are, or your conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God did not say that those who do good will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God said that salvation is not of works.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You cannot be saved even if you are the best person on earth, and neither can you perish because you may be the worst person on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Perdition or salvation do not depend on your work, but on whether or not you will accept God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>My dear sinners, do not consider all your goodness!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consider rather your sins!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why would you not come before God with a contrite heart, confessing that you are a sinner, that you have no goodness to boast of, no merit to depend on, and trust solely in the grace that God has given you through the cross of His Son?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I invite you to come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While you are reading this, please kneel down and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Tell God that you will now receive the Lord Jesus as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ask Him to forgive your sins, and be a saved person!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why will God not save man according to his works?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are many reasons, but one is "that no one should boast" 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If man is saved by his works, he will surely boast in himself and not give glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The greatest sin of man is to forsake God, to be independent, not trusting in God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The same is true with respect to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why would someone want to be saved by his own works and not by the salvation that God has prepared?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The reason is man's pride.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How humbling it is for one to trust in God!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is nothing for that one to boast in!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Man wants to be saved through his own works so that he can boast in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But God does not want man to be saved this way, for He does not want man to boast in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If one can boast in himself, his salvation is not the true salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let us look at another passage of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us" Titus 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After reading this verse, we see that even if we think that we have done much righteousness, God will not save us because of it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do we really have any righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"For all of us became like him who is unclean, / And all our righteousnesses are like a soiled garment" Isa 64:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We think that our righteousnesses are worth much.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But in God's eyes, they are nothing!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If God is to save us according to our righteousness, we would all perish because all our righteousnesses, without exception, are as filthy rags.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What kind of righteousness can this be considered as?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How can it save us?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Can God save us by our filthy, rag-like righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No. No. Thank God that He has given us His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He saved us because He has mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He did not save us because of our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If He saved according to our righteousness, none of us would be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot be saved through good works!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The meaning of mercy is to give grace to a person who does not deserve it, despite his unworthiness, and to do so through love.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We were the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How could we have deserved God's salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yet He has loved us without a reason.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He passed over our sins and caused the Lord Jesus to die for us on the cross, bestowing grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"According to His mercy He saved us" Titus 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, readers, do not think that you can be saved by your good works!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You should hurry to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He does not want you to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He wants to save you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He will save you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You do not have to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You only have to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Although you have not done any good and although you are most sinful, His crucifixion on the cross was a substitutionary death for you to redeem you from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He has borne your evil works and the sin of your evil works.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You can now come just as you are before Him, in your condition of failure in doing good works.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Receive Him as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He will save you.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He will receive you, and He will change you.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Perhaps you are a so-called member of a church already.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Perhaps you have been baptized and have been received into the Holy Communion.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Perhaps you are a leader of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But you should know that none of these will save you.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you do not believe in the Savior who has died for you and has borne your sins, whatever good you have done and whatever position you occupy will not change you from being a perishing man.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You are still no different from anyone else!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Before God, nothing will shelter a man from the wrath of God except the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Any kind of good work will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Only the saving work of the cross of the Lord Jesus is trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Every way to salvation that depends on your own work is from the bottomless pit and is destined for hell.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God has established only one way of salvation, which is to accept the grace which comes from the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There is no other way to be saved than to take God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Finally, let me read you one verse from the Scriptures, "I do not nullify the grace of God; for if righteousness is through law, then Christ has died for nothing" Gal 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Salvation does not come through good works.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If a man can be saved through good works, then Christ has died in vain!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If a man can satisfy God's heart by doing good himself, God would not have been so foolish as to send His Son to the world to die in vain and give up His life for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you think that doing good will help you be saved, you are nullifying the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Sinners, God may be foolish, but He is still wiser than you.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If a man can be saved by good works, God would surely not have given up His Son in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Since He has caused His Son to die for us and bear our sins, this proves that we cannot do good and cannot be saved by doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He has established the way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If you will receive the Lord Jesus as the Savior, you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Alas, we are truly sinners!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>God indeed loves us!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He is willing to receive us!</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Though we have no goodness to boast of and no righteousness to call our own, His salvation does not diminish.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>On the contrary, it is made more manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I wish that His love would touch you to come to Him in faith, saying, "O God!</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>I am truly a sinner!</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I know that none of my good works are worth anything before You.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I pray that You will receive me and save me because of the substitutionary death of the Savior Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>"Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out" John 6:37 .</S>
