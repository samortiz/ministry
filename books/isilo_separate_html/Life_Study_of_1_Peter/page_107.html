It may refer to Peter&rsquo;s wife, who traveled with him (1 Cor. 9:5), or to a prominent sister in the Lord, who had been co-chosen by God not only with the receivers of this Epistle, but also with Peter and all the other believers. Some suppose that it refers to the church.</p><p>Through the centuries the great teachers have held two different interpretations of the name Babylon as used in 5:13: one is figurative, referring to Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire; the other literal, referring to Babylon, a large city on the Euphrates. The reasons for the latter are more logical than for the former. First, it seems that Peter had no reason to use a figurative name to hide the city of his whereabouts. Second, all the names he used for the places in the address of his Epistle (1:1) were literal. Third, in the New Testament the name Rome is clearly mentioned (Acts 19:21; 28:14, 16; Rom. 1:7, 15), at least up to the time when Paul&rsquo;s last Epistle, 2 Timothy, was written (2 Tim. 1:17), probably after 1 Peter. It is when John&rsquo;s Revelation, a book of figures, was written, about A.D. 90, that the figurative name Babylon the Great was used for the city of Rome (Rev. 17:5; 18:2).</p><h2 class="head1">MARK, PETER&rsquo;S SON</h2><p>The name Mark in verse 13 refers to John Mark (Acts 12:12, 25), the writer of the Gospel of Mark. As Peter&rsquo;s spiritual son, he was there in Babylon with him. Later he was taken to Paul by Timothy (2 Tim. 4:11).</p><h2 class="head1">PETER&rsquo;S GREETINGS</h2><p>In 5:14 Peter concludes, &ldquo;Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ.&rdquo; At the beginning of this Epistle Peter says, &ldquo;Grace to you and peace be multiplied.&rdquo; At the end he says, &ldquo;Peace to you all who are in Christ.&rdquo; Peace results from grace; it issues from the enjoyment of the Triune God. Such enjoyment of God as the multiplying and multiplied grace (1:2), the varied grace (4:10), the all grace (5:10), and the true grace (5:12) as the reality of the contents of the Christian life under the government of God issues and results in a condition of peace with both God and man.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s writing is not at all superficial. It is deep in truth and very experiential. We see this even in what Peter says regarding peace. Peter&rsquo;s understanding of peace is deep. However, most Christians today think of peace in a very shallow way.</p><p>According to 5:14, Peter&rsquo;s desire is that peace be with all who are in Christ. Peter stresses the fact that the believers are in Christ (3:16; 5:10). It is of God and through our faith and baptism that we are in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30; John 3:5; Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:3). This results in an organic union with the Triune God (Matt. 28:19) and makes us one spirit with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_106.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
