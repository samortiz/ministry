THE UNVEILING OF CHRIST<br>AS THE WONDERFUL ONE</H2><P>In 9:6-7 we see the unveiling of Christ as the wonderful One.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Child Being Born to Us,<br>a Son Being Given to Us</H2><P>Isaiah 9:6a says, "For a child is born to us,/A son is given to us." Once again, this involves the sign of a virgin conceiving and bearing a son. In 9:6 the child born to us is both human and divine, and the son given to us is divine. Without the birth of the human and divine child, there would have been no way for God to give His divine Son to us. The divine Son was given (John 3:16) through the birth of the human child.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Government Being upon His Shoulders</H2><P>Isaiah 9:6b tells us that "the government/Is upon His shoulders." This means that the divine administration is upon the shoulders of this child who is born and this son who is given.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. His Name Being Called Wonderful Counselor,<br>Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace</H2><P>Isaiah 9:6c says, "His name will be called/Wonderful Counselor,/Mighty God,/Eternal Father,/Prince of Peace." In translating this verse, it is difficult to decide whether a comma should be inserted between the words Wonderful and Counselor. As the human and divine child born and the divine Son given, Christ is the Wonderful Counselor, and He is also Wonderful (Judg. 13:18) and the Counselor. Furthermore, He is the Mighty God (Rom. 9:5), the Eternal Father (Isa. 63:16), and the Prince of Peace (Eph. 2:14). Every item of what Christ is is wonderful. We can never exhaust our telling of what He is. He is the wonder in the entire universe; thus, He is wonderful.</P><P>Christ is wonderful mainly in His being the Counselor. I can testify that I experienced Him as such a Counselor when I was imprisoned in China by the Japanese invading army. During the month of my imprisonment, I was examined twice daily. Each examination and trial lasted about three hours. I was asked many difficult questions. As I was considering how to answer these questions, I looked to the Lord for His counsel. As He gave me counsel, I experienced Him as the Wonderful Counselor.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. To the Increase of His Government<br>and to His Peace There Being No End</H2><P>Isaiah 9:7 says, "To the increase of His government/And to His peace there is no end,/Upon the throne of David/And over His kingdom,/To establish it/And to uphold it/In justice and righteousness/From now unto eternity./The zeal of Jehovah of hosts/Will accomplish this." From the time, in Genesis 11, when mankind gave up God as their governor and made themselves the governors, the matter of government has been a great problem to man. But when the restoration comes, Christ will be the unique Governor, and the government of the Triune God will be upon His shoulders. This government will increase and fill every corner of this earth.</P><P>The increase of Christ's government and His peace will have no end. Peace is a sign that justice and righteousness are present. In the new heaven and new earth, everything will be just and right (2 Pet. 3:13). When Christ becomes Governor of this earth, the earth will be full of peace.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> </body></html>
