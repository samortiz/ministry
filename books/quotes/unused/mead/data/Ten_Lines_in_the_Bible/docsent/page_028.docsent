   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE LINE OF GOD S COVENANTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s covenants with man is a very special and important line in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ever since man was created, God has stood on the ground of a covenant in His dealings with man; these covenants with man are written in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible which has sixty-six books is a record of God s covenants with man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the Bible is also referred to as the Old and New Testaments, or the old and new covenants, which shows the importance of God s covenants in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is quite extraordinary that other religious writings are not called a covenant; only the Christian Bible is called a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Other religious writings talk about religious teachings, religious rules, and religious regulations, but only the Bible is a covenant made by God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Unlike common religious writings which center on teachings, rules, and regulations, the Holy Bible is centered on covenants, covering all the covenants that God has made with man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The words which we normally speak are not considered a covenant, but once words are formalized on a legal basis and bound by law, the words are called a contract or a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, when we discuss some matters with others in a casual way, our words are merely words that cannot be regarded as a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, if we are engaging in important business, we must put our words, the terms and conditions, and all the details into formal writing based on law and restricted by law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then these words become a contract, a covenant, between us and the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A covenant is a set of words that are more than just ordinary words; they are formal words with a legal basis and which are bound by law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We make contracts because we want to strengthen our credibility.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ordinary words may be unreliable and questionable, but when they are turned into a contract or a covenant, they are more trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Chinese word for contract or covenant also means binding ; in other words, a contract is something that binds people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once we put our words into a contract, we are bound by the words, and we must fulfill the terms of the contract.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Bible all of God s covenants with man reveal His desire toward man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every covenant fully discloses what man s position is in relation to God s desire, what God is doing in man, what God expects of man, and even the things that God has done for man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s desire toward man becomes a covenant because He swears by a solemn oath and explains His desire to man in very formal words.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This may be likened to the negotiation between two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When two parties negotiate about a certain matter, they do not speak to one another in a common, casual, and light manner.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, they speak formally and solemnly in relation to their legal standing so that there is a legal basis and the binding of law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Consequently, they have a responsibility to fulfill what they have spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Likewise, God expresses His desire toward man in a covenant as a way to provide a guarantee to man and to establish His credibility so that man would trust in Him and be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Please remember that the Bible is a book of the revelation of God s desire toward man; it is full of God s words, and these words fully explain God s desire toward man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When God spoke, however, He did not speak with ordinary words but with covenanting words.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He spoke with His own immovable faithfulness as the guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These words became covenants under the binding of law, being bound by His faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since the Bible is a book of God s covenants with man, these covenants are a great and central line in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to understand the Bible, we must find the line of these covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this overview, there are nine obvious covenants in the Bible, and among these there are two especially great ones, commonly known as the old covenant and the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of course, these do not refer to the Old Testament and the New Testament of the Bible, but to the two great covenants shown in the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Old Testament is so named because it contains a great covenant, which was a previous covenant that became old and has been abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Likewise, the New Testament is so named because it particularly speaks of a new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although one covenant has passed away, another covenant still exists.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The former covenant is considered an old covenant, and the current covenant is considered a new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a great subject, but we can only touch upon it briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Of these nine covenants, some are clearly pointed out in the Bible as covenants, but some are not pointed out so clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, God made a covenant with Noah twice, and the Bible plainly states that God made a covenant with Noah in both instances.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But there are other instances where the covenants are not plainly identified, even though they are God s covenants with man in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, in 2 Samuel 7 the covenant God made with David is not spoken of as a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was not until long afterward, during the captivity of the children of Israel, when someone wrote Psalm 89, recalling the incident of God s speaking to David in 2 Samuel 7, that it is referred to as a covenant with David.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although it was not plainly called a covenant at the time, it later was recognized as a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The words to David were very formal, based on law and bound by law, so they also were a covenant with man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now that we have clearly defined this principle, we can find nine instances in the Bible where God spoke to man in such a formal way; in other words, God made nine covenants with man.</S>
