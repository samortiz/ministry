   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. To Bear with Them</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's Dwelling, the Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of the Testimony with the Ark of the Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the priestly army carrying out the holy war, God's chosen and redeemed people bore with them God's dwelling, the tabernacle of the testimony with the ark of the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that in the church life today we are bearing God's testimony with God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Upon our shoulder we not only have God's dwelling place but also the dweller, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As long as the church bears the testimony of God, the church is God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, the dwelling place of God is the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today, this testimony of God, this dwelling place of God, is upon our shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Tabernacle of the Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Signifying God's Chosen and Redeemed People</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Built Up with Him as His Dwelling on the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The tabernacle of the testimony signifies God's chosen and redeemed people built up with Him as His dwelling on the earth the church in the New Testament .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here we would point out that, spiritually speaking, the history of Israel and the history of the church are one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The history of Israel is a prefigure, and the history of the church is the reality of the prefigure.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that what is recorded in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers prefigures what is recorded in Acts and in the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Ark of the Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Signifying Christ as the Center</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>of God's Economy among His Chosen</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>and Redeemed People</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The ark of the testimony signifies Christ as the center of God's economy among His chosen and redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today we have the ark among us; that is, we have Christ with us in a personal way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Testimony Signifying the Law,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Which Is the Portrait of What God Is</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The testimony signifies the law, which is a portrait of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because the testimony, the tables of the law, was put into the ark, the ark was called the ark of the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Tabernacle with the Ark</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Being the Testimony Borne</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>by God's Chosen and Redeemed People</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The tabernacle with the ark was the testimony borne by God's chosen and redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During the years in the wilderness, the children of Israel, who were more than two million in number, did not do anything except take care of God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They did not engage in commerce or work to make a living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God cared for their living by sending them manna and by giving them water from the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For a period of forty years, God's people, with the Angel of Jehovah taking the lead, camped and journeyed in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the eyes of the nations, the children of Israel were wasting their time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Likewise, in the eyes of the worldly people, we in the church life who have given ourselves to bear and to care for the testimony of God are also wasting our time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the sight of God, however, it is actually the worldly people who are idle and who are wasting their time Matt 20:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Others may think that we are wasting our time, but we in the Lord's recovery are happy to use our time to care for and to bear God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this message we have seen a bird's-eye view of the book of Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to this view, Numbers is a record of God's chosen and redeemed people being formed into a priestly army to fight for God and to journey with God so that they may be prepared by God to possess the all-inclusive Christ as the good land.</S>
