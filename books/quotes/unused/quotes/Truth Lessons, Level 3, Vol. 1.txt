In this volume we will see specifically the types in the Bible that are of great importance with rich significance
We even are the light ; that is, we are luminaries holding forth the word of life , shining forth Christ to enlighten this dark world
Genesis chapter one tells us that before the work of God's restoration began, the earth was waste and dark, that is, full of death
God commanded light to come forth on the first day, issuing in the plant life, which is the lowest life, a life without consciousness
We can grow in His life to have His image and be like Him , and we can bear the fruit of life as His spreading in life
In the church's degradation, religion crept in with its knowledge to distract the believers in Christ from eating Him as the tree of life
Eating the tree of life was not only God's original intention for man but will also be the eternal issue of God's redemption
The tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signify two persons in the universe-God and Satan
Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, yet what entered into him was sin, which resulted in death
Finally, death brings man's body into death and causes man's soul and spirit to perish in the suffering section in Hades
Among the types in the divine revelation in the Bible, the first are the light and the tree of life, which typify Christ as light and life
The light typifies Christ as the light of the universe, the source of all lights, the light of the world, and the light of life
As the source of all lights, He brings light to us and enlightens us in every way, that we may know ourselves and see our true condition
He also causes us who believe into Him to become sons of light, even to become the light, shining forth Christ to enlighten this dark world
Knowledge, good, and evil of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are in contrast to the life of the tree of life
Among the types in the Old Testament concerning Christ and the church, after the light and the tree of life, there are Adam and Eve
Christ is light and life in order that those who are enlightened by Him and who receive Him as life may become His church as His counterpart
It is spiritually significant that the types of Adam and Eve follow the types of the light and the tree of life
Whatever purpose God had for Adam and whatever work He did in Adam were to be carried out in and through Christ
Christ, who is the effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance , is His image, expressing what He is
John 1:18 also says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son , who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
After the creation of Adam, God wanted man to have dominion over all the living created things in the seas, in the air, and on the earth
God wanted the man whom He had created to be His representative to execute His authority and rule for Him on the earth
He is the Head of every one of us directly; as such, He has been the One appointed by God in the divine administration to rule over all men
Adam was the only male in God's creation at that time, typifying Christ as God becoming the unique male in the universe
Christ is the unique male in the universe; He is the unique object of our pursuit and the One to whom we eternally belong
Blood is the negative aspect of Christ's death; it is for redemption, which is for the purchasing of the church
Water is the positive aspect of Christ's death; it is for imparting life, which is for the producing of the church
Eve not only came out of Adam but also was brought to Adam to be joined to Adam and to become one flesh with Adam
Only Eve, who came out of Adam, could be joined to Adam; likewise, only the church, which comes out of Christ, can be joined to Christ
As Adam and Eve were joined to become one complete unit, Christ and the church are also joined to become one complete unit
Eve was a part of Adam's body as Adam's counterpart, typifying that the church is Christ's Body as Christ's counterpart
Eve was Adam's reproduction, Adam's duplication, signifying that the church is Christ's reproduction, Christ's duplication
As Eve was Adam's multiplication, the church is Christ's multiplication produced through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead
He fills us with His unlimited Spirit that we may become the bride, the increase, of the all-inclusive Christ, who is above all
The New Jerusalem as the universal bride is a living composition of all the saints redeemed by God throughout all generations
Christ slept in death and His side was opened to flow out the water of life, which produced the church as His counterpart
The church came out of Christ, has the same character, life, and nature as Christ, and is joined to Christ to be one spirit with Christ
The church is also the Body of Christ to be His counterpart as His reproduction, multiplication, increase, fullness, and expression
The New Jerusalem takes the Triune God as her center substance element and essence to be the full expression of the Triune God in eternity
Before the fall Adam and Eve the first ancestors of mankind were in a state of innocence they were sinless and had no consciousness of sin
The evil nature of Satan, which they received into them by their committing sin and by their fall, became their sinful nature
After they sinned, the fallen Adam and Eve became conscious of their sin and realized the shame of their nakedness
Corinthians 5:21 says, 'Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him'
According to Numbers 18:17, the firstling of a sheep was not to be eaten by the Israelites; it had to be offered to God
The firstlings of the flock offered by Abel were a type of Christ, who is unto God, who lives for God, and who is gentle and tender
On the cross He offered Himself without blemish to God to accomplish God's will, and He became a sweet savor to satisfy God's desire
He offered Himself once for all as the one sacrifice for sins to take away the sins of the world and accomplish an eternal redemption for us
The fat is the sweetness of the sheep; it is a type of the tender merits of Christ offered to God for His satisfaction
By faith he became one whom God considered righteous , and he walked with God in the midst of an adulterous and corrupt generation
Ephesians 5:2 says that Christ 'gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor'
He promised them that the seed of the woman would come as the one who would save them from the corruption and bondage of the serpent
In Genesis 3 the serpent in the garden of Eden as the embodiment of the evil one signifies the subtle one, the devil, Satan
He is called 'the tempter' , who in a subtle and crafty way seduced the God-created man and thereby caused him to sin and fall
Christ was made the righteousness of the sinners who believe in Him, and the sinners are justified and may live before God
In the fall of Adam and Eve there are not only the initial types of Christ's redemption but also the types of Christ's salvation
God promised them that the seed of the woman would come to save man from the corruption and bondage of the serpent
Noah built the ark which eventually saved him not only from God's judgment but also from that crooked and perverted generation
It was not merely a salvation from eternal perdition but a salvation from the crooked and perverted generation
People today are befuddled by the necessities of this life and do not know that God's judgment will come upon them by the Lord's appearing
The ark built by Noah eventually not only saved him from God's judgment but also saved his family of eight from that evil generation
The purpose of Christ in saving God's chosen people into a new age is that they may enjoy the riches of Christ in the new age
After this, the good land afforded Noah's descendants, the descendants of Abraham, the enjoyment of all the riches of the new earth
In the Old Testament, besides the good land of Canaan there is no other type that depicts Christ as such an all-inclusive One
The Lord Jesus said that out of the innermost being of those who believe into Him will flow rivers of living water
In the good land there are eight kinds of rich foods, of which there are two kinds of grain, four kinds of trees, and milk and honey
The wheat represents the Christ who was incarnated to be a man and who fell into the ground to die and be buried
Corinthians 15:20 says, 'But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep'
The barley loaves with which the Lord fed the five thousand typify Christ in His resurrection as the life supply to His believers
When we see a ripe pomegranate and its seeds, we surely have the impression that pomegranates are full of life
Honey is derived mainly from the plant life-the flowers and the trees-and it involves a part of the animal life-the bees
Such experience is produced from the two aspects of the life of Christ, the generating life and the redeeming life
Daniel 2 shows us that Christ is the stone that is cut out without hands and becomes a great mountain, which is the kingdom of God on earth
In order to participate in the enjoyment of the good land, we must first eliminate idols and all things related to idol worship
The children of Israel had no right to keep the firstborn of their cattle and the top tenth of their produce for themselves
They were not allowed to eat these things at home; they could enjoy them only in the place where God chose to put His name
The children of Israel were required to set aside the top tenth of the produce of the land and the firstborn of the cattle as well
The ark is a type of Christ as the salvation of God's elect in two aspects: the redeeming aspect and the saving aspect
Christ is all-inclusive and unsearchable, and the good land of Canaan is the type of such an all-inclusive One
In order to participate in the enjoyment of the good land, we must first eliminate idols and all things related to idol worship
We must be in the place of God's choice and we must present the riches of the good land as offerings to God and enjoy them with Him
The name Melchisedec first is interpreted 'king of righteousness,' and then also 'king of Salem,' which is 'king of peace'
Melchisedec typifies Christ as the King of righteousness who made all things right with God and made all things right with one another
According to the Bible, there are two orders of the priesthood, one being the order of Aaron and the other, the order of Melchisedec
Aaron was established in honor to be the high priest only for his lifetime, for he was prevented by death from continuing
Hebrews 716 says has been appointed not according to the law of a fleshy commandment but according to the power of an indestructible life
In Adam our portion was the cup of God's wrath, which would have sent us to the lake of fire to suffer the torment of eternal perdition
Christ as our Melchisedec today brings His life and all God's blessings with Him to His table to minister to us
When Abraham returned from his slaughtering of the kings, Melchisedec went forth to meet him and minister to him bread and wine
Melchisedec blessed Abraham, proving that he was greater than Abraham, and he also received offerings from Abraham
Genesis 171519 shows us that God definitely promised that Abraham would have a son Isaac and that this son would be born of his wife Sarah
It was only after they became nothing and were void of strength that God came in to carry out His promise by His grace
Abraham brought forth a seed Ishmael by the endeavor of the human flesh but Ishmael was rejected by God and could not fulfill Gods purpose
Whatever we do, whether good or bad, by the strength and ability of our natural man cannot fulfill God's promise to us
He was born through God's power in grace, which is implied in God's promise ; that is, he was born according to God's Spirit of life
What is brought forth in this way cannot remain in God's economy, and it is of no use for the accomplishment of God's purpose
God had no intention of bringing in the law or of having man endeavor to keep it for the fulfillment of His purpose
Rather, through the effort of man's flesh, the covenant of law, signified by Hagar, was brought in to frustrate God's work of grace
What was brought forth through her was not accepted as an heir to the inheritance and had no share in God's promised good land
In making this covenant, God used circumcision as evidence of the covenant to confirm the covenant of promise which He gave to Abraham
Since this was the cause of the trouble, God confirmed His covenant by having Abraham circumcised to cut off the flesh
The circumcision that is the putting off of the body of the flesh was not made with hands; it was accomplished by the death of Christ
In the covenant of circumcision which He made with Abraham, God required His people to be circumcised on the eighth day after their birth
God's promise is fulfilled not by the energy of man's flesh but by God's grace for those who inherit the promise
Those who inherit the promised inheritance according to this covenant should live for God as His burnt offering to satisfy God's desire
God's chosen people cannot be the burnt offering to satisfy God's desire by themselves; they must take Christ as their Substitute
God wanted Abraham to offer his son Isaac, who would inherit God's promised inheritance, as a burnt offering to God
He did not resist opposition, nor did He want to do anything for Himself or expect to gain something for Himself
Abraham called the name of the place where he offered the sacrifice Jehovah-jireh, which means 'Jehovah will provide'
He left the freedom of His divinity and was confined in the flesh of humanity which He put on in His incarnation
He was the infinite God in eternity, yet He was willing to become a finite man in time to be limited by time and space
Christ as the Lamb of God was willing to have His fighting power caught in His humanity that He might be offered as our Substitute
As the ram was killed on the altar instead of Isaac, so Christ, the Lamb of God, was crucified on the cross for us
In His resurrection, Christ, who died on the cross for us, is now in us living on our behalf to satisfy God's desire
Christ died for us that we might live to righteousness, that is, that we might live rightly under the government of God
Christ died for us not only that we might live to righteousness but also that we might become the righteousness of God in Him
God wanted Abraham to offer his son Isaac, who would inherit God's promised inheritance, as a burnt offering to God
On the other hand, He lives for us to satisfy God's desire that we may live to righteousness and become the righteousness of God
Following that, we have another type, a type portraying Christ and the church, symbolized by the marriage of Isaac and Rebekah
Isaac as the son brought forth by Abraham through his wife Sarah became the unique seed to inherit all that his father had
When Abraham's old servant was securing a wife for Isaac, he testified that his master had given all that he had to his son
The counterpart of Christ must come from Christ's race, not from the angels nor from any other creatures, but from the human race
Hebrews 2:14 says, 'Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same'
Rebekah was chosen to be Isaac's wife by the old servant whom Isaac's father, Abraham, sent to the place from where he was called out by God
It all depended on God's sovereign arrangement , for she was the one chosen and prepared by God to be given to Isaac
Half a shekel signifies the first taste, the foretaste, indicating that another half, the full taste, is coming
Ephesians 1:13-14 says that in Christ we have been 'sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise, who is the pledge of our inheritance'
At the time we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God
The old servant gave Rebekah not only a gold ring but also two gold bracelets for her hands weighing ten shekels
When the old servant went to Rebekah's house, he brought forth articles of silver, articles of gold, and raiment and gave them to Rebekah
After Rebekah received and enjoyed these riches, she was willing to leave her father's house immediately and be given to Isaac
Today, although we have never seen Christ, we are attracted by Him and we love Him because of the Spirit's testifying in us on behalf of Him
After Rebekah decided to leave her father's house to be given to Isaac, she rode on a camel and followed the old servant to go to Isaac
One day Isaac went out to meditate in the field at eventide, and he lifted up his eyes and saw that camels were coming
Isaac inherited all that his father Abraham had and took Rebekah as his wife, who was of his father's house and of his kindred
Rebekah was chosen to be Isaac's wife by the old servant whom Isaac's father, Abraham, sent to the place from where he was called out by God
Rebekah received a gold ring from the old servant, typifying that the church has received the Holy Spirit as a seal and a pledge
Genesis 28 shows us that Jacob was forced to leave his home and family, and from Beersheba he went toward Padan-aram
In his dream he saw a ladder set up on the earth with its top reaching to heaven and the angels of God ascending and descending on it
Through Christ as the heavenly ladder, the living way , God and we, we and God, can have contact and communication with one another
Through His incarnation He brought heaven to earth; then, He went through death and resurrection to join earth to heaven
Christ has been set up on the earth and has reached into heaven for the purpose of bringing God to us and bringing us to God
The angels of God are the ministering spirits, sent forth for service for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation
They ascend and descend on Christ as the heavenly ladder signifying that they serve from the earth to heaven for the sake of us Gods elect
Today, in the New Testament age, God is speaking through Christ that we may know God's intention and enjoy God's promise and supply
He is a living stone, and those who draw near to Him also become living stones to be material for God's building
Bethel became the hope of God's wandering elect, who left their home and wandered about, sleeping at night in the open air
Before we enter the church life, we do not have real satisfaction and rest; we are always suffering hardships and wandering about
The ladders being set up on the earth and reaching to heaven signifies that Christ brings the earth into communication and union with heaven
Joseph was a type of Christ as the Beloved of God the Father, yet he was hated, rejected, and put to death by his brothers in the flesh
Later, when he went to see his brothers according to his father's will, they conspired against him to slay him
He was brought down to Egypt, sold to an officer of Pharaoh's , and later was delivered into the prison of death
He was hated and rejected by his flesh brothers, and eventually he was delivered by the world, signified by Egypt, into the prison of death
According to the record of the Gospels, the Jewish leaders hated Christ, conspired against Him, and plotted to kill Him
On the same day Joseph was released from prison, he was given authority to become the actual ruler over the whole land of Egypt
Joseph's being made the ruler of a nation typifies Christ's being exalted by God and made the Ruler over all things
After the fall, however, man was told to eat meat because of the need for the shedding of blood for redemption
The blood comes out of the Lord's sacrificial life for redemption, and the bread comes from His regenerating life for life's reproduction
At that time they will lift up their heads to look and they will see the Messiah, their Deliverer, Jesus the Nazarene, whom they had pierced
The Lord will send His angels to gather them together from the four winds to the good land that God gave to their forefathers
After Joseph was released from prison, he was immediately given authority to become the actual ruler over the whole land of Egypt
He took away sin, solved the problem of the world, defeated Satan, abolished death, and eliminated every negative thing
Those taken captive refers to the redeemed saints, who were taken captive by Satan before being saved by Christ's death and resurrection
In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan's captivity and took them to Himself
The couching lion is skillful, indicating that he has gained the victory and devoured the prey and that he is now resting in satisfaction
That praise and worship were rendered to Judah by his brothers signifies that praise and worship will be rendered to Christ by God's people
In His victorious resurrection Christ received all authority in heaven and on earth , and after His ascension He also received the kingdom
The scepter in verse 10 is a symbol of the kingdom, and it denotes kingship, signifying Christ's kingdom, Christ's kingship
When Christ comes again as Shiloh, the Peace-giver, He will be the Prince of peace, who will bring peace to the whole earth
At that time the whole earth will enjoy peace; nations will not lift the sword against nations, nor will they learn war anymore
When we are under the heavenly ruling of Christ in the church life today, we enjoy Him as Shiloh, as our Peace-giver
At the second coming of Christ all nations will come to Christ and obey Him submitting themselves under His kingship in peace and security
The kingdom on earth will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever
The lion of Judah typifies Christ as the ultimate Overcomer, who has accomplished everything God required of Him
He took away sin, solved the problem of the world, defeated Satan, abolished death, and eliminated every negative thing
The lioness signifies that Christ in His strong producing produces many overcomers to deal with the enemy, Satan
Judah's hand would be on the neck of his enemies and no one would dare to rouse him up; his brothers would praise and worship him
When Christ comes again as Shiloh, the Peace-giver, He will be the Prince of peace, who will bring peace to the whole earth
The kingdom on earth will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever
Although the Triune God is one God, He became the God of three persons-the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob
The Triune God in three aspects is for the complete experience in three sections of a person who is mature in life
He exercised His divine foreknowledge and chose us out of numberless people, not because of our works but absolutely because of His mercy
When the man whom God created for Himself fell and forsook God, God came in to call man that He might have a new beginning with fallen man
The God of glory appeared to him there telling him to come out from his land and his relatives and go into the land which God would show him
No matter what our condition is in the way that we follow Him, His calling is irrevocable and it has such a great hope
As he was preparing to offer up Isaac, he experienced God's provision of a ram as a replacement of his son Isaac
In Gods eternal view Christ was slain and became the redemption to Gods people from the foundation of the world that is from the fall of man
He was born according to God's promise by God's visitation; hence, he was the proper, legal heir to inherit his father's possessions
It was absolutely and unconditionally by grace, not by his effort, that he became the heir of his father's riches
The envy, competition, and wrestling between his two wives, Leah and Rachel, in bearing children also put him in a predicament
All these grindings in the environment were used by God to deal with Jacob from all sides in order to transform him
While Jacob remained alone at the ford of Jabbok, God came in the form of a man to wrestle with him in order to expose his natural life
After we have been regenerated and saved, God the Spirit enters into us to be our life and to carry out a transforming work in us
Eventually under Gods leading and shepherding for his whole life Jacob who had been a supplanter became Israel a matured prince of God
As Jacob was dying, he leaned on the top of his staff and worshipped the God whom he had experienced in a full way in a life of sojourning
Although he ministered to his brothers according to his father's will, he was hated and harassed by his brothers
God was with him showed kindness to him and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison whatever he did God caused it to prosper
He not only ruled over the whole land of Egypt but also blessed the whole earth by ministering food to people for their existence
Genesis 41:56-57 says, 'And when the famine was over all the face of the earth, Joseph opened all the storehouses
God the Father's selection is seen in Jacob: Jacob was chosen before his birth; it was not of his own works but of God who calls
God the Spirit's transformation is seen in Jacob: Jacob was born a supplanter, full of human strength and the natural life
He was broken and experienced genuine transformation after going through God's grindings in the environment and God's direct dealings
Finally, Jacob's life reached maturity and, through Joseph, he reigned over the whole land of Egypt and blessed the whole earth
As the Apostle, Christ came to us with God to share God with us that we may partake of His divine life, nature, and fullness
In Exodus 3:10 God said to Moses, 'I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt'
Hebrews 3:3-4 says, 'He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by as much as He who built the house has more honor than the house
Although Moses was an honorable servant of God, he was merely a type of the real, typical, and genuine Apostle sent from God
Such a house is built up, ruled over, and taken care of by Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who is the Apostle sent by God
A prophet is God's spokesman, not mainly to predict things that are coming but to speak for God and speak forth God by God's revelation
It indicates that Moses' being a prophet was not of his own doing or of his own making; he was raised up by God
In his forty years of leading the children of Israel, he was God's spokesman, speaking for God to them all that God commanded him
When Christ was on the earth He spoke to His disciples for God His teaching was not His but was according to what the Father had taught Him
He was faithful to God in all God's house to bring God to us and to bring us into the rich supply of God's full salvation
Although Moses was an honorable servant of God, he was merely a type of the real, typical, and genuine Apostle sent from God
When Christ was on the earth, He spoke to His disciples for God; He did not speak from Himself, but as the Father said to Him, so He spoke
The Passover portrayed in Exodus 12 is a clear, suitable, and even all-inclusive type of the redemption of Christ
The flesh of the Passover lamb for the supply of the children of Israel typifies Christ as the believers' supply
Christ was examined by the Jewish priests and the Roman governor, and He was proved to be faultless, without blemish
While Jehovah God was smiting all the firstborn of the land of Egypt, when He saw the blood on the door, He passed over that house
Peter 1:19 shows us that we were redeemed 'with precious blood, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ'
The blood of the lamb was put on the door of the house in which the lamb was eaten for the deliverance of the children of Israel
The blood of the Passover lamb was to be put on the door, whereas the flesh of the lamb was to be eaten by the children of Israel
The flesh of the lamb being eaten for their supply typifies that Christ enters into the believers to be their life supply
To eat of Christ as if He were boiled with water is to regard His death on the cross not as death for redemption but as martyrdom
The head signifies wisdom, the legs signify activity and move, and the inwards signify the various inward parts of Christ's being
Day by day we must enjoy such a Christ as our feast, as the rich supply of life, that we may live a life that purges away sin
When the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, the Egyptian army, horses, and chariots that pursued them also went into the sea after them
The water of the Red Sea drowning the Egyptian army typifies that the death of Christ has destroyed the power of the world for us
Since in baptism the power of the world is terminated, baptism saves the believers from the power of the world
God's causing the children of Israel to be severed from Egypt is a type of God's causing the believers to be separated from the world
God has separated us from the world and delivered us from Satan and his world so that we are no longer under their bondage
After their exodus from Egypt, the children of Israel were able, eventually, to enter the good land to enjoy its riches
Colossians 267 says As therefore you have received the Christ Jesus the Lord walk in Him having been rooted and being built up in Him
These riches become the element and substance by which we grow and build up the Body of Christ as God's house and God's kingdom
The blood of the lamb was put on the door, typifying that the blood of Christ was put before God for the believers' redemption
The cloud was above them, and then it appeared before them and became the pillar of cloud that stood firm with strength
All the New Testament believers have the indwelling Spirit with them, who not only shelters them but also guides them
In the daytime it was the pillar of cloud that led the way for the children of Israel, and in the night it was the pillar of fire
The cloud signifies the Spirit; the fire signifies the Word of God, which is a shining light to us, the believers
The children of Israel could journey not only in the daytime but even in the night because the fire gave them light
The two pillars, the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire, that guided the children of Israel in their journey actually were one
After the setting up of the tent of meeting, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle
The Spirit of God as the pillar of cloud is the economical Spirit to be poured upon us, to fill us outwardly, for our work and move
The Spirit of God covers and shelters us all the time everywhere as the pillar of cloud, bringing to us God's intimate and glorious presence
On our way of following the Lord, the light which we receive from the Lord through the Spirit and the Word first guides us
In the entire course of our journey we should neither act according to man's opinion and choice nor depend on our own method and strength
Both the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire were the glory as the manifestation of God's presence with His redeemed
After they had been redeemed by God through the Passover, Israel, God's elect, crossed the Red Sea and went out of Egypt
In their journeying in the wilderness, because of the desolate environment and its hardships, they had all kinds of needs for their living
The tree that healed the bitter waters is a type of the cross on which Christ suffered the bitterness of death
It is not merely water but springs of water which issued from the fountainhead, flowing forth to supply the need of God's chosen people
The springs of water are for the quenching of thirst, whereas the palm trees are for a shade, a shelter from heat
They can survive under the scorching sun and bring forth an abundance of leaves as a shelter from heat, a place for cooling
Although the children of Israel had had their exodus from Egypt, they were still Egyptian in their constitution
They needed to change their constitution that they might become materials for the building of God's habitation
Today Christ has come from God to be our real food, and God has changed our food from something worldly to Christ Himself
We need to eat Him that He may enter into us organically to become our inner constituents that we may be built as God's habitation
From Exodus 16:13-14 we see that manna came with the dew: 'In the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp
According to John 6, the crowd wanted to enthrone the Lord Jesus as a king, but He fled from man's exaltation of Himself
There are two kinds of pearls: one kind is produced by oysters, and the other is produced by the secretion of resinous gum from trees
When we eat Christ, we become living creatures that are full of eyes, and we also become bright and transparent
In Exodus 17:6 the rock that was smitten and cleft to flow out the living water for God's chosen people was a physical rock
God told Moses to use his rod to 'strike the rock, and water will come out of it so that the people may drink'
The living water flowing out of the cleft rock typifies the Spirit, who flowed out of the crucified and resurrected Christ
In their journeying in the wilderness, because of the desolate environment and its hardships, they had all kinds of needs for their living
When we are in a bitter situation if we take the cross of Christs suffering death the sensation of the bitter situation will be made sweet
If we would diligently give heed to God's commandments, we would be spared from the diseases and plagues inflicted upon the worldly people
By eating Him, we allow Him to enter into us organically to become our inner constituents, and we are thereby built as God's dwelling place
The rock typifies Christ, who was smitten and cleft by God to flow out the water of life to satisfy the thirst of His believers
The living water is a type of the Spirit, who, as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, is the water of life in resurrection
Amalek signifies that the believers' flesh, their old man, is very close to the believers' regenerated and spiritual new man
The flesh is the leading enemy in frustrating us from entering into and possessing the all-inclusive Christ as the good land
Since the flesh is a hand against the administration of God, it is in rebellion against the economy of God's administration
Believers fighting against the flesh in their spiritual journey today always need the intercession of Christ in ascension
Christ intercedes for us in His ascension at the right hand of God that we may be brought fully into God's eternal purpose
In the battle against Amalek, Moses lifted up his hand on the mountaintop, and Joshua fought for the people at the mountain foot
On the one hand, we must take the initiative to put to death the practices of the body, because the Spirit does not do it for us
On the other hand we should not attempt to deal with the body of our flesh by relying on our own effort without the power of the Holy Spirit
The putting to death here is actually our coordinating with the Spirit who indwells us, just as Israel cooperated with Joshua
When the children of Israel were on their way in the wilderness, the first enemy who came to hinder them from going on was Amalek
The flesh is the leading enemy in frustrating us from entering into and possessing the all-inclusive Christ as the good land
When the children of Israel were fighting against Amalek, their victory or defeat hinged on Moses' interceding on the mountaintop
Christ's intercession for us in His ascension at the right hand of God is ever-unceasing, and His power in caring for us is unlimited
In the battle against Amalek, Joshua fighting at the mountain foot typifies the indwelling Christ as the Spirit fighting against the flesh
He charged the children of Israel to make a tabernacle for Him according to the pattern He showed them on the mount
Without being exposed and enlightened by the law, man could not sense the need for the tabernacle and the altar
Apparently, the law of God given in Exodus 20 consists merely of some commandments that God wanted man to keep
The law of God has a negative function and that is to expose man's true condition so that man is afraid to draw near to God
The sinner is aware of his sins and conscious of his need for Christ and His redemption, typified by the tabernacle and the altar
Christ appeared to people in the form of man , yet He was God manifested in man-He was the embodiment of God in the flesh
According to the Old Testament history, the tabernacle was God's dwelling on earth; Christ as the tabernacle is God's dwelling in humanity
God, who originally was above the heavens, hidden and untouchable , became flesh through Christ and was embodied in Him as the tabernacle
Through this tabernacle man can contact God and enter into God to receive Him and enjoy Him as grace and reality in fullness
With Christ as the tabernacle which is a mingling of divinity and humanity God obtains a concrete expression and dwelling place in humanity
The section outside the veil was called the Holy Place, and the section inside the veil was called the Holy of Holies
In the Holy Place there were the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar near the Holy of Holies
Within the ark there were the golden pot containing the hidden manna, Aaron's budding rod, and the two tables of the covenant
The first layer, the innermost layer, was made of ten curtains, which were of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen
Christ in His human living, in both nature and appearance, lived as a heavenly man; He is also kingly both in position and behavior
As the porpoise skins, He withstands for us all the attacks in our environment and enables us to stand strongly
Both of these veils are related to our entering into the tabernacle, God's dwelling place, and they both typify Christ
The hangings of the outer court signify Christ as God's righteousness to be the expression and boundary of God's building
The hooks and rods of silver signify Christ's redemption, issuing out of God's righteous judgment, as our holding power and joining strength
According to the record of Exodus 26:15-25, there was a total of forty-eight standing boards in the tabernacle
The fortyeight standing boards signify the created fallen and redeemed believers as the materials for the building of Gods dwelling place
Within us we have the divine nature, signified by gold, and the uplifted humanity of Jesus, signified by acacia wood
When the believers are united in the divine nature and are built together in Christ, they become God's dwelling place on earth
By this we see that God's dwelling place built up on earth is not only among us but also in our spirit to be indwelt by the Spirit of God
Exodus 40:34 says, 'Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle'
In its ultimate consummation this tabernacle will be manifested in the New Jerusalem as the eternal dwelling place of God and His redeemed
The furnishings within the tabernacle signify the different aspects of the believers' experience of Christ after they have entered into God
The boards were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold and united together by the rings of gold and the bars of wood overlaid with gold
In its ultimate consummation this tabernacle will be manifested in the New Jerusalem as the eternal dwelling place of God and His redeemed
Outside the tabernacle there were two articles of accessory furnishings, one being the bronze laver and the other, the bronze altar
The laver was made not merely of bronze but of the bronze mirrors of the women who served at the door of the tent of meeting
Since the laver was made of bronze mirrors, it implies that the entire laver was a bronze mirror to reflect, expose, and cleanse people
If we remain in these defilements, we cannot serve God, we cannot pray, and we cannot function in the meetings
According to the arrangement of the furniture, in position the bronze altar was before all the other furnishings
According to the arrangement of all the furniture inside and outside the tabernacle, the ark and the bronze altar are at two ends
A sinner who wants to go into the tabernacle to meet God must first pass through the altar, that is, the cross of Christ
Through the cross of Christ we have access to God and are fully reconciled to the righteous God and live to Him
As we enjoy Christ's humanity as the supply with which to serve God, the outcome will be Christ's divinity as the expression of God
The Gospel of John, which unveils the divinity of Christ, tells us explicitly that Christ is the light of life
Chapter one opens with the words, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God
In 812 the Lord Jesus said I am the light of the world he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness but shall have the light of life
The problem between man and God was appeased, enabling God to meet with those who come forward to His presence
He commanded Moses to take a golden pot, put an omerful of manna therein, and lay it up before Him to be kept throughout the generations
The rod that budded signifies our experience of Christ in His resurrection as our acceptance by God for authority in the God-given ministry
Outside the tabernacle there were two articles of accessory furnishings, one being the bronze laver and the other, the bronze altar
The furnishings within the tabernacle are the contents of the tabernacle, ministering to people the riches of Christ in different aspects
The third item was the golden incense altar, which signifies Christ as the means by which God's redeemed are accepted by God
According to the record in Exodus 30:22-25, the ingredients of the holy anointing oil are of two categories: the spices and the olive oil
Fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ's death for our healing and encouragement
Cassia signifies the power and the effectiveness of Christ's resurrection for us to overcome the demons and all negative things
One hin of olive oil is the basic element of the ointment, signifying that the unique God is the base of the compound Spirit
The four spices signify humanity in God's creation, and the one hin of olive oil signifies divinity in the Godhead
The first unit signifies the Father; the second unit, the Son, who was split on the cross; and the third unit, the Spirit
Exodus 30:29-30 says: 'Thus you shall sanctify them that they may be most holy; whatever touches them shall be holy
The ointment became a mark separating them from anything common that they might be unto God and be joined to God
John 2:20-27 reveals that this ointment, which typifies the compound Spirit, has its function in the believers
We are mingled with the Triune God as one and are sanctified for the building of God's habitation and the service of the priesthood
In Exodus 30, after the record concerning the holy anointing oil, there is the description of the holy incense
Through His death Christ redeemed the fallen sinners, produced the sons of God, and expelled the old serpent, the devil
Exodus 30:35 says: 'And you shall make of it incense, a perfume according to the perfumer's art, seasoned with salt, pure, and holy'
They were qualified to enter the tabernacle and come to the table of the bread of the Presence to receive a further supply of life
The holy ointment was made by the compounding together of flowing myrrh, fragrant cinnamon, calamus, cassia, and olive oil
Salt signifies that the cross of Christ has the killing power and the preserving power that incense may become pure incense
