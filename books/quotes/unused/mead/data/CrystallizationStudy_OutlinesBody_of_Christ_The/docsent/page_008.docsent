   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The oneness of the Body of Christ is of the divine, uncreated life; therefore, this oneness is divinely organic and full of life John 17:3; 1:4; 1 John 5:11-12.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The unique oneness of the Body of Christ is the oneness of the Spirit Eph 4:3: The Spirit is the essence of the Body of Christ; hence, the Spirit is the reality of the oneness of the Body of Christ 1 John 5:6; John 16:13.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The oneness of the Body of Christ is unique because it is a oneness in the uniqueness of the Triune God John 17:6, 11, 14-23: God the Father is the source as our nature and life, God the Son is the element of this nature and life, and God the Spirit is the essence of the element Eph 4:4-6.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because we have the Triune God within us as the source, the element, and the essence, we are one.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since the Body of Christ is uniquely one universally, the fellowship of the Body of Christ is also uniquely one universally Acts 2:42; 1 John 1:3, 7; 1 Cor 10:16-17: Just as there is the circulation of blood in the human body, so there is a circulation in the Body of Christ a circulation which the New Testament calls fellowship 1 John 1:3, 7.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The fellowship of the Body of Christ is the stream of the divine life; as the stream of the divine life flows within us, there is the fellowship of the Body of Christ Acts 2:42; 1 John 1:3, 7.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The divine fellowship is the reality of living in the Body of Christ; by being restricted in this fellowship, the Body of Christ is kept in oneness 1 Cor 1:9; 12:12-13, 27.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The unique fellowship is the genuine oneness of the Body of Christ as the unique ground for the believers to be kept one in Christ Eph 4:3-6.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The fellowship among the churches is the fellowship of the Body of Christ 1 Cor 10:16-17: Because there is one Spirit, there is only one Body, and there is only one circulation of life in the Body; this circulation is the fellowship of the Body of Christ Eph 4:4; 1 John 1:3, 7.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A local church is a part of the unique Body of Christ, and the fellowship of the Body is universally one; in fellowship there is no separation Rev 1:11; 2:7a.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we isolate ourselves from the fellowship of the Body, we are not qualified to partake of the Lord s body, because the loaf on the table in the Lord s supper signifies the entire Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we enjoy Christ in partaking of His blood and body at His table, we express and practice the fellowship of the Body of Christ, the unique fellowship among the churches Acts 2:42; 1 John 1:3, 7; Phil 1:5; 2:1.</S>
