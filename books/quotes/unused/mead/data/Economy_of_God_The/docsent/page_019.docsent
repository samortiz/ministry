   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT DEALING WITH THE HEART AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen the definition and function of the heart, the spirit, and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our relationship with the Lord is always begun and maintained by our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Of course, to contact the Lord is a matter of our spirit, but this contact must be initiated and maintained by our heart, for our heart is the gateway of our whole being Prov 4:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A building with many rooms always has an entrance and an exit; a person comes in by the entrance and goes out by the exit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the entrance is closed, everyone is kept away from the rooms inside the building, but once it has been opened, people can enter the building and enjoy each room.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The heart is not a separate and exclusive part of our being, but is composed of all the parts of the soul and one part of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, being such a composition, the heart becomes the very gateway of our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, the heart becomes both the entrance and the exit of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whatever enters into us must enter through the heart, and whatever comes out from us must proceed through the heart Matt 12:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, if our heart is not alert as we listen to a message, we will not receive the substance of the message.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Or, when we are reading, we will receive nothing if our heart is not set on the content.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even while we are eating, if we do not have the heart to eat, we will not taste the food.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This proves that the heart is the controlling organ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to control an entire building, we must be able either to close or open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With the heart there is the power to close or open our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For this reason the preaching of the gospel must be guided by the Holy Spirit that it might touch the human heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The most effectual way of preaching the gospel is to touch the human heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If one can break through the heart, many persons can be gained.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why unbelievers harden and close their heart to the gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Regardless of how much we preach, when they close their heart, we cannot touch them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We cannot minister anything into them, because their entrance is closed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to preach effectively, we must find a way to break through the entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The best preacher is the one who finds the key to unlock the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even the Lord Himself attracts us through our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He does not stir up our spirit first.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The seeking one in the beginning of Song of Songs asks the Lord to attract her by His love so that she may love Him 1:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord comes to touch our heart with His love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why, after His resurrection, the Lord asked Peter, Do you love Me?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John 21:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord s love is the best way to unlock the door of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the most effective way to open the heart is to preach the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once the heart is open, it is easy for the Holy Spirit to touch the spirit and all the parts of man s being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is true not only in gospel preaching but even in the ministry of Christian teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>DEALING WITH THE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to deal with our heart that we might have a proper relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How can we deal with our heart?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is quite simple.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Scripture says, Blessed are the pure in heart Matt 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some translators have changed the word pure to clean.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, the word clean is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not a matter of merely having a clean heart but of having a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may be clean but mixed and therefore not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be mixed does not mean to be dirty but means to have more than one goal and one aim.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the problem with many brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They think that there is nothing wrong with their heart because they are clean and without condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But they are not pure, because they have more than one goal, more than one aim.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yes, they are aiming at God, but at the same time they are aiming at several other things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They may be aiming at God and at a doctor s degree.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When they have two things as their aims, they are mixed and complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot see two things with our eyes at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we try to look at two items at the same time, both items will be blurred.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Why is it that some say they are not clear about the Lord s will?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is because they have two goals, two aims.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many brothers and sisters have more than two aims.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They are aiming at many things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yes, they are seeking the Lord, but at the same time they are seeking other things, such as their position and their career.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How can they avoid being perplexed and confused?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Their heart needs to be purified from many ambitions so that the Lord Himself may be their only goal.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even many Christian workers have too many goals.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One brother testified that he had a great goal: he wanted to be the greatest preacher in his denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His heart was clean, but he was not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His heart needed to be purified until he had only one goal the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some Christian workers have the Lord Himself and His work as their goal.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Thus, they have two goals.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They need to purify their heart until they seek nothing other than the Lord Himself as their goal.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Their aim, their goal, and their interest should be only the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When they seek absolutely nothing but Him, their heart will be pure, and if they have such a pure heart, the sky will be not only open but very clear to them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sometimes the sky is open but cloudy.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The spiritual sky is cloudy because the heart is mixed and not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When the heart is purified from many goals, the sky is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Another term the Bible uses to describe the heart is singleness singleness of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some versions translate singleness as simplicity.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Singleness of heart means to be simple in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To be simple means, in a sense, to be foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Those who truly love the Lord and aim at Him are a kind of fool.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must all be Christian fools.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This means that we do not know anything but Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Whatever we do, we know only Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Wherever we go, we know only Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We should not try to be clever.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We have only one way the narrow way of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>People may say, You are foolish, but we should like to be so foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is simplicity.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Three verses in the Scriptures referring to purity of heart are Psalm 73:1, Matthew 5:8, and 2 Timothy 2:22.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The latter reference shows that while the churches are deteriorating, we must pursue the Lord with a pure heart and call on the Lord together with others who have a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There are at least three verses that speak of singleness of heart: Acts 2:46, Ephesians 6:5, and Colossians 3:22.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we would seek and serve the Lord, we must deal with these two matters: being pure and single in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must learn to have not only a clean and right heart but also a pure and single heart.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we deal with our heart in such a way, our whole being will be open to the Lord, because the gateway will be open.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is not a doctrine but simply a set of instructions on how to deal with the heart so that the Lord can possess our whole being.</S>
