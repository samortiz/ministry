   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE LIVING AND CONDUCT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE LORD S SERVING ONES HAVING A GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Beginning with this chapter, we will cover some important matters that serving ones should pay attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We first will consider the living and conduct of the Lord s serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One who serves the Lord should have a vision, which we may call a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our goal can be high or basic.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>An example of a basic goal is to preach the gospel to save souls, that is, to bring people to the Lord Jesus for the salvation of their souls.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although this is a basic goal, it is nevertheless a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should regard preaching the gospel as an important thing in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should never give it up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, our entire being should be captured by it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As those who serve the Lord, we should have a clear goal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I was called by the Lord on the day that I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At that time I did not understand what it means to be called.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later, I realized that I was called on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While I was walking home, I had a feeling within, so I lifted up my head, looked up toward heaven, and said that I no longer wanted anything that the world could offer me, not even to be an emperor; I simply wanted to preach the gospel from village to village.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That was the extent of my understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I never thought that one day the Lord would open His New Testament economy to me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is an extremely high goal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, whether a matter is high or basic, it must serve as a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the Lord s serving ones, we each should have a clear goal.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This goal will be the compass in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is similar to setting sail in the dark night or in the fog; a person must have a compass to set the direction.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A young man in his twenties should have a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not a matter of blessing or curse; it is not a matter of having a future or not having a future; neither is it a matter of comfort or suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must have a goal in our life, in other words, a purpose in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have been serving the Lord for almost sixty years, and I have never regretted this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the contrary, the more I serve, the more I am inwardly assured that this is the best choice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, this was not up to me; it was the Lord s choice, His calling, and His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every serving one should have a clear goal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whether or not we are married, serve full time, are poor or rich, live in a small village or a big city, preach the gospel to fishermen, or preach the truth to scholars, we should have a clear goal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Marriage, occupation, blessings, or sufferings will not change us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The entire revelation in the Bible shows that for the accomplishing of His will, the Lord desires to gain a group of people who know and take His intention as their goal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>PURSUING TO MAKE PROGRESS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A person who serves the Lord must always pursue to make progress.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who serve the Lord are people of the highest class.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They might not be doctors of philosophy or scholars, but they must continuously progress in their learning and pursuit; they must not come to a standstill.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only should we have general knowledge; we should also understand the tendencies in human life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not need to become experts or to obtain an advanced degree, but we need to learn and make progress every day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Learning Both the Chinese and English Languages</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Most of our young people in Taiwan are college graduates.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They need to improve their Chinese so that they are able to express their ideas orally and in writing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who serve the Lord should be very particular about their writing and speech.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who are Chinese should at least be fluent and skilled in the Chinese language.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I also encourage the Chinese students to diligently study English.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>English has become the world language.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since those who do not serve the Lord are learning English, we, as the Lord s workers, have a greater need to know English.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we know English, we will be able to go to any place in the world without hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Knowing the World Situation</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In addition to learning languages, we need to know the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I began paying attention to the world situation when World War I ended in 1918.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At that time the magazine that helped me the most was Eastern Miscellany published in Shanghai by The Commercial Press.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This magazine was authoritative and highly regarded internationally.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Its discussions on international treaties and the various issues among the nations rendered much knowledge on international affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From that time onward, I have not stopped the habit of reading the newspapers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>My interest, however, is limited to understanding the international situation; I am not interested in other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I was born in Chefoo in northern China and attended an English college; hence, I know English and have common knowledge concerning international matters.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In 1958 I went abroad for the first time and had no difficulties visiting many countries in Europe and America.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When I ran into problems, I was able to assert my position using English.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I was even invited to give messages when I was in London, England.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, many Chinese people are at a disadvantage when they go abroad because they lack language abilities and an international perspective.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not think that it is superfluous to learn another language, especially English.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Not only should we know how to speak Chinese, but we should also learn English; otherwise, we will not be able to travel in many places of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even if we do not go abroad, we can use English to read reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, I encourage you to learn English.</S>
