   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN PRACTICING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND BEING RESCUED FROM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE PAPAL AND CLERGY-LAITY SYSTEMS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Over the course of the past seven and a half years, I have nearly exhausted sharing concerning the truth of the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this training, I do not want to repeat what I have already shared in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The verses in the Scripture concerning the God-ordained way have been repeatedly quoted to us again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I still have a heavy burden to have some practical fellowship concerning our experience and practice of the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE LORD'S RECOVERY BRINGING US OUT OF</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE PAPAL AND CLERGY-LAITY SYSTEMS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The God-ordained way as revealed in the Bible is the proper practice of the church life against the papal and clergy-laity systems.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The papal system is the system of the pope in the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Roman Catholic Church is called "The Mother of the Prostitutes" Rev 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Out of this impure, dirty mother, another system was produced the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The clergy-laity system, as the daughter of the papal system, is the system of Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible reveals the God-ordained practice to encounter these two systems.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible has its own practice and principle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The biblical practice and principle are always being put down by the papal and clergy-laity systems.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The goal of the papal and clergy-laity systems is to annul the Body of Christ and replace it with a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The intention of God's economy is to have an organic Body built up for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But after nearly two thousand years of church history, what is prevailing today on this earth is an organized religion, comprising Catholicism and Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we left the divisions, we left the papal system with the clergy-laity system, but not many among us know what we have done or what we are doing here today in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord's recovery has been lowered down by this ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are those among us who think that there is not much difference between us and the denominational churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This kind of thought among the brothers and sisters may be because our testimony has been somewhat weak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our testimony may not have been strong enough to bear the particular significance of the Lord's recovery to the ones who have been with us for a number of years, including all the ones who have made or caused division in the past seventy years of our history.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During the time of my ministry outside of mainland China in the past forty years, there have been at least three divisions caused among us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every division showed that those who participated in them did not have a clear view about the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is the recovery according to the Lord's mind?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is to get His believers out of the papal system and the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not forget that the intention of these two systems is to build up a religion, including Catholicism and Protestantism, to replace and put down the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who have made divisions in the Lord's recovery did not clearly see this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even I am concerned that we ourselves might not be so thoroughly clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We left the denominations, the divisions, but we did not fully give up the papal and clergy-laity systems.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have outwardly come out of the Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations, but we still carry and walk in these two systems.</S>
