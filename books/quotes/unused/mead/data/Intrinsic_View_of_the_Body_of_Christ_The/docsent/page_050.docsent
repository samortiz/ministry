   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Divisions Being among the Corinthians</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 1:10 says that there were divisions among the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They did not all speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we all speak different things, we will be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, the Corinthians were not attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be attuned may be likened to the tuning of a piano.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The piano will not give a harmonious sound if it is not tuned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may be likened to a piano with the mind as one key, the emotion as another key, the will as another key, and the conscience as still another key.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may not be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion, so when Jesus comes to "play on us," we do not sound so well.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our sound is not harmonious, so we need the heavenly One to attune us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a brother exchanges words with his wife, or when a wife argues with her husband, that is not harmonious.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why we need to be attuned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord needs to come to touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He wants to touch our mind and our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our emotion should be attuned, because we are wild in our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are also stubborn in our will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once we have decided something, no one can change us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why the Lord needs to attune our will, to make our will soft and flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I believe that many of us have experienced these things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have been attuned often.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All of us need to be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we will become like a grand piano which plays fine music in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Corinth it was not like this because there were jealousy and strife among the saints there 1 Cor 1:11; 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some young sisters in the church life may become jealous of one another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When they pray, when they share, or when they prophesy in the meetings, they are competing for "amens."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When one sister shares, she receives many "amens," but when another one shares, she does not receive many "amens."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then the sister who did not get many "amens" becomes offended.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some will not function unless they have the assurance that they will hear many "amens" from the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If they do not have this assurance, they will keep silent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This shows that it is easy to have jealousy and strife in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Corinthians also made parties by saying, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ" 1 Cor 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Parties are divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In our local church, there may be four or five speakers who minister the word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we come to a ministry meeting, we may ask who is going to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If one brother is speaking, we will not go, but if another brother is speaking, we will go.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To our feeling this brother is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are "of him."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a party.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may think that we are merely choosing to go hear a brother who is a good speaker, and not choosing to go to hear another brother who is a bad speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But to do this is to make parties.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all have to learn to avoid anything that can create division.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These kinds of divisions were there in Corinth.</S>
