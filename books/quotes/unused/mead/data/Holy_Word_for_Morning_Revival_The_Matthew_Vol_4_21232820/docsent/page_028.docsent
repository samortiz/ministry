   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 19 DAY 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 26:69-75</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a 1 servant girl came to him and said, You also were with Jesus the Galilean.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>70 But he denied it before all, saying, I do not know what you are talking about!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>71 And after he had gone out to the porch, another girl saw him and said to those who were there, This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>73 And after a little while 1 those who were standing there came to Peter and said, Surely you also are one of them, for your speech also makes it clear that you are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>74 Then he began to 1 curse and to swear: I do not know the man!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And immediately a rooster crowed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>75 And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And he went out and wept bitterly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>69 1 Peter could not withstand even a fragile little female!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>73 1 Under God's sovereignty the environment would not let Peter go until he had been tested to the uttermost, that he might realize that he was absolutely untrustworthy and should no longer have any confidence in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>74 1 In his first denial Peter spoke words only v. 70 ; in his second denial he replied with an oath v. 72 ; in his third denial he cursed and swore.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peter is our representative.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As far as our natural life is concerned, we are all Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For the kingdom of the heavens to be established, there was the need of a man like Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Throughout chapter twenty-six, the Lord Jesus stood in the position of a man, not in the position of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order for the kingdom of the heavens to be established, He stood as a man, a successful man, a victorious man, as a man that could withstand any hardship, defeat, opposition, and attack.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we consider this picture of the Lord Jesus, we should receive the clear impression that in our human life it is impossible for us to be the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The twelve disciples had been under the Lord's teaching and training for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord took special care to train Peter in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Time and time again, Peter was adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is difficult to believe that such a qualified and trained person could take the lead in denying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not even Peter himself believed that he would do this v. 35 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not read this account merely as a story about Peter, for it reveals that it is impossible for our natural life to enter into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because we all are the same as Peter, we should not try to follow the pathway into the kingdom by our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No matter what kind of mind or will we may have, we cannot succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The test will come that will fully expose us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sooner or later, all of us on the pathway to the kingdom will face the same tests.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Praise the Lord that there is still the way of repentance, weeping, and confessing that brings in the Lord's forgiveness and His further visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For the kingdom, we must have another life and be another person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only after we have passed through all the tests and have suffered all the defeats and failures will we realize our need for another life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Praise the Lord for the strong contrast presented in this chapter!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Peter we see the black, and in the Lord Jesus we see the white.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the way from the garden to the cross, Peter and the other disciples were defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only one man, Jesus, was victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually, He was not even arrested; He handed Himself over to those who came for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, His death was not a matter of compulsion, but a voluntary fulfillment of the prophecies of the Old Testament concerning His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Truly, only the life of Jesus is good for the kingdom.</S>
