   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A blasphemer is one who blasphemes God, and a persecutor is one who persecutes man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Saul of Tarsus, a strict Pharisee Acts 22:3; Phil 3:4-5 , could never have blasphemed God.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here he confessed that this was blasphemy.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Saul of Tarsus persecuted the church in an insulting, destructive way Acts 22:4; Gal 1:13, 23 , just as the insulting Jews persecuted the Lord Jesus Matt 26:59, 67 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul also says that he was ignorant and acted in unbelief.</S>
