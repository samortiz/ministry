   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOURISHING PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AFTER BAPTIZING THEM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>During the time when we were researching how to knock on doors, as soon as a person was baptized and changed his clothes, we would rush out the door to baptize the next person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is no longer our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is best to spend some time to nourish a person immediately after he is baptized and then go back to visit him the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to visit the new believers many times during the first month, because it is easy for them to become sick or to die prematurely.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is best to use the first thirty days to stabilize the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason, those whom we baptize must be visited at least ten times in the first month after their baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Otherwise, they may die prematurely.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During the past decades we baptized many people, but most of them died prematurely and few have remained, because we did not learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus said, I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain John 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The secret to bearing remaining fruit is to nourish them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This can be compared to a baby being fed milk immediately after it is born.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After we baptize someone, we must nourish him immediately and then continue to nourish him during the next thirty days.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>KEEPING A SEPARATING LINE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>IN THE COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Someone asked whether a brother and a sister can coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This must be avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even though this does not break the law, it violates the principle in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must not allow the single brothers and single sisters to have too much personal contact.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is best for them to have as little contact as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There should be a distance between the brothers and the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This has been our practice for many decades.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not approve of two members of the opposite sex being alone together in a room, especially if the door is closed and the room has no windows.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is forbidden.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, we should not think that it is a matter of convenience for a brother to give a sister a ride in a car in order for her to do her shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is fine for a brother to accept a ride from a brother and for a sister to accept a ride from another sister, but it is not acceptable for a brother and a sister to ride together alone in a car.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is absolutely against our principles for a single brother and a single sister to do anything together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must maintain this testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>People who have not received the Lord are not concerned when a man and a woman walk together or do something together, but when a brother and a sister walk together, they lose their testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, this does not mean that unbelievers do not have standards concerning male-female relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, they criticize the Christians who behave as they do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They know that the morality of Christians is very high and that Christians cannot be like other people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We cannot necessarily do things that other people do, even if it is legal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some legal things are not up to our standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must not allow a brother and a sister to do things by themselves alone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A husband and wife can go out together, and no one will say anything because they are married.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But there should be a distance between a brother and a sister who are not married.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Just as the meal offering could not be mingled with honey Lev 2:11 , the brothers and sisters must have a living testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is especially important when we go to the towns and villages to preach the gospel, because the neighbors are watching us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They know that we are a group of people who are preaching Jesus, so they will watch us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the married saints must have a proper relationship so that other people can see that Christians are different.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Male-female relationships are an important aspect of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In human ethics and morality the relationship between a husband and wife is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible condemns anything that damages the marital relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Nothing damages God s creation and the man God created more than improper relationships between males and females.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must remember this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even though I am an old man, I would never allow a sister to take me to get my hair cut when I cannot find a brother to take me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I would rather delay an errand than go against this principle, even though I am already elderly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May we all pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We cannot avoid contacting people when we serve the Lord; hence, we must maintain a proper testimony when we contact members of the opposite sex.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Otherwise, in our service to the Lord, we will encounter problems.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must be very careful in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This especially applies to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The brothers must remember to keep their contact with the sisters pure and in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They should not fall into a situation in which others can criticize them in this area.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today some women do not seem to have any sense of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Shamefacedness is a virtue, and females must have some sense of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is part of the God-created female disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is wrong for a female, especially for a girl who is eighteen or nineteen years old, to be flirtatious or to wear clothing that does not cover her.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Women should have a sense of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The sisters must remember that they are sisters and that they need to be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>More than fifty years ago the China Inland Mission sent many people to China.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They sent at least ninety young sisters from England.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>These young sisters were met by an elderly Western sister in Shanghai whose commission was to help them preach the gospel in China.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In those days the young women in the West liked to wear modern skirts that were shorter than the old-fashioned skirts, which were long and reached the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This elderly sister would invite the young sisters for afternoon tea and snacks.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After tea this elderly sister would spend time to speak with the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>While she was speaking, she would continually pull at her skirt below her knees.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After pulling at her skirt a few times, the young sisters began pulling at their skirts, because they realized that their skirts were short and did not adequately cover them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>According to the Bible, it is a shame, not a glory, for the fallen human body to be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is a shame, not a glory, for a person to expose his back or chest.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the Old Testament times women even covered their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Today women in Islamic countries cover their entire face.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In principle, it is better for less of the body to be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When we cover ourselves, we cover our shame.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After the fall man s first sense was to be ashamed of his nakedness; therefore, Adam and Eve made loincloths to cover their shame Gen 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When we go out to spread the gospel, we must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We are all co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In our service it is difficult to avoid contact between brothers and sisters; therefore, we must understand the situation and maintain these principles.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Brothers must remain in their position as brothers and not be loose in their speech.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Sisters must remember that they are females and keep the feminine virtue of shamefacedness.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In this way, the Lord will preserve us.</S>
