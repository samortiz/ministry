   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then what is being godly?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Timothy 3:16 says, "And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh..."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Godliness is God being manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that God is expressed through man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's life was manifested in the Lord Jesus the Head of the church .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the same way, His life is manifested in those who believe in Him the church .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, godliness is simply God's life in us being manifested through our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are saved to the extent that our thoughts, words, actions, and attitudes no longer reflect our self but become the living of Christ, we are living a life of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is what God requires from us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He wants to extend the manifestation of God in the flesh through us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second Timothy 3:12 mentions "to live godly..."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that we should be godly in our living, so that others will see God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The way we speak should make others feel the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The way we walk and act should make others feel the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even our attire, the furniture in our house, the decor of our dwelling, and our whole living should give others the impression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we contact others, they should sense God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is being godly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Unfortunately, it is hard to find even a few among a hundred Christians who live in a godly way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We often find many brothers and sisters who are ungirded in their loins and undisciplined in their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They joke with each other and jest without having any feeling at all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They privately indulge in drinking and gambling without any sense of remorse within.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is because many so-called Christians do not know the meaning of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Consequently, they do not have a godly living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Having the form of godliness, while denying its power, is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But one who has the power of godliness will surely not be void of the form of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Godliness originates from God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The essence of God's life is godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When this life is manifested in us, the result is surely godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The trouble with man is that he is full of the self; he is still fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, the life of godliness is frustrated from expressing itself freely.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a Christian does not have any sense of godliness, he is either void of life or living in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As long as a Christian is living in the light, he will always have consciousness within, although the degree of consciousness may vary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If he thinks, speaks, and acts according to an inward consciousness of godliness, he will become a godly man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why one has to exercise himself unto godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First Timothy 4:7 says, "But the profane and old-womanish myths refuse, and exercise yourself unto godliness."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This shows that the exercise of godliness is very related to the bridling of our words.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Careless words are a sure sign of ungodliness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should be living and fresh, but we must allow God to express Himself through our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Titus 2:12 says, "Training us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts..."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Godliness is not a question of the heart; it is a way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Godliness is God being manifested in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let me repeat again.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is fear?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a condition of the heart; it is being afraid of the presence of the self in everything and constantly being in fear of offending God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is godliness?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Godliness is a way of living; it is expressing God in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The principle of God's work is always from the inside to the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a man only pays attention to the form of godliness without caring for the life of godliness, his conduct is just a performance without the power and reality of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is genuine godliness when a person, in a fearful way, becomes apprehensive of his self-activity and constantly refuses, opposes, and condemns all ungodly thoughts, words, acts, moves, and attitudes to the extent that he becomes restricted in his outward behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When he moves away from this restriction, he becomes uneasy within; he is condemned and no longer at peace within.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must learn to fear and exercise ourselves unto godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May the Lord have a way among us.</S>
