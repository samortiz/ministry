 <h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&mdash;THEIR PRESENT</h1>
<h1 class="title">(8)</h1>
<p>We have seen that, concerning their present, the believers have been called by God, they have been separated unto God by the Spirit, they have repented, they have believed, and they have been baptized. Now we need to see that the believers have been joined to the processed Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. Joined to the Processed Triune God</h2>
<p>The believers have been joined to the processed Triune God through believing and through being baptized. We have believed into Christ (John 3:15-16), the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9), and we have been baptized into Him (Gal. 3:27). Believing and being baptized are actually one complete step by which we enter into the Triune God. In this way we are joined to the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>Matthew 28:19 indicates that the believers are baptized into the name, the person, of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This is to be baptized into the processed Triune God. To be baptized into the Triune God is to be brought into an organic union with Him. We sinners, after believing into the Lord Jesus, have been baptized into the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This produces an organic union between us and the Triune God. Now we, the baptized ones, are in this organic union. Having been baptized into the processed Triune God to be in the organic union with the Triune God, we have been joined to God the Father, to God the Son, and to God the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">a. To God the Father<br />
as the Source of the Divine Trinity</h2>
<p>The believers are joined to God the Father as the source, the origin, of the divine Trinity. This is indicated by John 13:3 and 1 Corinthians 6:19b. John 13:3 says, &ldquo;Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands, and that He had come forth from God, and was going to God.&rdquo; In John 8:42 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;I came forth out of God and am come from Him,&rdquo; and in 16:28 He says, &ldquo;I came forth out of the Father.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus came from a wonderful source&mdash; the almighty, infinite God. The Lord&rsquo;s source was not Nazareth, Bethlehem, or even heaven. His source was the Father.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 6:19b speaks of &ldquo;the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God.&rdquo; First Corinthians 2:12 speaks of &ldquo;the Spirit which is from God,&rdquo; and John 15:26 reveals that the Spirit of reality proceeds from the Father. Hence, the Father is the source of the Spirit. As the source of the Lord Jesus and the Spirit, God the Father is thus the source of the divine Trinity, and we, as believers in Christ, have been joined to this source.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(1) Having Turned to Him through Repentance</h2>
<p>The believers have been joined to God the Father by turning to Him through repentance. They have turned from the authority of Satan to God (Acts 26:18). To repent is to have a change of mind with regret for the past and a turn for the future. Through repentance we have turned to God from all things other than God. As believers who have been joined to the processed Triune God, we have had a full turn to God the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head4">(2) Baptized into Him</h2>
<p>According to Matthew 28:19b, the believers have been baptized into the name, the person, of the Father. They have been baptized into the riches of the Father, and, as indicated by the word &ldquo;into,&rdquo; they have been brought into a spiritual and mystical union with Him, that is, into an organic union with Him. Thus, they have been joined to God the Father by being baptized into Him.</p>
