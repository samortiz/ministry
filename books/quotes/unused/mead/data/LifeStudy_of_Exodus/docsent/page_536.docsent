   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST FOR GOD S ADMINISTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In one of the messages on the golden incense altar we pointed out that the incense altar is the administrative center of God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The tabernacle with the outer court reveals God s plan, God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This plan, this economy, is carried out by means of an administration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The incense altar is the center of God s administration, the divine White House.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everything else in the tabernacle and the outer court is for the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that the bronze altar is for the golden altar.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, the lampstand, the showbread table, and even the ark are for the golden altar of incense.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our experience we begin at the altar of burnt offering, the bronze altar in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then we go to the showbread table, to the lampstand, and to the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After we have been to the ark, we come to this administrative center to burn the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The incense we burn at this altar is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, the incense that ascends to God is our going to God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This matter is deep.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It means that our going to God in a proper way is Christ for God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A deep matter such as the burning of the incense can only be understood by experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you reach the point where you have this experience, you will see that your experience is exactly portrayed by the type of the incense in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You go to God in prayer, and your prayer is your going to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, this going to God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is your prayer, a sweet-smelling fragrance to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The prayer that ascends to Him as a sweet-smelling fragrance is God s administration and carries out God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God has no other way to carry out His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we persist in seeking the Lord, eventually our experience will bring us into the realization of the fact that our prayer is simply Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our prayer is Christ, and it is also our going to God in Christ, with Christ, and even as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This kind of prayer not only satisfies God with a sweet-smelling fragrance, but simultaneously carries out God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE WAY TO THE INCENSE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Old Testament the serving priests were required to come to the altar before entering the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At that point the priests had two needs they needed the blood to cleanse them, and they needed food to nourish them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The bronze altar in the outer court supplied the priests these two needs.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The blood washed them of their sins, and the meat nourished them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When they came to this altar, they were unclean and empty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Outwardly, they were defiled; inwardly, they were empty.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, they needed the blood shed on the altar to cleanse them of their defilement, and they needed the meat of the offerings to satisfy their hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After being cleansed and fed at the altar, the priests could move on.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that the supply at the bronze altar equipped them and qualified them to enter the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Spontaneously they could come to the showbread table to receive a further supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that our eating must be continual.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not eat once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is one kind of eating at the bronze altar, and there is a continuation of our eating at the showbread table.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The life supply on the showbread table brought the priests to the lampstand, where they received light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The life supply always brings forth light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do not eat at the showbread table, we shall be in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But feeding at this table brings us to the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that, experientially, this feeding produces light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many of us have experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Early in the morning we offer Christ as our sin offering and as our trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We experience this at the bronze altar in the outer court, where we are cleansed and fed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This strengthens us to continue our enjoyment of Christ at the showbread table, where we take Him as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The life supply always turns us to the light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How much light we receive depends on how much of the life supply we enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The light received at the lampstand guides us to the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There at the ark we contact God, and God s presence leads us to the golden altar of incense, the place of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once we are in God s presence, His presence turns us to the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words, it turns us to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Spontaneously, anyone who comes into God s presence will pray; no one can hold back the prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we pray, we are no longer at the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead, we are at the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have pointed out that the incense altar is very close to the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Regarding the incense, 30:36 says, And you shall grind some of it very fine, and put some of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What is the testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The testimony is the law inside the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For this reason, the ark is called the ark of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Verse 36 indicates that the incense altar was directly in front of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although there was a veil separating the ark from the incense altar, they were still very close.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to the record in the Bible, sometimes the incense altar was within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The meaning of the closeness of the ark and the incense altar is that the kind of prayer which is Christ Himself is the outcome of our contact with God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We may also say that it is the result of being in God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we would enter into God s presence, we must first come to the bronze altar.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then we must spend time at the showbread table and the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The lampstand will eventually guide us to the ark, where God meets with us on the propitiatory-cover.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Now we are in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The outcome of being in His presence is the prayer that is Christ ascending to God as incense.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If your experience has not come to this point, this word may seem strange to you, and you will not understand what I am talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But if you have had even some amount of experience, you will understand my word and feel very good about it, knowing that it is true.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A PICTURE OF TWO-WAY TRAFFIC</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Have you ever paid careful attention to these two pictures in Exodus 30, the one of the ointment and the other of the incense?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The significance of these pictures is tremendous.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The significance here is that of two-way traffic, the coming and the going.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As we have pointed out, the ointment is coming to us, and the incense is going to God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Christ as the Spirit coming to us is the ointment, and Christ ascending from us to God is the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The ointment is toward us; the incense is toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The ointment is for us to enjoy, and the incense is for God s enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We should not think that the incense is for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we try to enjoy it ourselves, we shall be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Exodus 30:38 speaks clearly concerning this: Whoever makes any like it, to smell it, he shall be cut off from his people.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Incense is absolutely and entirely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, there is an enjoyment for us, and this enjoyment is the ointment, the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We have emphasized the fact that with the ointment the priests and all the parts of the tabernacle were anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The incense is God s portion.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The ointment is Christ for us; the incense is Christ for God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In our experience we should not only have one-way traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This means that we should not only have Christ coming to us but also have Christ going back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We need to have two-way traffic, God coming to us through Christ and our going to God through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We should complete the circuit by burning the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Therefore, we need the anointing ointment, and we need the burning of the incense as well.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God anoints us with the ointment, and we burn the incense to God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In the next two messages we shall consider in detail the elements of the incense.</S>
