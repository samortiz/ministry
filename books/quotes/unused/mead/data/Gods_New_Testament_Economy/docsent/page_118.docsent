   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The seventh implication of the wall is that it protects God s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is the circumference of the interest of God, which is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whatever is protected within this wall is the very kingdom of God, and this kingdom of God is the economy of God to carry out God s eternal purpose, which is made according to His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church in every locality today should be such a separated and protected entity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There should be nothing in the church but God s desire.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is in resurrection that man will be like the angels Matt 22:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, a measure of a man, that is, of an angel signifies that the wall of the city is not natural but in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The entire wall is something transformed and built up in resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many of the sisters would like to be angels, but we must remember that if we want to be like an angel, we have to be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the natural life, everyone is a scorpion, gopher, or turtle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But hallelujah, there is a hope that in resurrection we could be transformed to be like angels.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The wall is something transformed and built up in resurrection so its measurement is one hundred and forty-four cubits, signifying absolute perfection and eternal completion of absolute perfections and eternal completions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A hundred forty-four is twelve times twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Twelve signifies absolute perfection and eternal completion in God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The wall refers to God s administration because it encircles, sanctifies, and protects the city.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Within this protected city is God s throne to carry out His administration, which is absolutely perfect and eternally complete.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No other number should be ascribed to the church life but twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the New Jerusalem everything is perfect and complete for God s complete and eternal administration.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>ITS FOUNDATION Built with Twelve Kinds of Precious Stones</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Twelve foundations Rev 21:14a signify the foundation of absolute perfection and eternal completion in God s administration.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we have seen, the twelve names of the twelve tribes inscribed on the twelve gates of the city indicates that the twelve gates are there to fulfill the requirement of the law and to satisfy the law s demand upon sinners.</S>

   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whatever we do according to God s nature, we immediately have the deep sensation of the flow of life watering us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The one tree of life growing on the two sides of the river Rev 22:2 signifies that the tree of life is a vine, spreading and proceeding along the flow of the water of life for God s people to receive and enjoy.</S>
