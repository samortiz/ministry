<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Exchanging the Reality of God<br>for the Falsehood, the Vanity, of Idols</H2><P>Israel exchanged the reality of God for the falsehood, the vanity, of idols (Jer. 2:5). They "exchanged the truth of God for the lie" (Rom. 1:25a). All idols are vanity; thus, to pursue an idol is to pursue vanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Worshipping and Serving<br>the Creation Rather Than the Creator</H2><P>Israel worshipped and served the creation rather than the Creator (Rom. 1:25b). They worshipped and served not only the things of God's creation but also the things of their own creation&#151;idols of wood, stone, and metal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Seeking the Egyptians' and Assyrians' Help<br>instead of Seeking God's Blessing</H2><P>Israel sought the Egyptians' and Assyrians' help (man's help) instead of seeking God's blessing (Jer. 2:17-18, 36; Isa. 31:3). They did not trust in God's blessing but in man's help.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. As the Wife of Jehovah,<br>Forsaking Her Chastity to Commit Fornication</H2><P>As the wife of Jehovah, Israel forsook her chastity to commit fornication, having a harlot's forehead and refusing to be ashamed (Jer. 2:20, 23-25; 3:1-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Practicing Apostasies<br>Rather Than Keeping Her Faithfulness</H2><P>Israel practiced apostasies rather than keeping her faithfulness (2:19). Apostasy is a matter of leaving the way of God and taking another way to follow things other than God. This is what Israel did.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Increasing the Number of Their Gods<br>according to the Number of Their Cities</H2><P>Israel increased the number of their gods (idols) according to the number of their cities (vv. 27-28). Wherever there was a city, there was an idol.</P>
