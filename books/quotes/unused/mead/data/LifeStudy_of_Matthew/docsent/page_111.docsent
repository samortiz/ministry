   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Healing of the Daughter</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Ruler of the Synagogue</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verses 23 through 26 we have the healing of the synagogue ruler s daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The daughter here and Peter s mother-in-law in 8:14-15, both representing the Jews at the end of this age, were healed in a house by the Lord s coming and direct touch.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that at the end of this age all the remnant of the Jews will be saved in the house of Israel by the Lord s coming and His direct touch Rom 11:25-26; Zech 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Jesus came into the ruler s house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a tumult, He said, Depart, for the girl has not died, but sleeps.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In His ministry, the Lord never cared for any crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 25 says, But when the crowd was put out, He entered and took hold of her hand, and the girl was raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By this we see that the Lord Jesus intended to raise the Jews, but that they did not have the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This gave an excellent chance to the Gentiles to contact the Lord to receive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus will reach the house of Israel, and all the dead Jews will be healed.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Blindness signifies lack of sight in seeing God and the things related to Him 2 Cor 4:4; Rev 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These two blind men called the Lord the Son of David.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the millennial kingdom, which will be the restored tabernacle of David Acts 15:16 , the Messianic kingdom, the Jews will recognize Christ as the Son of David, and their blindness will be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is typified by the two blind men recognizing Christ in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The two blind men were healed in the house by the Lord s direct touch v. 29 , as were both the daughter of the ruler v. 25 and Peter s mother-in-law 8:14-15 .

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A Shadow of the Millennium</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The healing of the blind and the dumb signifies the restoration to the people on earth during the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, these healings are a shadow of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the millennium all the blind will see, and the mouths of the dumb will be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Isaiah 35:5 and 6 say, Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before such a revival, so many Christians are blind, unable to see God or the things of God, and dumb, unable to speak a word for God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If those in the denominations today are asked to give a prayer, many are unable to do so and they will reply, This is not my job, my profession.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ask the pastor to pray.</S>
