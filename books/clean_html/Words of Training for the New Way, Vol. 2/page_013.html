<h2 class="head3">Establishing Home Meetings</h2>
<p>Visiting people&rsquo;s homes by door-knocking for preaching the gospel is our first step. Immediately following that is the establishing of home meetings. Your baptizing a person equals giving him birth. You have the responsibility to feed him and take care of him; otherwise, it will be very easy for him to have an early death. Therefore, you need to set up a home meeting immediately in the new believer&rsquo;s home. In order to establish home meetings, you need to start first with your own home to have home meetings with your own wife or husband and children to live a normal church life. In this way, you can lead the newly saved ones to have home meetings and to live a normal church life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Speaking to One Another<br />
and Listening to One Another</h2>
<p>Following that, you need to practice speaking to one another and listening to one another in the meetings. Regardless of whether they are large meetings or small meetings, we need to stay away from the habit of one speaking and the rest listening. We must overthrow this tradition of Christianity and change to speaking to one another and listening to one another. In order to achieve this, we need to endeavor together and have a spiritual and victorious living daily. We need to live in spirit every day and fellowship with the Lord moment by moment, in order to be filled with the Spirit inwardly and outwardly. By this we can go to the new ones&rsquo; homes to lead them to enjoy the Lord together. Therefore, to live a spiritual and victorious life is very necessary. Anyone who does not live a spiritual and victorious life is through with his church life and service.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Building Up the Local Churches<br />
for the Building Up of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>Up to this point, you can realize that the new way is not merely knocking on doors for preaching the gospel, nor does it stop at building up home meetings. The new way further requires us to be living persons who can speak and also listen. Hence, we all need to have a spiritual and victorious living, live in spirit moment by moment, walk according to the Spirit, and be burning in spirit. Eventually, all these are not for ourselves, but for the establishing of the local churches for the building up of the Body of Christ, which is the universal church. This is the practice of the new way in the subjective aspect. This begins with the dispensing of the Triune God into people that they may receive Him, call upon His name, and be baptized into His name. It continues with the feeding and caring for people and the establishing of home meetings in their homes to eventually build up the local churches.</p>
<p>May we all see that the new way is the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The new way is inclusive. It starts with knocking on doors for preaching the gospel to dispense the Triune God into people; then it continues with establishing home meetings in the believers&rsquo; homes, with speaking to one another and listening to one another, for the building up of the local churches. When we are building the local churches in this way, we are building up the Body of Christ, the universal church. I hope that you all can listen to this word completely, thoroughly, and comprehensively. When you return to your respective localities to speak, you must also speak completely, thoroughly, and comprehensively. May the Lord have mercy on us!</p>
