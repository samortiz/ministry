<p>The issue of the threefold dispensing of the Triune God is through our spirit of revelation (v. 17) and by the exceeding greatness of His power toward us (v. 19). This great power is according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead (v. 20), that is, in resurrection; in seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies far above all (vv. 20b-21), that is, in ascension; in subjecting all things under His feet (v. 22a), that is, making Him above everything; and in giving Him to be Head over all things to the church (v. 22b). Such a power has been applied to us, and the application of this power is the life-dispensing. It is by the life-dispensing of the Triune God that such a power, even a power of surpassing greatness, has been applied to all of us.</p>
<p>The result, or issue, of this dispensing is the church, the Body of Christ. How can sinners become the Body of Christ? This is only by the divine life-dispensing. When the Triune God dispenses Himself into us, this life-dispensing saturates our entire being and causes us to become regenerated, transformed, and even transparent members of Christ. Therefore, we are now the Body of Christ, which is an organism, not an organization. We may say that a chair is organized of many pieces of wood. In contrast, a man is an organism because he is organic. When the Triune God dispenses Himself into our being, this life-dispensing makes us organic. Together all of us are an organism, and this organism is the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is not a social organization. It is something organic, an entity saturated by the life-dispensing of the Triune God. The so-called churches are for the most part organizations instead of an organism. The church must be an organism that is fully organic. The church must be full of life-dispensing, saturated with the Triune God in every part. This is the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is the fullness of the universal Christ. The fullness of a person is his body. If a person had only a head and no body, he would not have any fullness. But with a body, there is the fullness. The Body of Christ, which is the church, is the fullness of this great, universal Christ who fills all in all (v. 23). How can this be? It can be only by the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. Thus Ephesians 1 reveals the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</p>
<p>The Body comes into being not by organizing, but only by life-dispensing. It comes into being only by the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;dispensing Himself as life and life supply into all His believers, saturating them and thereby making them the Body of Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Divine Dispensing of the Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 57</div><br></body></html>
