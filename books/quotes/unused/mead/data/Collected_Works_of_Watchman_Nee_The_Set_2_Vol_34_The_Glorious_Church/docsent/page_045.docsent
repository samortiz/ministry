   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CITY, THE GATES, AND THE WALL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us continue in our reading of Revelation 21.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must give special attention to the wall of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 12 says, "It had a great and high wall."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 15 says, "He who spoke with me had a golden reed as a measure that he might measure the city and its gates and its wall."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 17 says, "And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the beginning God made a garden in Eden, and the serpent was able to come into this garden to speak to Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shows us that there was no wall surrounding the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God originally intended for Adam to keep the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In other words, His intention was that Adam would be the wall of the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, Adam did not guard it, and Satan entered.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But what about the New Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Jerusalem has a wall.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On one hand, a wall includes, and on the other hand, it excludes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It includes and keeps everything that is within the city, and it excludes and rejects everything that is outside the city.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When there is a wall surrounding a city, it serves to separate everything that is within the city from everything that is outside; it serves to make a difference between them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The New Jerusalem is the new man whom God has desired to obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The new man is in God's presence and separated from all that is outside.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The serpent can no longer creep in. There is a wall, a separation, a distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every possibility of the serpent entering again has been eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When describing the New Jerusalem, the first thing that is mentioned other than God's glory is the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Separation, therefore, is one of the most important principles in a Christian's living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If there is no separation, the Christian is of no value.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There must be a line that is drawn to differentiate that which is spiritual from that which is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The New Jerusalem has a separation, a boundary line, and we need to learn a lesson from this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everything that is of Babylon must be rejected, while everything that is of God must be protected.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To build a city wall is not an easy thing, because Satan hates a wall more than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem to build the wall, Sanballat and Tobiah came and made every effort to stop the building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nehemiah held a spear in one hand, and with the other hand, he built the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must pray, therefore, that God will enable us to bear spiritual arms in order to wrestle with spiritual wickedness in high places and in order to maintain the principle of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The city has twelve gates and twelve foundations, and on the foundations are the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This tells us that everything in the city is based upon the principles of the kingdom of God preached by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephesians 2:20 says, "Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that the revelation which the apostles obtained is the foundation of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The gates are for going in and out, but why are the names of the twelve tribes of Israel written upon them?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus said that salvation is of the Jews John 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have learned everything related to God from Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The law was given to Israel, redemption is known through Israel, and salvation has come from Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, the names of the twelve tribes of Israel are on the gates.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The city has three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are three gates in each direction.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Gates are usually located in a convenient place to go in and out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the fact that this city has gates on all four sides indicates that it is located in a very central position and that it is the center of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The New Jerusalem is the masterpiece in the center of God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the gates there are twelve angels to keep the entrance Rev 21:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Formerly cherubim guarded the way of the tree of life, but now the tree of life in the city is guarded by angels at the gates.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The angels are ministering spirits Heb 1:14 , and the day is coming when angels will be subject to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Revelation 21:15 says, "And he who spoke with me had a golden reed as a measure that he might measure the city and its gates and its wall."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Gold in the Bible represents all that is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The city being measured with gold means that the city can be measured by God's standard and corresponds with God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to seek God's glory, hoping that we will be able to meet God's standard when we are measured in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 16 says, "And the city lies square, and its length is as great as the breadth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And he measured the city with the reed to a length of twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is another place in the Bible where the measurements of length, breadth, and height are equal, that is the Holy of Holies in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof" 1 Kings 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The length, the breadth, and the height are all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the Bible, only the Holy of Holies in the temple and the city of the New Jerusalem have equal measurements of length, breadth, and height.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In other words, in the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem becomes the Holy of Holies to God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When David gave Solomon the pattern for the temple, he said, "All this...the Lord made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern" 1 Chron 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Everything in the temple was built according to divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem is the very temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Everything that constitutes the city is something in God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is nothing that is outside of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Revelation 21:17 says, "And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today can we say that the measure of a man is that of an angel?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No, never.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At what time will the measure of a man be equal to that of an angel?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord Jesus said that in the resurrection man will be equal to the angels Luke 20:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The one hundred and forty-four cubits will be revealed when man's measure is equal to an angel's measure.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In other words, everything within this city is in the reality of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Thank God, of all the things included in this city, there is nothing which is not in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Everything that is dead and everything that is of man is outside the city, but inside everything is resurrected and of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Resurrection means that which is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everything that is of man, once it dies, can never be raised up, but everything that is of God, though it passes through death, will rise again.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Whatever cannot be bound or held by death is called resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When that which originates from us passes through the cross, it is brought to an end, but nothing of God can be touched by death.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When John recorded the description of the city, all the numbers he used were twelve or products of twelve twelve gates, twelve foundations, twelve apostles, twelve tribes, etc. The measurement of the city wall is one hundred and forty-four cubits, the product of twelve times twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Twelve is the number used in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is the most precious number in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the first part of Revelation, there are many sevens seven churches, seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls, seven angels, etc. But in the latter part, there are many twelves, such as those already mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Seven means perfection, and twelve also means perfection, but they are not altogether the same.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Seven is composed of three plus four, while twelve is composed of three multiplied by four.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Since God is the Triune God, the number three represents God, while four is the number which represents creation, such as the four winds, the four seasons, and the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When three is added to four, it means that God is added to man.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>How complete and perfect it is to have the Creator plus the creature!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But anything which is added can also be subtracted and thereby lost again; so this completion is not a lasting one.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But in the New Jerusalem, the union of God and man is no longer seven, but twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is no longer three plus four, but three multiplied by four.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Multiplication is a perfect union, something which can never be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When the Creator mingles with the creature it is twelve, and twelve is the number of perfect union.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In the new heaven and new earth, God and man will become one, and God and man can no longer be separated.</S>
