   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"The hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What hour will that be?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible is not silent concerning this hour.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Old Testament prophets, the Lord Jesus Himself, and the apostle Paul all prophesied about this hour.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jeremiah said concerning this day, "Alas!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For that day is great, / And there is none like it; / And it is a time of distress for Jacob" Jer 30:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time, God said, "I will make a full end of all the nations to which I have scattered you; / But I will not make a full end of you" v. 11 . Daniel also spoke of this time: "And there will be a time of distress, such as never occurred since there came to be a nation until that time" Dan 12:1 . "The day of the Lord" as prophesied by the Old Testament prophets mainly refers to this day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus also spoke of this day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He said that in that day, "Nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All these are the beginning of birth pangs" Matt 24:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said that when that day arrives, "there will be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor shall by any means ever occur" Matt 24:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul also spoke of this time: "When they say, Peace and security, then sudden destruction comes upon them, just as birth pangs to a woman with child; and they shall by no means escape" 1 Thes 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Events during this time will initially center around Judea Matt 24 , but will eventually spread all over the world Rev 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why it says here: "The hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This great trial will only be an "hour" in the "great and dreadful day" Mal 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, it will only be for a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This short time will last for only three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord Jesus appears in glory, this hour will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The world, the flesh, and the trials of Satan are fierce enough now.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Will they become more fierce in the future?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Indeed, when that time comes, trials which the whole world has never experienced will all come.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the beginning of this time, Satan will be cast out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He knows that his time is short, and he will be in great wrath, tormenting those in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He will hand over his authority and power to his minister, who will set up a throne on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His minister will assume to be the Messiah and will blaspheme God on the one hand and cause men to worship him on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All worldly and satanic powers will come to his support.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He will be sustained by both human as well as demonic strength.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the perishing ones will be zealous for him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His false prophets will raise up many idolatrous things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone will have to be sealed by him, without which seal no one will be able to buy and sell.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time, the false Christ will come "according to Satan's operation in all power and signs and wonders of a lie" 2 Thes 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The atmosphere, environment, laws, and punishments then will all be geared toward the worshipping of Antichrist and the receiving of his seal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who will not worship will die, and those who will not receive the seal will also die.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But then, to worship means eternal perdition, and to be sealed means to perish eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, "here is the endurance and the faith of the saints" Rev 13:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because of the ferocity of Satan and the sinfulness of the world, God's wrath will roll continuously from heaven see Rev 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How great will the influence of this trial be?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It will come upon "the whole inhabited earth"!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only will the Jews and the Gentiles suffer, even the whole inhabited earth will fall under Satan's snare.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Despite the fact that there will be severe calamities befalling those inhabitants around the Mediterranean Sea, the area where the Roman Empire stood and where the kingdom of Antichrist will be, the power of Satan on that day will reach all inhabited lands.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"And permission was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them; and authority was given to him over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And all those dwelling on the earth will worship him, every one whose name is not written in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world" Rev 13:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In that day, no nation in the world will escape his power.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What then is the purpose of this shocking trial?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"To try them who dwell on the earth"!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who dwell on the earth think that the world will become better each day and that it will even be turned into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They boast and brag about their progress.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even the church considers itself highly and thinks that it has become more advanced than before.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It links itself with the worldly politicians and social reformers and tries to reform the world cursed under sin, making the latter more comfortable for the sinner to dwell in forever.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They will learn in their suffering that nothing is trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everything that they trust in and love will be overturned.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All beauty and ideals will be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The real condition of men's heart toward God and toward each other will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All corruption, bitterness, and hypocrisy will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The world will be operated on according to the Lord Jesus and His truth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The righteousness of the Jew will be but dust before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The justice of the Gentiles will become mere terminology before His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The world, whether the Jewish part, the Gentile part, or the church, will declare its true condition before Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God's goal is to expose man's true condition Luke 2:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>His truth and Satan's lies will be presented before men at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At that time, man will see that he prefers the deception of Satan to God and His Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The excuses of today are only disguises.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who are tried are all those "who dwell on the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Their hearts are with their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Their homes, fame, position, and wealth are all in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On that day, the great trial will show how great their foolishness is.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God has no intention to ill-treat His own people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God's purpose is not for His people to be judged with the world 1 Cor 11:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, because the believers mix themselves with the worldly ones and participate in their sins, they are involved and affected when the worldly ones are tested.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Since the believers have fellowship with them in heart, it is inevitable that they suffer with them in body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The scriptural teaching is that those who mingle with the world suffer the punishment of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should be so separated from the world that we are not conformed to the world Rom 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Of course, eternal life is guaranteed.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, the three and a half years of trial on earth is not something that all regenerated ones will be able to avoid.</S>
