   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>COMMITTING OUR SOULS TO A FAITHFUL CREATOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 19 Peter continues, Wherefore, let those also who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in welldoing to a faithful Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Persecution can damage only the body of the suffering believers; it cannot damage their souls Matt 10:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Their souls are kept by the Lord as the faithful Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They should cooperate with the Lord by their faithful commitment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word commit here literally means to give in charge as a deposit, as in Luke 12:48; Acts 20:32; 1 Timothy 1:18; and 2 Timothy 2:2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the believers suffer persecution in their body, especially as in martyrdom, they should commit their souls as a deposit to God, the faithful Creator, as the Lord committed His spirit to the Father Luke 23:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Creator spoken of in verse 19 is not the Creator of the new creation in the new birth, but the Creator of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Persecution is a suffering in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God as our Creator can preserve our soul, which He created for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has even numbered our hairs Matt 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is loving and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His loving and faithful care 1 Pet 5:7 accompanies His justice in His governmental administration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>While He is judging us, as His household, in His government, in His love He cares for us faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In suffering His just disciplinary judgment in our body, we should commit our souls to His faithful care.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Peter is a book on the Christian life under the government of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is easy for us to pay attention to the Christian life and to neglect God s government.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, the Christian life and the government of God go together.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Triune God has passed through a long process and has become the life-giving Spirit to indwell us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is for our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the same time, the Triune God is still the Creator of the universe and its ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, we have been reborn to have a spiritual life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the other hand, we are still in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this reason, we need God s governmental dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order for the Christian life to grow, we need the discipline of God s government.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The preciousness of Peter s writings is that he combines the Christian life and God s government.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul did the same thing, but he did not do it in such a clear way as Peter did.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Peter s writings show us that the Christian life and the government of God go together as a pair.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we would carefully read the two Epistles of Peter, we would see that Peter is quite deep in the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first chapter of 2 Peter, in particular, is rich, deep, and profound in the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But at the same time in his writings Peter gives a serious word regarding God s governmental dealings with His regenerated people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, in the Epistles of Peter we need to see the Christian life and God s government and also see how the two go together.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>KNOWING THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>ACCORDING TO THE PURE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the past, most of us received little more than traditional Christian teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through the notes in the Recovery Version and through all the Life-study Messages, I am burdened to present the basic matters in the Word to the Lord s people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we take these matters into us and allow them to make a permanent impression upon us, I believe that in the coming years we shall see a great change, even a change that will revolutionize our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I hope that after a number of years these messages will issue in a very positive result.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>My desire is to see that God s truth, according to His pure Word, will be prevailing throughout this country.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In spite of the opposition, I believe that eventually the seeking ones will read the messages and come to know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>My immediate concern is that those of us in the Lord s recovery will have a clear view of all the basic matters in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, I am deeply sorry that some who have been in the recovery for many years still are not able to say an adequate word regarding many things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 3:15 Peter says, But sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, being always ready for a defense to everyone who asks of you an account concerning the hope in you, but with meekness and fear.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This indicates that we all need to be able to speak forth God s truth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I hope that the time you spend in all these messages on 1 Peter will help you in this regard.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am not happy if the saints are merely excited over what they see and hear in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>My desire is that the hands of all the saints would be filled with the solid things of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you cannot remember all the details of what Peter says concerning God s governmental judgment, I hope that you will at least remember the basic points and also know where more detailed information is found.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, you need to remember such verses as 1:17, 2:23, and 4:5.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may also want to refer believers whom you contact to the notes in the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You may say to them, You claim that we are teaching heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I urge you to read for yourself what Witness Lee has taught.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you do this, you will realize that this man leads us to the truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do you not want to know the Word of God?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us open 1 Peter and consider some verses related to God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I ask you to be fair and discern who it is who is heretical and what is the truth of God according to His pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All of us need to personally carry out God s truth through our life, knowledge, and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then God will have a way to accomplish His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Otherwise, He will have to wait, perhaps for hundreds of years.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord s people have been veiled and drugged by traditional teachings for too long.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am burdened that the Lord may have a way and that all the saints would have a proper knowledge of God s truth according to the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All the elders need to be clear concerning the condition of the churches with respect to the knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The elders may need to reconsider their way of shepherding the saints and overseeing them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to find a way to get the truth into the saints so that everyone will be full of truth and full of experience of life according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For example, the saints should know the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They should be able to open this Gospel to others and point out the truth to them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should be able to do the same with the Gospel of John, the Epistles of Peter, the book of Revelation, and, in fact, all of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We need to be able to help others have a clear definition of many aspects of God s truth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we can do this, then we shall have a better way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I am concerned that many among us still have only a superficial grasp of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I do not like to hear shouting and the so-called release of the spirit that is lacking in content.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is good to shout praise to the Lord and to release our spirit, but this must be filled with content.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we are filled with the solid content of truth in knowledge, life, and experience, we shall have a firm foundation for our praise and release.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We shall also be able to show others that we have a basis for the shouting of praises and the release of the spirit.</S>
