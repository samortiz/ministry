<h2 class="head2">A Worker Not Being Bound<br />by One Locality or One Assembly  </h2><p>They worked in Iconium and started another assembly. Acts 14:4 indicates that the multitude of the city was divided into two groups. Some followed the Jews, and some followed the apostles. This shows that the number was quite large. Verse 6 says that the apostles fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the "surrounding" region because some were trying to treat them outrageously. According to the Bible, the Lord has no intention for a worker to go to a place and remain there. A worker should be above any locality or any assembly. An apostle is for the whole church. In Lystra Paul healed a lame man. Verse 20 says that the disciples "sur- rounded" Paul, and verse 21 tells us that there was a "considerable number of disciples." This proves that there were many disciples. Although Paul was wounded, he rested only for a night and went to Derbe the next day. He did not go to Derbe to recuperate from his wound, but to preach the gospel.</p><p>Paul and Barnabas passed through all these places. Once a number of people were saved, they moved on to another place. They did not stay in a church to "edify" men. Paul kept moving forward to sow. After he went through all the places, then he returned to build up the saints. They went forward first to establish the churches, and then returned later to strengthen them.</p><p>Acts 14:23 says that the two appointed elders in all the churches. They appointed elders in "every" church; there was no exception. We would think that an assembly needs ten or twenty years before some saints mature and are old enough to be appointed as elders. But the apostles handed over the responsibility of the assembly to the local brothers very quickly. The workers are responsible for the extra-local work of the assembly. The local responsibility must be taken up by the local brothers.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE ELDERS</h2><h2 class="head2">The Appointment of the Elders</h2><p>The Bible gives us very brief qualifications of the elders. When a worker goes to a place, he cannot appoint elders immediately. When he returns from another place and sees that a group of saints are still meeting, he can be assured that they are trustworthy. From among them, he will spontaneously find some who are particularly seeking spiritually and appoint them as elders.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORKS OF AN ELDER</h2><p>An elder does not monopolize everything in the church. The works of the elders are: (1) managing the administrative affairs of the church, taking the lead in receiving the saints, making arrangements for the meetings, and collecting offerings; and (2) caring for the local believers, preaching regularly to the congregation, and nurturing the brothers and sisters spiritually. Administration and preaching are the main responsibilities of the elders. According to 1 Timothy 5:17 there are two kinds of elders. One kind takes the lead in the church. The other kind not only takes the lead in the church, but labors in the word and teaching. The regular preaching and shepherding work in a local church belongs to the elders; they are not the work of the apostles.</p><p>Titus 1:9 says that the elders have to hold to the faithful word and to exhort and convict by the healthy teaching. This shows us that an elder must not only bear administrative responsibility, but must bear spiritual responsibility as well. However, the workers do not bear any responsibility for a local assembly. In other words, the preaching on the Lord's Day, Wednesday, and Saturday should be the common responsibility of the local brothers and sisters. The church in Shanghai does not have any worker. I thank the Lord for this. Someone in the church in Swatow has said that a church cannot be without a worker. This is a joke. Paul and Barnabas established over ten churches. If they presided over a church, how could they have been distributed among all these churches?</p>
