   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Sometimes when I want to share something in the meeting, I'm not sure if it is from my spirit or from my soul.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you release it in the spirit, it is something in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you keep it within you, it may become something in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not necessary to analyze that way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is better to exercise your spirit to release what you want to share than to keep it within.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is there any way to share the truth without getting into arguments?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Arguments lead nowhere.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Especially with our relatives, we must avoid arguing about doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If they raise a doctrinal point, we can steer away from it and give instead a testimony of our experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let them know how joyful our life is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our relatives not only need such a verbal testimony from us; they also need to see such a testimony lived before them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This living has the strongest impact.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need much more experience of Christ daily.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This will make our testimony brighter and will influence our relatives, as well as others, to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What should we pray for?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Last year in college I prayed nearly every day for fifteen people; it was an exhausting labor.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The other brothers and sisters were praying for the same people, but none of them has been added.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The best way to pray is according to John 15:7: "If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The way to pray is to abide in the Lord, remain in Him, and be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then our praying will not be according to our preference, but according to His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we abide in Him and His Word abides in us, we have His abiding Word to pray about.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then, as we open to Him, He moves within us, and we pray whatever we sense within.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is hard to tell you what to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just contact the Lord and be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once you have taken His words into you and are actually one with Him and He with you, there will be a consciousness deep within you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Pray according to that sense.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many times, as we begin to utter the words of prayer, more of a sense will come.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The inner sense becomes our prayer uttered in words.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you still have a burden to pray for many things, don't adjust yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Be simple, not bothered by any way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Go to the Lord, contact Him, and, as He leads you, utter the words according to your inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If, at the same time, you still have a burden to pray for certain people, for certain situations, for the church, or for the Lord's recovery, just utter that burden.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Don't analyze whether your burden was initiated by you or by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Pray until you have an inner restraint, telling you not to pray for a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you have no such restraint, feel free to pray according to your burden.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not pick up something as your burden.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Praying is just coming to the Lord and then uttering the prayer according to the sense He gives you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A LAW OF BONDAGE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>While the New Testament refers to the law of liberty, Mosaic law was really a law of bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As soon as we are given a law, we find that we cannot keep it see Rom 7:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A missionary in China preached to his cook that we are all sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the cook protested that he was a good man and had never sinned, the missionary began to talk to him about a horse.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The cook needed a new horse, and the missionary's description of the horse aroused in the cook longings to have such an excellent one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thoughts about how he could get the horse for himself began to fill the cook's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On a subsequent occasion the missionary again broached the subject that we are all sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Again the cook denied that he had ever done anything sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The missionary then asked him what had been occupying his thoughts since their previous conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The cook replied, "Well, I've been thinking about that horse.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It sounded like such a good one, I've been wondering how I could get it."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The missionary then called to his attention what such thoughts indicated, and the cook was forced to admit they were signs of covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This, the missionary then pointed out, was a sin Exo 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Who can keep the law of Moses?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is impossible; it is a law of bondage.</S>
