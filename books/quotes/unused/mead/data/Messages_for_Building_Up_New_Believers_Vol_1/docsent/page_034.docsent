   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Becoming God s Dwelling Place</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Together with Other Brothers and Sisters</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible also shows us that the church is God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is spoken of in Ephesians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This fact is one of the greatest revelations in the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should realize that God has a dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He needs a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible we see the thought of a dwelling place from Moses tabernacle to Solomon s temple, including the later rebuilding and restoration of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the church age God is making man His temple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God once dwelt in a big building Solomon s temple.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But today God dwells in the church; the church has now become the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have been gathered together to be the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We as God s many children have been gathered together by the Holy Spirit to be the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is covered in 1 Peter 2:5.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are the living stones being built into the spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How is the spiritual house built?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Solomon s temple was built with dead stones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But today the dwelling place of God is built with living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Peter, whose name means a stone, was a living stone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When all the living stones come together, they become a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If they are not together, can one stone be a house by itself?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If no stone is upon another, it is a mark of desolation; this is not a good sign.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No stone being upon another is a result of judgment and desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As long as we have a house, we have one stone upon another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thank God that today we are saved and have believed in the Lord Jesus; we are now stones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What use does a single stone have if it is left alone?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when the stones are put together, they become a house.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When they are isolated, they are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In fact, they may become stumbling stones instead of living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we are like the accessory parts of a car.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When all the parts are assembled together, we have a car which can be driven around.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We dare not say that those who are living stones will become dead if they become isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we can say that if a stone is not joined to other stones to be God s dwelling place, it will lose its function and spiritual riches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a living stone, we must be joined to other living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only then can we contain God and only then will God dwell among us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A hundred years ago an Englishman by the name of Mr. Stooneg said, After I was saved, a most wonderful thing happened to me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day I came to realize that I was building material in the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a most wonderful discovery.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first time I read this, I did not think too much about it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is so wonderful about being building material in God s dwelling place?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But today, as I ponder over it, I appreciate Mr. Stooneg s word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once such a feeling is in you, you will realize how wonderful this is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are indeed material for the spiritual dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we, as building material, are detached from the building, we will be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the same time, God s dwelling place cannot go on without us as stones.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without us as stones, there will be holes in God s dwelling place, and thieves will get into this building.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since I am the building material for God s dwelling place, God cannot go on without me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Brothers, we must see that we are the building material the Holy Spirit is using for the building of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you are by yourself, you will lose God s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You will not be able to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You must be joined to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only then can you contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A wooden bucket which contains and carries water is made out of pieces of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you remove a piece of wood from the bucket, the whole container will no longer hold water.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The nature of the individual pieces of wood has not changed, but the riches they contain have changed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Each piece can be soaked with a little water, but it will never hold much water; it will lose all the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are God s house, and as soon as we become isolated we lose all the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Brothers and sisters, you may not see it clearly today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But gradually you will see more and more clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As soon as you believe in the Lord, spontaneously there is an inclination within you to contact other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is a desire within you to look for other materials, other stones.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You must go along with this nature.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not isolate yourself from others through concepts of your own.</S>
