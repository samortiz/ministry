   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PRAYER OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All real prayers are prayers of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A prayer of life means that such a prayer comes entirely out of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because it comes out of life, it is therefore a real prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Any prayer that is not of life is feigned, imitated, reluctant, ritual, and outward.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, it is false.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us assume we have two guests visiting us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One is old, over sixty years of age, and the other is young, a little over two.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we are together, I notice that there is a tremendous difference between our guests in their words and manners.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes the old one tries to copy the smile of the young one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such a smile is pretentious, false.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At other times the young one tries to imitate the language of the old one and sounds somewhat like him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, there is still the sense that the child is feigning the speech of another.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is not yet sixty years old, but he speaks the words of a sixty-year-old.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although he fakes it very well, you still have to admit that it is false, because his life has not yet reached that stage.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If he were to scream and yell, turn the plates upside-down, and throw away the bowls, one would feel that his behavior is genuine, for that behavior genuinely reflects his level of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Please keep in mind that the same is true with respect to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A genuine prayer is definitely of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no way to imitate the tone, sound, words, form, and style of the prayers of anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And even if you could imitate them very well, it would still be false.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brothers and sisters, I hope you can see that prayer is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may not be so strict concerning other matters, but prayer is uniquely and absolutely a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The extent of your life determines the extent of your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The measure of your life decides the measure of your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Your life is the deciding factor of your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The condition of your life reveals the condition of your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If there is a problem with your life, there will surely be a problem with your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Life and prayer are entirely in direct proportion to one another, and they run parallel to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All genuine prayers are prayers of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have said that prayer depends also on words.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But do not forget that words are the expression of the degree of one's life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You need to reach a certain degree of life in order to speak the words of that degree.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Otherwise, you may have learned to speak them, but they carry neither the backing of life nor the weight of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not merely exercise ourselves in prayer yet ignore the matter of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we ignore the growth in life, our prayer will be little different from a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, we need to measure our prayer by our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is an absolute principle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>SUPPLY OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The measure of life supply being received by us determines the weightiness of our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One who has the life supply may not pray with all his life supply, but one who does not have the life supply cannot possibly pray.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In other words, life supply always exceeds prayer, but prayer can never exceed life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do not think that preaching is very hard and praying is very easy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you pray in an acting or performing way, then, of course, it is very easy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But it is not an easy matter to pray a prayer of burden, a genuine prayer, a prayer that can touch the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Prayer is a difficult labor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the historical record of the human race, there has never been one who labored on something to the point of sweating blood.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But in the garden of Gethsemane there was One Who did pray and sweat blood.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When Moses prayed on top of the hill, he needed Aaron and Hur to support his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To lift up the hands is easy, but to lift up the hands and pray is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brothers, I know no passage in the Bible that says we need to fast and preach the Word, but I have certainly found it to say we need to fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What does the Bible mean when it says to fast and pray?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It does not mean just to treat our body severely.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It means to exercise our whole being to bear the burden of a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then the burden presses us to the point that we do not feel hungry, causing us to fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Prayer can supply as well as consume life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the one hand, prayer can really cause one to receive supply.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the other hand, prayer can also cause one to be consumed in life to a considerable extent.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If a prayer does not supply you with life, that prayer is questionable.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the other hand, if a prayer does not consume you in life, it is also very questionable.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only those prayers which are a performance do not consume life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A genuine prayer that bears a burden will definitely be life-consuming.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After praying thus for an hour, you need the replenishment of a large measure of life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, one who seeks true prayer should know how to obtain the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many times when we draw near to the Lord it is not to pray but to fellowship with Him in order to gain some life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To pray in a genuine way, one should not bear too many burdens daily; otherwise, it will become a real hardship and suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because prayer is the highest as well as the most lasting part of spiritual work, it really consumes life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should not overwork ourselves, and in the same principle, we should not pray excessively.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This means that our prayer must not exceed the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Everyday we should have a time when we do not bear any burden of prayer but merely draw near to the Lord and receive His supply.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I hope that every brother and sister will remember this principle: if you do not receive the supply of life at set times daily, your prayer is certainly questionable.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If there is no life supply, there is definitely no prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, we must learn to receive the supply of Christ as life continually.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Receive the supply of life through the quiet time, meditation, calling on the Lord, reading the Word, and through fellowshipping with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This will enable us to have true prayers before God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We also need to learn to receive the burden in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, it must not be too heavy a burden lest we suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Receive regular life supply daily; this is a great principle of prayer.</S>
