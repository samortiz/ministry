<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(5)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:4-6</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the sign of the way, the reality, and the life as seen in John 14:4-6. In verse 4 the Lord Jesus says, “And you know where I go, and you know the way.” I would call your attention to the words “where” and “way” in this verse. In verse 5 Thomas says to the Lord, “Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way?” Here the words “where” and “way” are used again. According to verse 6, “Jesus said to him, I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.” In verse 4 Jesus speaks of the “where” and the “way.” In verse 5 Thomas says that the disciples do not know where or know the way. Then in verse 6 Jesus says that He is the way and indicates that the “where” is the Father. Therefore, both the way and the where are living persons. The way is the Son, who is also the reality and the life, and the where, the place, is the Father. The Father is the “where,” and the Son is the way.<p>We have seen that in 14:4-6 the Father is the place and the Son is the way. But what does it mean to take the Lord Jesus as the way to the Father? It means that when we take Jesus, we get the Father. When we walk in Him as the way, we arrive at the destination, which is the Father. Hence, we take Jesus as the way, and we reach the Father as the place.<p>These three verses in chapter fourteen are very deep, and the three matters in verse 6—the way, the reality, and the life—are signs. We may say that, taken together, these are the third sign in chapter fourteen. The first sign was the Father’s house, and the second was the Lord’s coming and going. Now the third is the way, the reality, and the life.<p>For years I have been seeking to know the meaning of the way, the reality, and the life in John 14:6. We need to ask what is the meaning of “way” here. Furthermore, what does it mean to say that Christ is the reality? In most English versions the Greek word for reality is rendered truth. If the word truth is used, what does it mean here? Doctrine? Faithfulness? Sincerity? Is Christ doctrine? Is He faithfulness and sincerity here? It is not easy to explain the meaning of reality in this verse. Also, because life is mysterious, it is difficult to say what is the meaning of the word “life” here.<p>We cannot understand these matters properly if we consider these verses merely according to the black and white letters. We need to realize that the way, the reality, and the life are a sign. The way, the reality, and the life signify certain things. We may consider these three as one sign in three aspects, steps, or stages, or we may regard them as three separate signs.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY—TO ENTER INTO THE FATHER</h2><p>Let us now consider the significance of the way. To make this matter easier to understand, we may use a jumbo jet as an illustration. The best and fastest way to travel from the United States to Europe is on a jumbo jet. A jumbo jet can easily overcome gravity and bring people safely and comfortably through the air to their destination. The passengers in a jumbo jet need not be frustrated by wind or rain, for the jet carries them through everything. Hence, the jumbo jet is their way of reaching a particular place.<p>This is a picture of how the Lord Jesus is our way to the Father. The Father is holy, dwelling in unapproachable light, and we are sinful. We are also involved with the world, Satan, and other negative things, all of which are obstacles that make it impossible for us to come to the Father. It is impossible for us to overcome these negative things and to clear the way. This is the reason Confucius says that we should not offend heaven (a term he used for God, similar to that used in Luke 15), for he claimed that if we offended heaven, there would be no way for us to be forgiven. This indicates that, for Confucius, there was no way for sinful human beings to contact God, because we cannot solve the problems of sin, the world, Satan, and all manner of negative things. Sin, the world, and Satan are three great obstacles that make access to the Father impossible. But praise the Lord that Christ is our way to the Father! We may say that He is “Jumbo Jesus,” the means by which we may come to the Father.
