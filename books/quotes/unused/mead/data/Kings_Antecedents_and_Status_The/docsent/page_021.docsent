   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Joseph the Husband of Mary,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of Whom Jesus Was Born</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At this point, the record of this genealogy does not say "Joseph begot Jesus," as mentioned of all the foregoing persons; it says, "Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus" Matt 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jesus was born of Mary, not of Joseph, since it was prophesied that Christ would be the seed of a woman and born of a virgin Gen 3:15; Isa 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ could not have been born of Joseph, because Joseph was a man and a descendant of Jeconiah, of whose descendants none could inherit the throne of David Jer 22:28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If Christ had been born of Joseph, He would have been excluded from the throne of David.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, Mary was a virgin Luke 1:27 and a descendant of David Luke 1:31-32 , the right person of whom Christ should be born.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The marriage of Joseph with Mary brought him into relationship with Christ and united into one the two lines of Christ's genealogy for the bringing forth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we need to examine the chart p.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>53 which shows that the generation of Christ begins from God and continues until it reaches Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first name is God, and the last name is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It proceeds from God to Adam, from Adam to Abraham, from Abraham through Isaac and Jacob and on to David.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After David, it is divided into two lines, the first running from Nathan to Mary and the second from Solomon to Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, in God's sovereignty, these two lines are brought together by the marriage of Mary to Joseph to bring forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we spend time to consider this chart, we shall realize how wonderful is God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All marriages are under God's sovereignty, especially marriages related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From God to David the genealogy was one line, and from David to Jesus it was two lines; yet these two lines were united through the marriage of Joseph and Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Jesus who was brought forth by Mary fulfills the prophecies: the prophecy concerning the seed of woman Gen 3:15 ; the prophecy of a virgin bringing forth a son Isa 7:14 ; the prophecy of Abraham having a seed who would bring blessing to all the nations Gen 22:18 ; the prophecy to Isaac and Jacob, which was the same as the prophecy made to Abraham Gen 26:4; 28:14 ; the prophecy made to Judah that Judah would be the royal tribe Gen 49:10 ; and the prophecy made to David 2 Sam 7:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although the birth of Jesus fulfilled many prophecies in the Old Testament, He was not the descendant of Jeconiah.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Seemingly, the descendants of Jeconiah were still in the royal line.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But according to God's sovereignty, Mary, the mother of Jesus, married Joseph, a descendant of Jeconiah, who seemed to be in the line of the royal family.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Apparently, Jesus was the descendant of Jeconiah; actually, He was not.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was the descendant of David.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only God can arrange such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Praise Him!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you consider your history, the history of your salvation, you will see that the principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not think that the marriage of Joseph and Mary was an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was no accident; rather it was planned by the sovereign hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Likewise, your association with Christ your salvation was not an accident; it also was planned by the divine hand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes I have thanked the Lord and said to Him, "I am so happy that You did not put me on earth in 20 B.C., but in the twentieth century.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You put me on this earth in a place where the missionaries came with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day I was born of a Christian mother.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Later, I was given the opportunity to hear the gospel, and I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was no accident.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Neither was your association with Christ an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God carefully planned it all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has arranged all this for little people like us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not an insignificant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we enter eternity, we may be very surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may shout, "Praise the Lord!"</S>
