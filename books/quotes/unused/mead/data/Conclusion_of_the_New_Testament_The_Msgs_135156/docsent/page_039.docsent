   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE THE BELIEVERS THEIR PRESENT 29</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the progressing stage of God's full salvation the believers not only experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing but also experience God's redemption continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Experiencing God's Redemption Continuously in Being: a. Forgiven of Their Sins</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The believers experience God's redemption in being forgiven of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For God to forgive us of our sins means that He releases us from the offense of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's forgiveness is continuous, and we need it moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not think that once we have been saved we no longer need God's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As long as we are living on earth in the old creation we need God's redemption daily.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever we contact Him, we should sense that we need His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our sin, the indwelling sin in our nature Rom 7:17 , has been taken care of by Christ as our sin offering Lev 4; Isa 53:10; Rom 8:3; 2 Cor 5:21; Heb 9:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our sins, our trespasses, have been taken care of by Christ as our trespass offering Lev 5; Isa 53:11; 1 Cor 15:3; 1 Pet 2:24; Heb 9:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After our regeneration we still need to take Christ as our sin offering, as indicated in 1 John 1:8, and as our trespass offering, as indicated in 1 John 1:9.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some Christians claim that sin has been eradicated from the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible, however, does not teach that sin has been eradicated from our being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First John 1:8 says, "If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To say that we do not have sin is to say that we do not have indwelling sin within our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In his first Epistle, John inoculates the believers against this false teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First John 1:7 2:2 deals with the believers' sinning after regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This sinning interrupts their fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If after regeneration the believers do not have sin in their nature, how could they sin in their conduct?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though they sin only occasionally, not habitually, their sinning is an adequate proof that they still have sin working within them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The apostle's teaching here condemns today's teaching of perfectionism, the teaching that a state of freedom from sin is attainable or has been attained in earthly life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The apostle's teaching also annuls the erroneous teaching of the eradication of the sinful nature, which, by misinterpreting the word in 3:9 and 5:18, says that regenerated persons cannot sin because the sin in their nature has been totally eradicated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To say that, because we have been regenerated, we do not have sin is self-deceiving.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It denies the actual fact of our own experience and thus causes us to lead ourselves astray.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not say that we no longer have sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sin, after our regeneration, still remains in our flesh, in our sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, the Bible reveals that our old creation has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the other hand, in practicality our old creation, our old man, is still with us, and we are still very much under its influence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only when our body has been transfigured, redeemed, will we be able to say that sin is no longer with us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But while we are still living in the old body sin remains with us, and, perhaps unwillingly or subconsciously, we may become entangled with it and stained by it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, every moment we need the cleansing blood of Jesus to be applied to our actual situation.</S>
