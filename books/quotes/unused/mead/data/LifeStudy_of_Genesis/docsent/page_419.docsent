   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>10 God's Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we must consider God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God blessed Laban because of Jacob 30:27, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through His blessing, God preserved Jacob from Laban's squeeze 31:7-12, 16, 42 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must bow down, worship God, and learn the lesson not to care for how much we are squeezed by others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As God's chosen people, we are under His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although others may squeeze us, we do not need to play tricks on them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more tricks we play, the more squeezing we shall suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But whether or not we play tricks, the blessing will be ours because we are destined for it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jacob began to play tricks in his mother's womb and he did not stop until he was transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only when we come to the last few chapters of Genesis do we see that Jacob had ceased playing tricks.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After Jacob had been transformed into a prince of God, he no longer played any tricks.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In like manner, only after we have been fully dealt with and transformed will we stop playing tricks.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we have pointed out, in this record there are three main parties: the squeezing party, the trick-playing party, and the blessing party.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God might have told Laban, "Laban, I shall use your squeeze as a means to transform Jacob, My chosen one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You cannot rob him of My blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more you squeeze him, the more I shall bless him."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moreover, God might have said to Jacob, "Jacob, you did not become rich because of your tricks, but because of My sovereign blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You put the white cattle in front of the striped branches, but the dream indicates that the results did not come because of your tricks.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In My eyes, the white cattle were actually speckled, spotted, and striped cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>My sovereign blessing, not your tricks, has made you rich.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all must learn not to fear any environment or squeezing and not to play tricks.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although you may continue to play tricks on others, one day your trick-playing nature will be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although Jacob was tricky, God still blessed him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the dream, God did not rebuke him; rather, He comforted him, saying, "I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee" 31:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God saw Jacob's suffering and affliction under Laban's hand and seemed to say, "I am the God of Bethel, the God of your father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I shall take care of you."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we read this record, we see that God did not care for what Jacob did; He only cared for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All that God did was for Jacob's building up and transformation.</S>
