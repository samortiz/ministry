<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XII. THE ISSUES OF THE GLORIFICATION OF CHRIST</H2><P>The Father's house in 14:2, the vine in 15:5, and the child in 16:21, which imply the Body of Christ, are all the issues of this glorification of Christ through His death unto resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIII. GOD BEING GLORIFIED IN CHRIST<br>AND IN THE CHURCH</H2><P>God is glorified in Christ and in the church in the church age (Eph. 3:21). If we are not a part of the church, we will miss this glorification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIV. EXPRESSING GOD IN OUR BEHAVIOR</H2><P>When the believers express God in their behavior, God is glorified (Matt. 5:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XV. BEARING MUCH FRUIT</H2><P>When the believers as the branches bear much fruit, the Father is glorified (John 15:8). The more fruit we bear, the more God is glorified in our Christian work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVI. BEING GLORIFIED IN THE KINGDOM AGE</H2><P>The believers who suffer with Christ in this age will be glorified in the kingdom age, that is, will reign with Him as His co-kings (Rom. 8:17; 2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 20:4, 6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVII. PETER'S MARTYRDOM</H2><P>Peter was martyred so that God would be glorified (John 21:19). The Lord Jesus predicted this to Peter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVIII. THE GLORY OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</H2><P>Eventually, all of God's chosen people will participate in the glory of the New Jerusalem, that is, will be glorified with the glory of God for eternity (Rev. 21:11). We need to enjoy what Christ is and live Him. Eventually, we will be eternally glorified in His glorification.</P>
