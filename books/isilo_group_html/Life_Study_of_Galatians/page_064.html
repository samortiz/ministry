You did not injure me at all.&rdquo; Paul was free from the bondage of Jewish observances. He besought the Galatians to become as he was, even as he had become as a Gentile for the truth of the gospel. Having done his best to become the same as the Galatians, he now besought them to become as he is. He seemed to be saying, &ldquo;I love you and became like you. Now I ask you to become as I am. I am not for days, months, seasons, and years. I am for Christ. I beg you, become as I am.&rdquo;</p><p>In verse 12 Paul tells the Galatians that they did not injure him at all. The Galatians had not injured Paul in the past. Paul expects that neither would they injure him now.</p><h2 class="head1">AN OPPORTUNITY TO MINISTER CHRIST</h2><p>Verse 13 continues, &ldquo;And you know that on account of weakness of the flesh I preached the gospel to you formerly.&rdquo; In his first journey, Paul was detained in Galatia because of physical weakness. While there, he preached the gospel to the Galatians. His illness afforded him a good opportunity to minister Christ to them.</p><p>Verse 14 says, &ldquo;And that which was a trial to you in my flesh you did not despise nor loathe, but you received me as a messenger of God, as Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Here Paul appeals to their love by reminding them that they had received him as a messenger of God, an angel, and had not despised his sickness.</p><h2 class="head1">THEIR BLESSEDNESS</h2><p>In verse 15 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Where then is your blessedness? For I testify to you that if possible you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.&rdquo; The Greek words rendered &ldquo;your blessedness&rdquo; also mean your felicitation, your happiness. The Galatians formerly considered Paul&rsquo;s being retained in their place and preaching the gospel to them a blessing. They were happy about it and boasted of it. That became their felicitation. However, now that they had departed from Paul&rsquo;s preaching of the gospel, the apostle questions them, &ldquo;Where then is your blessedness, your happiness, your felicitation?&rdquo;</p><p>When Paul was among them, the Galatians celebrated their happiness with one another and congratulated one another for the opportunity to have such a minister of Christ with them. When Paul was in Galatia preaching the gospel, ministering Christ to the people, they were happy and regarded Paul&rsquo;s presence as a great blessing. This happiness, blessedness, felicitation, is what is implied by the Greek term used here.</p><p>The Galatians appreciated Paul&rsquo;s preaching and loved him to such an extent that, as he says, if possible, they would have torn out their eyes and given them to him. This may indicate that Paul&rsquo;s physical weakness (v. 13) was in his eyes. This may be confirmed by the large letters he used in writing to them (6:11). It may also be the thorn in his flesh, some physical weakness, which he prayed might be removed from him (2 Cor. 12:7-9).</p><h2 class="head1">AN APPEAL TO THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; AFFECTION</h2><p>In verse 16 Paul asks, &ldquo;So have I become your enemy in speaking the truth to you?&rdquo; This word indicates that certain of the deceived ones had come to regard Paul as an enemy. Suppose some brothers visit the saints in a certain region, and the saints there receive them gladly. However, later the saints are distracted by some teaching or practice and turn against the very brothers whom they once gladly received and appreciated highly. In such a case, these brothers may be tempted to give up on the saints in that region. But this definitely was not Paul&rsquo;s attitude. On the contrary, he was burdened to write them and to appeal to them in a loving manner. We should learn of Paul to take up the burden for those believers who have turned away from us. Perhaps we should write them and say, &ldquo;Do you not remember how you served us in love? Where is your love today? It seems that now you consider us your enemies. To be sure, this is not reasonable. Are we enemies simply because we speak the truth to you?&rdquo;</p><p>In writing Galatians 3, Paul spoke like an attorney. But in composing chapter four, he wrote like a loving father. Chapter four was written according to Paul&rsquo;s personal and intimate love for the Galatians. Instead of arguing in a legal way like a lawyer, Paul appealed to the believers&rsquo; affection. If we would be those who minister Christ to others, we must learn to speak to them in such a way. We should not simply speak according to doctrinal truth, but should appeal to others in a personal, loving manner.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Galatians &nbsp; pg 64</div><br></body></html>
