   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Working, but Eating</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Exodus 12:16 says, "And in the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse says that on the first and last days of the feast of unleavened bread no manner of work was to be done.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This signifies that in the enjoyment of God's salvation, there is no place for our work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must learn to stop our doing We must cease from every kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do not resolve to be a loving husband, a submissive wife, or a child who honors his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All this is human work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The only thing we are permitted to do is eat.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that as we partake of God's salvation, there is room only for enjoyment, not for working.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not try to do anything just eat and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The situation of today's Christianity is just the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead of eating, there is working.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sermon upon sermon is given charging people to engage in certain kinds of work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This contradicts the principle of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's salvation does not allow us to do any work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Due to our serpentine nature, immediately after we were saved or revived, we made up our mind to do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some resolved not to lose their temper; others decided to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the Lord makes no allowance for this kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In God's salvation we are only allowed to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In contrast to the writings of the religions of man, the Bible charges God's people concerning the first and last days of the feast to do nothing except eat.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the children of Israel worked on these days, they would have broken the principle of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Salvation is for our enjoyment; it does not require our work or our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, even many zealous Christians are cut off from spiritual fellowship simply because they are engaged in so much work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To add human labor to God's salvation is to insult God and to cut ourselves off from fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We find it difficult to stop working and to keep eating.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead of eating without working, our habit is to work without eating.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some may complain of too much spiritual eating.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They may even say that they are bored with such eating.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Talk like this circulated among us some time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This kind of word comes from the Devil, the enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As soon as a word is spoken against eating the Lord, it is followed by a suggestion that we work or engage in a certain activity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What a devilish contradiction of the principle of God's salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I repeat, God's salvation requires that we stop our working and do nothing except eat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is even possible for prayer to become a work that God forbids.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some of the saints may decide to spend more time in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In such a case, their prayer may become a work that breaks the principle of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To one who resolves to pray in this way, I would say, "Do not allow prayer to become a work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead of praying in a natural way, you must eat the unleavened bread."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When I was young, I engaged in much work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I read books about how to be holy, how to pray, and how to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These books encouraged me to work and to do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then one day I saw the light that God does not want us to work He wants us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we would feast unto Him, we must stop our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose a brother invites you to his home for a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After you arrive, however, you spend a great deal of time working for him You mow the lawn, trim the trees, and wash the windows.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But all your work is offensive to this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What he desires is that you sit down at the table and feast with him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more you feast, the happier he will be.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We all must learn to drop our natural doing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, this is not easy for us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As we drop our doing, we need to maintain our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if we do not eat, we should not stop working.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Most Christians work without eating, but we must learn to eat without doing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Let us drop our doing, but continue with our eating.</S>
