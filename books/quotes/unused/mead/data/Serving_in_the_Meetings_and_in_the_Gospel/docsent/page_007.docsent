   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WORSHIPPING IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTHFULNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, we need to exercise our spirit with the indwelling Holy Spirit to worship in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we exercise our spirit, the Holy Spirit cooperates and honors this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the true worship in spirit and in truthfulness John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Truthfulness refers to reality, that is, to Christ who is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today we worship God in spirit with Christ as the surplus that we bring to God as the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>BEING COORDINATED, STRONG, ACTIVE, AND POSITIVE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Third, we must learn how to cooperate and coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The only way to worship is with Christ as our experience, with the spirit as our means, our instrument, and in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we have these three Christ, the spirit, and coordination the meetings will be wonderful and rich, full of Christ and living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They will be very good because we will have the riches, the spirit, and the way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must pay our full attention to these three matters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then whenever we come together, the meetings will be very attractive and attracting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They will attract people; people will be happy and anxious to come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the contrary, a meeting can be very low.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some brothers do seek the Lord and like to come to the meetings, but whenever they come to the meeting, they bring it lower; we need to be delivered from meeting in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all have to labor on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all have to learn how to exercise our spirit in the meeting to be active, not inactive, and positive, not negative.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not sit and wait.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That is not the time to wait; that is the time the Lord is waiting for us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should exercise our spirit to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Luke 1:80 says that John the Baptist grew and became strong in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever we come into the meetings we have to be strong in spirit and active and positive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we will not imprison the Holy Spirit within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Holy Spirit will be released, and the release of the Holy Spirit will bring forth the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all have to learn to release our spirit and exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we will be open.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We will pave the way for the Holy Spirit within us to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must also learn the technique of how to coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once a brother starts in one way, we simply follow him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If his functioning is weak, we must learn to strengthen it, and if it is low, we must learn to uplift it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I look to the Lord that we will learn these practical things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can be assured that if we put them into practice, the meetings of the church will be enriched, living, edifying, and very attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>People will receive the real help, and the Lord will be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord s presence will be with us, and it will be easy to bring unbelievers to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is our responsibility, and it has very much to do with the building up of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A local church can be built up only through these practical matters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all must put them into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>PLAYING WITH THE SAME BALL IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A brother may begin a meeting by ministering something concerning Christ as patience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we know how to exercise the spirit and if we have many experiences of Christ as the surplus in our hand, we can immediately follow the brother to give a testimony of how we experienced Christ as our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Or perhaps we will be ready to continue his ministering by offering a prayer to praise and thank the Lord that He is our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This may be compared to handling the same ball in a ball game.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes, however, we may have only one item of the surplus of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may have nothing to say concerning Christ as patience, but we may have something to say about Christ as our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the brother ministers Christ as patience, we do not have anything with which to follow him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet because we feel that we must exercise our spirit to do something, we start on another line.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is to play with a different ball.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After this, another brother may start another line; this is to play with yet another ball.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually there will be many different lines in one meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That is like one team playing a game with many balls.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sometimes a team of five members may play with more than five balls; one player plays with his ball, another plays with his, and another plays with a third ball.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is an illustration of a poor meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we know how to discern, we can tell that many meetings are poor; we play with ball after ball, not like a team but like naughty boys.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Each one plays his own ball, and each one even has two or three balls.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is because we are not trained, educated, or exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord can testify for me that I have no intention to criticize anyone, but I must say that it is hard to find a Christian meeting that is truly satisfying.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many Christian meetings are always poor.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is always a dissatisfaction within the attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not our dissatisfaction only; it is the Lord s dissatisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord is not satisfied unless there is a proper meeting with a group of Christians who know how to exercise their spirit, have many experiences of Christ, and have the technique, the best way, the best exercise, to play ball.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The more we see this kind of meeting, the more we will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We will not say, This is a poor game.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I will never come back again to see this kind of game.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This kind of meeting will attract people and edify them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I can testify that to be in such a meeting even once edifies people for their whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Such a meeting edifies and builds up.</S>
