   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO VISIT PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND ENDEAVORING TO SPREAD THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If some elders are willing to practice and learn in this way, even if there are only two such brothers, they will be able to raise up churches wherever they go.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The new way given to us by the Lord is simple and easy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord may lead some of us to go out two by two.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To do so, we do not need to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One of us may be a teacher, and another may be an office employee.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we are not occupied by our jobs and do not seek many possessions, desiring to lead a proper life, we will be able to use our evenings, weekends, and holidays to visit people by door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can begin from where we live.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can tell our neighbors that we live nearby and would like to visit them, get to know them, and speak with them about the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do this, I believe that we will be able to quickly bring someone to salvation, perhaps in two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we all go out in this way and gain one person a week, we will be able to gain fifty-two people in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These fifty-two people have friends and relatives, and soon these fifty-two may bring in another fifty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the end of the year, there may be as many as one hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those saved in this way will naturally do the same thing that we do, because they will see this pattern from the time they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, every time we meet with them, we should let them know that we are neither pastors nor preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are no different from them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are simply teachers and employees who come together to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can choose a hymn to sing, and they also can choose a hymn to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can then introduce our hymnal to them and select a portion to read from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whatever we do, they can do, and they can even do it more than us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must bring people to take the new way from the time they are saved; nevertheless, we do not need to emphasize to them that it is a new way, because this may stir up unnecessary debates.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should simply tell them that this is the Lord s way in which we should all walk.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today if we read the Bible to people, they will sense that the truth in it is solid and logical, that it contains neither myths nor strange legends but rather the most proper and most orthodox truths.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we read these high truths to people, they will see what the Bible says concerning God s will, honoring one s parents, and the true God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This will open people s eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Taiwan everyone is seeking the philosophy of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we spread forth the truths that are in our hands, some people will surely receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we contact people, we do not need to speak regarding any profound doctrine; we only need to speak the straight truth, that is, to speak the truth by cutting it straight.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we open the Bible, we may read a portion from Proverbs, Psalms, or the Gospels, all of which are good and profitable to people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After reading with them, we need to ask them how they feel about what we have read and let them share what they have gained.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We often have an erroneous concept that what we speak is too deep and that people cannot understand it when they first hear it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Of course, it is relatively easy to give people candy, but if we speak candied truths to those who are educated and have some position in society, we insult them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we go out, we should properly present the philosophy of human life to people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way, they will feel respected and be interested in what we say.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is easy for us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If there is no spread or multiplication in a church, this indicates that there must be a reason; hence, we must have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The problem is that we are too influenced by our background and our old ways and are thus unable to jump out of them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From now on, we must leave our old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, there are many different ways to preach the gospel and even to speak to the newly saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In short, all these responsibilities rest on the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The elders must be the first to change their concepts and come out of the old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although not every one of us is an elder, the principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must realize that we cannot serve according to the old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Especially those who have joined the full-time training need not consider too much but should simply advance step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even in the world, as long as a proper person takes the proper way, he will surely have a bright future.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In high school he needs to study properly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then when he goes on to college, he needs to continue to study properly and endeavor to finish his education.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Afterward, when he takes a job, he needs to work diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whoever takes such a proper way will surely have a promising future.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some may think that if they take the Lord s way to serve Him full time, they will surely starve because no one will take care of their daily necessities.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In fact, when they have only a little need, the supply is not evident; nevertheless, when they truly have needs, the supply will come from different directions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They may even have a surplus to share with others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, we can all be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord is responsible for our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now we will see the proper pursuit of the elders.</S>
