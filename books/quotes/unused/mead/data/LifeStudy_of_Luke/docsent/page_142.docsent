   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE FORTY-EIGHT THE MAN-SAVIOR S PRESENTATION OF HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO DEATH FOR REDEMPTION 5 Scripture Reading: Luke 21:5-38</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 21:5 22:46 the Man-Savior prepares the disciples for His death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As part of this preparation, He tells them of things to come 21:5-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that these things include the destruction of the temple vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>5-6 , the plagues between the Lord s ascension and the great tribulation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>7-11 , the persecution of His disciples in the church age vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>12-19 , and the great tribulation and the Lord s coming vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>20-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this message we shall go on to consider what the Lord says concerning the disciples redemption and the overcomers rapture vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>28-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>OUR REDEMPTION DRAWING NEAR</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 21:28 the Man-Savior says, And when these things begin to happen, straighten up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this verse redemption surely refers to the redemption of our body, that is, the transfiguration of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul speaks of this redemption in Romans 8:23: Even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Philippians 3 he speaks of the transfiguration of our body: The Lord Jesus Christ, who will transfigure the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, the redemption in Luke 21:28, the redemption that is drawing near, is not the redemption of our spirit or soul but the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We shall experience this redemption at the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE SIGN OF THE FIG TREE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 21:29-31 the Lord tells the disciples a parable: Look at the fig tree and all the trees; when they are already sprouting leaves, you see it and know of yourselves that the summer is already near.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>So also you, when you see these things taking place, know that the kingdom of God is near.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fig tree, signifying the nation of Israel, was cursed in Matthew 21:19.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It passed through a long winter, from the first century to A.D. 1948, when the nation of Israel was restored.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That was its branch becoming tender and putting forth its leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This fig tree is a sign to the believers of the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fig tree becoming tender Matt 24:32 signifies that life has come back.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The sprouting of leaves in Luke 21:30 signifies outward activities.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Winter signifies the time of being dried up, the time of tribulation, whereas summer signifies the age of the restored kingdom Luke 21:30-31 , which will begin at the Lord s second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verse 30 the Lord speaks of summer being near, and in verse 31, of the kingdom of God being near.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, in the Bible the word near does not mean that something will happen within a few days or even within several years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To the Lord an event that will take place in two thousand years may still be regarded as near, because with Him time and space do not mean anything.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I heard about the re-formation of Israel in 1948, I was excited.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I said to myself, Look, the end of the age must be near.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The nation of Israel has been under the control of the Gentiles since the time of Nebuchadnezzar.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now Israel has been re-formed as a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I thought that probably in just a few years the Lord would come back.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But thirty-six years have gone by, and the leaves are still sprouting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even though Jerusalem was returned to the Jews in 1967, we can still say only that the time is near.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 21:32 and 33 the Lord goes on to say, Truly I tell you that this generation shall by no means pass away until all things take place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The word generation in verse 32 is not the generation according to age or people, as the generations in Matthew 1:17.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rather, this is the generation according to the moral condition of the people, as the generation in Luke 11:29-32 and Proverbs 30:11-14.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All things in verse 32 refer to the things predicted in the foregoing verses.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The word until implies that some things have not yet taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, more time is needed for all things to take place.</S>
