It mainly refers to maintaining a fresh relationship between us and the Lord. There should be no barrier between us and the Lord. We cannot always practice the prayer of Matthew 6, shutting ourselves in our private room and praying with our doors shut. We need to go out and contact the things and people of this world. Therefore, it is inevitable that we will defile our feet. Our feet are defiled through our contact with the world, and this defilement becomes a barrier between us and God. This is why foot-washing is necessary. Foot-washing has nothing to do with our conscience. The conscience is related to sin, and when there is sin, there is the need of the washing of the blood. Foot-washing has to do with our spiritual vitality; it is for rekindling our spiritual vitality. Believers do not sin all the time. Yet every believer has times when he or she is spiritually enervated. This is why we all need foot- washing for the recovery of our spiritual energy.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING OFF THE SHOES SIGNIFYING<br />ONE'S CONTACT WITH GOD'S HOLINESS</h2><p>In order to wash our feet, we must take off our shoes. In the Bible removing the shoes signifies one's contact with God's holiness. On Mount Horeb, Moses wanted to see the vision of the burning bush, but God said to him, "Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (Exo. 3:5). Why did God ask Moses to take off his shoes? It was because he could not touch God's holiness directly unless he took off his shoes. Hence, removing the shoes signifies one's contact with God's holiness.</p><p>There are two things that separate us from God. The first is sin, which is taken care of by the Lord's blood in washing us of our sins. The second are the things of this world, which are taken care of by the foot-washing. Today many people do not know how precious it is to have the Lord's presence all the time. These people must have the blood-washing in their conscience before they are qualified to speak about the foot-washing. My word tonight is for those whose conscience have been washed. Many times our conscience has been cleared, yet we still feel a separation between us and God. At such times there is the need of foot-washing. Foot-washing sustains an intimate fellowship between us and the Lord. The Lord loves us, and He loves us to the uttermost. He gave Himself and shed His precious blood to redeem us from sin. But this is not all. His great love also constrains Him to wash our feet so that there will be no barrier between us and Him, and we can continually draw nigh to such a holy God and enjoy His fellowship.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DEFILEMENT OF THE FEET<br />SIGNIFYING SEPARATION FROM GOD<br />AS A RESULT OF CONTACT WITH THE WORLD</h2><p>I have observed that many brothers have similar experiences. In the morning they draw near to God and enjoy a sweet fellowship with Him. Heaven is so near to them that they can almost touch it. However, they lose this inner taste by the time they go to work, especially in the afternoon. Even though they are able to repeat the same intimate words of fellowship which they uttered in the morning to the Lord, the taste is gone. Those who have been through this experience know the pain that it brings. Those who have never been through this experience do not know what we are talking about. If one sins, there are ways to deal with it. But if one falls into this condition, it is very difficult to deal with it. The defilement of the feet is not a sin. The Lord never said that our feet cannot be defiled. He only said that those who have bathed have no need except to wash their feet, but are wholly clean (John 13:10). For a Christian to sin is abnormal, but for him to have feet that are defiled is normal. No one can avoid having his feet defiled. The barrier that comes from defiled feet is not a matter of sin, but the result of our normal contact with this world. In order to remove such a barrier, there is the need of foot-washing.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
