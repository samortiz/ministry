The brothers wondered at one another. Certainly they should have realized by this indication that this ruler was Joseph. There must have been particular features in Joseph's countenance that they could have recognized, even after twenty-two years. If they had put all the indications together, they would have said, "This is Joseph." They should have remembered that Joseph was taken to Egypt, and they should have realized that this man was Joseph.</P><P>Verse 34 says, "And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs." There must have been a purpose in Joseph's giving Benjamin a portion five times greater than that of the other brothers. His intention must have been to indicate to his brothers that he was Joseph and that he loved his younger brother. If I had been there, I would have had the boldness to ask the man if he was Joseph. However, none of his brothers did this. Rather, they had no discernment.</P><P>With respect to our knowing the Lord it is exactly the same today. The Lord showed Himself to us and we saw Him, yet we did not know Him. He did many things for us with a good intention, but we were frightened by what He did. Everything He did was motivated by love, but we had evil thoughts regarding it all.</P><P>Joseph had a loving intention in inviting his brothers to his home for a feast. But they had the evil thought that he was planning to seize them and make them slaves. Verse 18 says, "And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses." The money and the donkeys were veils that kept Joseph's brothers from recognizing him. The donkeys meant a great deal to them, but they meant nothing to Joseph. Later, when Joseph sent his brothers back to get his father, he sent chariots with horsemen. Their money and their donkeys meant something to them. These were all they had. They were also afraid of being taken as slaves. It is the same with us today. The Lord may be directly in front of us and He may have done a great deal for us, but we cannot recognize Him or what He has done. Rather, we are afraid. Joseph's brothers should have realized that the ruler of world would not have cared about their donkeys. We are the same way. When we came to Christ and then into the church life, we might have wondered about our money, our security, or our family. Joseph's brothers were poor. But they were under the rich care of the ruler of the earth. If I had been there, I would have said, "Forget about the money and the donkeys. I want only Joseph. I love him." In knowing the Lord, we are all as foolish as Joseph's brothers. Instead of considering Him, we consider ourselves, our money, and our donkeys. Joseph's brothers should have turned their eyes on Joseph and looked at him. If they had done so, they would have realized that the man resembled Joseph. But for them to look at Joseph, they had to forget their money. However, they kept their eyes on their money and might have said to one another, "Don't you realize this is a lot of money? We must be careful not to lose it." I doubt that Joseph's brothers set their eyes on his countenance adequately. If they had done so, they would have recognized him. Levi might have said to Reuben, "I am quite sure this man is Joseph. Let us not be afraid, but be bold and ask if he really is Joseph."</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_664.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_666.html">Next</a> </body></html>
