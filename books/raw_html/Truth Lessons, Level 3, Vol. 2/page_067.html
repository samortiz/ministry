 <h2 class="head1">II. THE SHOOT OF DAVID</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Typifying the Development and<br />
Growth of Christ&rsquo;s Humanity</h2>
<p>Christ is God as man with divinity and humanity. Hence, the Old Testament uses two shoots to signify His two natures of divinity and humanity. The Shoot of Jehovah signifies Christ&rsquo;s divinity, whereas the Shoot of David (Jer. 23:5) signifies Christ&rsquo;s humanity. The development of His divinity is from His incarnation to the manifestation of His beauty and glory, that is, the manifestation of His divinity in splendor. The development of His humanity is from His birth as the Son of Man to the uplifting of His humanity into His divinity in resurrection, that is, the mingling of His humanity with His divinity for Him to be the firstborn Son of God with two natures&mdash;divinity and humanity (Rom. 8:29).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being the Development and Growth<br />
of Christ in His Birth as the Son of Man<br />
and in His Humanity</h2>
<p>Christ was born as a human baby (Luke 2:12), grew up through childhood (vv. 40-43), and at the age of thirty became a complete man (3:23). This is the development and growth of Christ in His humanity as the Shoot of David living for God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being the Development and Growth<br />
of Humanity in Christ&rsquo;s Divinity</h2>
<p>The development and growth of Christ in His humanity is the development and growth of His humanity in His divinity, that His humanity may be filled with divinity and that His divinity may live out all the divine attributes through His humanity in His human virtues.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Development of Christ&rsquo;s Humanity<br />
to Attain to the Consummate Glory<br />
in Full in Eternity</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Related to the Development<br />
of His Divinity That He May Be One Who Is<br />
Glorified in Divinity and Humanity</h2>
<p>The development of Christ&rsquo;s humanity is related to the development of His divinity that He may be a God-man who enters into glory in both divinity and humanity. He passed through incarnation and arrived at His resurrection out of death to enter into the glory of His divinity. Then in resurrection He ascended to heaven and was exalted, and through His ascension He entered into the state of reigning in the kingdom. In the restoration of all things in the coming kingdom, the kingship of Christ with His humanity, which has attained to the highest state, will manifest the splendor of the glory of His fullness, as prophesied in Jeremiah 23:5 and 33:15.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Eventually Attaining to the Consummate<br />
Glory in Full in the New Jerusalem<br />
in the New Heaven and New Earth</h2>
<p>The development of Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah and the Shoot of David will attain not only to the glorious condition of the kingdom in the coming age but also to the condition of the consummate glory in full in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. In eternity He will be the Shoot of Jehovah and the Shoot of David&mdash;the God-man as the development of the Shoot of Jehovah and man, attaining to the full glory in the ultimate consummation.</p>
