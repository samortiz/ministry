   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING SINNED IN ADAM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How does the Bible view the fall of mankind?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It shows us that due to the unity of men, when the first man Adam sinned, all sinned in him, although none were yet born.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The way we look at it is whether or not we as individuals have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is not God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even if I had never sinned from the day I was born, God would ask from whom I came.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I came from Adam, then I was there and took part when Adam sinned in the garden of Eden, even if I have not sinned from the day I was born.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to biological law, my life is communicated from Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The latest life is the same as the first life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to God, everyone from Adam on is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Adam sinned; so every single person became a sinner in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suppose a man has never sinned of course, no such person ever existed .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God would still reckon him a sinner because his life is a life that sins; he is the offspring of a sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even though we do not feel that we have the same experience as Adam, the fact is that his life is in man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Up till today we bear this life with us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>ANOTHER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible also shows us another man, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God considers Christ the same way He considers Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God counts Adam and everyone from him as one man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the same way, God considers Christ as the Head and includes everyone who comes out of Him as one man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The life we received from Adam is a life of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we can come out of Christ and receive His life, we can be free from sin in the same manner Jesus was.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the present, we will not consider how to receive this life that comes out from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We will explain this later.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We want to see how the life that comes out of Christ is the very life of Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is a life without sin, a life that is pleasing to God, filled with the Holy Spirit, and absolutely holy and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we receive such a life, we will be the same as Christ, having the same experiences He had.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>NO THIRD MAN</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, there are only two men in the whole of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Either you have your being in Adam or in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are not associated with Adam, you have to be associated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You cannot find a third man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once someone asked me, "How many people are there in hell?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I told him that there was only one, and that there was also only one in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The man in Christ is in one place, and the man in Adam is in another.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is extremely simple.</S>
