<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Consummated, Compounded, All-inclusive, Life-giving, Indwelling, Sevenfold Spirit<br>of Jesus Christ, Who Was Not Yet<br>before the Resurrection of Christ</H2><P>The third factor of the genuine Christian perfection is the consummated, compounded, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold Spirit of Jesus Christ (Exo. 30:23-25; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:11; Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; Phil. 1:19). Such a Spirit was not yet before the resurrection of Christ (John 7:38-39).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Divine Life</H2><P>Another factor which produces the genuine Christian living is the divine life (John 1:4; 10:10b; 3:15; 14:6; Col. 3:4; Rom. 5:17, 21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Divine Nature</H2><P>Second Peter 1:4 says that we have become partakers of the divine nature, which is the divine element.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Hand of Love of God the Father<br>and the Hand of Grace of God the Son</H2><P>John 10:28 and 29 speak of God the Father's hand of love plus the Son's hand of grace. These are factors of Christian perfection. No one, including Satan, can snatch us away from these two hands.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Unlimited Fullness of the Father</H2><P>The Father's fullness is unlimited (Col. 1:19). The fullness means the overflow of the riches. When a cup is filled with water to overflowing, that overflow is the fullness. John 1:16 says, "For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. The Unsearchable Riches of Christ</H2><P>The unsearchable riches of the all-inclusive Christ also bring forth the genuine Christian living (Eph. 3:8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. The Bountiful Supply of the Spirit</H2><P>The bountiful, the sufficient, the complete supply of the Spirit is spoken of in Philippians 1:19.</P>
