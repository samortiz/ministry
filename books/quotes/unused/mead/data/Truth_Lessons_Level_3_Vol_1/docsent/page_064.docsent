   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MANNA</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first thing that the children of Israel needed in their journey through the wilderness was the thirst-quenching water and the cooling shade.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After this, what they needed very much was food to satisfy their hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the next thing that was supplied for their life necessities was manna, the heavenly bread.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. A Type of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Manna is a type of Christ John 6:31-35, 48-51, 57-58 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the real manna, Christ was sent by God the Father that God s chosen people might live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although the children of Israel had had their exodus from Egypt, they were still Egyptian in their constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They needed to change their constitution that they might become materials for the building of God s habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God gave them manna to change their diet that they might become a new constitution through their eating.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today Christ has come from God to be our real food, and God has changed our food from something worldly to Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to eat Him that He may enter into us organically to become our inner constituents that we may be built as God s habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. The Unique Food for God s Elect</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the wilderness God gave the children of Israel nothing to eat besides the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to Numbers 11:6, the people said that there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that, besides Christ, God did not give us anything as our food supply.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is the unique food given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>C. Coming Down from Heaven</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Manna was the food which God rained from heaven for His chosen people; it was the heavenly food to sustain and supply them for their existence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a type of Christ as the bread of life sent from heaven by God the Father John 6:35, 51 to be man s life supply in the form of food that we may eat Him and live.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>D. With the Dew</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From Exodus 16:13-14 we see that manna came with the dew: In the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And when the layer of dew lifted, there upon the surface of the wilderness were fine round flakes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This small, round thing was manna.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Numbers 11:9 also says, When the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the Bible, the dew signifies daily grace, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Psalm 133:3 mentions the dew of Hermon / That came down upon the mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The dew of Hermon signifies grace which comes down from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to Lamentations 3:22 and 23, God s mercy, like the dew, is fresh every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Mercy in the Old Testament eventually issues in grace in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Grace is God reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When God reaches us in a positive manner, full of mercy and compassion, He becomes grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Manna coming down with the dew signifies that Christ as our heavenly bread of life comes to us through grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>E. In the Morning</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Exodus 16:21 says that the children of Israel gathered it morning by morning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fact that manna came in the morning indicates that it gives us a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may also say that every new beginning brings us fresh manna.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we desire to enjoy Christ as the real manna, we must be prepared for a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, whenever we enjoy Christ as our daily food, He brings us a new beginning every day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>F. Small</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Manna was something small, signifying the smallness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ was a descendant of David, a descendant of a royal family.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, He was born in a manger, and He was raised in the home of a carpenter in a small, despised town.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This indicates that the Lord did not make a display of His greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, He preferred to be small in the eyes of man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to John 6, the crowd wanted to enthrone the Lord Jesus as a king, but He fled from man s exaltation of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The next day He returned and presented Himself as the bread of life, which was as small as the manna v. 35 . He did not want to be a king; He wanted to be food that we may receive Him as our life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As the real manna, Christ is small enough for us to take in, digest, and assimilate.</S>
