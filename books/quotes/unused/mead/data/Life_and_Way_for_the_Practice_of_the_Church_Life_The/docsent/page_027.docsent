   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Even though we love the Lord, we still act apart from Him most of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In our daily living and walk, we are like Peter before the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before the Lord's resurrection, Peter was one who loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Yet he acted on his own all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was a good brother, but he acted by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time he did not live by Christ, walk in the Spirit, and take Christ as life, strength, and power for his service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Like Peter, we may seem to love the Lord so much, but we do not take Him as our life in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Most of the time we walk and act either according to our own opinions, thoughts, and ideas or according to religious doctrines or church concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What the Lord wants is that we take Him as our life and walk in oneness with Him by fellowshipping with Him all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes after I finished reading the Holy Bible, I had to confess to the Lord and ask for His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is because while I was reading it, the Lord was demanding that I pray.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But I was not willing to pray at that moment because what I was reading was really interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, I would go on with my reading and ignore the inner regulating.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Outwardly, it seemed that I was nicely reading the Word, but inwardly I was disobedient to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the Christian life is not an outward matter but an inward matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is why in the New Testament we are taught not to judge people according to their outward actions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A person may be very good, right, and religious, yet he may be very disobedient to the Lord within.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He does things always according to his own taste and preference.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He has his desire, his intention, and his motives, but he does not know the meaning of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to humble ourselves before the Lord, confessing to Him, "Lord, maybe I am not sinful or worldly, but I am disobedient to You.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Maybe people would appreciate and applaud me, thinking that I am religious, right, and good, yet they don't know that I disobey You all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I don't take You as my life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I don't walk in You or live by You.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I don't know the meaning of the cross and the meaning of walking in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I don't know the law of the Spirit of life in me."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we need to go further and pray, "Lord, I need Your deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Deliver me from things other than Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You are the living One.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You are the only One who is living, acting, moving, working, shining, and regulating within me all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lord, help me to take care of You and to go along with You.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Help me to forget about all the outward things."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to humble ourselves before the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The life for the practice of the church life is Christ Himself experienced by us through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must be put to death by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This should not be merely a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It must be our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In our daily life, we should always deny ourselves and take Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we will have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without the cross on the negative side and the living Christ on the positive side, we will have many problems whenever we come together.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Each one of us is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are not willing to be put away by the cross and to take Christ as our life, we will be a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not listen to this message for others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not nod your head, saying, "This message is good for Brother So-and-so.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am glad he is here."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you say this, this simply shows that you are in yourself and out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you are in Christ, you will say, "Lord, this is what I need.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I need this for Your Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I need this for the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I need the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I need You as the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I need to know You as the living One within me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I need to know how You regulate me and shine in me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I need to go along with You in me."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brothers and sisters, when we learn the lesson of the cross and experience Christ as the living One and the law of the Spirit of life in us, we have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The church life is nothing less than Christ Himself lived out through us in a corporate way.</S>
