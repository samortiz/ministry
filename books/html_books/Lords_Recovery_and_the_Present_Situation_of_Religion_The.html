<h1 class="title">THE PRESENT EVIL AGE AND<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S CALLING OF HIS DISCIPLES<br />
IN GALILEE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 1:4, 13-16a; 2:3, 19-20; 3:1-3, 5, 14, 27; 4:6, 19, 29; 5:3-6, 16, 25; 6:1, 8, 13-15, 18</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT EVIL AGE BELONGING TO<br />
THE RELIGIOUS WORLD</h2>
<p>In the book of Galatians there are several crucial phrases. The first is in 1:4, which says, &ldquo;Who gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age according to the will of our God and Father.&rdquo; The apostle Paul uses two modifiers, <em>present</em> and <em>evil,</em> for the word <em>age.</em> According to the traditional religious concept, Christ gave Himself for our sins that He might deliver us out of hell and bring us into heaven. However, the actual issue of Christ giving Himself for our sins is not merely to deliver us out of hell and bring us into heaven but to deliver us from this present evil age. We may suppose that the word <em>age</em> in the Bible refers to the secular age, or world. However, in the New Testament there are two kinds of ages: the secular age and the religious age. The book of Galatians deals not with the secular age but with the religious age.</p>
<p>God created the heavens, the earth, and man for the fulfillment of His purpose, and He ordained many things for man&rsquo;s existence, such as food, protection, and a place to live. However, when Satan came in to cause man to fall, he corrupted all the things created by God for man&rsquo;s existence, and he formed the world to ensnare man and distract man from God&rsquo;s eternal purpose (Gen. 4:16-24). This is the secular world that we see before us today, in which people are ensnared by the things in the world and kept away from God&rsquo;s purpose. After the fall God came in to bring man back to Himself. To this end, God gave man the Scriptures to tell man how to come to Him, how to be one with Him, and how to take Him as his life and living that man may fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. However, after man was brought back to God through the holy writings, Satan came in again to cause man to use his fallen mentality to form different kinds of religions based on these writings. In this way the second kind of world&mdash;the religious world&mdash;came into existence.</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s goal is to keep man away from the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Originally, it was the first kind of world, the secular world, that kept man away from God&rsquo;s purpose, but after God brought man back to Himself, Satan formed the second kind of world, the religious world, to once again keep man away from God. It may seem that the secular world keeps man away from God and that the religious world helps man to come back to Him. In actuality, however, both aspects of the world, the secular and the religious, keep man away from God. The age mentioned in Galatians refers not to the ordinary, secular world but to the particular, religious world. When we speak about the secular world, many people understand what we mean, but when we speak about the religious world, people may question our meaning. They may say, &ldquo;Do you mean that religion is a world? Religion helps people to worship God, please God, and serve God. How can such a thing be a world?&rdquo; The book of Galatians, however, reveals that religion is indeed a world. In particular, the term <em>the present evil age</em> in Galatians 1:4 refers to the present evil age of religion.</p>
<p>Galatians 6:14 says, &ldquo;Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.&rdquo; The world in this verse is not mainly the secular world but the religious world. This is proved by the following verse. Verse 15 begins with the word <em>for,</em> indicating that what follows is an explanation of what has just been mentioned. Paul said that the world had been crucified to him, &ldquo;for neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision.&rdquo; By this we can see that the world mentioned in verse 14 refers mainly to the religious world. To be sure, a world consisting of circumcision is not the world of restaurants and theaters. Circumcision is in the religious world, a realm of religious regulations and rituals.</p>
<p>There is a difference between an age and the world. The world is the entire satanic system, but an age is only one section of the world (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 2:2). The world is composed of many ages. Paul spoke of the evil age of the first century. If he were living today, he would speak of the evil age of the present century. Paul was in his present age, and we are now in our present age. The present evil age in Paul&rsquo;s time included Judaism, the religion of the Jews, with its circumcision and the law. This was the prevailing religion of that time, a religion that charged and compelled people both to be circumcised and to keep the law continually for their whole life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORLD OF RELIGION, TRADITION,<br />
SUPERSTITION, AND FALSEHOOD<br />
BEING EVIL IN THE EYES OF GOD</h2>
<p>The longer that human history has continued, the more religions it has brought forth. At Paul&rsquo;s time there was only one main religion, Judaism. In the past nineteen centuries, however, many more religions have been formed. Besides Judaism there is Christianity, including Catholicism, and there is Islam. Moreover, even within today&rsquo;s Christianity there are many religions, such as those centered around baptism by immersion, the observance of the seventh day, speaking in tongues, and other matters. There are formal religions, fundamental religions, Pentecostal religions, and charismatic religions. All these were formed to one degree or another based on the same Bible. Even the counterfeit religion of Islam was adapted from parts of the Bible. Thus, all the main religions on earth today are related to the Bible. God gave us the Bible, but the enemy of God utilized man&rsquo;s mentality to form many religions based on the Bible. Apparently, all these religions teach people to worship God, please God, serve God, and do many things for God, but in actuality they keep people away from the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose. Therefore, all religions have become evil in the eyes of God. This is the reason that Paul speaks of the present evil age of religion.</p>
<p>The first chapter of Galatians mentions the age, and the last chapter speaks of the world. As we have seen, the age is simply a part of the world. Between these two chapters of Galatians there are several other crucial terms. In 1:13 and 14 Paul speaks of Judaism, that is, the Jewish religion, and also of traditions. In these two verses he says, &ldquo;You have heard of my manner of life formerly in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it. And I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more abundantly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers.&rdquo; Today we still have religion and traditions. Recently, a number of brothers visited Rome, the center of Catholicism; Geneva, a strong center of Protestantism; Greece, the center of Greek Orthodoxy; and Israel, the center of Judaism. After visiting all these religious centers, we were impressed with the religion, tradition, superstition, and falsehood that we saw there. We saw no light, truth, or life in those places. In Rome, for example, in the Basilica of Saint Peter the foot of the statue of Peter has been eroded because it has been kissed by people for centuries. This is the result of a great superstition. According to tradition, the tomb of Peter lies beneath the Basilica. There are also tombs of a number of popes, before which people come to kneel and pray. In one room there is a large painting of the Trinity, depicting the Father as an old man with a beard, the Son as a young man standing by Him, and the Spirit as a dove overhead. In between the Father and the Son stands Mary, who is called &ldquo;the mother of God.&rdquo; According to this tradition, it seems that there are no longer three in the Trinity but four, since Mary is worshipped along with the Father and the Son.</p>
<p>After visiting these major centers of the various religions, we received the deep impression that the world today is fully, thoroughly, and heavily covered with the darkness of religion. The darkness of religion overshadows the entire earth. People have been drugged with religion and are fully under its influence. Therefore, the Lord has no way to fulfill His eternal purpose in religion, including Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism. Most people have no sense of how dark and evil religion is. If a room is filled with the odor of garlic for a long time, everyone in the room will lose his consciousness of the odor, but if someone comes into the room from the fresh air, he will not be able to tolerate it. When we were in Rome and the other centers of religion, we could not tolerate the things there. We had the deep sensation that the atmosphere in some of these places was full of demons, and we could not remain there for very long. Today some of the denominations, the &ldquo;daughters&rdquo; of the great harlot (Rev. 17:5), are making advances to come together with Roman Catholicism in an ecumenical movement, and Catholicism is making certain concessions in order to receive the denominations. The Catholic Church has received even the charismatic movement and infiltrated it with the worship of Mary and the mass. This is an example of the situation in religion today.</p>
<p>When we were in Rome, we sat very close to the pope and listened to him speak. Apparently, he gave a very spiritual message. He told the audience that although our languages are different, we are all one in the Spirit and are members of the mystical Body of Christ. He also said that we must have a personal connection with Christ as the resurrected One and must care for the new man in our daily walk. When I was in the denominations and even under the Brethren teachers, I never heard a message using such proper spiritual terms as these. Nevertheless, while the pope was giving such a spiritual message, he was surrounded by many idols, including images of serpents, and he sat under a great canopy made of bronze taken from the Roman Pantheon. His spiritual message amidst all those things related to idol worship was truly three measures of meal in which much leaven was hidden (Matt. 13:33). Only because we had been rescued from such a situation were we able to appreciate the spiritual terms that were spoken.</p>
<p>Judaism has also turned many things into traditions and superstitions. The Wailing Wall in Jerusalem is a part of the wall belonging to the original structure of the temple that remained after the destruction of Jerusalem. Because of this, the Jews now consider it to be a sacred site, and they come there to pray, weep, and even to kiss the wall. This also is a superstitious practice. Wherever we went, we found superstitions and traditions like these. Over a cathedral in Corinth we observed a sign listing all the bishops of the church in Corinth in an unbroken succession, beginning from Paul, continuing through Apollos, and concluding with the present day. This too is a mere tradition. In the United States also we can see religion, tradition, and superstition. Many people in the Roman Catholic Church pray before the images of the &ldquo;saints&rdquo; so that the sufferings of their loved ones in purgatory may be reduced. This is a great superstition. The celebration of Christmas and Easter also belongs to religion, tradition, superstition, and falsehood. At the time of Paul there was mainly one religion, but in our time there are many religions. If the time of Paul was an evil age, how much more evil is ours!</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY, WHICH IS VERSUS RELIGION,<br />
BEING THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST<br />
AS THE SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Between his mentioning of the present evil age (Gal. 1:4) and the world (6:14) Paul speaks of the Jewish religion and tradition (1:13-14). He also speaks about circumcision and the law (2:3; 3:10-13; 5:3-6; 6:13). To the Jews, <em>circumcision</em> and <em>law</em> are both good terms. The Jews were required to be circumcised and to always keep the law. However, these were components of the present evil age at the time of Paul. Circumcision and the law were evil because these two religious items kept people away from Christ and the Spirit. God&rsquo;s eternal purpose can be fulfilled only in Christ and through the Spirit. Therefore, in Galatians besides the line of religion, including Judaism, tradition, circumcision, the law, and the world, there is also the line of Christ and the Spirit (3:1-3, 14; 4:19). This shows that anything related to worshipping, pleasing, or serving God apart from Christ and the Spirit is religion, which is evil in the eyes of God. Paul was in the Jewish religion, he advanced in it beyond many of his contemporaries, and he was abundantly zealous for the traditions of his fathers. However, it pleased God one day to reveal His Son, Christ, in him (1:15-16a). This is not a matter of being religious or of keeping the traditions; it is a matter of Christ in us. In 2:19-20 Paul says, &ldquo;I through law have died to law that I might live to God. I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we still try to keep the law, we will be kept from Christ and will go back into religion. Although almost no one would consider that to keep the law is evil in the eyes of God, Paul was bold to say that in his experience it was evil, because keeping the law separates people from Christ (5:1-4). We should not try any longer to keep the law. What God wants today is simply that we would live by Christ. We need Christ to be not only our Redeemer but also our life and our person. He must live in us, and we must live by Him. Moreover, Christ must be formed in us (4:19), and we must put Him on by being baptized into Him (3:27). Christ is not only our life; He is also our covering and the realm, the sphere, in which we live and walk. This also is altogether not a matter of religion. It is a matter of Christ being everything to us. He is our Redeemer, life, person, clothing, realm, and atmosphere. We live by Him, we live in Him, and we walk in Him. He is everything to us.</p>
<p>Paul also tells us that the Spirit is the reality of Christ in our experience (vv. 1-3, 13-14). We have received the Spirit, God bountifully supplies to us the Spirit, and God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts (v. 5; 4:6). Since we have the Spirit, we must walk by the Spirit, live by the Spirit, sow unto the Spirit, and reap eternal life of the Spirit (5:16, 25; 6:8). We need to do everything in the Spirit, who is Christ experienced by us. In order to experience Christ, who is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), we need to exercise our spirit. Galatians 6:1 says, &ldquo;Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness,&rdquo; and the final verse of Galatians says, &ldquo;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit&rdquo; (v. 18). We need to exercise our spirit to touch Christ and experience Him as grace in our spirit. This is God&rsquo;s economy, which is versus religion. At Paul&rsquo;s time there was mainly one religion, but today there are many religions that teach people to worship God, to serve God, and to try to please God apart from the experience of the living Christ. If the age at Paul&rsquo;s time was evil, the age today is much more evil. If Paul unveiled to the saints that they should not be under the influence of that religious age, how much more do we need to be delivered from the influence of religion in our own age.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD CALLING HIS DISCIPLES IN GALILEE,<br />
NOT IN JERUSALEM, THE CENTER OF RELIGION</h2>
<p>As we observed the things in the religious centers that we visited, we were deeply impressed with the traditional, superstitious, false, and dirty things that we saw. The Lord Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem, but He was raised in Galilee, where He continued to live. Even when He came into His ministry, He did not stay in Jerusalem for long; He went there mainly for the annual feasts. We do not find in the Gospels that He chose to stay in Jerusalem even for one night. The last time the Lord went to Jerusalem for six days, He stayed in Bethany, going into Jerusalem only during the day (Matt. 21:1, 10-11, 17). Most of His life and work were in Galilee, and all the disciples whom He called, except for Judas, were from Galilee, not from Judea (cf. 10:4). When the Lord ascended, the angels called the disciples &ldquo;men of Galilee,&rdquo; and on the day of Pentecost the people said, &ldquo;Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?&rdquo; (Acts 1:11; 2:7). When I was young, I was taught that the Lord Jesus was raised in Nazareth and lived in Galilee simply in order to suffer and be despised. When we were in Israel, however, we realized that the Lord needed to be in Galilee because the atmosphere in Jerusalem was too religious. The Lord could not do much there.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus came not to the secular world but to the religious world, but He did not care for that religion, the holy city, the holy temple, or the worship in the temple. Rather, He began something new. There were certain spiritual persons in Jerusalem, such as Simeon, Anna, and Nicodemus (Luke 2:25, 36; John 3:1), but the Lord purposely did not go there to call His disciples, because that region had been altogether spoiled by religion (cf. 2:23-24). The situation there was incurable, hopeless, and helpless. Instead, the Lord Jesus gave up that region and went to Galilee of the Gentiles, where there was little influence of religion. There He called young Galilean fishermen, such as Peter and John. He did this in order to have a new beginning for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy could not be carried out by the people in Jerusalem, who had been fully drugged by religion.</p>
<p>If we read the New Testament carefully, we can see that the twelve apostles were young people. When James and John were called, for example, they were working with their father, indicating that they were not very old, perhaps in their younger twenties (Matt. 4:21-22). Three and a half years later, when they were the elders of the first church, the church in Jerusalem, they were probably only in their late twenties. There was a change at that time that caused the older ones, the priests and scribes, to be out of date, because their religion could not fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. Those who were drugged with religion became useless for the Lord&rsquo;s purpose, and because of this the Lord left them behind and went to a new region to call young fishermen and have a new beginning. One day the Lord brought these disciples far away from the holy city and the holy temple to Caesarea Philippi in the northern part of the Holy Land, close to the border. It was there in the clear atmosphere that He gave them the vision of Christ and the church (16:13-18), and it was there on Mount Hermon that He was transfigured (17:1-2).</p>
<p>The religious age today is no better than the age at the Lord&rsquo;s time. If the religion at His time was hopeless, religion today is even more hopeless, and the Lord cannot have His way in it. Therefore, the Lord desires a new beginning in &ldquo;Galilee.&rdquo; Today&rsquo;s Galilee is the United States, and the &ldquo;Sea of Galilee&rdquo; is the college campuses. Today the Lord is traveling around the &ldquo;Sea of Galilee&rdquo; to call young &ldquo;Galilean fishermen.&rdquo; After the Lord called the young disciples in Galilee, He trained them there. He did not carry out much training in Jerusalem. In Jerusalem Nicodemus came to the Lord Jesus with certain kinds of arguments (John 3:1, 4), and when the Lord healed the impotent man in Jerusalem, this stirred up an evil debate (5:1-10, 16). Later the Lord also forgave the sinful woman and cured the blind man in Jerusalem (8:10-11; 9:1, 6-7). However, most of the training that the Lord exercised over the disciples was carried out in Galilee. Then after three and a half years of training, the Lord told the disciples to remain in Jerusalem and wait there (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4). They were trained in Galilee but sent to Jerusalem. Today the Lord is coming to visit many campuses around the &ldquo;Sea of Galilee&rdquo; to call many &ldquo;fishermen&rdquo; to follow Him and be trained by Him. Then after a certain amount of time, He will send them to Europe and to Israel. In this way, the Lord will gain both &ldquo;Galilee&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jerusalem,&rdquo; that is, the United States, Europe, and Israel. However, for this purpose we must be young; we must not grow old. If we become old, we are finished with the Lord&rsquo;s move.</p>
<p>We need to bring these matters to the Lord and ask Him to show us the real situation today. This is truly an evil age, and we must all be delivered from it. The religious world is crucified to us, and we are crucified to the world. Now we are the young Galilean followers of Jesus, who are under His training in order to bring His testimony to &ldquo;Jerusalem,&rdquo; that is, to Europe and to Israel.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

AND INFLUENCE OF RELIGION<br />
FOR THE SPREAD OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 2:11-14; Acts 21:18-24, 26-33</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AND THE CHURCH BEING<br />
VERSUS THE RELIGION OF JUDAISM</h2>
<p>According to the complete revelation of the Bible, God made a plan in eternity past to dispense Himself into man in order to make man a corporate expression of Himself. After He made His plan, God created the universe with the heavens, the earth, and especially man with a human spirit (Zech. 12:1). This indicates that the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man&rsquo;s existence, and man with his spirit is for God. With his spirit man must contact, receive, contain, and assimilate God so that He may be life to man, and man may be His living corporate expression. This is God&rsquo;s intention throughout all the dispensations and generations. This is very clear in the Bible, but in order to see this, we must have a vision. We may have the Bible in our hands for our entire life yet never see this vision. This is what has happened in Christianity. Christianity has the Bible, but many people in Christianity do not see the eternal plan of God. In order that man may see God&rsquo;s desire, God gave him the Bible. However, the enemy of God never sleeps. He came in and utilized all the points in this Holy Book to instigate man to exercise his mentality to form religion. Religion is something formed by the human mentality under Satan&rsquo;s instigation and inspiration in order to oppose God&rsquo;s economy. Apparently, religion is for God, but in actuality, it is fully against Him.</p>
<p>The first religion formed in this way was Judaism, which came entirely from the Old Testament. In the Old Testament, God gave His people the commandments concerning circumcision, the Sabbath, and dietary regulations. Every male among God&rsquo;s people had to be circumcised on the eighth day after his birth (Gen. 17:9-14). In addition, every seven days the Israelites had to keep the Sabbath separate, holy, and for God (Exo. 20:8-11), and in their eating they had to keep a particular diet (Lev. 11). These three things&mdash;circumcision, the Sabbath, and the holy diet&mdash;are the three pillars upon which Judaism is supported. All these are in the Old Testament, but they are not the kernel of the Old Testament. The kernel of the Old Testament is Christ and God&rsquo;s dwelling place, that is, Christ and the church. In the Old Testament there are many prophecies, types, shadows, and figures showing, declaring, and describing who Christ would be, what He would do, and where He would go. In addition, in the Old Testament there is also God&rsquo;s dwelling place. First, God&rsquo;s people Israel built a tabernacle for God&rsquo;s dwelling. Then this tabernacle was replaced by a solid temple, and after the temple was destroyed, a recovered temple was built. Thus, Christ and God&rsquo;s dwelling place are the kernel of the Old Testament. Circumcision, the Sabbath, and the holy diet are far off from the kernel, but Satan utilized what God commanded to cause the Jews to exercise their mentality to form a religion rather than to focus on Christ and God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Anything that we do to serve God, worship God, or please God apart from Christ is religion. However, anything we do with Christ, in Christ, and in union with Christ can never be a religion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST COMING ACCORDING TO PROPHECY,<br />
APART FROM RELIGION</h2>
<p>In the fullness of the time, the promised Christ came. Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; / And the government / Is upon His shoulder; / And His name will be called / Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father, / Prince of Peace.&rdquo; His name is called Wonderful, meaning that no one can fully understand Him. Anything that we can fully understand is not wonderful, but in the universe there is One who is wonderful. The more we abide in Him, the more wonderful He is to us. This One is not only the Redeemer but also the Counselor. We all need Christ as our Counselor. Moreover, the child born in the manger is the Mighty God, and the Son given to us is the Eternal Father. He is also the Prince of Peace. If we have Him, we have the Counselor, God, the Father, and peace. Micah 5:2 also tells us that His goings forth are from ancient times, from the days of eternity.</p>
<p>This One came in a very humble way. First, He was born in a manger. He was persecuted and fled to Egypt, and later, because of the persecution in Judea around Jerusalem, He escaped again to Nazareth in Galilee. There He was raised in the home of a poor carpenter for thirty years. In the holy city was the holy temple, and related to the holy temple were the altar, the priesthood, and the priestly ministry to offer the various sacrifices according to the book of Leviticus. Here also were the burning of the incense and the lighting of the lampstands morning and evening. All these were according to the Old Testament. Far to the north, however, was a city called Nazareth, in which there was a carpenter&rsquo;s home, where the child born to us and the Son given to us lived for thirty years. This child and Son was God Himself. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; This Word who became flesh was Jesus of Nazareth. Therefore, during those thirty years God was not in Jerusalem; He was in Nazareth. Religion was in Jerusalem, but Christ was in Nazareth. At that time, in order to meet God, people needed to go to Nazareth, even to the home of a carpenter. However, the Jews were not clear concerning this. According to their religion, tradition, and superstition, they went to Jerusalem, the place of religion, and not to Nazareth.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST CALLING AND TRAINING<br />
YOUNG PEOPLE OUTSIDE RELIGION</h2>
<p>At the end of thirty years Jesus came out to minister. At first He did not go to the holy city to minister in the holy temple. Instead, He went to the wilderness, to a &ldquo;wild&rdquo; man named John the Baptist, in order to be baptized by him (Matt. 3:1-4, 13). If we read the Gospels again, we will see that Jesus preferred not to be in Jerusalem. Whenever He was in Jerusalem, He received trouble, opposition, arguments, slanders, and insults. He did not have rest and enjoyment there. Instead, He spent most of His time in Galilee. It was there that He called young people to be His disciples. The Gospels record the Lord&rsquo;s calling of James and John, but they do not mention that He directly called Zebedee or any of the other fathers of the disciples (4:21-22). Likewise, the disciples named in Acts 1:13 are only the young ones who had been called by the Lord, although some among the one hundred twenty must have been older women (v. 14; cf. Luke 8:2-3; 24:10).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus called the young Galilean fishermen, not the religious priests, scribes, or elders. Then after the Lord Jesus called the disciples, He trained them for three and a half years. This was the Lord&rsquo;s &ldquo;trade school,&rdquo; located not in the holy temple but in the wilderness and on the mountaintops and seashores far away from the religious things. The Lord trained His disciples to have faith, for example, by calming a storm (Matt. 8:23-27). Today the Lord is taking a similar way. We do not need to go to a seminary to be trained. Rather, we simply need to follow the Lord through troubles and storms.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem there was the strong center of religion according to the Old Testament, but in Galilee there was a living person. Apparently, He was only a carpenter without an academic degree, and those whom He chose were also not learned (John 7:15; Acts 4:13). Nevertheless, the Lord trained His disciples so that one day He could live in them in a practical way in order to produce the church for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose and plan. Then after three and a half years of training, the Trainer went to the cross to die. Through His death and resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), and in the evening of the day of His resurrection, He breathed Himself into all these trained disciples (John 20:22). At that time the disciples had learned their &ldquo;trade,&rdquo; and they also had the Trainer living within them. They were not trained in how to offer the sacrifices or burn the incense, and they were not even formally trained in how to interpret the Bible. Rather, they learned the &ldquo;trade,&rdquo; the skill, of how to live by Christ and with Christ in a corporate way so that He might gain His church.</p>
<p>Day by day and month after month for three and a half years the Lord Jesus was with His disciples. His presence alone was a kind of training to them. Whatever He did, spoke, or accomplished was a training in the eyes of all the disciples. What the disciples learned was entirely different from what the priests were trained in. What the priests learned was religion, but what the disciples learned was Christ. After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection they had learned their trade, and they also had the Trainer, Christ, living within them as their life. Then after this preparation, the Lord Jesus charged them to remain in Jerusalem until He poured out the Spirit on the day of Pentecost for the producing of the first local church, the church in Jerusalem.</p>

UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF RELIGION</h2>
<p>At this point there were two temples in Jerusalem, a physical one and a spiritual one as God&rsquo;s house on the earth. One temple was in religion, and the other was Christ with the church (1 Cor. 3:16). Everyone could see the physical temple but not many could see the spiritual one. Even though God was in the spiritual temple, the physical, religious temple opposed the spiritual one. To some, it must have seemed that the physical temple was more scriptural than the spiritual one. Apparently, the Old Testament speaks of priests in the physical temple, not of apostles in the spiritual temple. Moreover, the apostles were all unlearned Galileans; not one was from the holy city. If we had been in Jerusalem at that time, we might have gone to the physical temple, not to the spiritual temple, which did not seem to be according to the letter of the Old Testament. However, at least one hundred twenty, plus three thousand more on the day of Pentecost, received the heavenly vision to be in the spiritual temple.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was not easy to stand with the heavenly vision. Peter, John, and the others were enlightened, clear, and trained, but since they were in Jerusalem, not in Galilee, they were surrounded by religion, and it became difficult for them to remain in a pure condition. When Peter went north to Antioch, far away from Jerusalem, he was put to the test. There were not only Jews but also some Gentiles in the church there, and at first Peter ate with the Gentile believers. This was proper and apart from religion. However, when certain of the Jews came from Jerusalem to Antioch, Peter withdrew from eating with the Gentiles (Gal. 2:11-14). To do this was to keep the Jewish religion.</p>
<p>Peter had already received a special vision in Acts 10:9-16, in which he realized that God had included the Gentiles in His economy. Not long afterward, however, Peter went against the vision that he had seen, and all the Jewish believers, including Barnabas, joined him in this hypocrisy. Peter was a bold person, but in Galatians 2 he was weak. This shows that the atmosphere and influence of religion are difficult to overcome. We may believe that we are strong, but when we are tested by religion, we may be exposed and find that we are weak. Religion is hateful in the eyes of God because religion replaces Christ, damages the church, and frustrates God&rsquo;s economy. Therefore, Paul rebuked Peter and opposed him to his face. No doubt, Peter was convinced by Paul. Inwardly, he might have said, &ldquo;Brother Paul, you are right. What a shame that I was so weak.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">PAUL BEING WEAKENED BY<br />
THE INFLUENCE OF RELIGION IN JERUSALEM</h2>
<p>Some time later, when Paul went to Jerusalem, he came to James and the elders there (Acts 21:18-19). All these ones worked together to convince Paul, saying, &ldquo;You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed; and all are zealous for the law. And they have been informed concerning you that you are teaching all the Jews throughout the nations apostasy from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs. What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come. Therefore do this that we tell you: We have four men who have a vow on themselves; take these and be purified with them, and pay their expenses that they may shave their heads. And all will know that there is nothing to the things that they have been informed of concerning you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law&rdquo; (vv. 20-24). It is difficult to believe that Paul would do this only a few years after he wrote Galatians, but he did. He brought the four men, who no doubt were believers, to the temple and the priest, paid their fee, and waited for the completion of the vow. Again this shows that it is not easy to be rescued from religion.</p>
<p>When Paul was surrounded by James and the others, perhaps including Peter and John, it was difficult not to be convinced. Still, no one can subdue the Lord. The Lord has His economy, and even though Paul tolerated the influence of religion, the Lord would not allow him to continue. Before the seven days were completed, the Lord came in and disrupted the entire situation. It was through this that Paul was arrested (vv. 26-33). The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Do you think that you can be purified in the temple? Religion cannot purify you. Rather, I will allow you to go to prison, which will be a real purification to you.&rdquo; Paul was purified not in the temple but in prison, and it was there that he wrote his deepest Epistles. God was sovereign and did not allow Paul to become involved in the old religion that he had thoroughly condemned in Galatians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FAILURE OF THE CHURCH<br />
IN FALLING BACK INTO JUDAISM BRINGING IN<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S JUDGMENT ON JERUSALEM</h2>
<p>According to history, it was only a few years later, in A.D. 70, that the Lord sent the Roman army under Titus to destroy Jerusalem and the temple, leaving not one stone upon another (Matt. 24:1-2). Josephus, the Jewish historian, wrote about the slaughter under Titus. Although Jerusalem had been destroyed before, no other destruction was as thorough as this one. Titus slaughtered anyone who was in Jerusalem, including Jews and Jewish Christians. In this way the Lord used &ldquo;one stone to kill two birds.&rdquo; Not only was Judaism destroyed at that time, but Christianity in Jerusalem also was destroyed. Without that destruction, Christianity would have taken Jerusalem as its center, and the church would have fallen into another religion. Because the Lord was offended with the situation there, He not only disrupted the purification in the temple that Paul had begun, but He also eventually sent the Roman army to destroy the whole of Jerusalem. Because there was a thorough destruction of Jerusalem, it is difficult to trace the history of the apostles after that time. The Lord did not spare the church in Jerusalem. He destroyed the temple, the city, and even the church there, because the church was falling back into Judaism.</p>
<p>It was not a small thing for James and the elders to try to convince Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, to neglect Christ and the church and return to the temple, the Old Testament, and the old religion. Because the Lord could not tolerate that, He disrupted the situation, caused Paul to be arrested and put into prison, and destroyed Jerusalem with both the temple and the church. He did all this so that there would be no way for His church to return to Judaism. Therefore, we should not think that as long as a group of people has the Bible, serves God, and tries to be scriptural, they are right. This is altogether a religious concept. We are not merely for these things; we are for Christ and the church apart from all religion. We need to clearly see what religion is and what Christ and the church are.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FURTHER DEGRADATION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Hierarchy Killing the Functions<br />
of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>The church is an organism, the Body of Christ. It is one with Christ in life and in spirit. In the early days of the church the disciples were filled with Christ and clothed with Christ. They had no regulations, rituals, doctrinal teachings, or forms. They had only Christ within and without. In the first few chapters of Acts, for example, Peter did not care for religion, politics, knowledge, or skills. Instead, he was frank, simple, pure, and fully saturated with Christ. Gradually, however, the church tended to fall back into the &ldquo;dungeon&rdquo; of Judaism. As we have seen, because the Lord would not tolerate that, He allowed the whole of Jerusalem to be destroyed to leave no way for the church there to become a snare.</p>
<p>After a short time, however, the church became degraded again, mainly in three ways. At the beginning of the second century Ignatius was a faithful and notable teacher who was martyred for the Lord in Rome, but he was also used by Satan to teach that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder. In the New Testament <em>elder</em> and <em>overseer</em> are synonymous terms denoting the same person. <em>Elder</em> denotes the person, and <em>overseer</em> denotes the function (Acts 20:17, 28; Phil. 1:1). From the erroneous teaching of Ignatius the hierarchy in Christianity was built up. Archbishops and cardinals were produced from among the bishops, and the chief of these became the pope. The hierarchy of pope, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, and elders constitutes a change in the nature of the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is an organism, not an organization, and elders are the only office in the church for the purpose of oversight. About five hundred years after the teachings of Ignatius came forth, the papal system was established, and the position of the pope began to be officially recognized. Eventually, the hierarchical system was adopted by the Protestant churches. The Church of England and the Methodist Church, for example, have bishops and archbishops. The hierarchy is a matter of religion and has killed the function of the Body of Christ. In Christ and with Christ there is no organization or hierarchy.</p>
<p>Many pastors and ministers today justify the hierarchical system by saying, &ldquo;Because every trade today must be specialized, we cannot expect everyone to be a pastor or a preacher. Only someone trained to be an expert can do this. A person needs to study in seminary to learn how to pastor a church and give a sermon. Otherwise, he will be backward and not up to date.&rdquo; Someone who does not have light from the Lord can be convinced and cheated by this kind of reasoning. Some dear ones who have come to our meetings enjoy the life here, but they are frightened by the need to function. Some say, &ldquo;Since my profession occupies me the whole week, I simply want to relax on Sundays. The best place to relax is in a church with a good pastor who can pray for me and give a good sermon and with a good choir to sing for me. I do not want to come to a church in which I need to function.&rdquo; This example helps us to further see what religion is and what Christ is. Christ is living and functioning. Christ with the church is an organism, not an organization. In contrast, Christianity is merely a religion, and the hierarchy in it kills the functions of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">Differing Doctrines Causing<br />
Divisions in the Church</h2>
<p>Beginning from the second century the fathers of the church began to argue concerning the Person of Christ. Strictly speaking, there is no science of Christology in the Bible. This science was invented by certain teachers in order to study who Christ is. Some said that Christ is divine, and others said that He is human. Some even said that Christ was first human and eventually became divine. This resulted in fighting, which caused division. In A.D. 313 Constantine became emperor of Rome, and eventually he made Christianity the state religion and encouraged many thousands of people to be baptized into Christianity. As the emperor, Constantine did not like to see fighting in his realm, so he called a council at Nicaea in A.D. 325 to gather together the great Christian teachers. It was there under his presiding that the Nicene Creed was formed. However, that did not solve the problem of fighting in the church. From that time onward, Christianity has been filled with different kinds of doctrines. The hierarchy kills the functions of the Body of Christ, and the different teachings divide the church and cut it into pieces.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Religion, Tradition, Superstition, and Falsehood Replacing Christ and the Church</h2>
<p>After Constantine encouraged thousands of unbelievers to be baptized into Christianity, the church adopted many pagan things, such as Christmas, Easter, and the worship of Mary, which was patterned after the worship of a pagan goddess. Today we can still see relics placed on display to be venerated by people. Because of this, Christianity has become a religion full of tradition, superstition, and falsehood. This is all around us today in Catholicism, the denominations, and even the free groups. In religion there is no light, life, truth, or reality; that is, there is no Christ. Christ is there only in name, not in His Person and living reality. Likewise, there is no church in reality. The church is the living Body of Christ, but what surrounds us today is a religion full of traditions, organizations, teachings, doctrines, performances, and falsehood. The Lord cannot accomplish His purpose in this situation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLE IN THE BIBLE,<br />
THE LORD CALLING THE YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
TO TRAIN THEM AND SEND THEM OUT</h2>
<p>Revelation 17 tells us that at the end of this age the Lord will sovereignly use Antichrist to terminate religion (vv. 16-17). Then in chapter 19 the bride is prepared for Christ (vv. 7-8). There is no possibility for the Lord to prepare His bride in Catholicism, the state churches, or the denominations. The Lord prophesied in Matthew 16:18, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.&rdquo; Roman Catholicism claims to be the church built on a certain kind of rock, but that church cannot stand against the gates of Hades. Nevertheless, the Lord will not give up His promise to build the church and prepare the bride. According to the principle in the Bible, the Lord will once again turn away from today&rsquo;s religion and go to the &ldquo;Sea of Galilee&rdquo; to call some young people. Because many older ones have been influenced with a certain amount of religious thought, the Lord is forced to go to the younger generation to call the young people, train them, and send them out.</p>
<p>Since the Lord began His recovery in the United States in 1962, we have been laboring, suffering, and struggling. Eventually, our history has proven that the Lord is taking the way to reap the young people. Many in the local churches today are young people. It is difficult for some over fifty years old to turn to this way, and some who do may bring in opinions. This may be the reason that the Lord Jesus did not call Nicodemus or other older ones from Jerusalem to follow Him. He called mainly the young simple ones. When He said, &ldquo;Follow Me,&rdquo; they followed Him. They gave up the secular world, and they had relatively little of the religious world to bring with them. The Lord&rsquo;s strategy today is to gain the young people, train them, and send them to &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; to raise up the church.</p>
<p>The younger ones among us still need some years of training. However, they should not go to a seminary. They need simply to remain in the &ldquo;Galilean&rdquo; church life to have the experience of Christ and the church. Eventually, they should bear the responsibility to go first to the larger universities throughout the United States to contact the students there. Within a short amount of time the number of saints in those places will increase. Following this, some should also go to the smaller universities. At the same time, others will be burdened to emigrate to Europe. Because America and Europe are the two most crucial continents with respect to the world situation, the Lord desires to gain them. To this end, the young people should study the European languages. Then after a few years, they will have the experience of Christ and the church, the experience of knowing and contacting people, and the ability to speak to them in their language. Some may go to a major city in a particular European country to study the language for a few years. During that time they can contact their classmates and schoolmates. After a certain amount of time they will become a nucleus for the Lord to gain that city. In every country in Europe, and also in Israel, there must be a nucleus for the church life.</p>
<p>For this purpose the young people must be burdened, and they need to pray to ask the Lord whether He would send them to a college campus in the United States or to Europe. This is the unique way to have something absolutely new for the Lord. We all need to drop our concepts, have no opinions, be unloaded, and support those who go out by our prayer. The older ones must pray day and night for the young people to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in this way. If we take this way, the Lord will gain the United States, Europe, and Israel.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING DELIVERED FROM<br />
THE SUBTLETY AND DECEIT OF RELIGION<br />
TO TAKE CHRIST AS LIFE FOR THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 3:2-8; Col. 2:8-9, 16-17; 3:10-11</h1>
<p>Nothing is as subtle as religion. We are all clear that the secular world is evil and that it frustrates people from going along with God (1 John 2:15-16). The religious world, however, is very subtle. Every religion teaches man to know and worship God. Even Islam seems to teach people to worship God in a pure way, purer even than Catholicism, since Muslim mosques have no idols, images, or even depictions of natural objects. Moreover, Muslims often bathe their bodies before they pray. However, they do not have the reality of God and Christ. By this we can see that religion is deceptive.</p>
<p>Some Christians attempt to justify their organizations by asking, &ldquo;Are not the people in these organizations real Christians who worship God?&rdquo; This is a deceptive question. At the time of the Lord Jesus, the Jews not only worshipped God but carried out their worship according to the Old Testament. The proper priesthood, the priestly service, and everything the Jews did in their worship was according to the law of Moses. There were also certain spiritual persons among them, such as Simeon, who waited for the Lord to come, and Anna, who served God in the temple night and day (Luke 2:25-38). However, the Jewish religion rejected Christ, who is the very embodiment of God. The Jews said that Jesus cast out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons, and even that He had a demon (Matt. 12:24; John 8:48, 52; 10:20). Moreover, the Jews sentenced the Lord Jesus to death according to their Scriptures. At that time the religious world and the secular world cooperated together to crucify the Lord Jesus. Today the principle is the same. In order to oppose God, Christ, and the church, the secular world needs the religious world, and the religious world needs the secular world. This principle will remain until Antichrist will be used by the Lord to terminate Judaism, Catholicism, and every kind of religion.</p>
<p>Because religion is deceiving, our eyes must be enlightened that we may no longer be cheated. As we saw in the previous chapter, the apostle Paul wrote the Epistle to the Galatians to strongly condemn the observance of the law under the Jewish religion. Soon afterward he went to Jerusalem, where he was surrounded by the elders who knew his history. They told him, &ldquo;You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed; and all are zealous for the law&rdquo; (Acts 21:20). In actuality, Satan, the subtle one, had used these thousands of believers to bring the church back into Judaism. The Lord had annulled Judaism, the religion that crucified Jesus. If Peter was there in Acts 21, it seems that he forgot what he had spoken on the day of Pentecost, when he was strong to tell the Jews, &ldquo;This man, delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to a cross and killed&rdquo; (2:23). Peter was the first to be clear that Judaism was against God, God&rsquo;s economy, Christ, and the church, and he was the first one to suffer for the church at the hands of the Jews (4:1-3). However, Peter might have been among those who tried to convince Paul to return to the Judaistic practices (21:22-24).</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING DECEIVED BY<br />
THE SPIRITUALITY WITHIN RELIGION</h2>
<p>We should not suppose that we are clear concerning religion. Regardless of how clear we may be, there is still the possibility that one day we can be deceived. In 1935 in my hometown of Chefoo, there were a number of missionaries from the China Inland Mission. When Brother Watchman Nee came to Chefoo, he held a prevailing conference, and a British missionary received much help from his speaking. When Brother Nee left, he committed this sister to my care, and I had thorough fellowship with her concerning the Lord&rsquo;s way in His recovery today. This impressed her very much. Because of this, when she left China and returned to England, she began to meet in the fellowship at Honor Oak and became a leading co-worker of T. Austin-Sparks. Twenty-three years later, in 1958, the Lord led me to England, where I was the invited guest of Brother Austin-Sparks. When I inquired concerning the sister, I was told that she had gone back to the Church of England, probably because she had learned that a number of people there were seeking after spiritual things. Although I was able to fellowship with her at that time, each of us knew where the other stood, and I was very sorrowful for her. I mention this to illustrate that regardless of how clear we think we are, certain circumstances and environments may one day cause us to be deceived.</p>
<p>We must be on the alert not to be deceived simply because certain ones are seeking after spiritual things. A good example of this is the charismatic movement. As a rule, the Catholic Church should not have received this kind of movement, but being subtle, it fully accepted it and then mixed it with the worship of Mary. As a result, many who are in the charismatic movement also worship Mary. By this we can see the deception of religion. Some may ask, &ldquo;Are not many in the denominations real Christians?&rdquo; We may ask in return, &ldquo;Are not those in the charismatic movement within the Catholic Church seekers of spirituality?&rdquo; They are real seekers, but at the same time they worship Mary. The worship of Mary is a great insult to God, yet the Catholic charismatics still worship her. What a deception this is! Therefore, we cannot say that as long as people worship God, hold to the Bible, seek after spiritual things, and love the Lord, what they do is right. If we say this, we are blinded under a thick veil, and we have already been cheated.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RELIGIOUS WORLD SENTENCING<br />
THE LORD JESUS TO DEATH<br />
AND PERSECUTING THE DISCIPLES</h2>
<p>Again, it was not mainly the heathen, secular world that sentenced the Lord Jesus to death. It was the members of the Sanhedrin, the &ldquo;supreme court&rdquo; of the Jewish people, which judged things according to the Bible. The Sanhedrin was composed of the chief priests, the elders, the lawyers, and the scribes, all of whom were God-fearing people, but they sentenced Jesus to death according to the law given to them by God. What a cheating and a deceiving this was! In John 16:2 the Lord told the disciples, &ldquo;An hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God.&rdquo; This has actually happened. Saul of Tarsus, before he became Paul the apostle, offered service to God by persecuting the disciples. When Stephen was martyred by being stoned, the witnesses laid down their garments at Saul&rsquo;s feet, and Paul himself told us that he persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it (Acts 7:58; 8:3; 9:1; Gal. 1:13, 23). He was a typical, genuine, religious person with the best religious qualifications. He said concerning himself, &ldquo;As to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless&rdquo; (Phil. 3:5-6). However, whatever he did was against Christ and damaged the church.</p>
<p>Therefore, while Saul was on the way to Damascus with authority from the high priest to arrest the believers, the Lord Jesus came to him (Acts 9:2-3). Paul might have been unique in history as one who did not hear the gospel from a man. The Lord Jesus came to preach the gospel to him directly, saying, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; (v. 4). Although he did not know the Lord, Saul cried, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; (v. 5). If anyone calls Jesus the Lord, he will be saved (Rom. 10:13). When Saul called Him &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; the Lord said, &ldquo;I am Jesus&rdquo; (Acts 9:5). It was there that Paul had a radical change. He had thought that he was full of sight, but after he was saved, he became blind (vv. 8-9). Today many religionists think that they are full of sight and light. They do not know that they are fully blind and under a covering veil.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DISCERNING ALL THINGS<br />
ACCORDING TO CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We must not be cheated or deceived. We should not discern the situation of the denominations according to the fact that genuine Christians are there who are zealous for the gospel and who love the Lord. Rather, we need to discern according to Christ and the church. I like to see the young people being released and excited, but whether or not they are religious must be checked not by their excitement but by Christ and the church. How much do they live by Christ? I am not legal to say that we should not use guitars and tambourines in the meetings, but to use these things does not prove that we are not religious. I am afraid that our excitement, guitars, and tambourines may even prove that we are religious. Whether or not a person is religious depends on how much he knows Christ, lives by Christ, knows the church, and lives with Christ in the church and for the church.</p>
<p>In 1963 in Los Angeles the leading ones of four different groups proposed that they come together to practice the church life. A number were excited by this. I was the only one to &ldquo;pour cold water&rdquo; on the situation, asking them if they were all willing to drop their religion. One group among the four practiced speaking in tongues, and the other three had a Brethren background. I told them, &ldquo;You brothers need to drop your insistence on tongue-speaking and on biblical doctrines. We are all here only for Christ and the church.&rdquo; I showed them in Romans 14 how liberal, generous, and general the apostle Paul is. Paul says, &ldquo;He who eats, let him not despise him who does not eat; and he who does not eat, let him not judge him who eats, for God has received him...One judges one day above another; another judges every day alike. Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind&rdquo; (vv. 3, 5). Paul certainly knew the correct doctrines and Christian practices, but he did not tell people which were right and which were wrong. He did not care for that. He told them simply to receive one another and be like-minded, not according to doctrines and practices but according to Christ. All those who heard my word agreed to drop their religion, and they came together to meet beginning from the first Lord&rsquo;s Day in March of that year. That was wonderful. After one week, however, I received a phone call telling me that the tongue-speaking religion and the doctrinal religion had collided. Those who spoke in tongues said that the leading brother did not know the Spirit, and the others said that he did not properly care for the doctrines.</p>
<p>These things have happened not only in the present time. They were already happening at the time of the apostle Paul. What bothered the churches in the early days, while the apostles still were on the earth, was religion. Paul says, &ldquo;Beware of the dogs&rdquo; (Phil. 3:2). According to the context, the dogs are the religionists. In verse 8 Paul says that he counted all his religious gains as refuse. In Greek, the word for <em>refuse</em> refers to dregs, rubbish, and filth that are thrown to the dogs. Because I speak these things, I do not have a good name among the religionists. Like Paul, I am sounding the trumpet, telling people that the religionists are &ldquo;dogs&rdquo; and that all the religious things&mdash;including circumcision, the Sabbath, and anything that seems to be for God but is apart from Christ&mdash;are &ldquo;dog food.&rdquo; Even the doctrinal knowledge of the Bible apart from Christ is &ldquo;dog food.&rdquo; When Paul was Saul of Tarsus and persecuted the church, he was a strong, religious &ldquo;barking dog&rdquo; eating religious &ldquo;dog food.&rdquo; This is not my own teaching; it is the revelation of Philippians 3. In that chapter Christ is everything. Christ must be our gain, not circumcision, the Sabbath, or anything religious (vv. 7-8). Likewise, in Colossians Christ is the test of whether or not one is religious, and He is also the church, the new man (2:8-9, 16-17; 3:10-11).</p><h2 class="head1">BEING PURELY FOR CHRIST AS LIFE<br />
AND FOR THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Not many among the four Christian groups that we spoke of earlier had seen an adequate vision concerning Christ, nor did they know the church. They were seeking ones, but they were not seeking Christ, and they were not living for the church. Rather, they were seeking their religion. As long as the tongue-speaking group could prophesy by saying, &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord,&rdquo; they were happy. However, this is not the New Testament way to prophesy; it is mainly according to the Old Testament. The book of Acts does not tell us that on the day of Pentecost some stood to say, &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord.&rdquo; This would have brought the church back into the old religion of Judaism. Again I say, most of the believers in those groups had not seen Christ and the church, and they were not for Christ and the church.</p>
<p>Whether or not we are religious depends upon how much we live by Christ. Perhaps the young people would ask, &ldquo;Should we play the guitar and be excited in our meetings, or not?&rdquo; The answer is that we must check with the indwelling Christ. We should ask, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, should I play the guitar?&rdquo; We have no religion and no regulations; we simply have Christ. It is not that when we sit quietly in a pew, we are dead and in religion, but when we shout and are excited, we are living and not in religion. If this were the case, people at a football game would be more &ldquo;living&rdquo; than we are. However, the behavior of the attendants at a football game is not the living of Christ. To be released from religion requires that we be in Christ, with Christ, and for the church. Satan is everywhere. He is not only in the pews; he may also be in our excitement. Today the whole earth is covered by two layers&mdash;the secular world and the religious world. Only Christ and the church can rescue us from these two aspects of the world.</p>
<p>Over fifty years ago I observed the situation in Judaism, the Catholic Church, and Protestant Christianity. Since then, things have changed to some extent. After the re-formation of Israel and the return of Jerusalem to the Jews, more Jews became zealous for their fathers&rsquo; religion. Today even many young people in Jerusalem have become more pious and zealous. Apparently, even the Catholic Church is more &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; than it has been. As I mentioned in a previous chapter, some of us sat before the pope as he gave a sermon, saying that we are all one in the Spirit as members of the mystical Body of Christ. Perhaps no pope before him ever gave so spiritual a message. When I heard that, I said to myself, &ldquo;This man sounds like a brother in the local churches.&rdquo; We also never expected that such a dead, formal, and demonic religion would allow people to practice the charismatic things as they are now doing. All this is a subtle cheating. Moreover, fifty years ago there were not as many spiritual seekers in Protestant Christianity as there are today. Wherever we go today, there are groups of seeking Christians. However, many of these are still under the shadow of religion. The pious, zealous Jews are under Judaism, those in the Catholic Church are under Catholicism, and those in the Protestant churches are under a new kind of religion. The Jews are pious and zealous, many Catholics are seeking spiritual things, and many Protestants also are seeking the things of the Lord, but to our observation, very few care for Christ as life and for the church. If those who speak in tongues were genuinely seeking after Christ, how could they go to worldly entertainments or worship Mary, and if they were real seekers of the church, how could they join the Catholic Church? The fact that they join Catholicism and accept the worship of Mary is proof that they are not purely for Christ and the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOLDING TO DOCTRINAL OPINIONS<br />
CAUSING THE CHURCH TO BE DIVIDED</h2>
<p>Prior to the Reformation, the church under Catholicism became degraded to a great extent. History today refers to that time as the Dark Ages. Because the Bible was locked up and no life or light was released, the entire world was in darkness. At that time God used Martin Luther to begin the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. At first, Luther had no intention to begin a reformation. He was stirred up simply by matters such as indulgences. The pope at that time sent out certain persons to sell certificates of forgiveness. If anyone sinned, he could buy an indulgence issued by the Vatican in order to be forgiven. This offended Luther, and he rose up to proclaim his ninety-five theses. This stirred up opposition against him. Because he did not have the capacity and the way to properly care for the church, he made the mistake of becoming instrumental in the forming of state churches. Before that time the church was called Catholic, which means &ldquo;universal.&rdquo; After that time, however, other nations followed to create state churches, such as the Church of England, of which the Queen is the head and into which every British subject has the right to be baptized. In Germany today people pay a church tax to the government, which uses the money to pay preachers. This is a real degradation.</p>
<p>About two hundred years later, in the early part of the 1700s, the Lord did something further with the Moravian brothers under the leadership of Count von Zinzendorf. This was the first major recovery of the proper practice of the church life. Then one hundred years later, in the 1820s, the Lord recovered a fuller and clearer practice of the church life among the Brethren in England. Eventually, however, religion came in through doctrinal debate. The first division was between John Nelson Darby and Benjamin Newton. Soon afterward there was another dissension of opinions between Darby and George M&#252;ller regarding the matter of receiving the believers at the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. This resulted in a second division. These divisions were caused by holding to doctrinal concepts. Regardless of how good, right, and proper our doctrinal concepts are, to hold to them in a divisive way is religious. When we practice the church life, we must drop all our doctrinal opinions. To hold to doctrinal opinion is religious.</p>
<p>We can testify from our conscience that in the almost fifteen years that we have been practicing the church life in the United States, we have not held to any doctrine in a divisive way. Because certain opposers hold to their doctrines, they have criticized our way of pray-reading the Word. What is wrong with pray-reading the Word and calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo;? It would be better for those persons to oppose the evils of today&rsquo;s Christian religion, such as the observance of Christmas and Easter, the use of rock music in Christian meetings, and the title <em>Reverend,</em> which is an insult to God because He alone is to be revered. Some of our critics claim that calling on the Lord is merely an Oriental practice. I came from China, but I did not come with anything Chinese. Rather, I came with the Holy Bible, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the church. Those who question where calling on the Lord comes from should rather ask where Santa Claus, the Christmas tree, and other such matters come from. People justify the observance of Christmas by the historical fact that millions of Christians have accepted it. However, history means nothing with respect to the truth. It is better to oppose the things of religion, tradition, superstition, and falsehood. The Jews today are more zealous, the Catholic Church is absorbing spiritual practices, and many Protestants are seeking the things of the Lord. However, where is the real experience of Christ, and where is the church?</p><h2 class="head1">THE TESTIMONY OF WATCHMAN NEE&rsquo;S<br />
MINISTRY OF CHRIST AS LIFE<br />
FOR THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The two attempts to practice the church life&mdash;under Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren and under John Darby and the British Brethren&mdash;were good, but eventually they were nullified by religious concepts. One hundred years later, in 1920, the Lord was forced to go to the heathen land of China, which was truly a &ldquo;Galilee of the Gentiles.&rdquo; At that time the ground in Europe and America had been ruined for the Lord&rsquo;s work. This is not my thought alone; it was Brother Watchman Nee&rsquo;s also. Early in the 1930s he and I had a long talk concerning the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. He told me, &ldquo;The Lord was forced to come to China because, as far as the practice of the church life is concerned, it is still virgin soil.&rdquo; As one of the few persons who knew Watchman Nee very closely, I can testify that he was fully burdened for Christ being our life in order to produce the church. He dreamed of churches in all the localities in China. This was his vision, and it was his ministry, which was the most important ministry in this century.</p>
<p>However, there have been several attempts to dilute Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry concerning Christ and the church. First, over fifteen years ago a certain source in England began to spread the rumor that after World War II, Brother Nee changed his concept concerning the ground of the church, but that I, as his co-worker, did not change. Thus, this source says that I am different from Brother Nee. This forced us to publish <em>Further Talks on the Church Life,</em> documenting every message in the book, giving the year, month, day, and location of the message. These messages, all of which Brother Nee gave in 1948 and afterward, are even stronger than his messages in <em>The Normal Christian Church Life</em>. After the publication of <em>Further Talks on the Church Life,</em> the source of the rumor was forced to admit that it was wrong.</p>
<p>Following this, some changed their tone and a biography of Brother Nee was published in which the author claimed that Brother Nee was wrong in the matter of the church. Since they had been forced by <em>Further Talks on the Church Life</em> to admit that Brother Nee did not change in the matter of the church, they utilized Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry on the side of life to build up their religion, at the same time refusing to promote anything that Brother Nee wrote concerning the church. To utilize Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry in this way for their own purposes is subtle, dishonest, and unfaithful.</p>
<p>In addition, certain ones among us who were co-workers of Brother Nee, being afraid of men, have not been bold to speak his true ministry. One told me, &ldquo;We should not offend Christianity, because our work depends upon Christianity.&rdquo; I do not agree with this. Our work does not depend upon anyone. When I came to this country, I received the burden to speak to people concerning the local church, but these weaker ones advised me: &ldquo;We must take care of our situation. Do not speak in this way, because people will not be able to bear it.&rdquo; My answer is, &ldquo;If Martin Luther had cared for the situation and not spoken faithfully, there would have been no recovery of justification by faith.&rdquo; Today Brother Nee&rsquo;s books have begun to fill this country, but what has been the result? Have many begun to know Christ and be for the church? On the contrary, Brother Nee&rsquo;s books have been utilized to build up something in religion.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church and other denominations are now trying to form a kind of spiritual oneness. This is altogether a counterfeit. According to prophecy, Catholicism and the denominations will continue until Antichrist is used by the Lord to terminate Judaism, burn Catholicism, and destroy all religions (Rev. 17:16-17; Dan. 9:27; 11:36-37). Under the present situation, then, what is the Lord doing? Some spiritual seekers may say, &ldquo;The Lord is bringing all the spiritual things together, including Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry, the charismatic things, speaking in tongues, the manifestation of gifts, and the Catholic Church.&rdquo; We must not believe this. The Lord never does anything in the way of mixture. His way is always pure, in which all things are &ldquo;according to their kind&rdquo; (Gen. 1:11-12, 21, 24-25). Spiritual things are not according to the &ldquo;kind&rdquo; of the Catholic Church, nor are they according to the kind of the denominations and free groups. To mix these things is against the spiritual principle (Deut. 22:9-11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL AGES COORDINATING TOGETHER<br />
TO GAIN THE VICTORY IN THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENT MOVE</h2>
<p>What the Lord is doing today is to go to &ldquo;Galilee&rdquo; to catch the young Galileans to have a new, pure, and clean start. These young ones should not merely be excited; this is not sufficient. They must exercise their spirit to know Christ, live by Christ, and gain Christ day by day. Then with, in, and by Christ they will have the proper church life without any religious concepts. The young people must first be caught by the Lord. Then they need to be trained and sent to other young ones. On the practical side, we must know that the church includes all ages. According to the record of the Gospels, it seems that the Lord did not call the older ones to follow Him directly, but neither did He reject them. Not all the one hundred twenty in Acts 1 were young people. At least some must have been older women (v. 14; cf. Luke 8:2-3; 24:10). Therefore, the young people must never say that the Lord will use only them; this is absolutely not correct.</p>
<p>In actuality, all the saints should be encouraged to bear the burden for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. Whether we are young, middle-aged, or elderly, as long as we have a heart and a clear spirit for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we will all be fully useful to the Lord. However, we are in a battle today, and we need a strategy for fighting. The present need is to send the young people to the front, that is, to the campuses, to fight the battle with a strong burden. The older ones can support them, help them, care for them, and pray for them. In this way we will all coordinate together to win the war.</p>
<p>We must not compromise with religion. If we compromise, we will give up the Lord, and we will cause the Lord to give us up. The Lord has no way in any kind of religion. He must have a new start with the young people, and the older ones must stand with the young ones, bearing the burden to support them, pray for them, care for them, cover them, and do everything they can for them, so that the young ones can fight the battle on the front lines to gain the victory. This is the right way for us to take.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE EVIL SITUATION OF RELIGION<br />
AND THE NEED FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 11:18-19; 12:24; John 8:48; Matt. 5:11; Acts 24:1-6; Dan. 9:27; 8:9-11; 11:36-37; 2 Thes. 2:3-4; Rev. 17:16-17; 19:7-8</h1>
<h2 class="head1">RELIGION DEFAMING THE LORD<br />
AND THOSE SENT BY HIM</h2>
<p>As we have seen, the present evil age that Paul speaks of in Galatians 1:4 refers to Judaism. John the Baptist was born not only into Judaism but even into the priesthood of that religion (Luke 1:5, 13). However, he did not live like a priest. He ministered in the wilderness, eating locusts and wild honey and wearing a garment of camel&rsquo;s hair, the camel being considered unclean according to the Levitical regulations (Matt. 3:1-4; Lev. 11:4). Nevertheless, he was the forerunner of Christ, testifying of Christ and recommending Christ to the people. Because he did not eat and drink in the expected way, people said that he had a demon (Matt. 11:18). The religious people spoke in this way because John&rsquo;s way was different from their religion. The Lord Jesus also did not come in a legal way. Although He was recommended by John the Baptist, He did not follow John in His way of living. John came neither eating nor drinking, but the Lord Jesus both ate and drank. Because of this, the religious people said, &ldquo;Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners&rdquo; (v. 19).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus cast a demon out of a blind and dumb man, the Pharisees, the highest ranking persons in that evil religion, said, &ldquo;This man does not cast out the demons except by Beelzebul, ruler of the demons&rdquo; (12:24; John 8:48). The name Beelzebul was a most evil and ugly name. Beelzebub, meaning &ldquo;the lord of flies,&rdquo; was changed by the Jews to Beelzebul, meaning &ldquo;the lord of the dunghill,&rdquo; and was used for the ruler of the demons. The real intention of the Pharisees&rsquo; word was to say that the Lord Jesus was one with the ruler of the demons and the lord of the flies of the dung hill. Jesus was God manifested in the flesh (John 1:14; 1 Tim. 3:16). To say that a person is possessed by a demon is a small thing, but to say that God manifested in the flesh has a demon, even the ruler of the demons, was a very serious matter. Although the genuine, typical religion of that day taught people to worship God, serve Him, seek His interests, and hold to His holy Word, it defamed the Lord Jesus to such a great extent. By this we can see how evil religion is.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples, He told them, &ldquo;It is sufficient for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of His household!&rdquo; (Matt. 10:25). The Lord said that the religious people would not only reject the ones sent by Him, but they would also say that they were demon possessed. This is because no prejudice is as serious as religious prejudice. The religious Jews said such a thing to the disciples because the ones sent by the Lord Jesus behaved, acted, and worked in a way that was not according to the Jews&rsquo; religion, tradition, superstition, and falsehood. Rather, it was according to the truth with which the Lord Jesus had commissioned them.</p>
<p>Today we also have been defamed very much. Some have called us a cult, and they compare our calling on the name of the Lord Jesus to chanting to a Hindu deity. They particularly oppose the scriptural teaching that God is mingled with man to be expressed corporately in the church, calling this a kind of idolatry. Those who oppose us in this way suppose that they are contending for the truth. However, this is to act in the same principle as the Pharisees, who with the rest of the Sanhedrin sentenced the Lord Jesus to death, thinking that this was according to the Scriptures. We do believe that the genuine, proper church has the divine life and partakes of the divine nature, making it the expression of Christ (John 3:15-16, 36; 2 Pet. 1:4; Eph. 3:10, 21), but to interpret our writings as claiming that the church is a part of the Godhead is shortsighted and even blind. Such opposers are short of knowledge, which is a dangerous thing. We are in a battle today, just as the Lord Jesus was at His time.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me&rdquo; (Matt. 5:11). Because Jesus predicted that the religious people would speak against the disciples in this way, to be fully welcomed by today&rsquo;s Christianity may prove that we are wrong. If we are right with the Lord, we must be prepared to be spoken of in an evil way and be given a bad name. Paul says that he ministered through &ldquo;evil report and good report&rdquo; (2 Cor. 6:8). The evil reports concerning the apostle Paul came not mainly from the Gentiles but from the Jews, from the source of religion. This is why Paul called that religion the &ldquo;present evil age.&rdquo; In Acts 24 the leading person of that religion, the high priest, came with the elders and an orator to accuse Paul before the governor. The orator said, &ldquo;We have found this man a pest&rdquo; (vv. 1-6). Religion considered Paul to be &ldquo;pestilent,&rdquo; and they tried to kill his &ldquo;germs&rdquo; of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RELIGION CONTINUING<br />
IN MIXTURE AND CONFUSION UNTIL<br />
THE END OF THE AGE</h2>
<p>Recently, while we were at a sacred site in Rome, one brother among us began to call on the Lord. An attendant stopped him, saying that he was desecrating that holy place. This illustrates that there is no compromise between the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and today&rsquo;s evil religion. We cannot go along with religion. Some who hear this may be stirred up to go purposely to religious places and interfere with what people are doing there. I would urge you not to do this, because it is neither legal nor proper. We are outside of religion, but we are not wild.</p>
<p>We must not expect that religion will improve. When I was young, I was very bothered, and I asked the Lord why He tolerated evil things and how long He would continue to tolerate them. At that time I did not know the Word very well. Gradually, though, I came to learn that according to the prophecy of the Bible, the Lord in His wisdom will allow religion to continue. As we have seen, fifty years ago the situation of the world and religion was not like it is today. Today the nation of Israel has been re-formed, and Jerusalem has been returned to the Jews. This is a great matter. As we have pointed out, many Jews have now become more zealous and pious. The Catholic Church also has assimilated certain spiritual things. In addition, there are also many in Protestant Christianity who are seeking spiritual things. Some even utilize Brother Nee&rsquo;s writings related to the matter of life but not those related to the matter of the church. Others, especially in the United States, have used Brother Nee&rsquo;s books and mine, claiming to practice the local church life as we do but not fellowshipping with the other churches. This is a mixture with religion.</p>
<p>All kinds of religion will continue to grow, and there is already the tendency for Christians to seek spirituality under the umbrella of various religions. This is absolutely against God&rsquo;s economy. The Lord said clearly, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). To seek spirituality in the different religions apart from the church is a compromise and a mixture. Mixture, confusion, and division are all in the principle of Babylon. The entire situation of religion today is Babylonian, because it is filled with divisions, confusion, counterfeits, and mixtures. The Lord desires to have a pure church as a chaste bride for Himself (2 Cor. 11:2). We must be clear concerning this and not be deceived. Because we testify concerning the evils of religion, we are defamed. Therefore, we must be prepared to suffer. The whole earth is filled with religion, which tolerates falsehood.</p>
<p>On the other hand, certain Christian organizations in the United States use the spiritual terminology in my books for their own purposes, without citing my writings as the source. Deep in their spirit and even in their minds many seekers are clear about this ministry, yet some still utilize this ministry while opposing us. The ministry in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States began in 1962. At that time I told the brothers that after a few years all the terms we use will be used by others who are not among us. In 1962 almost no one in America spoke concerning the human spirit, transformation, or the local church. Today people have adopted all these terms, but they have turned their back on us. This is not being honest or faithful. This demonstrates the evilness, dishonesty, and lack of conscience in religion.</p><h2 class="head1">JUDAISM, CATHOLICISM, AND<br />
ALL RELIGIONS BEING TERMINATED<br />
AT THE END OF THIS AGE</h2>
<p>This trend will continue and will not abate. However, at the end of this age the Lord will sovereignly use Antichrist, the evil incarnation of Satan, to terminate all religions. At the beginning of the last seven years of this age, Antichrist will make a firm covenant of peace with the Jews, but in the middle of the seven years he will break the covenant, persecute the Jews, and terminate all the Jewish religious practices. He will cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease, and he will set up his image in the temple, sitting in the temple of God to say that he is God (Dan. 9:27; 8:9-11; 12:11; Matt. 24:15; Rev. 13:14-15; 2 Thes. 2:3-4). This will be the termination of Judaism. At the same time Antichrist and the ten kings under him will hate Babylon the Great, that is, the Roman Catholic Church. Because the Catholic Church has exercised its power over the nations, the ten kings will be disgusted with her, turn their back on her, and agree with Antichrist to burn her with fire and destroy her to the uttermost. In this way they will accomplish God&rsquo;s will, which He has put into their hearts (Rev. 17:12-13, 16-18). Moreover, Antichrist will terminate all religion in his kingdom around the Mediterranean Sea in those three and a half years (Dan. 11:36-37). After sovereignly using Antichrist to do this work, the Lord Jesus will come to destroy him (2 Thes. 2:8; Rev. 19:11-21).</p>
<p>After Revelation 17 and 18 there is chapter 19, in which the wife has made herself ready (vv. 7-8). We desire to be in the bride, not in religion. Therefore, we must be careful not to bring any kind of religious concept into the church. We need to read Revelation 17, 18, and 19 as one section. Chapter 17 speaks of the fall of religious Babylon, and chapter 18, of the fall of material Babylon. After the fall of these two Babylons, there will be loud praises in heaven (19:1-4), and amidst the praises will be the prepared bride. This means that the judgments on religious Babylon and material Babylon will bring in the bride. All religions will be terminated, and the one bride will remain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY<br />
WITH HIS LIVING WORD IN THE END TIME</h2>
<p>The Lord must fulfill His prophecy and promise in Matthew 16:18: &ldquo;I will build My church.&rdquo; There is no way for the Lord to do this in religion. In religion people can be saved, love the Lord, and seek Him, but the Lord cannot truly build His church there. This is why we believe that at the end time there is the need for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The Lord must recover the church life. In His recovery the Lord will have the way to build His church. We are seeing the Lord&rsquo;s work of building today. I am happy to see the young people drink Christ, pray in their spirit, be one, and follow the Body. This produces the building.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there is much opportunity for the Lord to build His church. Moreover, the Lord is releasing His word in His recovery. Throughout history the Lord&rsquo;s word has never been released as clearly and richly as it is today, and all the messages that are being released match the current situation. As we have pointed out, people use our messages in spite of the fact that they oppose us. This proves that whether or not they take this way, some of them, at least certain leading ones, are reading the messages. By this they can know the Lord&rsquo;s speaking concerning the bride, the firstfruits, the different kinds of overcomers, the tribulation, and the way Antichrist will terminate all religion. The Lord is building the church, the messages are going out, and people are reading them, whether or not they will turn to take this way.</p>
<p>The Lord has made the prophecy very clear to us. Antichrist will sign a contract with the Jews for seven years, but in the middle of the seven years, he will turn his back on them. Then he will terminate Judaism, burn Catholicism, and persecute every kind of religion. Before this time, however, near the middle of the seven years, the overcomers in the churches throughout the earth will be raptured, and people will realize what has happened. What will someone who is still in the denominations but has read our messages think at that time? Many who are not among us, and some who are, will be left on the earth. Those who are left will say, &ldquo;O Lord, forgive me! I am late.&rdquo; At that time there may be a worldwide revival. Those from the local churches will take the lead, and many others will come this way. During the tribulation those who are in the local churches will help all the Christians to be the late overcomers.</p>
<p>I would encourage you to bring this to the Lord and pray about it. Do you want to be among the firstfruits (Rev. 14:1-5), or do you want to be left on the earth at that time? We are happy that the Lord has His recovery, that the living word is being released, and that many others are reading the messages in order to be prepared for the coming time, which may not be long from now.</p>
<p>What the Lord is doing today is meaningful and up to date. Fifty years ago I did not have this view of the world situation, but since then I have been studying the prophecies in the Bible and watching the world situation. Now I am in the United States ministering the Lord&rsquo;s living word to the living churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This is not a small matter. Some may warn me to be careful and not to stir up opposition. However, because we have been willing to &ldquo;stir the water&rdquo; of religion, the Lord has His recovery, He is releasing His word, many others are reading our messages, and the firstfruits are being ripened. When the ripened firstfruits are raptured and Antichrist begins his persecution, there will be a great revival on the earth to produce many late overcomers. I do believe that this will happen. We need to sound the trumpet to wake the sleeping believers. Hallelujah for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and for His living word!</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING<br />
GOING TO THE CAMPUSES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Gathering with Other Churches<br />
to Pray and Fellowship</h2>
<p>In the church life the young saints need to be trained to be one and to follow the church. Then they need to pray and fellowship with the churches in order to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading concerning which university campuses they should go to. The older ones should not do the campus work for them; the young ones must rise up to do it. However, they must not do anything in a loose, light, or confused way. We may need thirty to fifty to care for a large campus. After the young ones pray and fellowship, and the Lord shows them where to go, they should go out.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Contacting the First- and Second-year Students</h2>
<p>According to our experience, the best way is to go to the first- and second-year students. After their second year, it is more difficult to contact these students, because many have settled into their interests and do not change easily. When they first enter college from high school, they are not settled, and they do not know the direction they will pursue. This is the time when it is easiest to contact them. The young ones must do everything that they can each semester to catch the freshmen, learning the proper way and spending everything that they have for them. The older saints can help the young ones if they make themselves young, tender, and approachable to the freshmen.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Need for Married Couples with Homes</h2>
<p>For the work on the universities, we also need married couples with homes. Out of the number that go to work on a campus, there should be some who have homes. The younger saints can take the lead to contact people, and the couples can open their homes to keep the ones who are contacted. We need both functions. In this way, all the saints will be useful.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">ENJOYING CHRIST IN THE MINGLED SPIRIT<br />
AND GOING OUT<br />
FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S INTERESTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22; Gal. 5:16, 25; 6:18</h1>
<p>The revelation of the Bible is that Christ came in the flesh to be the Lamb of God (John 1:29) that He might die on the cross in order to accomplish redemption, deal with all negative things&mdash;including sin, Satan, the flesh, and the world&mdash;solve all problems, and release the divine life from within Him. Following this, He rested for three days, and then He resurrected from the dead. In resurrection Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). We must all be deeply impressed with the two steps that Christ took. First, as God He became flesh to accomplish redemption and release His life, and then as the last Adam He became the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into us as life. Now sin is gone, and life, which is Christ Himself (John 11:25; 14:6), is here. Because God has forgiven us of our sins and Christ has imparted Himself into us as life, we have all become living members of Christ&rsquo;s Body, His living organism for His expression. Whenever and wherever we come together, we are the church, the Body of Christ as His expression.</p>
<p>Now Christ is no longer only objective to us but very subjective. Therefore, we all need to live by this living, subjective One and walk in our spirit, which is regenerated and indwelt by the Spirit of God. This spirit is the mingled spirit, the human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit (John 3:6; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22). We, the redeemed ones, do have a wonderful mingled spirit as the treasure in our being (2 Cor. 4:7). This mingled spirit is the source of every spiritual reality and spiritual attribute. Regardless of how young a person is, as long as he believes in the Lord Jesus, is washed by His redeeming blood, forgiven of all his sins, and regenerated in his spirit, he has this wonderful treasure within him. Regrettably, however, very few Christians are clear that as redeemed sinners and living members of Christ they have a wonderful spirit that is mingled with the divine Spirit. Some Christian teachers even oppose this truth. When we speak of our spirit mingled with the divine Spirit, some say that we are teaching &ldquo;evolution into God.&rdquo; This shortsightedness is an insult and even a blasphemy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR HUMAN SPIRIT BEING<br />
BORN OF THE DIVINE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>That we have a mingled spirit is according to the revelation of the Bible. Some say, &ldquo;God is high, great, holy, and divine, but we are low, small, mean, and sinful. How can we sinful persons be mingled with God?&rdquo; This argument neglects the spiritual facts. The first fact is in John 3:6, which says, &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; This verse makes it clear that it is our spirit, not our mind or even our heart, that has been born of the divine Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING JOINED TO THE LORD AS ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The second fact, which is even stronger, is in 1 Corinthians 6:17, which says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; <em>One spirit</em> indicates a mingling. We are one spirit with the Lord because we have been joined to Him organically in our spirit. Our critics are shortsighted, even blinded, by their traditional concepts. They know that God is high and that we are low, but they do not see 1 Corinthians 6:17. The revelation of the mingled spirit is wonderful and great. Without being mingled, how can the human spirit and the divine Spirit become one? Many in Christianity say that the church is merely united with Christ. This is not wrong, since the Bible tells us that Christ is the Husband and the church is the wife (Eph. 5:25). However, while saying that our union with Christ is scriptural, some say that to be mingled with the Lord as one spirit is a heresy. These critics have been blinded by religion. They hold to Ephesians 5:25, but they do not see 1 Corinthians 6:17.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING IN US AND WE IN HIM</h2>
<p>The third spiritual fact is that the New Testament repeatedly says that we are in Christ and that He is in us (1 Cor. 1:30; 2 Cor. 5:17; John 14:20; 15:4-5; 17:23, 26; Rom. 8:10; Gal. 2:20). If we were only in Christ but He were not in us, or vice versa, there would simply be an indwelling, not a mingling. However, the Bible says again and again that we are in Him and that He is also in us. This is not a mere indwelling; it is a mingling. We may illustrate this mingling by considering a glass of tea. Not only is the tea in the water, but the water is also in the tea. This is a mingling of the tea with the water. We all need to see the mingling of God and man. Some critics say that if we as human beings are mingled with God, God and we will both lose our natures. This thought is short even of scientific knowledge. When tea is mingled with water, both the nature of the tea and the nature of the water remain unchanged. It is not that the water is no longer water and that the tea is no longer tea. Although the two are mingled as one, they both retain their distinctive natures. <em>Webster&rsquo;s Third New International Dictionary</em> defines <em>mingle</em> as &ldquo;to bring or combine together or with something else so that the components remain distinguishable in the combination.&rdquo; A clear Old Testament type of mingling is seen in the meal offering, which is composed of fine flour, signifying Christ&rsquo;s humanity, mingled with oil, signifying the Holy Spirit as Christ&rsquo;s divinity (Lev. 2:4). In such a mingling the distinction between the two elements of fine flour and oil is preserved, and no third element is produced. The same is true regarding the mingling of divinity and humanity in the incarnated Christ and in His believers. Although the proper denotation of <em>mingling</em> is readily understood, most Christians still neglect the truth concerning mingling, and some condemn it as heretical. This is because they are veiled and blinded by their traditional, religious doctrine. We are not arguing here for doctrine; we are contending for the truth.</p><h2 class="head1">LIVING AND WALKING BY THE MINGLED SPIRIT<br />
TO RECEIVE THE GRACE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Today we are no longer like the children of Israel in the Old Testament, who had God only among them, not mingled with them. Because the God who was among them could not enter into them, He gave them five long books written by Moses full of regulations, rituals, forms, and instructions. Today, however, the age has changed. God came in the flesh to accomplish redemption, the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, and this Spirit, who is the realization of the Triune God, has come into us to regenerate us and mingle Himself with our spirit to make us one with Him. This is wonderful and marvelous! Today the very Triune God is within us and one with us. Because of this, we do not need books full of regulations, rituals, forms, and instructions. The New Testament has no such books. Rather, the apostle Paul charges us to live and walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25) and to walk according to the mingled spirit (Rom. 8:4). This all-inclusive charge is sufficient.</p>
<p>We all need to realize that the Triune God has been wrought into our being, and we have been joined to Him as one spirit. Perhaps some of the young people may say that they have no feeling of being one with the Lord. In actuality, they have much feeling day by day. The unbelieving young people do not have this reality within them, but the believing young people have something wonderful within them, which is the mingled spirit. We all have such a wonderful spirit within us. Many in Christianity have never been instructed to know that within them is a wonderful spirit. This is the reason that Christianity has so many doctrinal teachings. This was not Paul&rsquo;s way. In 2 Timothy, for example, Paul did not write a long doctrinal letter. At the end of only four chapters he simply said, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you&rdquo; (4:22). Grace is Christ Himself for our enjoyment, and this Christ today is in our spirit.</p>
<p>Similarly, Paul said at the end of Galatians, &ldquo;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers&rdquo; (6:18). In order to practice the church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we do not need mere outward instructions. What we need is to walk according to the mingled spirit and enjoy Christ as grace in our spirit. To enjoy Christ as grace, we simply need to take a drink of Christ. In our daily living drinking is very crucial. Every morning after I rise up, the first thing that I do is take a glass of water. Then at breakfast I drink something more, and throughout the day I drink even more. This is the reason I am so energetic. We need to drink Christ, who is the fountain in our spirit. The waters that Elisha healed in Jericho are a picture of the Christ whom we drink. Jericho is situated in a low valley, a desert that is full of dust and heat. Within that valley, however, is a strip of green land that is watered by the spring that Elisha healed (2 Kings 2:19-22). Originally we all were a &ldquo;Jericho,&rdquo; cursed and condemned (Josh. 6:26), but our Elisha, Jesus Christ, has healed the waters within us. Today we all have a healed fountain of living water within us that springs up into eternal life (John 4:14). If we drink of this fountain day by day, the church will be watered and flourishing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING<br />
THE GOING OUT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE</h2>
<p>The local churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery may be composed in several ways. A certain church may be composed of all ages, of which the church in Anaheim is a good model. The church in another locality may also be composed of saints of different ages, but that locality may have many good colleges and universities with a large number of students, for whom the young people will be burdened. In this case, a group of young saints can go there but not to set up another church. To do this would be to create a division, because there is already a church in that locality. A third local church may be composed of saints of all ages, but in it there may be a few young people who are studying at some smaller colleges and universities. Thus, this church will be composed of all ages and also have some young college and university students.</p>
<p>Regardless of the composition of the churches, we must realize that we are not in an age of doctrine; we are in the age of the mingled spirit. Therefore, the young saints should not engage in any doctrinal debates. Whereas the older ones often have religious concepts, young people tend to have many natural concepts. In the church, however, we must all drop our concepts. We need to return to our spirit and remain in our spirit continually. We do not care for doctrinal debates; we care only for the mingled spirit. What we have fellowshipped here is according to the Lord&rsquo;s economy today, and He will work it out. The Lord will use the young saints to capture many of their peers in the United States, and then He will train them and send them to other countries. In this way the Lord will spread His recovery and produce many firstfruits for the rapture (Rev. 14:1-5).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">ALL AGES BEING USEFUL<br />
FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE</h1>
<p>As we have been speaking about the young people being useful in the hands of the Lord, the older brothers and sisters may have been bothered concerning their own usefulness. Because of this we need further fellowship concerning the function of the middle-aged and older saints. (For a fuller treatment of this subject, please see <em>All Ages for the Lord&rsquo;s Testimony,</em> published by Living Stream Ministry.)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THOSE OVER THIRTY YEARS OLD<br />
BEING THE MOST USEFUL<br />
IN CARING FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S TESTIMONY</h2>
<p>In general, there are more middle-aged brothers and sisters in the recovery than young people. Therefore, the middle-aged saints have more to do in the church than the young ones. The young people need to go to the campuses, but the middle-aged saints do not need to go anywhere. They are already in the &ldquo;fishing pond,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;fish&rdquo; are all around them. The young people are full of energy and should &ldquo;sell all&rdquo; to go to the campuses, but the middle-aged saints do not need to go out. There is no need for them to go to the &ldquo;seashore,&rdquo; because the fish are in their own backyard. The middle-aged saints are more useful than the young saints in caring for the church as the Lord&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<p>In any nation the young people under thirty years old are good to be sent to the front lines to fight, but in general the middle-aged ones are not good for this purpose. Rather, the middle-aged persons are useful in carrying out the governmental affairs at the various levels of country, state, and city. A country cannot survive if it has only young people to send out to fight but no one to carry out its affairs. In this sense, the persons of middle age are more important. However, because I have been emphasizing the young people in the Lord&rsquo;s present move in His recovery, many middle-aged saints may have become disappointed, puzzled, and frustrated, supposing that they are useless. This is absolutely not the case. The family, the nation, and all society depend mainly on the middle-aged persons. Likewise, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery needs the young ones to go out to fight the battle, but the recovery stands and runs the race mainly through the middle-aged ones. Nevertheless, after the young people hear this, they should not feel less important and decide not to go out for the Lord&rsquo;s interests.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT KEEPING AFFAIRS IN OUR OWN HANDS<br />
BUT HELPING EVERY AGE TO BE USEFUL</h2>
<p>Humanly, older persons like to keep things in their own hands. The older some are, the more insight and experience they gain, and as a result, they do not trust the younger generation. This problem came to light in our recent migrations. Before the summer of 1970 there were very few local churches in the United States, but all the migrations that began at that time were successful. There was a kind of explosion, and within three years there were over forty-five churches. Beginning from 1974, however, the spread of the churches reached a blockade. This was due to the middle-aged brothers keeping everything in their hands, causing the younger generation to be unemployed. This is why the Lord has now given us the burden to perfect the young people and encourage them to function.</p>
<p>From now on none of us should keep things in our own hands, trusting no one else. Since 1962 I was burdened by the Lord to begin the recovery in the United States. According to the common way of preachers and missionaries, we could have taken several ways to carry this out. First, we could have raised up a single church in Los Angeles, remained there for many years, and increased our number to become very large. Certainly, every one would have considered this to be a success. Second, we could have remained in Los Angeles for only a few years and then gone to other major cities successively, remaining in each one for a few years to establish the church there. This way is better than the first, since the total number of those meeting would be greater, and there would be several churches instead of one. The third way, however, is the way of migration, which is the way we have taken. This has spread the churches over the whole country, and several thousand brothers and sisters are now meeting together. Most of the spreading was accomplished through the migrations from 1970 to 1973. After that time, however, the spreading stopped because certain middle-aged brothers kept everything in their hands.</p>
<p>To be in the Lord&rsquo;s work is not easy. We must do things diligently day and night, yet we must also not exercise control over the things that are in our hands. This gives others the opportunity to do the things and to learn. We may compare this to a driving instructor. He must be alert so that when danger comes, he can apply his hand to help the situation; however, after that he should let go again to let the car be in the hands of the learner. Then instead of having one chauffeur, there will be hundreds of drivers. Some have criticized me by saying that I control the churches. I certainly do not have the ability to do that. How can one person with two hands &ldquo;drive a thousand cars?&rdquo; At most, I am only a &ldquo;driving instructor.&rdquo; All the dear saints who have been with us for many years can testify from their conscience that I keep nothing in my hands. Not even the church in my own locality is in my hands, and many churches have not received a direct speaking from me for many years. I say this to illustrate that we should keep nothing under our control. Every age is useful for carrying out the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p><h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL FELLOWSHIP<br />
REGARDING THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENT MOVE<br />
AMONG THE YOUNG PEOPLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Move to the Campuses<br />
Being a Matter of Spiritual Warfare</h2>
<p>We believe that the vision we have received concerning the young people going to the college campuses is truly from the Lord, and that the Lord has already begun a good work among many of the young people. However, we must fellowship concerning a number of crucial points related to the Lord&rsquo;s present move in His recovery. First, we must realize that we are in a spiritual warfare. This is not a small matter. The Lord&rsquo;s move to the campuses touches the enemy&rsquo;s heart. Therefore, we must all be on the alert. The young people are not going out in a light way; they are going to the frontier, where they will confront the enemy. We must beware, lest the enemy take advantage of us through deceit. Every deception has something of truth in it. If a counterfeit dollar does not look like a genuine one, no one will be deceived by it. Even Babylon the Great is gilded with gold, precious stones, and pearls, which are the components of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 17:4). No one will receive leaven, signifying evil things (1 Cor. 5:6, 8) and evil doctrines (Matt. 16:6, 11-12), unless it has been hidden in &ldquo;three measures of meal&rdquo; (13:33). Therefore, we must be alert to pray fighting prayers with trembling. In the type of the Old Testament, when the Tent of Meeting with the Ark set out, the armies of Israel surrounded it (Num. 2:1-34). This means that Israel moved in the way of fighting the battle. Matthew 13:24-25 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field. But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away.&rdquo; We must not be negligent and &ldquo;sleep,&rdquo; lest the enemy creep in and damage the situation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Walking in the Mingled Spirit<br />
in Everything We Do</h2>
<p>From now on, we should emphasize that we must walk in the mingled spirit in everything we do or speak. To check by asking, &ldquo;Is what I am about to do or speak in the spirit?&rdquo; will render us much protection. We have heard this many times, but when the situations come, we may forget the mingled spirit. If we do not check with the mingled spirit, we will have no &ldquo;brakes&rdquo; to stop ourselves. The mingled spirit is the highest and best restriction. We must walk in the mingled spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living in the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>We must also live in the Body of Christ. The Body is the high tower to safeguard us from every attack of the enemy. Practically, the principle of the Body is oneness (Eph. 4:3-6). Therefore, to damage the oneness is to break the principle of the Body. If we take care of the governing principles of the mingled spirit and the Body, we will be fully safeguarded.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Keeping a Spirit of Harmony<br />
between All the Ages in the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>We need to exercise our discernment to be sober. It is true that we have said that the young people should go out to the campuses, but this should not be interpreted to mean that the young people should neglect the older saints and not fellowship with them. We must keep a good atmosphere with a harmonious spirit between all the ages. The older ones have been and still are for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Therefore, they are worthy of the respect of the young ones. On the other hand, the middle-aged and older saints should not mistrust the young people. Rather, they should allow the young people to learn how to do things. If they do not learn by their first mistake, they may learn by the second one. Of course, we do not like to see mistakes, but we must allow the young people to learn. Two proverbs say, &ldquo;Failure is the mother of success,&rdquo; and &ldquo;mistakes are always a good teacher.&rdquo; A good coach will help his team adjust according to their mistakes as many times as possible until the team can win the game. We must not be disappointed. We should tell Satan, &ldquo;We may make even more mistakes, but we will reach the goal. Satan, one day you will be in the lake of fire, and we will be in the New Jerusalem.&rdquo; The more Satan tries to subdue us, the more we rise up.</p>
<p>The young people must not be proud and should learn to respect the older ones. At the same time, the middle-aged and older saints must trust the young people. The middle-aged saints are the ones most useful in caring for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, but not many of them may able to go to the front to fight the battle. For this we need the young ones. However, we must all keep a sweet, constructive, and pleasant atmosphere as a testimony to the enemy that we are one, leaving no ground to the enemy to come in to do anything. On the one hand, the young people need not depend upon the older ones to do everything, and the older ones should not exercise control over the young ones. On the other hand, the young people are not &ldquo;emancipated&rdquo; from proper coordination with the older ones. Rather, we are the Body of Christ, in which we all have our place and standing. Therefore, it is very crucial to keep a good spirit of harmony among us.</p><h2 class="head2">Praying Adequately and<br />
Not Making Decisions Too Quickly</h2>
<p>We must all learn to pray and not make decisions too quickly concerning our going out for the Lord&rsquo;s present move. If we make a quick decision without prayer, our decision may be without God, the Lord, and the Spirit. It may be merely in our self, like the decisions made by unbelievers. Politicians make decisions by themselves without praying to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading, but we have the Lord. We are not doing our own work; we are doing His will. Therefore, we must do nothing without adequate prayer. When we began the migrations in 1970, we prayed much concerning who should migrate, where they should go, when they should go, and in what way they should go. We should drop any decisions we have already made without adequate prayer and should have a new beginning. If some have already prayed, they should pray again to seek a confirmation. We should never follow merely an outward &ldquo;flow.&rdquo; Rather, we should ask the Lord to give us a clear leading. Any move or work done without adequate prayer is light and not valuable in the eyes of God. It may be counted as a work according to Matthew 7:21-23. Some will say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power?&rdquo; But the Lord will declare, &ldquo;I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness.&rdquo; Our move and what we raise up may not be sinful, but if it is according to our preference, decision, and intention and not according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading, it is considered lawless in His eyes.</p>
<p>We all need to pray. To pray is to deny ourselves. It is to say, &ldquo;Lord, not my will but Your will be done.&rdquo; We should pray much concerning who should go and when, where, and how they should move. Only then can we make a decision. To delay our decision one or two months is not too much. Everyone who will participate in the Lord&rsquo;s move should be clear and not follow merely an outward &ldquo;flow.&rdquo; We must go with a burden and in a proper way, a way that is approved in the eyes of the Lord. This can be carried out only by much prayer. We need to pray for our future, our vision, our burden, our goal, and the proper way to go to the campuses.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Neglecting Our Environment<br />
under the Lord&rsquo;s Sovereignty</h2>
<p>We must also not neglect our environment under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty. If the environment does not permit us to move, we should simply say, &ldquo;Lord, I submit to Your sovereignty&rdquo; and remain where we are. We must believe in the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty and submit to it. The Lord is in every kind of environment. If something is the Lord&rsquo;s will and we desire to go along, He will eventually clear the way for us to go peacefully.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Making Nothing Legal for Others</h2>
<p>We should not make anything legal for others, claiming that whoever does not go out for the Lord&rsquo;s move is not properly in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This will create legalities, which produce problems, performances, falsehoods, disappointments, and weak consciences. Someone may have the heart and intention to move, but his situation may not allow it. Then he may feel that he is not faithful and not for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This will weaken his conscience, create a leak in his conscience, and provide a subtle entrance for the enemy to come in to ensnare him and defeat him. Therefore, we must not make anything legal.</p>
<p>The Lord is sovereign. He may keep some saints in a certain church or a certain meeting hall for their entire life. They may say, &ldquo;Lord, I do not like this, and I cannot take it,&rdquo; but the Lord may say, &ldquo;I like it, and My grace is sufficient for you.&rdquo; It is not up to us. We should not think that if we remain where we are under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty, we are shrinking back. We would never shrink back, but we need to go on in a proper way. For this reason, we must not make anything legal.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Doing Everything in a Coordinated Way</h2>
<p>We must always move, work, walk, and do things not individualistically but in a coordinated way. This requires much learning. The Lord is truly merciful to us, and His grace is sufficient. I would ask you all to try your best to learn all these points. Then we will see not a movement with arrangements and organization but the move of the Lord in the spirit and with life.</p></body></html>
