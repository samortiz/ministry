   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Even though a sinner may be corrupt to the uttermost, as long as he is willing to accept, that is, believe in the Lord Jesus as the Savior, he will immediately be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After he is saved, as one who has been regenerated by God, he should develop the new life, work for the Lord, and serve Him faithfully so that he can receive the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man is saved by the merit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man is rewarded through his own achievement.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man is saved by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man is rewarded by work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is willing to save a sinner who has no merit, but God is not willing to reward a believer who has no achievement.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before a man believes in the Lord, if he will confess that he is a sinner, and will come to Jesus, and will trust that His death on the cross is a substitution for him, he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He will be guaranteed eternal blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once he is saved, according to the Bible, he is placed in an arena where he must run.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If he wins, he will receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If he loses, he will not receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, he will not lose his eternal life, that is, his salvation, just because of his defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Salvation is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here we have the most balanced teaching and the most appropriate truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Unfortunately, many only know about salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They think that they will be adequately satisfied if they can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They have no further capacity to strive for the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is sad that many have confused salvation with reward.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result they consider salvation to be extremely difficult and obtainable only through one's self-mortification.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, this is not the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible says that salvation is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus has accomplished all the works for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But to receive the reward is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is an achievement we should attain through our trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here I can use an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose a certain rich man is setting up a free school.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All those who come to join the school will not be charged any fee.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The expenses are born by the rich man himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Among all the students in the school, those with outstanding results will be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Salvation is like enrollment in this free school.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone who is willing to come to the Lord Jesus will be saved by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the price for salvation has been paid by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is very easy to become a student in a free school; there is no effort to it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as one comes, he will be accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise it is very easy to be saved; one does not need to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All he needs to do is believe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But it is not easy for a student to receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He has to put in the effort.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Likewise it is not easy for a believer to receive the reward; he must have many good works.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The readers should never think that to be saved is good enough, and that there is no need to seek after any reward.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to know that the Lord desires every genuine regenerated person to pursue after the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the same time, it is spontaneous that a person would seek after the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is not for one's self gain.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To gain the reward is equivalent to gaining the Lord's heart, for those that the Lord rewards are the ones that are well-pleasing to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As sinners should seek for salvation, so believers should seek for reward.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Just as salvation is crucial to a sinner, in the same way reward is crucial to a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The most important thing for a sinner is to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The most important thing for a believer is to receive the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a believer does not receive the reward, it does not merely mean that he has relinquished his rights.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It means that he has not conducted a holy life, that he has not been faithful in his work, that he has achieved no performance in this world, and that he has not fully expressed the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Recently, there have been two extreme teachings which have developed into two errors.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some think that to be saved is very difficult, that man has to do this and that before he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This annuls the merit of the Lord Jesus' substitution and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This teaching puts all the responsibility on man and forgets the biblical teaching that salvation is by grace and justification is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some others think that everything is of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is, of course, true, but they think that all those who believe in the Lord Jesus are not only saved but will also receive reward, glory, and kingship with the Lord Jesus in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They put all the responsibility on God and forget that the Bible also says that some will suffer loss, and that though they will be saved, they will be saved so as through fire 1 Cor 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have the most balanced and sensible teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Before a person believes in the Lord, the Lord takes all the responsibility for him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After he believes in the Lord, he has to take up his own responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The work of salvation is fully accomplished by the Lord on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once a man believes, he will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The matter of reward is fully accomplished by the believers themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is not enough just to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A sinner cannot be saved by good works.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A believer cannot be rewarded by his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Salvation is based on faith, while reward is only based on work.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Without faith one cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Without work one cannot be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we read the New Testament carefully, we will see how clearly God separates the matters of salvation and reward.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Salvation is for the sinners, while reward is for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Both are God's commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A sinner should be saved, and a believer should obtain reward.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Those who are reluctant to accept either of these commandments are bound to suffer great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must never mix salvation with reward.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What is to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We know that it is to receive eternal life and to be delivered from perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, this does not determine our position in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The latter is determined by the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What is the reward?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>According to the Bible, we can see that the reward is to reign with the Lord Jesus in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Every believer has eternal life, but not every believer will be rewarded with the kingship with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The kingdom of the heavens mentioned in the book of Matthew refers to the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom 5:3, note 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There, believers will reign with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Every careful reader of the Bible should see the difference between eternal life and the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Lord permitting, we will discuss this more at a future date.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>To receive eternal life requires only faith, but to receive the kingdom of the heavens requires our striving.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>To be saved is to receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>To be rewarded is to enter the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Brothers, let us press forward towards the mark!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>May God cause us to be willing to relinquish everything for His sake so that we can obtain His reward.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Salvation is for now.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It is obtained instantly because the Scripture says that he who believes in the Son has eternal life John 3:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>To have is to obtain now.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But reward is something for the future; we will be rewarded in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The Scripture says that not until the Lord comes will there be praise 1 Cor 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We will all be recompensed 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>"Will" means something for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Salvation is for now, but reward is for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The two cannot be mixed.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>There is a great difference in principle between salvation and reward.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Salvation shows God's grace because God does not recompense man according to his sins; when he believes in the Lord, he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Reward shows God's righteousness because God recompenses according to the believers' good work; if they serve the Lord faithfully, they will be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We have to remember that God is not either gracious or righteous; He is both gracious and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>To save the sinner is an act of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>To reward the believer is an act of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We have said that Revelation shows God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Hence, to understand the distinction between salvation and reward is the necessary condition in understanding the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If one fails to understand the difference between salvation and reward, he will not be able to explain God's righteous way of dealing with the believers in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>God spoke the words of the eternal life through John.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In the Gospels, He spoke of the way to receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>In the Epistles, He spoke of the expression of the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>In Revelation, He spoke of the judgment for those who have received eternal life, that is, the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Hence, Revelation seldom touches the question of the believers' salvation; it touches the question of their reward.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This book is on righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Reward is God's act in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Hence, this book is concerning reward.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>This is why when we study chapters two and three, there is no mention of the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>They cover the Christian life, work, and victory.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>This realization will help not only to explain chapters two and three but the doctrines in all the following chapters also.</S>
