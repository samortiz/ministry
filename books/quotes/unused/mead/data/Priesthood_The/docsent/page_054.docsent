   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SHOWBREAD TABLE FOR THE LAMPSTAND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, according to the record of the Old Testament, there are at least two other things in the Holy Place: the showbread table and the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What kind of relationship do these have with our contacting God?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the last chapter we saw clearly that if we burn the incense, we cannot burn it in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the outer court there is the sunshine in the day time and the moonlight at night.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the natural light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But within the Holy Place there is no natural light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no window, or even a door just a covered entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the lampstand is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The burning of the incense requires the lighting of the lamps to give the light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then it is possible to burn the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The burning of the incense depends very much on the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have seen this clearly in the previous chapter, and we have seen its spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must have the light from the Word, through the Spirit, that we might know how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Otherwise, we will simply pray in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever we say without the light will be in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It will be a kind of nonsense, a foolish talking to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must pray in light and with light.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our prayer will then issue out of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The light comes from the Word, through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Word and the Spirit are not two separate things, but two sides of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are two aspects of one thing just as the children of Israel had the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was one pillar with two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the daytime it was the pillar of cloud, and in the nighttime it was the pillar of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The cloud is the type of the Holy Spirit, and the fire is the type of the holy Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When our sky is clear, we have the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But when our sky is cloudy, we need the holy Bible to enlighten us and give us light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So the Spirit and the Word are two aspects of one thing for our enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is in this enlightenment that we know how to pray and how to utter something of Christ unto God as the sweet incense.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the expression of something of Christ from within us in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without the light, we would pray foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But what does the showbread table have to do with the lampstand and the incense altar?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Exodus 37 we can see an order or sequence in the making of these utensils.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First of all, they made the showbread table, then the lampstand, and then the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This shows us clearly that the table comes first, then the lampstand, followed by the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that the showbread table is for the lampstand, and the lampstand is for the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>LIGHT ISSUES OUT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The showbread table is for the lampstand because the table is for life and the lampstand is for light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John 1:4 says, In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The life is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the showbread table there is the life supply, and from this life the light is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The light comes from life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more life supply we enjoy, the more light we are in. Life produces light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we do not partake of and enjoy Christ as our life supply, we will be in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we are filled with the life supply of Christ, we will have the light.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The enjoyment of the life supply will give the light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some people receive light when they read the Bible, but this receiving of light depends to a certain extent on the enjoyment of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more life we have, the more light we will receive from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more we grow and mature in life, the more light we will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Light depends on the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more we enjoy Christ as our life supply, the more light we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To burn the incense requires the light, and to have light requires the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order for us to burn the incense in a proper way, we need the light, but to get the light, we need the life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must learn to feed on Christ as the showbread, the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not simply to receive Him once for all; we must feed on Him continually, day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can never graduate from feeding on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must eat continually to receive the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The supply of life we receive will become the light.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The life is the light, and this light is necessary in order to burn the incense unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The burning of incense depends on the light, and the light depends on the life supply.</S>
