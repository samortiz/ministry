   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By Setting Our Mind on the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We receive, experience, and enjoy Christ also by setting our mind on the spirit Rom 8:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 8:4 tells us to walk according to the spirit, and verse 5 tells us to set our mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not do anything that is not according to the spirit, and we should not think anything without our mind being set on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every person, even a little child, is controlled by his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we begin to think about something, we as seeking Christians should always check whether or not our mind is set on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If our mind is not set on the spirit, the source of our thinking is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If our mind is not set on the spirit, it is surely set on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The flesh is contrary to the Spirit Gal 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because our mind is fallen, whatever we think when our mind is set on the flesh is an offense to God Rom 8:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The spirit mentioned in Romans 8:4-6 refers to the regenerated spirit, which is indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In his New Translation, John Nelson Darby said that in many verses in the New Testament one cannot discern whether the spirit refers to the human spirit or the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He then said that the spirit in verses such as Romans 8:4-6 refers to both the human spirit and the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In addition to this, I would say that the spirit in these verses refers to the mingled spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today, we no longer have a single, independent spirit; we have a mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such a mingled spirit is troublesome to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Very often we are troubled by the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At certain times I would like to say something unpleasant to my wife, but as I am about to speak, something bothers me within, and I have to stop without finishing my statement.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead of saying something unpleasant, I change my tone and begin to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because of this behavior, I may seem to be mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, I have such behavior because I have a mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every proper Christian is a mystery, and within every proper Christian there is a mystery the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must learn to walk according to the spirit and to set our mind on this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we set our mind on the spirit, we have life and peace v. 6 . These are signs of our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By the Renewing of Our Mind</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>for the Transformation of Our Soul</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That We May Know the Will of God</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>concerning the Body Life</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ in the book of Romans includes three things: first, walking according to the spirit, second, setting our mind on the spirit, and third, the renewing of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The renewing of our mind is for the transformation of our soul that we may know the will of God concerning the Body life Rom 12:2-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The mind is the leading part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the leading part of the soul is renewed, the entire soul will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The purpose of transformation is that we may know the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The will of God in Romans 12:2 is not His will related to our daily affairs, but His will concerning the Body life, the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The book of Romans, which is the gospel of God 1:1 , has four sections.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first section is on justification chs.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>1 4 ; the second section is on the full realization of being in Christ chs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>5 8 ; the third section is on God's selection chs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>9 11 ; and the fourth section is on the Body life, issuing in local churches chs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>12 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First, we must experience justification, both objectively and subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then we must have the full realization of being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today we are no longer in Adam; we are now in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With this realization, we then need to experience the Body life and live a proper local church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Romans 12 is on the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 5 says, "So we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to live the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to live such a life, all the members must have their minds renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This renewing will cause us to be persons who know God's will concerning the Body life, the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord's recovery has stressed the Body life since 1939.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In 1934 Brother Nee held a conference concerning Christ as God's centrality and universality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that time my eyes were opened, and my Christian life took a big turn from doctrines and knowledge to a living person, Christ, who is God's centrality and universality.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Five years later, after his return from Europe, Brother Nee called a conference and began to give messages on knowing the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These messages caused me to have another turn.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>My first turn was to know Christ, and my second turn was to know His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To know Christ is only half of what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We also must know the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ is the Head Eph 1:22 , and He is also the Body 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
