<h2 class="head1">A FEW THINGS TO NOTE IN HANDING ONESELF OVER</h2><p>In making judgments concerning the saints' handing themselves over, we have to be accurate. Otherwise, there will be undesirable consequences. Some brothers handed themselves over in another place already. We should not dictate their pathway for them.</p><p>From now on, all the arrangements we make should be centered around the church. In other words, they should be centered around the Lord and the gospel. The schooling of the young people also should be done in coordination. We do not expect all of you to quit work, but some should change jobs and work with the brothers and sisters. Others can be scattered among unbelievers and strive to gain more of them. If we all practice this, the Lord will bless us.</p><p>If the things that you handed over should be sold, you should dispose of them as quickly as possible. If not, you will get into trouble. One brother started out as an officer in the navy. Later he was promoted to be a commander and then an admiral. He owned much land and had a nice house. It was built at the cost of sixty thousand gold dollars. He loved antiques, and he kept a great deal of precious metals and antiques in the house. I exhorted him to sell his things. Even if he had to discount his house by ten percent, he could still get back fifty thousand gold dollars for it. He was reluctant to give up these things. As a result of this delay, his house has been turned into the headquarters of the Communist government. He could not take one article from his house, and he did not get a single dollar back of what he had put into it. During these few days, I hope you will gather together and make suitable arrangements for the things that the brothers and sisters have offered up. In this way the church will not suffer any loss.</p><h2 class="head1">HANDING OURSELVES OVER OPENING THE WAY<br />FOR US TO LOVE THE LORD</h2><p>Finally, I would like to say that during the past few days I have had a deep feeling that our handing over of ourselves opens the way for us to love the Lord. If a man does not hand over himself, he can never succeed in loving the Lord. Mr. F. B. Meyer was a person very experienced in the matter of consecration. One young sister consecrated herself over ten times at the age of twelve. She kept saying that she consecrated her heart to the Lord, but there was no breakthrough. She said to Mr. Meyer, "I do not know why I fail all the time. Whenever I pray and give my heart to the Lord, I still feel as if it is with me." Mr. Meyer answered, "Tell the Lord that you cannot give your heart to Him, and ask Him to take it away instead."</p><p>Let me say this: Our heart cannot go to Him, because it is stuck in the world and in its treasures, the mammon. This is the reason our mouth can say as much as we want about loving the Lord but our heart will not follow. If we send our treasures and our mammon to the Lord, our heart will follow. We cannot control our heart, and we cannot consecrate ourselves. The Lord said that where our treasure is, there is our heart also (Matt. 6:21). How do we consecrate? There is no need to deal with the heart, just deal with the treasure. When we give the Lord our treasure, our heart will go to Him. The happiest experience on earth is when our heart goes to the Lord. We can jump up and sing, "Hallelujah!" A Christian suffers when his heart cannot love the Lord. In order for our heart to love the Lord, we must not pay attention only to our heart, but to our treasure. Once we hand over our treasure, our heart will surely follow. We can only love the Lord when we hand over ourselves.</p><h2 class="head1">HANDING OURSELVES OVER<br />OPENING THE WAY FOR US TO LOVE<br />THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS</h2><p>From the day we hand ourselves over, not only do we love the Lord, but we begin to truly love the brothers and sisters. If we have not handed ourselves over, we can only give what we have in excess to others; we cannot love the brothers and sisters. When we hand over everything, the Lord breaks our shell of self-love. We are delivered from our own little domain and begin to practice brotherly love. We become one who is good at giving. Once we see something we have that others do not, we feel uneasy and want to give it up as well.</p><p>I can testify to you honestly that Brother Philip Luan was a brother who handed himself over long ago. He sold everything he had. He was a strong person. He offered up many of his possessions the day after he was saved. He terminated many relationships. He even closed his tobacco factory. Originally, he was known as the king of tobacco in Manchuria. Every factory under him was very large. He had twenty-seven companies and over a hundred retail branches. However, he closed all these businesses a day or two after he believed in the Lord. He paid all the debts he owed, but he forgave all the debts that others owed him. Later, when Brother Luan came to Hong Kong, he went through severe trials financially. He had been a rich man in his own place, but he volunteered to take the way of poverty. He did more than just love the Lord. Many people can testify that he loved the brothers and sisters. Perhaps his speaking could not match that of Brother Witness, but he was a person who was absolutely free from self. God saved many people and perfected many others through him. Here we see a brother who was free from mammon. He loved the Lord and the brothers and sisters. No one who is constantly calculating can love the brothers.</p><h2 class="head1">HANDING OURSELVES OVER OPENING THE WAY<br />FOR US TO LOVE SINNERS</h2><p>Finally, handing ourselves over enables us to love not only the Lord and the saints but sinners as well. Before we hand ourselves over, we always count our money and consider it more precious than the human soul; we do not believe that a sinner is worth more than the whole world. But after we hand ourselves over, we feel that every soul is precious. It is worthwhile to spend the riches of the whole world in exchange for a single soul. The Lord asked, "What shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?" (Matt. 16:26). When we fearfully hold on to our money, all the souls in the world mean little to us. We argue over three or five dollars while allowing a soul to go to hell. When we let go of our money, our heart will love all the sinners in this world. During the past two or three years, I have had the deep feeling that we can never treasure what is true unless we cast away what is false.</p><p>Only those who are truly delivered from the power of mammon can love the Lord, the brothers, and sinners. If mammon continues to have a hold on us, our love for the Lord is false, our love for the brothers is false, and our love for sinners does not exist. It is nothing but doctrine, good only for deceiving and mollifying ourselves. We will have love and joy only after we have handed ourselves over. Christ will be precious to us only after we have done this. Only then will the church and all the brothers and sisters be precious to us. When we walk on the street, we will feel that every soul is precious and every sinner lovable. While we are waiting for the bus to come, we will have a different feeling when we see the crowds passing by. Even if some argue and fight in front of us, we will still love them and treasure their souls. When we see someone engaged in a brawl, we will pray earnestly for him. Others may consider him a demon, but we will find his soul very precious.</p><p>There is only one thing in the world that takes away our love for the Lord, for the saints, and for sinners&mdash;mammon. Once mammon goes away, our senses will be clear, our eyes will be opened, our minds will see, and our judgments will be right. May God grant us this kind of seeing.</p>
