<p class="bold">WEEK 12 — DAY 4</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 16:18-20</h2><p class="bold">18 &nbsp;And I <sup>1</sup>also say to you that you are <sup>2</sup>Peter, and upon <sup>3</sup>this rock I will <sup>4</sup>build My <sup>5</sup>church, and the <sup>6</sup>gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.</p><p class="bold">19 &nbsp;I will give to you the <sup>1</sup>keys of the <sup>2</sup>kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you <sup>3</sup>bind on the earth shall <sup>4</sup>have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you <sup>3</sup>loose on the earth shall <sup>4</sup>have been loosed in the heavens.</p> <p>20 &nbsp;Then He charged the disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>18<sup>1</sup> The Father’s revelation concerning Christ is only the first half of the great mystery, which is Christ and the church (Eph. 5:32). Hence, the Lord needed to reveal to Peter the second half also, which concerns the church.</p><p>18<sup>2</sup> Or, a stone; material for God’s building (1 Pet. 2:5).</p><p>18<sup>3</sup> This rock refers not only to Christ but also to this revelation concerning Christ, a revelation that Peter received from the Father. The church is built on Christ and on this revelation concerning Christ.</p><p>18<sup>4</sup> The Lord’s building of His church began on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4, 41-42). Yet the Lord’s prophecy here still has not been fulfilled, even up to the twentieth century. The Lord is not building His church in Christendom, which is composed of the apostate Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations. This prophecy is being fulfilled through the Lord’s recovery, in which the building of the genuine church is being accomplished.</p><p>18<sup>5</sup> Gk. ekklesia, meaning an out-calling. This word is used in reference to a called-out congregation. My church indicates that the church is of the Lord, not of any other person or thing; it is not like the denominations, which are denominated according to some person’s name or according to some matter.</p><p>18<sup>6</sup> Gates of Hades refers to Satan’s authority or power of darkness (Col. 1:13; Acts 26:18), which cannot prevail against the genuine church built by Christ upon this revelation concerning Him as the rock, with stones such as Peter, a transformed human being. This word of the Lord’s indicates also that Satan’s power of darkness will attack the church. Hence, there is spiritual warfare between Satan’s power, which is his kingdom, and the church, which is God’s kingdom.</p><p>19<sup>1</sup> According to history there were two keys. Peter used one on the day of Pentecost to open the gate so that the Jewish believers could enter the kingdom of the heavens (Acts 2:38-42), and he used the other in the house of Cornelius to open the gate so that the Gentile believers could enter (Acts 10:34-48).</p><p>19<sup>2</sup> Kingdom of the heavens is used here interchangeably for church, which is used in the previous verse. This is a strong proof that the genuine church is the kingdom of the heavens in this age. This is confirmed by Rom. 14:17, in which the kingdom of God is mentioned in obvious reference to the proper church life.</p><p>19<sup>3</sup> This Gospel is concerned with the kingdom of the heavens, which is a matter of authority. The church revealed in this book represents the kingdom with its reign. Hence, the authority to bind and to loose was given not only to Peter, the apostle for the church here, but also to the church itself (18:17-18).</p><p>19<sup>4</sup> Whatever the church people bind or loose on earth must be something that has already been bound or loosed in the heavens. We can bind or loose only what has already been bound or loosed in the heavens.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The church that is built upon the revelation concerning Christ is the genuine church, and it is not sectarian.…If we see this, we will be saved from division.…Any group that is built upon doctrines, views, practices, or concepts is not the church built upon the revelation concerning Christ. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 567-568) </p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 566-570; Hymns: #824</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
