[1]  TRUTH LESSONS LEVEL ONE LESSON THIRTEEN A KEY VIEW OF THE OLD TESTAMENT 7 FROM THE CAPTIVITY TO THE RETURN 2 OUTLINE The prophets during the return: The kingship not being recovered.
[2]  In this lesson we will continue the previous lesson to see the prophets and other related people during the return.
[3]  Zechariah the prophet was the son of Berechiah and the grandson of Iddo Zech 1:1 .
[4]  Besides telling of the importance of Christ in relation to God s rebuilding work in the preceding eight visions, Zechariah also prophesied of the various aspects of the two comings of Christ in chapters nine through fourteen of his book.
[5]  In His first coming, Christ would come as the King of Israel, meek and mounted on a colt, the foal of a donkey 9:9; Matt 21:1-10 ; eventually He would be betrayed by one of His disciples for thirty pieces of silver 11:12-13; Matt 26:14-16; 27:3-10 .
[6]  Malachi was the most hidden among the prophets, because aside from his name, there is no record of his status or genealogy.
[7]  The prophets before the age of the prophets: Abraham.
[8]  They speak for God and speak forth God; sometimes they also predict.
[9]  According to the Bible, the main function of a prophet is not to predict the things to come but to speak for God.
[10]  For example, in Exodus 3 and 4 when Moses was called by God, he told God that he was slow of speech and of a slow tongue 4:10 .
[11]  David was a king and a prophet as well Acts 2:29-30 .
[12]  The Spirit of Jehovah spoke by him, and His word was in his tongue 2 Sam 23:2 .
[13]  In his psalms he prophesied that from the beginning Christ was God Psa 110:1; Matt 22:43-44 who became a man Psa 8:4-5; Heb 2:6-9 .
[14]  During the time when King Ahab and the people were worshipping Baal, Elijah was a strong witness of God and a man of prayer as well James 5:17 .
[15]  In it are found prophecies concerning Christ: a His birth God becoming a man 7:14; 9:6 ; b His genealogy a descendant of Jesse 11:1 ; c His name Emmanuel, Wonderful, Counselor, a child being called the mighty God, a son being called the everlasting Father, the Prince of peace, Jehovah s Servant 7:14; 9:6; 42:19 ; d His living as a root out of a dry ground, having no form nor comeliness, His image being marred more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men, being despised and rejected of men, being a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief 52:14; 53:2-3 ; e His being anointed being filled with the Spirit of God 61:1; 11:2 ; f His work preaching good tidings and proclaiming God s jubilee 61:1-3 ; g His dealings with man not crying nor lifting up His voice, not breaking a bruised reed, and not quenching the smoking flax 42:1-4 ; h His death having borne our griefs and carried our sorrows, being wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities 53:4a-10 ; i His burial making His grave with the rich 53:9a ; j His resurrection swallowing up death, prolonging His days, justifying many 25:8a; 53:10b-11 ; k His coming back rending the heavens and coming down, judging the people 64:1; 63:1-6 ; l His reign in the millennium Rev 20:4, 6 reigning in righteousness, all peoples enjoying peace, and all creation living in harmony 9:7; 11:3-16; 32:1; 33:17-24 ; m His kingdom being exalted above all the nations and all peoples flowing to it 2:2-4; 35:1-10; Micah 4:1-3 , bringing in the new heaven and new earth 65:17; 66:22 .
[16]  The prophet Amos was a native of Tekoa in the kingdom of Judah Amos 1:1 .
[17]  When he had problems or when he sought for the interest of his fellow people, he embraced God and attached himself to God, asking questions repeatedly and not relaxing at all.
[18]  The book of Habakkuk is very similar to the book of Nahum, both being concerned with God s judgment upon the enemies of God s people.
[19]  Furthermore, they include: His becoming a man; His human living on earth; His being anointed by God; His being filled with the Spirit; His preaching the good news; His proclaiming the jubilee; and eventually His being betrayed; His being wounded on the cross; His bearing man s sin; His being buried with the rich; His resurrection to be the foundation stone and cornerstone set up by God that His disciples might become His brothers to be His church, in whose midst He sings praise to God; His being ascended to the height; His sitting at the right hand of God; His being designated by God as High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec; and His waiting for God to make His enemies His footstool.
[20]  TRUTH LESSONS LEVEL ONE LESSON FIFTEEN A KEY VIEW OF THE OLD TESTAMENT 9 FROM THE REBUILDING OF THE HOLY TEMPLE
[21]  TO THE END OF THE OLD TESTAMENT AGE OUTLINE Antiochus Epiphanes king of Syria: The little horn in Daniel 8.
[22]  In Lesson Twelve, volume one, which covered the captivity and the prophets in captivity, the great image in Daniel 2 and the visions in chapters seven through twelve were mentioned.
[23]  Daniel 2 describes the great image in King Nebuchadnezzar s dream; chapter seven covers the vision of the four beasts emerging from the sea; chapter eight speaks of the clash between the ram and the he-goat; chapter eleven cites the things related to the southern and northern kings.
[24]  TRUTH LESSONS LEVEL ONE LESSON SIXTEEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
[25]  As we come to study the new and old testaments, we must first know the difference between these terms: a promise, an oath, a covenant, and a testament.
[26]  A promise is an ordinary word spoken by God, promising you that He will do something for you.
[27]  An oath is a confirmation of God s word of promise.
[28]  Galatians 3:19 says that the law was ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator.
[29]  The new covenant was accomplished by Jesus Christ Himself.
[30]  When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross and shed the precious blood, He made the way for God to enact a new covenant with us Matt 26:28 .
[31]  Unlike the old covenant which was ordained in the hand of Moses, the new covenant was accomplished by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, God s beloved Son.
[32]  The new and the old testaments first refer to the two covenants which God made with man as the two conditions for man to have a relationship with Him.
[33]  The old covenant was ordained in the hand of Moses, dedicated with the blood of bulls and goats, and based upon the law, which could not give life, as its condition, requiring man only to work, not to believe.
[34]  It was not God s original intention but was added later and eventually was done away.
[35]  The new covenant, the better and eternal covenant, was accomplished by Jesus Christ, was established with the blood of Jesus, the Son of God, and is based upon grace, which gives life, as its condition, requiring man only to believe, not to work.
[36]  TRUTH LESSONS LEVEL ONE LESSON SEVENTEEN A KEY VIEW OF THE NEW TESTAMENT 1 JOHN THE BAPTIST OUTLINE The background.
[37]  From this lesson on, we will look at the key view of the entire New Testament in sequence.
[38]  And the young child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his presentation to Israel Luke 1:80 .
[39]  The word of God came to John, the son of Zachariah, in the wilderness.
[40]  John the Baptist had the spirit and power of Elijah, and he did the work of Elijah in turning many Israelites to the Lord their God Luke 1:16-17 .
[41]  TRUTH LESSONS LEVEL ONE LESSON EIGHTEEN A KEY VIEW OF THE NEW TESTAMENT 2 JESUS CHRIST 1 FROM HIS ETERNITY PAST
[42]  TO HIS DEATH AND BURIAL OUTLINE His eternity past: The Word that was in the beginning with God.
[43]  The first important person in the New Testament is John the Baptist.
[44]  In the foregoing lesson we saw that he was the inaugurator of the New Testament age, who brought in the central figure of the New Testament Jesus Christ.
[45]  In this lesson we will see the Lord Jesus, who is the central figure of the New Testament and even of the whole Bible, from His eternity past to His death and burial.
[46]  This wonderful person, Jesus Christ, was conceived of the Holy Spirit of God in the womb of a chaste virgin.
[47]  Luke 2:13-14 says, And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying, Glory in the highest places to God, and on earth peace among men of His good pleasure.
[48]  Christ as the center of the entire Bible is all-inclusive, having many aspects.
[49]  The first thing the Lord Jesus did in His ministry was to preach the gospel, to announce God s glad tidings to the miserable people in bondage Luke 4:18-19 , that they may repent, believe in the gospel, have their sins forgiven, and be regenerated by God to have the divine life and enter into God s kingdom Mark 1:14-15; John 3:3-7 .
[50]  X. HIS DEATH A. The Date and Place of His Death
[51]  From the Lord Jesus baptism and the beginning of His ministry to the Passover recorded in John 2:13 was about half a year.
[52]  From that Passover to the feast of the Jews recorded in John 5:1 was one year.
[53]  The Lord Jesus died, and in the evening of that day He was buried by two of His disciples, Joseph of Arimathea, a rich man, and Nicodemus.
[54]  TO HIS ETERNITY FUTURE OUTLINE His resurrection: The process of His resurrection.
[55]  In this lesson we will continue to see Jesus Christ as the center of the New Testament, from His resurrection to His eternity future.
[56]  His spirit did not die at the cross when His flesh did; His spirit rather became more active with the power of God s life, so that in this empowered spirit He went to Tartarus, the deep pit, to the fallen and imprisoned angels to proclaim God s victory through His incarnation in Christ and Christ s death in the flesh over Satan s scheme to derange the divine plan 1 Pet 3:19 and notes .
[57]  On the night of His resurrection the Lord Jesus came to the disciples and breathed Himself, the resurrected Christ, the pneumatic Christ, as breath into them John 20:22 .
[58]  When Christ ascended to heaven and sat on the throne of God, He was put into a number of important offices.
[59]  Based upon these offices, He is carrying out His heavenly ministry unto eternity.
[60]  This better covenant, which is the new covenant Christ enacted for us Matt 26:28 , was not only enacted upon better promises of a better law, the inner law of life Heb 8:6b, 10-12 , but also consummated with Christ s better sacrifices Heb 9:23 and His better blood Heb 12:24 .
[61]  Thus, Christ became the Mediator and Surety of the better covenant between God and man, not only guaranteeing the eternal efficacy of this covenant but also executing all the rich bequests of this covenant into His believers.
[62]  At the end of the church age, before the times of restoration of all things, Christ, who is carrying out His ministry according to His heavenly offices above all the heavens, will come back from heaven according to His promise Matt 24:33-44 .
[63]  After Christ in His second coming deals with the four groups of people on the earth, He will send an angel to bind Satan, cast him into the abyss, and shut him up for one thousand years Rev 20:1-3 .
[64]  Immediately after Satan s rebellion, God declared His judgment on him Isa 14:12-15 .
[65]  Since then God has been continuously executing His judgment Luke 10:17-19; Heb 2:14; Rev 12:9, 12 .
[66]  Then in His second coming, Christ will further execute God s judgment pronounced on the rebellious Satan by binding and imprisoning him.
[67]  After Christ removes God s rebel from the earth, He will clear up the rebellious earth that His kingdom, the kingdom of God, may come to the earth.
[68]  Revelation 21:9 refers to the New Jerusalem as the wife of the Lamb, indicating that Christ is the Husband of the New Jerusalem Rev 21:2 .
[69]  The New Jerusalem comes out of the Lamb, who has accomplished an eternal redemption, and returns to Him to be one with Him, as Eve came out of Adam and returned to Adam to be one with him.
[70]  Jesus Christ as revealed in the New Testament is the God-man, the union and mingling of the entire Triune God and the complete tripartite man, mysterious, wonderful, rich, bountiful, all-inclusive, and immeasurable.
[71]  He is the center of the entire New Testament economy of God and the contents of the whole New Testament.
[72]  He needs the church which is rich in His life to testify Him in this age, the kingdom which is full of His authority and power to exalt Him in the next age, and the New Jerusalem which will be overflowing with His fullness to express Him in eternity fully, completely, multifariously, and eternally!
[73]  Its achievements consist of seven items: God s vindication and approval of Him and His work; the sign of His universal success; His victory over death, including Satan, Hades, and the grave; the release of the glory of His divinity, which was concealed in the shell of His human body, enabling Him to enter into the divine glory with humanity; His becoming the life-giving Spirit; His being born as God s Firstborn with humanity; and the regeneration of His believers that they may become God s many sons to be His Body, the church.
[74]  TRUTH LESSONS LEVEL ONE LESSON TWENTY A KEY VIEW OF THE NEW TESTAMENT 4 THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST OUTLINE His person: The Creator.
[75]  The gospel of Jesus Christ is simply Jesus Christ Himself Acts 5:42b; Rom 1:1-3 , with His person, His accomplishments, His attainments, His obtainments, and His work in this age, in the coming age, and in eternity as the content.
[76]  After the Lord Jesus was born, according to God s ordination He was named Jesus, which means Jehovah the Savior, or Jehovah the salvation.
[77]  This indicates that He is Jehovah God in the Old Testament becoming man s Savior and man s salvation to save God s people from their sins Matt 1:21 .
[78]  The second major step in the Lord Jesus accomplishments was His experience of human life.
[79]  As a man He lived in a lowly home cf.
[80]  God raised Christ to the highest position, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is coming Eph 1:21 .
[81]  Finally, when He, as the God-man in resurrection, was exalted by God to the height of the universe, far above all, He attained the peak where He expresses the divine attributes in His human virtues to the highest degree, expressing what God is in His humanity in the universe unto all the generations of the age of the ages.
[82]  V. HIS WORK IN THE PRESENT AGE A. Giving Repentance and Forgiveness of Sins
[83]  The first thing Christ did after His ascension was to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to men Acts 5:31 that they might believe and be saved Acts 16:31 .
[84]  Christ saves sinners in this age to make them His members for the building of the church Matt 16:18 , His Body Eph 1:22b-23 , that God may be manifested in Him and through the church 1 Tim 3:15-16 .
[85]  HIS WORK IN ETERNITY A. Being the Lamb Who Is One with God
[86]  In eternity at the center of the holy city, New Jerusalem, is the throne of God and of the Lamb Rev 22:1 .
[87]  In eternity He will be the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, to His redeemed people.
[88]  AND SHEPHERD-TEACHERS OUTLINE Apostles: The meaning of apostles.
[89]  Concerning the work of the ministry, Ephesians 4:12-13 says that it is to minister Christ to men for the building up of the Body of Christ, the church, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[90]  This is the focus of God s work in the New Testament, which especially stresses the building up of the Body of Christ.
[91]  For such a building work of the Body of Christ, God has particularly separated a group of people and given them as gifts to the church.
[92]  After rescuing men from Satan and death through His death and resurrection, Christ in His ascension, with His resurrection life and through the Holy Spirit, gave spiritual abilities to His rescued ones that they might build up His Body; He also separated some from among them and gave them as gifts to the church to perfect the saints for the building up of His Body.
[93]  After they were sent, the apostles principal work was to go out to preach the word of God.
[94]  Evangelists are also Christ s gifts to the church Eph 4:11 , but how they become such men is not told in the Bible.
[95]  Christ gave these gifted persons to the church for the perfecting of the saints that the saints may participate in the work of the ministry, that is, in the building up of the Body of Christ.
[96]  The saints need to be perfected and equipped unto the work of the ministry Eph 4:12 .
[97]  TRUTH LESSONS LEVEL ONE LESSON TWENTY-TWO A KEY VIEW OF THE NEW TESTAMENT 6 THE CHURCH OUTLINE The church being the assembly of God s called ones.
[98]  Some consider the chapel as the church; in their thinking, to go to the chapel is to go to the church.
[99]  The church is the house of God, the dwelling place of God on earth, the place in which God can have His rest and put His trust.
[100]  In this dwelling place God lives and moves to accomplish His will and satisfy His heart s desire.
[101]  The church has two aspects: the universal aspect and the local aspect.
[102]  The kingdom of God has many aspects, as revealed in the New Testament by the following different designations:
[103]  The words spoken by the Lord in Matthew 21:43 and the parable preceding it in verses 33-41 show us that the kingdom of God was there with the children of Israel in the Old Testament, but due to their rejection of the Lord, it was given to the church in the New Testament.
[104]  First Corinthians 6:9-10, Galatians 5:19-21, and Ephesians 5:5 all mention that the evil or unrighteous ones cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
[105]  When Christ came out to preach the kingdom of God as the gospel Mark 1:14-15 , He was the unique seed of the kingdom of God.
[106]  After passing through death and resurrection, He released God s life and dispensed it into His believers, thus bringing forth many grains John 12:24 .
[107]  Through them the kingdom of God spread again and again Acts 8:12; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31 into thousands of believers Acts 2:41; 4:4; 21:20 , making them constituents of the kingdom of God.
[108]  The New Testament uses different designations, such as the kingdom of God, the kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom of God s beloved Son, the kingdom of Christ and of God, the kingdom of the Lord and of His Christ, the eternal kingdom of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the kingdom of the Father, the kingdom of the Son of Man, and the kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world, to reveal various aspects of the kingdom of God.
[109]  TRUTH LESSONS LEVEL ONE LESSON TWENTY-FOUR A KEY VIEW OF THE NEW TESTAMENT 8 THE NEW JERUSALEM OUTLINE The conclusion of the whole Bible and of the entire divine revelation: The conclusion of the whole Bible.
[110]  AND OF THE ENTIRE DIVINE REVELATION A. The Conclusion of the Whole Bible
[111]  The New Jerusalem revealed in the last two chapters of the book of Revelation is not only the conclusion of the book itself and of the New Testament; it is also the conclusion of the whole Bible.
[112]  In the sixty-six books of the Bible, all the records of plain words, prophecies, and types in the Old Testament, beginning from God s creation, progressing through Satan s rebellion, man s fall, God s promise of redemption to fallen man, God s dealings with the Patriarchs, God s calling of His chosen people, their redemption, their being formed into a nation, their failure, and their recovery, and concluding with their looking to and waiting for Christ; and all the records of plain words, prophecies, and signs in the New Testament, beginning from John the Baptist and the ministry of the Lord Jesus, progressing through the Lord Jesus death, resurrection, ascension, and ministry after His ascension, the work of the apostles, the calling, salvation, and maturity of the believers, the establishment and building up of the church, the Lord Jesus second coming and the things that He will do in His second coming, the establishment of the millennial kingdom, the termination of Satan and his followers, including demons and human beings, and the passing away of the old heaven and the old earth, and concluding with the coming of the new heaven and new earth, are consummated in the New Jerusalem.
[113]  Whereas the sphere of His work of the old creation was the old heaven and old earth of His original creation Gen 1:1 ; the sphere of His work of the new creation is the new heaven and new earth 2 Pet 3:13; Rev 21:1 , which are the original God-created old heaven and old earth renewed through the burning of God s judging fire.
[114]  The dispensation of law extended from the giving of the law by Moses to the first coming of Christ John 1:17 .
[115]  In this dispensation God used His law to deal with man by exposing man s sin and weakness Rom 5:20a; 3:20b; 8:3a , that man might be led to Christ Gal 3:24 .
[116]  In this dispensation God uses grace John 1:14, 16; 1 Cor 15:10 to work the fallen sinners into Christ 1 Cor 1:30 and to work Christ into them Gal 1:16a; 2:20b; Col 1:27b , thus producing the church Eph 1:22-23 .
[117]  In this dispensation God will use the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens to reward, according to His righteousness 2 Tim 4:8 , the perfected righteous ones, the overcoming saints, of the Old Testament Heb 12:23; 11:39-40 , and the overcoming believers in Christ of the New Testament Matt 24:45-47; 25:21, 23 , and He will also perfect the immature New Testament believers in Christ Matt 24:48-51; 25:26-30 .
[118]  In the old creation, according to the arrangement of His economy, God uses the aforementioned four dispensations to carry out His work of the new creation in the man of the old creation, and He further uses a short period of insertion to carry out His work of restoration in the remaining nations through His eternal gospel.
[119]  At the end of the millennium, among the nations who are restored to be the peoples in the millennial kingdom, Gog and Magog will be deceived by the Devil to rebel against God.
[120]  This will be mankind s last rebellion against God, at the end of which the rebellious ones will be devoured by fire from heaven Rev 20:7-10 .
[121]  After this last purging of mankind, the remaining ones among them will be transferred to the new earth of the new heaven and new earth to be God s peoples in eternity Rev 21:3, 24 .
[122]  The New Jerusalem cannot be a physical city, as commonly believed by Christians, for the following reasons:
[123]  After God finished the creation of all things and man, He used different ways in the different dispensations in the old heaven and old earth to carry out His work in the man of the old creation by choosing, redeeming, renewing, transforming, and glorifying them; thus, He perfects them according to His desire and builds them up to be His eternal habitation, which is the New Jerusalem of His heart s desire.
[124]  Revelation 22:1 shows us that in the center of the New Jerusalem there is the throne of God and of the Lamb.
[125]  God s work of the old creation is a preparation for His work of the new creation.
[126]  Since the completion of the creation of the old heaven and old earth and everything therein, and since the fall of man, God has used four different dispensations the dispensation of the Patriarchs, the dispensation of law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of righteousness to carry out the work of the new creation in man, who is of the Satan-ruined and God-judged old creation, by the Spirit and life of Himself as the Triune God who has been processed through incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension; by His heavenly ministry after His ascension; and by what He will accomplish in His second coming.
[127]  His work of the new creation through the different dispensations in the old creation and His work of restoration in the short inserted period will have the following results: 1 all the redeemed people of the Old Testament and New Testament will be produced; 2 among the redeemed, a group of overcomers who are perfected and have arrived at the maturity in God s life will be obtained; 3 the overcomers will be constituted the New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom and become the kings in the heavenly part of the millennium; 4 all Israel will be saved and serve as priests in the earthly part of the millennium; 5 at the end of the dispensation of grace, the remainder of the nations will be restored as the citizens in the earthly part of the millennium; 6 the redeemed but immature believers, who are unable to participate in the New Jerusalem of the millennium, will be perfected and become mature in God s life; 7 the nations, having been restored as the people in the millennium, will be purged and be brought into the new earth of the new heaven and new earth as God s people for eternity; 8 as a secondary result, all the creatures who rebel against God will be terminated and cast into the lake of fire; and 9 all the Old Testament and New Testament saints who have been redeemed and perfected and have reached the maturity in God s life will be constituted the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.
