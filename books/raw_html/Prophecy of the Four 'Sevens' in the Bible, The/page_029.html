<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>k. The Judgment at the Great White Throne,<br>After the Earth and Heaven Fled Away,<br>to Judge the Unbelieving Dead with the Demons</H2><P>The judgment at the great white throne, after the earth and heaven fled away, is to judge the unbelieving dead with the demons (Rev. 20:11-15). The Bible has a complete conclusion. God executes His judgment to deal with the living ones. At the great white throne, He will judge all the dead ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) Death and Hades Being Cast<br>into the Lake of Fire</H2><P>Death and Hades will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:14). The lake of fire is the "trash can" for the entire universe, into which all negative things, including death and Hades, will be cast. Death will be the last enemy destroyed by the Lord (1 Cor. 15:26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The Unbelievers and the Demons<br>Being Cast into the Lake of Fire</H2><P>The unbelievers and the demons will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:15). The lake of fire is prepared for the devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41). Since the unbelievers have followed the devil, they share the devil's judgment (John 16:11) and will become joint partakers of the devil's eternal torment. The demons, having also followed the devil, will share the same destiny.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>l. The Coming of the New Heaven and New Earth<br>to Be God's Kingdom Forever</H2><P>The seventh trumpet concludes with the coming of the new heaven and new earth to be God's kingdom forever (Rev. 21:1&#151;22:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) The First Heaven and First Earth Passing Away,<br>and the Sea Being No More</H2><P>The first heaven and first earth will pass away, and the sea will be no more (Rev. 21:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The New Jerusalem, the Holy City, Coming Down<br>to the New Earth as God's Tabernacle<br>and as the Bride, the Wife of the Lamb</H2><P>The New Jerusalem, the holy city, will come down to the new earth as God's tabernacle and as the bride, the wife of the Lamb. It will be the ultimate composition of all the redeemed people of God, and in it the saints will reign as kings with God and be supplied by the Triune God as the river of water of life and the tree of life (Rev. 21:2&#151;22:5). As the New Jerusalem, we will enjoy the Triune God, drinking Him and eating Him forever. We will be His royal, kingly family, the co-kings with Christ reigning forever and ever (Rev. 22:5). This is the destiny that God has assigned to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) The Restored Nations Being<br>the People around the New Jerusalem<br>and Being Sustained<br>by the Leaves of the Tree of Life</H2><P>The restored nations will be the people around the New Jerusalem and will be sustained by the leaves of the tree of life (Rev. 21:24-27; 22:2b). The New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth with the restored nations is the end of the seven trumpets, which is also the end of the seventh seal and the end of the book of Revelation.</P><P>Because of the world situation today, I believe that our present study of the prophecy of the four "sevens" in the Bible is timely. Romans 9:27-28 says that the Lord will cut His word short in order to have a quick fulfillment of His prophecy concerning the nation of Israel. The present situation in the Middle East is the Lord cutting His word short so that the prophecies concerning Israel can be fulfilled quickly. As we have seen in the previous messages, the nation of Israel as the fig tree has become tender and put forth its leaves. Now the summer is near (Matt. 24:32). We are not teaching the biblical prophecies to satisfy people's curiosity. We desire to be enlightened by the Word, especially the prophetic word in the Bible. We need to give heed to this prophetic word as to a lamp shining in a dark place (2 Pet. 1:19). Then we will know where we are. The prophetic word will guide us to pass through the dark night until the day of the Lord's appearing dawns and the morning star rises in our hearts.</P>
