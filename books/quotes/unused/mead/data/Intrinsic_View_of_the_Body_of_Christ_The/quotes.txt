[1]  WHO FILLS ALL IN ALL Scripture Reading: Eph 1:3-6, 7-12, 13-14, 18-23 OUTLINE The issue of God the Father's impartation: Of His holy nature into His chosen people that they may be separated from the world and sanctified wholly unto Him Eph 1:4.
[2]  To bring them into Christ as their sphere and element, that they may be made God's inheritance, with the divine element in Christ, as a treasure to God vv.
[3]  The issue of God the Spirit's impartation of the divine essence into God the Father's inheritance redeemed by God the Son: By sealing it God's inheritance that it may be saturated with the divine essence as the impress to be a mark and the image of God to be His expression v. 13.
[4]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You that You are still moving on this earth.
[5]  How we thank You that Your moving is going on among us in Your recovery.
[6]  We remind You that whenever we come together into Your name, there is an oracle ready for You to speak to us.
[7]  In order to see the revelation of the Body of Christ, it is helpful to consider our physical body.
[8]  Now there is such a unique One in the universe who is both God and man.
[9]  Hebrews 9:14 indicates that when He went to the cross to offer Himself to God, He was not alone because the Holy Spirit was with Him to strengthen Him.
[10]  The title of this first chapter says that the Body of Christ is the issue of God's impartation and transmission.
[11]  God the Son redeemed us through His blood v. 7 . If we had not been lost, we would not have needed to be redeemed.
[12]  Thus far, we have seen that the Father's nature is imparted into us, the Father's life is imparted into us, the Son's element is imparted into us, and the Spirit's essence is also imparted into us.
[13]  The essence is finer and more intrinsic than the element.
[14]  In the substance there is the element, and in the element there is the essence.
[15]  Now the Triune God as the substance, as the element, and as the essence are altogether imparted into us, and this imparting is still going on.
[16]  The final section of Ephesians 1 reveals that the church as the Body of Christ is the issue of the transmission of God in His divine trinity into His chosen and redeemed people vv.
[17]  This power was wrought in Christ, making Christ the Head over all things for the transmission of this power to the church, the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.
[18]  AS THE POEM, THE MASTERPIECE, OF GOD Scripture Reading: Eph 2:14-22, 4-10 OUTLINE Created by Christ Eph 2:14-22: In Himself as the sphere and element substantially v. 15.
[19]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You that You have brought us back again by gathering us into Your name.
[20]  God created us without the element of holiness, but He intended to make us holy.
[21]  In order to make us holy, God had to take a second step after the first step of the old creation.
[22]  God had to take a second step to make the new creation out of the old creation.
[23]  Although we are a new creation, much of our being is still in the old creation.
[24]  We still have the "old cocoon" of our old nature.
[25]  This old cocoon comes out many times in what we do.
[26]  In our daily experience, we should not forget our status as sons of God.
[27]  The Body of Christ is the issue of God the Father's impartation of His holy nature and of His divine life into His chosen people.
[28]  In addition to this intrinsic constitution, we also need power.
[29]  I am burdened to point out the intrinsic element and essence of the Body of Christ in the book of Ephesians.
[30]  In chapter one of Ephesians, the Body of Christ is the coming out, the issue, of God's impartation and transmission.
[31]  In chapter two the church as the Body of Christ is the new man v. 15 . For the church as the Body of Christ there is the need of life, but for the new man there is the need of life plus the person.
[32]  No human being works when he is dying, but Christ was different.
[33]  Ephesians 2:14-22 reveals that the new man was created by Christ.
[34]  Ephesians 2 has another part, verses 4-10, which tells us that this new man created by Christ on the cross with Himself as the resurrection element needs a kind of intrinsic constitution.
[35]  When we were the old man, we were dead in our offenses and sins v. 1 , but we were enlivened by God with Christ as life organically vv.
[36]  We were dead in trespasses and sins, so God made us alive together with Christ v. 5 . He raised us up together with Christ and seated us together with Christ in the heavenlies v. 6 . He subjected all things other than Christ under our feet and gave Christ to be the Head over everything for us, making us a part of the Head.
[37]  We may understand this doctrinally, but we need to practice taking Christ as our person.
[38]  When we are going to the department store, we should realize that we are not the person.
[39]  Prayer: Lord, thank You for Your mercy that we could still be here with You.
[40]  Lord, You know that Your presence means everything to us.
[41]  Thus far, we have seen the intrinsic view of the Body of Christ in the first two chapters of Ephesians.
[42]  Under the revelation which we have picked up from these chapters, we all should be clear that the church as the Body of Christ has nothing to do with our natural life, our old man, our flesh, and our self.
[43]  The next evening we were waiting to have dinner together; afterwards, we would go to the meeting hall, which was across the street.
[44]  All of a sudden, we heard someone knocking on the door.
[45]  Now we need to see the intrinsic view of the Body of Christ in Ephesians 3.
[46]  Ephesians 3 says that the unsearchable and unlimited Christ desires to make His home in our hearts.
[47]  Paul prayed for all of us that the Father of all the families would strengthen us with power through His Spirit into our inner man vv.
[48]  When Christ makes His home in our heart, we will be rooted and grounded in love v.
[49]  By that time we will realize that our Christ is really loving.
[50]  WITH THE REGENERATED BELIEVERS AND THE BUILDING OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4-6, 11-16 OUTLINE The constituents of the divine mingling with the believers Eph 4:4-6: God the Father, who is over all, through all, and in all, as the origin, the source v. 6.
[51]  God the Son, who is the Lord and the embodiment of the Father, as the element v. 5.
[52]  God the Spirit, who is the realization of God the Son, as the essence v. 4.
[53]  Prayer: Lord, this morning we ask You to give us a trance that transfers us from the visible circumstances into the invisible scene.
[54]  We want to see something that is invisible to us.
[55]  In herself and by herself, no wife can submit according to the apostle's teaching.
[56]  The apostle's teaching of submission starts from being filled in our spirit Eph 5:18 .
[57]  To be filled in spirit with Christ causes us to overflow with Christ in speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks to God vv.
[58]  Previously, we saw from Ephesians 2 that while the Lord Jesus was being visibly and outwardly crucified on the cross, He was working invisibly.
[59]  IN EPHESIANS 4 The Constituents of the Divine Mingling
[60]  This chapter says that we need to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit v. 3 . Then it continues by saying, "One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all" vv.
[61]  Ephesians 4:4-6 reveals a group of four persons the one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father mingled together as one entity to be the organic Body of Christ.
[62]  There is another portion of Ephesians 4 telling us that the members need to be perfected by the gifts to do the work of the New Testament ministry for the building up of the Body of Christ vv.
[63]  Our old, unscriptural way of meeting was a waste.
[64]  In the old way, a brother comes to the meeting place and sits down to wait for the meeting to begin.
[65]  CHAPTER FIVE THE ONENESS OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 4:2-6, 12-16 OUTLINE The oneness in reality Eph 4:3-6: The oneness of the one Spirit as the essence with: The oneness of the one Body the one place to stay.
[66]  The oneness of the one hope of the believers' calling the one destination to pursue vv.
[67]  The oneness of the one Lord as the element with: The oneness of the one faith the one transfer into Christ.
[68]  Prayer: Lord, we are so happy that we have another time to look unto You for Your speaking.
[69]  It was to this one, later to be called Paul, that the Spirit of truth eventually disclosed many mysterious things.
[70]  Paul said that he received an assignment, a charge, and a burden from God to complete the word of God, the divine revelation Col 1:25 .
[71]  Without his Epistles, we would not be able to fellowship anything concerning the Body of Christ.
[72]  Matthew 16 tells us that one day Jesus asked His disciples, "Who do you say that I am?" v. 15 . Peter responded, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" v. 16 . No doubt, Peter received a heavenly revelation of who Jesus is.
[73]  This revelation of Christ and the church in Matthew 16 is wonderful, but it is not as intrinsic as the revelation of the church as the Body of Christ.
[74]  These verses speak of seven "ones" one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father with one hope, one faith, and one baptism.
[75]  We need to grow up into Christ in the way that we comb our hair.
[76]  For many of us, the way that we comb our hair is not up to the standard of being in Christ as the Head.
[77]  We comb our hair in ourselves, not in Christ.
[78]  Do we believe that it is easy for the Triune God to mingle Himself with us?
[79]  If I want to mingle flour with oil, the flour does not struggle with me.
[80]  Now we come to the oneness of the Body.
[81]  The oneness of the Body is also taught in Ephesians 4.
[82]  If we take the proper, scriptural way, however, we can gain the increase, and we can receive a reward when the Lord comes back.
[83]  If we take the old way and do not bear fruit, the Lord will ask us to give Him an account when He returns.
[84]  THE ONENESS OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:10-13; 3:3-4; 4:6; 11:17, 29-30, 19; 12:24-25; Eph 4:2; Rom 16:17; Titus 3:10; Lev 13:45-46; Num 12:10-15.
[85]  We thank You that You have brought us to this last meeting.
[86]  The Oneness in Reality The Oneness of the One Spirit as the Essence
[87]  Moreover, God the Father stays here, God the Son stays here, and God the Spirit stays here.
[88]  The Oneness of the One Father as the Source
[89]  He showed us that God the Father is the source of our oneness, the Lord is the element of our oneness, and the Spirit is the essence of our oneness.
[90]  There are also those from within who may be considered as "indoor barking dogs."
[91]  One of them may ask you where you meet.
[92]  The oneness in practicality is first the oneness of the faith.
[93]  The oneness in practicality is not only the oneness of the faith but also the oneness of the full knowledge of the Son of God the full apprehension of the unlimited Christ Eph 4:13 .
[94]  To fully arrive at the oneness in practicality, we need to be perfected by the gifts unto the work of the New Testament ministry for the building up of the Body of Christ v. 12 . Then we will grow from babyhood to a full-grown man, no longer being tossed by the waves, the turmoils, and no longer being carried about by every wind of teaching, doctrine v. 14 . To arrive at the oneness in practicality, we need to hold to truth in love to grow up in all things into the Head, Christ v. 15 . Eventually, we will be a full-grown man with the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, the Body of Christ v. 13 . We will be built in the Body of Christ by being joined together through every joint of the rich supply of Christ and by being knit together through the operation in the measure of each one part of the Body v. 16 . This is the best and most effective way to keep the oneness of the Body vv.
[95]  First Corinthians 1:10 says that there were divisions among the Corinthians.
[96]  Parties of division manifest those in the church life who are approved 1 Cor 11:19 .
[97]  We must always remember that there is no way for the members of the Body of Christ to be legitimately divided in the Body of Christ.
[98]  None of us should make an issue over the practice of the new way versus the old way, because these ways are not our faith.
[99]  Surely there is nothing wrong with preaching the gospel by visiting and contacting people.
