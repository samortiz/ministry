   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPECIAL GRACE AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RESERVE GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question:What is the cause of poverty in the life of a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How can a Christian have a reserve before God?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Answer:In Revelation 3 the Lord said, "You are...poor" v. 17 . These words were addressed by Him to the church in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This poverty implies that nothing had been laid up in store.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It implies not merely a momentary lack but a continuous lack.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many brothers and sisters have a fundamental problem: They are maintained by the experience of special grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a serious problem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are dependent on temporary supplies of grace; they do not have the revelation which they saw "thirteen years ago."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have said before that God's work in our lives is wholly a work of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If He removed His grace from us, our lives would be an utter void.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a fact which we need to recognize.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, it is also a fact that God does not want to see His children to be devoid of any deposit of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He does not want them to be dependent on interventions of special grace in order to be kept in His will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not well-pleasing to Him if His children live from hand to mouth on special grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He desires us to have a rich deposit of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many people have no such deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Consequently, the Lord told us to fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Matthew 17:21 the Lord said that some demons could only be cast out by prayer and fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He told the disciples that they needed to have special prayer and fasting, without which they would not have the needed power.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christians whose loins are not girded, who are unrestrained, and whose spirits are wild have no choice but to live by special dispensations of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we have just come to the Lord, it is understandable if we live by special grace; but if we are still dependent on such grace after we have believed in the Lord for a year or two, this indicates a state of poverty and sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This poverty is the result of living by special grace without having any extra or reserve grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is wealth?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Wealth is the reverse of poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Being spiritually wealthy means to have a reserve of grace before God and not to rely on special grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Poverty is banished by the surplus of grace within.</S>
