   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PRAISE OF THE RETURNED CAPTIVES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THEIR GOING UP TO ZION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>CONCERNING THE GREAT THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>WHICH JEHOVAH HAD DONE FOR THEM</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psalm 126 is the praise of the returned captives in their going up to Zion concerning the great things which Jehovah had done for them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. They Being like Dreamers Filled</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Joyfully with Laughter in Their Mouth</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>and with a Ringing Shout in Their Tongue</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The psalmist said that when Jehovah turned the captivity of Zion, they were like those who dream.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Their mouth was filled with laughter and their tongue with a ringing shout vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1-2a .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"At that time they said among the nations,/Jehovah has done great things for them./Jehovah has done great things for us;/We are joyful" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2b-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. Asking Jehovah to Turn Again Their Captivity</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Turn again, O Jehovah, our captivity/Like the streams in the south" v. 4 . Although some of the people had returned, many remained in captivity, and here the psalmist prayed for them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In his prayer the psalmist asked Jehovah to turn again their captivity like the streams in the south.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In contrast to the streams in the north, which may be frozen, the streams in the south are flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Those who sow in tears / Will reap with a ringing shout.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>/He who goes forth and weeps, / Bearing seed for scattering, /Will no doubt come in with a ringing shout,/Bearing his sheaves with him" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe that this refers to the captives.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In a human sense, their captivity in foreign countries was a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In a divine sense, however, it was a sowing through their preaching to the Gentiles concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Apparently, God's people were captives; actually, they were preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many of the captives, such as Daniel and his companions, were excellent preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Their preaching was a sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a result, a number of Gentiles were brought to God through these captives.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, Nebuchadnezzar had to admit to Daniel and his companions that their God was the true God Dan 2:47; 3:28-29; 4:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that the captives sowed the seed of the knowledge of God among the heathen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 5 of Psalm 126 speaks of reaping with a ringing shout, and verse 6, of coming in with a ringing shout.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A ringing shout is a shout of joy, a joyful noise.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whereas the captives sowed in tears, they returned with a ringing shout, bearing their "sheaves" with them.</S>
