Does this indicate that your sin is not forgiven? Or that the blood of Christ does not work? Or that something further is needed? You must answer, &ldquo;Absolutely not!&rdquo;</p><p>Where, then, do these bad feelings come from after you have confessed and applied the blood? Their source is God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan. To understand this we must see who Satan is and what he does.</p><p>Satan is the &ldquo;devil,&rdquo; which in the original language of the Bible means &ldquo;accuser.&rdquo; So Revelation 12:10 refers to him as &ldquo;the accuser of our brothers,...who accuses them before our God day and night.&rdquo; Satan, God&rsquo;s enemy, spends most of his time day and night accusing God&rsquo;s people. This is his job. Of course, God did not ask him to do this. Rather, he has taken it upon himself to accuse God&rsquo;s people incessantly.</p><p>This is revealed in the story of Job. Job was a righteous man, and feared God (Job 1:1). Yet it is recorded that Satan appeared before God to accuse Job before Him. He said, &ldquo;Does Job fear God without cause?...You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions are spread throughout the land. But stretch forth Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face&rdquo; (Job 1:9-11). In other words, Satan accused Job of only fearing God because God had blessed him. Satan claimed that God bribed Job and that if God took away all Job&rsquo;s riches, Job would curse God. This illustrates Satan&rsquo;s accusing in the spiritual realm.</p><p>In the book of Zechariah, the high priest, Joshua, stood before God and Satan stood at his right hand &ldquo;to be his adversary&rdquo; (3:1). Joshua was &ldquo;clothed with filthy garments&rdquo; (v. 3). This speaks of his poor, sinful condition. How often your poor condition gives Satan the opportunity to accuse you. This implies that Satan is not only God&rsquo;s enemy, but he is your enemy as well. Whenever you come to God, Satan resists your coming by accusing you.</p><p>Nothing cripples a Christian spiritually more than accusation. Whenever you listen to Satan&rsquo;s accusation, you are powerless. It is as if all the strength is drained from your spirit. A Christian under accusation finds it hard to fellowship with others and even harder to pray. He feels as though he cannot approach God.</p><p>This is the enemy&rsquo;s subtlety. He never appears in a red suit with a pitchfork crying, &ldquo;I am the devil! Now I am going to condemn you!&rdquo; He is more clever than that. He accuses you inwardly and even tricks you into thinking that his accusations are God&rsquo;s speaking.</p><p>How can you distinguish between God&rsquo;s true enlightening in your conscience and Satan&rsquo;s accusation? Sometimes it is difficult, but there are three ways:</p><p>First, God&rsquo;s light supplies you, whereas Satan&rsquo;s accusation drains you. When God speaks concerning your sins, you may feel very exposed and wounded. Nevertheless, you are also supplied and encouraged to draw close to God and apply the precious blood of Christ. Satan&rsquo;s accusations, on the other hand, are totally negative. The more you listen, the harder it is to pray. You feel empty and discouraged.</p><p>Second, God&rsquo;s speaking is always specific, whereas Satan&rsquo;s condemnation is quite often (though not always) general. Sometimes you may be tricked into thinking that you are just tired, or that you have had a rough day. Other times, you may just have a general impression that you are not right with God. But when you search your conscience, you find no specific sin that would cause you to be separated from God. Or you may wake up with a general feeling of depression or a feeling of uneasiness toward God. All these general feelings of condemnation that have no apparent source in sin are of Satan and should be rejected. When God speaks, He is specific and positive. But when Satan speaks, he is often general and negative.</p><p>Third, any uneasy feeling which remains after you confess and claim the blood is of Satan. There is never a need to confess and claim the blood again. God&rsquo;s demand is at once satisfied by the blood. But Satan is never satisfied. He would like to see you confess again and again. Proverbs 27:15 says, &ldquo;A continual dripping on a very rainy day / And a contentious woman are alike.&rdquo; Satan&rsquo;s accusations are like that&mdash;like a dripping faucet, or like a nagging wife&mdash;they will not let you go to sleep. But God&rsquo;s speaking is different. When you confess and claim the cleansing of the blood, God is instantly satisfied. Any further voice is Satan&rsquo;s.</p><p>If you confess your sin and claim the precious blood, yet some uneasiness continues to tug at you within, you should stop praying immediately. Do not confess anymore. Rather, turn to the source of the accusation and say something like this: &ldquo;Satan, I have confessed my sin to God. He has forgiven my sin, and the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed me from it. This uneasiness that I sense right now is not from God; it is from you, and I reject it! Satan, now you must look at the blood of Christ. That blood answers every one of your accusations.&rdquo; Try speaking to Satan in this way. When you use the blood in this way, Satan is defeated and he knows it. Revelation 12:10-11 says, &ldquo;The accuser of our brothers has been cast down....And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony.&rdquo; The word of your testimony is just your declaration that the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed you from every sin and that this blood has defeated Satan. When you speak boldly in this way, Satan&rsquo;s accusations are overcome.</p><p>The Christian life is a kind of warfare. Satan, &ldquo;your adversary...as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking someone to devour&rdquo; (1 Pet. 5:8). For this warfare, you need the proper weapons. One important weapon which you must utilize is the blood of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">A DAILY LIFE<br />FULL OF GOD&rsquo;S PRESENCE</h2><p>By the power of the precious blood of Christ, it is possible for a Christian to live moment by moment in God&rsquo;s presence. Whenever any little sin would come to frustrate your fellowship with God, you may instantly confess and claim the Lord&rsquo;s prevailing blood. Immediately the fellowship is restored. Why should you waste time? The blood of Christ is available moment by moment, day after day. You can never exhaust the cleansing power of the blood of Christ. His blood is not only able to cleanse every past sin, but also every sin that you could ever commit.</p><p>By the power of the precious blood of Christ, you may enjoy a conscience free from the stain of guilt. Because of this, you can come boldly to God. &ldquo;Let us come forward...with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience&rdquo; (Heb. 10:22). By the blood of Christ, your conscience can be free from guilt. Like a freshly washed window, it can be clear, bright, and full of light.</p><p>Finally, by the power of the precious blood of Christ, you can overcome every accusation of Satan. Though his accusations may be strong, the blood of Christ is stronger. It answers them, every one. This blood is your weapon. With this weapon you could never be defeated by Satan; rather, he will be defeated by you.</p><p>How dear and how precious is the blood of Christ! By this blood you can live in God&rsquo;s presence day after day.</p><p class="indent1"><em>&ldquo;If we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.&rdquo;</em></p><p class="indent1" style="text-align:right"><em>(1 John 1:7)</em></p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>The Precious Blood of Christ &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
