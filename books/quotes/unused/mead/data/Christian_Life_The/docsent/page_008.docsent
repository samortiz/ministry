   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE CONTENTS Scripture Reading: John 14:6-20; Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14; Acts 16:7; Phil 1:19b; Heb 9:26, 28; Rom 6:6; Gal 5:24; Heb 2:14; John 12:31; Eph 2:15; Col 1:20; John 12:24; Acts 13:33; 1 Pet 1:3; 1 Cor 15:45b; Eph 1:20-21; Exo 30:22-31; John 7:39; 2 Cor 3:17; Gal 3:14; Rev 2:7; 22:17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the first message, we fellowshipped concerning the definition of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We saw that the Christian life is the life in which the believers of Christ live Christ and magnify Him Phil 1:20b-21a .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is also the life in which the Christians live Christ and magnify Him corporately in their locality as a local church to be a local expression of Christ as a part of the universal Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Christ whom the believers are living and magnifying is the center of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why do we say that Christ is the center of the Divine Trinity?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is the center, on the one hand, to express the Father, and on the other hand, to be realized as the Spirit John 14:6-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These two phrases to express the Father and to be realized as the Spirit are short, but they are crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To arrive at the second phrase, to be realized as the Spirit, took me probably more than fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was not until these past fifteen years of my ministry that I began to use this phrase.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The phrase to express the Father was used not only by us but also by others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many fundamental theologians would agree that Christ the Son is the expression of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But to say that Christ the Son is realized as the Spirit brings us into a big war.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some have said that this is heresy, but this is the truth revealed in the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This truth is very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To say that the Second of the Divine Trinity is realized as the Third is the ultimate understanding of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this message we want to see the contents of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The contents of the Christian life is not a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To know the contents of the Christian life, we have to know the sixty-six books of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now I would like to ask, "What is the content of the Christian life?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The content of the Christian life is the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I want to help us realize this in a very simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first verse of the Bible says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth" Gen 1:1 ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The last verse of the Bible says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Amen" Rev 22:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible is one book.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It begins with God, and it ends with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Are God and the Lord Jesus two or one?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you say they are two, this is not logical.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can a book start with God and end with another person?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible as the content of the Christian life is the autobiography of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Triune God has written a record of His own history, which we should call the autobiography of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Who is God?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is God?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What has God done, what is He doing, and what will He do?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Where was God, where is God, and where will God be?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is only one autobiography which speaks of God, and this autobiography is the content of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, the content of the Christian life is altogether not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When I was very young, I read the Old Testament, including the minor prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But I did not spend much time to study these minor prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the upcoming summer training of 1992, we will have a life-study of these minor prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are twelve minor prophets, but we will cover eleven of them since we have already covered Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Recently, I was working on the outlines for Hosea.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hosea is a very difficult book to read.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Most of his writing is in poetic form.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verses 4 through 7 of Hosea 7 speak of the symbols of an oven and a baker.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These symbols are particularly difficult to understand and interpret.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am sharing this so that we can realize that the Bible is altogether not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is too high, too deep, and too profound.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible is an autobiography, not a history.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not a compiled book of theological doctrines and teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible is an autobiography of a wonderful person the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This wonderful person comprises many things.</S>
