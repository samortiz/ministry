Concerning the new way, the God-ordained way, this matter has been missed and much neglected by the Lord's children
God wants us to serve Him, but in the New Testament no one is allowed to serve God according to his own concept
We may help the young believers, but the way we do it may not be that fresh, like the fresh dew early in the morning
As one of God's priests, could you not bring one person to the Lord in one year, three hundred sixty-five days?
In the past one hundred fifty years, two heretical groups have been the most successful in increasing their numbers
Even if you could get only one person in one year, although it seems slow, it is much better than doing nothing
Our problem is, first, we do not realize that we are priests of the gospel, and second, we do not persevere in our practice
Some may say, 'Peter spoke once on the day of Pentecost and three thousand were saved, and then a few days later, five thousand were added'
God did not say that if a woman would be faithful and believe in Him, one day He would suddenly give her three thousand children
Every year we should bring forth one or two spiritual children that we may present them to the Lord as a present, an offering, a sacrifice
In Luke 14 the Lord says, 'Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled'
According to the New Testament, we first have to see that we are priests of the gospel and that we need to offer some sacrifices to God
If you have the patience and faith, surely at least one of them will be brought to the Lord and will be brought into the church life
They liked 'perfect persons,' so they did not have the patience and faith that they could eventually bring people to the Lord
We must practice this by endeavoring with endurance, with longsuffering, with patience, with love, with care, and with faith
We have the pure gospel, the highest gospel, yet we do not have the increase because we do not go out to get it with patience and faith
Sometimes we brought someone to the Lord, but after two months they died prematurely because they received no care
Most students and teachers of this Gospel concentrate their teaching and fellowship directly on the matter of life
When we look at the situation today, among the believers who are not pastors and preachers, who is doing this kind of feeding work?
By all that we have talked about above, we can see that both Christianity and we ourselves are not practicing these four steps
Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as the prophesying for the building up of the church, the Body of Christ, as an organism
He said, 'I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice'
We must learn how to look unto the Lord, how to trust in Him, and how to receive His death and put His death into our daily experience
If they would practice to exercise their spirit to touch the Holy Spirit, eventually it would be easy for them to prophesy
Regardless of how long we have been serving in the Lord's recovery, we may not have rendered much building up to the Body of Christ
Our service must be: in the Body, in our spirit and by the Holy Spirit, by life, and for the building up of the Body of Christ
In this message we shall consider the exercise and practice of the gospel preaching according to God's ordained way
The first thing we need to practice in the God-ordained way for the New Testament service is the preaching of the gospel
Before the Lord Jesus came, John the Baptist's work was not only to baptize people but also to preach the gospel
Luke 8:1 says that the Lord 'journeyed from city to city and village to village, proclaiming and bringing good news of the kingdom of God'
Even this was not adequate, so He sent out seventy to visit every city and place where He Himself was about to come
The goal of the gospel is not only to save sinners, to win souls, but also to obtain materials for the building up of the Body of Christ
My burden is for us to see the urgent need for all of us to be in the exercise and practice of preaching the gospel in the God-ordained way
Whether or not we have been cut off is determined by whether we have the real enjoyment of the riches of Christ
Without exception, as long as Christians are occupied with fighting and debating, the result will be barrenness
Even though they feel they are fighting for the Lord and defending the truth, the issue of their fighting is that there is no fruit
Our first burden in this training is that every trainee would be burdened to go to visit people in order to preach the gospel to them
We should go first to our 'Jerusalem,' which means we have to go to our close relatives-our parents, uncles, aunts, cousins, in-laws, etc
Luke 14 says we should 'go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city' , and then 'go out into the roads and hedges'
Before we were saved, we were not willing to seek after the Lord; we had to be compelled, forced, to receive His salvation
Only the Lord knows who the tares and the wheat are , and the Lord did not tell us to try to discern the difference between them
As members of the church, our first responsibility is to rise up and exercise to go out and preach the gospel in the new way
If you are a gospel preaching elder, the church in which you bear the responsibility will be a gospel preaching church
At that time He had only a handful of people with Him, mainly only twelve; so it was right for Him to call them a 'little flock'
In southern California alone, there are twenty-five churches, but each church has only a small number of saints
They have done this because they realize that the way they have been preaching the gospel has not been working so well
Although some improvements have been made, our way has been and still is in the same category as that of Christianity's
My burden is that we would all wake up and rise up to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel to gain people for God's kingdom
No one can condemn the preaching of the gospel by the New Testament priests of the gospel going to visit people in their homes
That was in the way which is really old, and this is in the way that is revealed in the Scriptures as God has ordained
Even the term the New Testament priests of the gospel is new to us, although it is clearly mentioned in Romans 15:16
The last step of the God-ordained way is to prophesy for the building up of the church as revealed in 1 Corinthians 14
Many still consider that to prophesy is merely to predict, but 1 Corinthians 14 does not refer to this kind of prophesying
In a hot and dry place like southern California, you cannot water your flowers or your lawn only once or twice within one or two months
The Jehovah's Witnesses put out some statistics for the twelve countries in which they gained the most people in 1987 and 1988
That may seem too poor, but if every member in a church brings one new one into the church life in a year, the church is doubled
In Luke 14, the Lord told us that when there were still vacancies in His salvation, He sent out His slaves to get people to fill His house
If we baptize a number and still do not bring one into the church life, we must exercise the Lord's persistence, patience, and faith
If each saint gains one new one every three years, the church will have a thirty-three percent increase yearly
According to my study, no church on this earth has ever increased consistently by thirty-three percent for many years
We will surely bring some into the church life, and many others will also believe and be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus
The first definite step needed for practicing the New Testament priesthood of the gospel depends on the eldership
Because of our determination, we have to consecrate ourselves, to present our bodies as living sacrifices to God
The best way to exercise and to practice is to preach the gospel to our close relatives-to our parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc
A number of years ago, a certain saint was dying and was full of regret for not having brought anyone to the Lord
The preaching of the good news is the very propagation of Christ Himself in His person and in His wonderful redemptive work
As long as we preach Him through the power of the Holy Spirit, such propagation should not be opposed or criticized
He has never charged His angels to do this because the preaching of the gospel is fully based upon the principle of incarnation
Without the mingling of God with man, without the incarnation of the divine person with the human person, God cannot accomplish His purpose
We need to preach the gospel whether the opportunity is convenient or inconvenient and whether we are welcome or unwelcome
Because of this their attendance at the Lord's table, which was three thousand five years ago, has now become five thousand
If we have seen the need for us to preach the gospel, and we are burdened, we should pray and fellowship with some who are close to us
If we decide to wait for others, heaven and earth may pass away before they pick up the burden to preach the gospel
If we all gain only one within three years, the church where we are will have a thirty-three percent yearly increase
If we give the Lord two of our evenings each week for visiting people, we will still have five evenings for other matters
Within a certain period of time, perhaps two or three weeks or even two months, we will see two or three baptized
From the very beginning of the Lord's recovery in mainland China, Brother Nee did much preaching of the gospel
We printed gospel posters with big characters and posted them at the railway station the bus stops the crossways and all the crucial places
The next day, Monday evening, the saints came together, and we classified the records of the names according to their streets
After many years of experience and study of the Bible, we have found that this is the most economical and effective way for gospel preaching
In the same way, we must give ourselves to be trained in how to talk with people and how to bring people to the Lord
It is very helpful to try your best to make an appointment with certain ones whom you are going to visit through others who know them
We were cautious in bringing the new ones to the church meetings in Taipei at first because the church meetings had become old
If you baptize one and only go to his home for a few weeks, it becomes more difficult to bring him to the meetings of the church
If you go out today and one gets baptized, you should suggest to him that tomorrow you will bring him to a meeting of the church
It is good to have some tracts or other literature to leave with them which have the address of the church meeting hall
After bringing someone to the Lord and baptizing him into the Triune God, we should begin to have home meetings with him right away
After gaining some for the Lord, it is good for us to testify of some of the good cases in the church meetings in order to encourage others
If we will speak for one or two minutes, others will also have time to testify, and more saints will be convinced by many testimonies
To bear fruit we first need to be clear that if we have been saved by the Lord, we have also been charged by the Lord
He has given each of us some talents as capital with which to do business for Him, and He requires that we make a profit
The first thing the Master wants us, His slaves, to do is to invest the talent or capital He has given us, that is, to do business for Him
Inwardly they may say: 'Christ told us He was coming quickly, but nearly two thousand years have passed and He is not here yet'
Many Christians love John 15 because it teaches us how to abide in the vine, how to enjoy the riches of Christ
He has appointed us for three things: first, we should go forth; second, we should bear fruit; and third, our fruit should remain
One day, when we stand before the judgment seat of Christ, we will have to give an account of what we have done
If we have not been faithful, we will have to tell the Lord why we did not bear fruit, and the Lord will rebuke us
He may even remind us of this message concerning John 15:16 and ask why we would not take His charge to bear fruit
If we see that we have been charged by the Lord, we will have a heart to carry out a successful contact with the sinners
If they have seen that they have been charged by the Lord, their hearts will not be fully occupied with their households
Every time we go out to preach the gospel, we should first practice speaking Christ for at least ten minutes in our home
If we practice speaking Christ all the time, it will become easier for us, and we will become rich in speaking Christ
Regardless of how the unbelievers respond to us, we will be able to speak Christ to them in a particular way that they may be saved
Now that we have been charged by our Master to go forth and bear fruit, we need all these items as our preparation
The other way to practice is to go to your close relatives and speak Christ to them by the Spirit under the Lord's leading
According to our study, it is best to have a team of three with two brothers and one sister or one brother and two sisters
When we go out to preach the gospel, we must first learn how to knock on a door or ring a doorbell in a proper way
If we go to a sinner and ring the doorbell in a wild way, this may offend him, and he may not open the door to us
We should not be too polite or humble but frank and honest with one another, and we should not be offended by the other team members
To use this booklet, we must become very familiar with its contents, and we should not follow it legally or read every word
In a living way, in a striking way, in an attracting way, we should present the points to them from this booklet
To them, whether they go to heaven or hell, whether they are baptized or not, whether they believe Buddha or Jesus, it is all about the same
If each of us baptize only three, we can spend all our energy to raise up these three children in a proper way
Through our experiences we have learned that to bring people to Christ is not as hard as to bring the saved ones into the church life
If we went out about once a week, maybe for only forty-five weeks in one year, we could easily baptize twenty to thirty
Although our discernment is not always accurate, in principle, we have to exercise our discernment regarding these two or three
If we can bring only two out of thirty baptized ones into the church life within a year, that will really be marvelous
If we take this fellowship and put it into practice by teams, each team can baptize about thirty people within one year
In Philippians 4 Paul says, 'The things which you have also learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things'
Because Paul was a person absolutely for God, he not only received the vision, but he also practiced what he saw
He trained Timothy, saying, 'I write to you that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God'
Eventually, the Lord will gain a people through whom He will be able to fulfill His New Testament economy to build up His own Body
There may be as many as one hundred twenty million Christians in the United States and many Christian broadcasts are sent over the air waves
They do not realize that the Father does not want us just to do good things or just to express Him in Christian ethical duties
Our preaching the gospel is to bear fruit, to bring forth Christ into people, making them Christ's fruit, Christ's expression
If we keep the Lord's commandments, we will abide in His love , we will bear fruit , and the Father will be glorified
To be branches of the divine vine and to bear fruit to express the divine life is a matter of joy-a joyful life
Some Christians are preaching the gospel, but their preaching is mostly being carried out in an old, traditional way
His word to us is that we should abide in Him that we may bring forth fruit that He may be expressed and enlarged
Many Americans need to work only eight hours a day, leaving at least two to three hours in the evening free for them to do other things
Seeing how much free time we have, could we not separate just two or three hours during two of these days each week?
If we live a regular life and budget our time, we can easily separate two periods of two or three hours each for fruit-bearing
From our closest relatives the circle of our gospel preaching can be enlarged to Judea to Samaria and then to the remotest part of the earth
It may be that you will not have the way to go out to bring additional new ones to the Lord for a period of time
You should not drop them, but you have to consider whether or not it is profitable to spend so much time with them
If we practice this way year round, surely we can bring at least one promising one into the church life each year
If we really give ourselves for this, it may be that each of us can bring three persons into the church life each year
After gaining people we must spend adequate time to nourish, to cherish, and to raise them up as our spiritual children
Additionally, we should attend the Lord's Day morning meeting, the prayer meeting, and other meetings of the church
If you come together as a team, you will find the best way to get people to open to you and the best way to answer their questions
Let these onethird make up their mind and pick up the burden to practice this new way as their duty as a part of their daily Christian life
If in every church one-third can be raised up in this way, there will be a real revival among us after only one year's time
If two-thirds of the saints can be raised up in this way, we will see at least one hundred percent increase yearly
We must go to them again and again to have home meetings with them and to nourish them, to cherish them, and to feed them
Our service to the Lord in the New Testament includes preaching the gospel and meeting regularly for the fulfillment of God's purpose
The first step is the preaching by the New Testament priests of the gospel to save sinners for God's satisfaction
Corinthians 14:26 reveals that when the church comes together, each one has something of the Lord to share with others
He said that the Lord's Day message meeting in which one person speaks and the rest listen is according to 'the customs of the nations'
They liked the message meetings because they were all nourished by the messages that were given Lord's Day after Lord's Day
The God-ordained way to preach the gospel is by every believer going to visit people to preach the gospel to them personally and directly
To visit people for the gospel preaching is not merely to knock on doors; it is to reach people where they are
You could say: 'Because you have prayed to the Lord Jesus and have believed in Him, you are now qualified to be baptized
To rigidly practice this kind of 'turning to the left' in the United States may not work so well because the situation is quite different
Although your grandfather loves you, he may not listen to you, so you should take some mature brothers with you
Surely they will go to the heavens, but in the heavens the Lord will ask, 'How much fruit have you borne for Me'?
If we have not gained a profit for the Lord, He will say, 'Cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness'
If within fifty-two weeks they still could not gain one, they should not worry; the Lord is teaching them patience
If every saint could get one person saved within three years, this would produce a thirty-three percent increase each year
They may like to have their children go to her home, and she can open a small childrens' meeting class with about five children
The Lord may tell you to just go out and stand in front of your house every day from five to six in the afternoon
The Jehovah's Witnesses and the Mormons do not have the way to make many appointments because they have a bad name
It may be good to have a card printed with your name, address, phone number, and something to indicate that you are a real Christian
At such an opportunity, you can hand the salesman your card and say, 'I would like to talk with you about Christ for only a few minutes'
After you purchase these socks, you may say: 'Sir, my intention is not to buy the socks; it is to preach Christ to you
If we are faithful to the Lord every week, we have to believe that we will bring at least two to the Lord every year
One brother told us that he visited an upper-middle-class community, and no one would open their door because no one knew him
Many of the residents saw him quite often in that neighborhood, and eventually someone talked to him and opened to him
If you can get one person to invite you into his home, after two or three weeks, some others may also be open to you
To visit and talk to people is much easier on the streets and in the lanes of the city than on the roads, the highways
If we do not bear fruit, the Lord will cut us off from His enjoyment, and He will judge and punish us at His coming
In considering the exercise and practice of the God-ordained way to preach the gospel, we must include the unit of God's salvation
The blood of the Passover lamb was put on the doorposts and the lintel of the house in which they were instead of upon any individual
If we do not take care of the household as the unit of God's salvation, we are violating the principle of God's economy
The unit of God's salvation being a household is according to the truth; therefore, we must stand for this truth
We must realize that we are being sent out by the Lord to reach households, the entire unit of God's salvation
If we pay attention only to individuals rather than households in preaching the gospel, our God may be offended
Isaiah 53:2 says, 'He hath no comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him'
God's ordained way of preaching the gospel is primarily concentrated on our going forth to visit people where they are
To preach the gospel by going out to visit people's homes in order to reach households is according to the truth of the Scriptures
Since my ministry began in this country in 1962, over eleven hundred churches have been raised up on the earth
If we are to continue in the God-ordained way, we all have to know the truth, and we have to take the way of the truth
Today the people in Taipei regard the saints highly and are quite open to the saints' visiting their homes to preach the gospel of Christ
Over a period of time, this kind of positive relationship should be built up in the neighborhoods of the cities in the United States
Through His death and in His resurrection, He was glorified; and in the Son's glorification, the Father was also glorified
In His death and resurrection, He bore much fruit; He brought forth His disciples as His many brothers to express and glorify the Father
In the second half of the year, after going out for four and a half months and gaining no one, we may feel hopeless and give up
According to Christian history, there has never been a church that has had a thirty-three percent increase every year
If we will go out just once a week for only forty-four weeks a year for three full years, we could gain six as remaining fruit
If fifty are stirred up, they may baptize over five hundred and bring at least one hundred into the church life as remaining fruit
They must go there to knock on doors to get people saved and baptized, but without an expectation that they will get a large number baptized
Because the trainees go out at least three times a week, they can gain at least eight in their new city in sixteen weeks
Not long after the day of Pentecost, persecution came upon the thousands of believers in Jerusalem and scattered them
If we practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, the church will be like a vine continually propagating on the earth
While we are practicing we will learn how to discern people how to say the right things and how to prepare the way to gain the whole family
In your wording in your expression and even in your tone of voice you must learn to express gravity and dignity to win peoples confidence
Simply labor consistently and persistently, and while you are laboring, exercise your wisdom concerning how to labor
If the Lord can get one-third of the saints to practice the priesthood of the gospel, the results will be marvelous
After five years, the practice of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel will become prevailing on the earth
If we do not take proper care of such children, their parents may become offended with us and reject the gospel of Christ
We may be talking to a young adult in the family, yet we may affect an older adult in the same family by our actions
Many of us have been reared in America and have been influenced by the atmosphere of looseness which is so common in this country
Many who have been saved and are the lovers of the Lord Jesus have been influenced by the present way of living
If that household has a young one, such a song will attract the young one and soften the hearts of the father and mother
If we ignore the smallest member of the family we will probably offend and hurt the parents feelings making them unable to receive our words
The disciples tried to rebuke the people, but the Lord received the children, took them into His arms, and blessed them
Many Christians today aspire to be like the angels, but the Lord Jesus is not interested in our becoming like angels
We must not forget that in our going out to preach the gospel, we are going not only for individuals but for families
To reach them, Hudson Taylor adopted their way of dress, even to the extent of wearing the Chinese 'pigtail' hairstyle
If we would be so human as to stay for one night in someone's home, this may open that whole household to the gospel of Christ
As we are carrying out this biblical way, we must realize that this is according to the pattern the Lord Jesus set up
If we will learn to be human in all our actions, we will become so available to all the people whom we contact
In verse 8 the Lord says, 'In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit, and you shall become My disciples'
We need to consider how to carry out these three things: to go forth, to bear fruit, and to assure that our fruit remains
We intend to feed them, to have home meetings with them, to have small group meetings with them, and to bring them into the church life
To bring them to the small group meetings is difficult, and to bring them into the church life as remaining fruit is even more difficult
In John 15, following abiding, that is, following the enjoyment of Christ, there is the matter of fruit-bearing
Now we must consider the remaining portion of verse 16: 'That whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you'
Even if we would go forth and bear fruit, and even if we were able to labor much to keep the fruit, our fruit still might not remain
We have learned from church history and it is confirmed by the Bible that to preach the gospel effectively we must go where the people are
In the mid-1970s, we had more than one thousand saints meeting in Orange County, but today the number is much less
Christianity has tested this old way throughout the centuries, and they now agree that their way does not work
Today the population might be over two hundred forty million, and only one hundred twenty million may be Christians
It is not that this biblical way, the God-ordained way, does not work; it is that we are not faithful to this way
To spread the kingdom of God on this earth to propagate Christ in the human race to preach His good news to save sinners is a crucial matter
In our full-time training, we give lessons on items such as the all-inclusive Christ, the church, and the basic truths of the Bible
We do not know what kind of person we will face, and we do not know what kind of knowledge we will need to convince that particular person
Moody testified that after this small disturbance, he could not bring that lady back to the point of receiving the Lord
When we go to visit people, we must be on the alert, yet we should not let them know we are so serious since that might threaten them
We must learn the ways of preaching the gospel with all the detailed points in order to deal with every situation
To go to visit sinners in order to preach your dear and precious Savior to them is altogether a matter in the spirit
Out of these, probably four to six will remain, yet not all of the remaining fruit will be brought to the church
If the Lord stirs up one-third of the saints to preach the gospel, He will gain a good percentage of increase every year
If we are asked a question, we should restrict our answer to the point at hand, thus leaving no side issue to be raised by the person
It is better to speak a few words that are directly to the point to bring the person to the proper destination
If you are presented with a question which you cannot answer so well right away, you should still do your best to give an answer
From there, you must enter through the door and begin to consider, day and night, how to carry out your scientific research
If we are going to speak to someone whom we have known for several years we can exercise to speak to him as though we do not know him at all
If we know the person so well, and he realizes that he is a proud person, he may not want us to bring up such a subject
A strong reason that we are not always effective in preaching the gospel to our relatives is because we know them so well
You cannot simply go to all the people that you visit and tell them that you would like to speak with them about the mystery of human life
When such a custom has been built up, it will be easy for all the brothers and sisters in the Lord's recovery to bear fruit
One brother related an experience of going with some other brothers to visit a man who had come from mainland China
When they brought out the booklet The Mystery of Human Life, he became very defensive, saying that he was an atheist
He believed absolutely in communism, and he did not want them to say anything about religion and things of that nature
The brothers began to wonder if it was really worthwhile to go back to see him again since he told them that he was an atheist
When a baby is crying, the mother would not rebuke or spank it; the more the baby cries, the more gentle the mother would be
While the newly baptized one is changing, we must learn how to exercise in such a way that our whole being would express a contagious joy
Others are like preachers, theological school graduates, always presenting one portion from the Bible after another to instruct them
If you were in a home talking with a man and his young, four-year-old son comes into the room, what would you do?
While this one is still changing clothes perhaps one of the three a young sister would begin to sing a song concerning the joy of salvation
To sing a hymn or a song is often the best way to begin, but you have to sing the right song, and you have to sing it with the right voice
You can practice by speaking and singing to yourselves at home, and you can also practice every time you are with the new ones
To preach the gospel and to gain people by contacting them in a way that will make them happy require much learning
It is not so simple, but if we have a good preparation, it will be easy to talk to this person on the 'right track'
Immediately after baptism, some may touch the subjective experience, telling the new one that he has a human spirit
After we have prepared the situation, the atmosphere, we must exercise to tell this new one about God, the Savior, Jesus Christ
In our talk about God, we may also tell him, 'If you go to Buddha, you will find out that this Buddha cannot solve your inward problems'
We may continue: 'There is only One who can satisfy us, solving our problems, dispelling our doubts, and answering the questions within us
Another way to speak to him concerning God which is also from the inner feeling, yet from another angle, is to talk about the conscience
After our talk has induced a new one to speak a number of sentences, we may realize that he is a person who takes care of his conscience
We should always limit ourselves to one talk per visit, and in this talk, we should thoroughly cover one matter
At another time when the situation is right, we will be able to talk with him about forgiveness in a thorough way
Even if we teach the Bible, it should be done as part of our practical dialogue with the person who is listening
Some do not believe that people can be saved within just a few minutes, but it all depends upon how you present the gospel
God means business with us, and the Lord told us that if we believe in Him, if we receive Him, He will surely give eternal life to us
One of the most common questions raised by thoughtful persons is why God would allow these sorts of things to occur
One thing we know is that in the Bible He tells us that He wants us to repent and that He wants us to believe in Him
While you are talking with someone, you can realize what kind of person he is from his attitude or from the tone of his words
If he is highly educated or quite knowledgeable concerning the Bible, you have to consider how to proceed with him
Your answer must be according to his level of education and according to the amount of knowledge he has about the Bible
If he is not highly educated and not knowledgeable concerning the Bible, you can take a simple, clear way with him
With those who have a limited knowledge of spiritual matters, it is always good to center on the fact that God is real
Even medical doctors have to admit that there are many things about our human body which they do not understand
Someone was asked whether a terrible criminal who has committed all kinds of crimes and has become demon possessed can be saved
When we are not rejoicing, our minds will be soaring, but the best way to consolidate our soaring minds is to sing
If you drop your formality when you go to visit people, you will not go as a pastor, a missionary, or a Bible student
Rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore, It is better to sing than be sighing: It is better to live than be dying; So let us rejoice evermore
We have seen that the first step of God's ordained way is to preach the gospel by visiting people in their homes
There are four elements that constitute a meeting the Word of God the mingled spiritour spirit mingled with Gods Spirit singing and praying
Without these four elements, a meeting will be flat like a tabletop lying on the floor with nothing to support it
The more we exercise our spirit to speak, sing, and pray in a free and released way, the better and more living the meeting will be
The worshippers of God should not be silent but utter some voice by speaking forth the Lord Jesus in the Spirit of God
, or speaking the Word by reading from the Bible or reciting a verse are all proper kinds of speaking for the meetings
The more we have these four elements-the Word, the spirit, singing, and praying-the richer our meetings will be
You should sing the hymn, the song, or the chorus that you sang with them on your last visit when they were baptized
Rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore, It is better to sing than be sighing: It is better to live than be dying; So let us rejoice evermore
You might turn to Acts 16:31-'Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household'-and ask the boy to read it
You can also turn to the others to help them to know that once they have believed in the Lord Jesus, they are saved
Although they prayed in the car while they were going, they did not take their Bibles or hymnals into the home with them
We are often too anxious to gain people and go too far too quickly; so eventually, we offend people and gain nothing
It was sovereign of the Lord that this brother and sister would visit such a coupleboth husbands being Japanese and both wives being Chinese
We will pave the way by opening people's hearts and preparing their spirits to receive whatever we might speak the next time
Regardless of how much you would act in a spontaneous way, you must grasp some time to minister something of the holy Word
We must minister something of the holy Word to these ones concerning Christ, concerning God, and concerning God's salvation
On the one hand, we must be so spontaneous, so ordinary, and so human, not giving people any impression that we are pushing something
On the other hand, we must learn to skillfully grasp the time to speak something of the Word, even if it is only for a few minutes
We must grasp the right time, minister the right verse, and minister it in a way that is brief yet impresses them very deeply
To select a good verse concerning God's forgiveness is not difficult, but to apply such a verse properly requires skill
Acts 10:43 says, 'To this One all the prophets testify that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins'
On their first visit, one of the brothers had given the husband a hymnal and a book used for a time of morning revival
When they arrived, they realized that the house had been prepared for them, and these two books had been laid out on the table
When we feel that we are bound, we need to get into the Word by using our spirit to touch the Word, and the truth will set us free
They simply went to this new one's home and acted not according to any preparation but according to the real situation
We all must learn not to be formal, legal, or religious but to go and see what the situation is and then act accordingly
If the brothers had selected a subject beforehand, they might have presented their prepared talk without caring about the situation
To take this way is not easy because it requires us to be properly equipped with much knowledge of the truth and experience of life
All day they may pray concerning that appointment, and they may also read some messages or some books on the way to talk to people
You need to pray much that the Holy Spirit will be with you to help you to realize the real situation of the new ones
When you go, you can speak something rich according to the situation and according to the real need of the ones you are contacting
We all have to learn two things: to be normal and spontaneous, and to grasp the opportunity to impart something of the Word
You can demonstrate how to begin a home meeting and how to talk to people according to many different situations
While you are presenting the gospel to him, he may ask how anyone can really know that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead
Because this question involves a very great matter, your conversation with him must be a little longer, slower, and more thorough
When we use such an illustration, we should stress these points repeatedly in order to convince and subdue our listener
The historical record, the written history, tells us that such a migration took place three or four hundred years ago
The descendants of those who migrated are now present among us, and they can trace their genealogies back to these immigrants
The Bible contains the historical record concerning not only the resurrection of Christ but also the entire history of Christ
If a book has a low standard of morality and ethics, such as the book of Mormon, we are justified in not believing it
Because of Israel's degradation, God became unhappy with them, punishing them by dispersing them among the nations
The Bible also predicted that one day the land would return to the Jews and that they would be formed into a country
It was written by God Himself through the prophets in the Old Testament and through the apostles in the New Testament
His words are deeper, of a higher standard, and more full of meaning than those of any philosopher including Plato and Confucius
In human history there has been only one person who could speak and did speak such things, and His words were written down in the Bible
The Bible as a record of history is very high in its morality and ethics; therefore, it is very believable and trustworthy
The second reason we know that Jesus Christ was resurrected is by the spiritual descendants of those who witnessed it
Peter, John, and the other apostles, including Paul, were witnesses of Christ's resurrection and were the first generation of Christians
The third reason we know that Jesus Christ was resurrected is by the effect of His resurrection on human society
The whole earth being under a calendar which is based upon the birth of Jesus Christ is also a strong evidence of Christ's resurrection
When a person asks a question which is too vague and too broad, we should try to solidify or compress his question into a manageable form
By their speaking, you should be able to discern who among them is the one to whom you should address your speaking
We have our physical part, our body, and we also have our psychological part, our soul, of which the mind is the largest part
We have used our mouths which belong to our physical part, and our minds which belong to our psychological part
By this kind of conversation, you rescue your listener from the endless psychological realm to the realm of the human spirit
A person may be very rich in material things and enjoy all kinds of entertainment, yet still be very unsatisfied
The body may be satisfied, the psychological part may be satisfied, but there is still a part which is not satisfied
After you briefly remind him of the subject of the church which he proposed for your fellowship, you should wait for him to say something
By giving him the opportunity to speak, you may realize that he is a person who has never been saved, that is, he is a nominal Christian
In this message we will continue to fellowship concerning the way to care for the new believers in the home meetings
While a brother is driving to a new one's home for a home meeting, one of his team members may say something about his driving
In married life it is difficult to be released because small things can easily cause offenses, and to be offended is to be bound
You may feel and realize that you are bound and even pray, 'O Lord, release me,' but many times your prayer would not be answered
If we are about to go to speak for the Lord, something will happen related to our children that will bother us
Many things in our circumstances, in our environment, and in our situation come to us with the intention of destroying our spiritual work
Regardless of how much training you receive concerning the home meetings, you must first learn how to get yourselves released
Even if someone says something to us concerning our driving, we would not care, we would not be interested in getting involved
We should not do this in a legal way as if we were using a textbook: first, lesson one, then lesson two, and so forth
When we come to the new ones to have a home meeting in their home, we should not have a subject that we have already decided to cover
It is best not to speak something too quickly, but first ask him why he did not have peace within for these two days
Sometimes you need to ask the new ones a question in order to find out something, but do not ask too many questions
Four crucial practices of the Christian life are reading the Bible, praying always, keeping morning watch, and attending the meetings
To have a purpose in going to a home meeting is different from making a decision as to what you are going to speak
If you are going to visit a man who was baptized only two days ago, you must have a burden, a purpose, to feed, or nourish, him
Timothy 3:15-16 says, 'From a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation
All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness'
You may continue your talk with him by saying To read the Bible is good but it should be accompanied by another thingour prayer to the Lord
We can take the word 'All Scripture is God-breathed' and simply turn it into prayer, saying, 'Lord, thank You for all the Scriptures
Now we would like to tell you about another practice which is crucial to our Christian life-keeping morning watch'
You should also have the time to say, 'Another crucial practice of the Christian life is to attend the meetings
If we are going to learn to keep our morning watch, we must ask the Lord to grant us His grace and mercy so that we can go to bed earlier
While we are helping to build up these four practices in the new ones, we will also need to touch other matters
With the matter of consecration, we do not need a long time, but with these four practices, we need a longer time
You delivered these babes, so the responsibility is upon your shoulders to go back to them to feed, nourish, and cherish them
You should work for quite a period of time to develop in them these healthy practices that are crucial to the Christian life
In this case we must be honest and humble and say that we did not study that field and cannot answer that question
As long as you have two or three newly baptized ones, stop visiting new homes, and take care of these two or three by feeding them
After about three or four weeks, you will realize which of these three are worthwhile for you to labor on further
By doing this, you can work on certain persons in a definite way and within a year you can gain one or two solid ones as remaining fruit
If you realize that they are real Christians, but they are not settled in any denomination, it is worthwhile for you to work on them
Out of so many Christians in the United States, many are moving to new places every year, and they are looking for a new church
There are many Christians in this country, but if you focus your labor on the Christians, you will gain very little
We had home meetings with this family for a long time and were training them in the four crucial practices that were shared in this message
The home meetings seemed very good, but eventually the husband said that he did not want us to come back anymore
We have to lead them by telling them, 'This is what the Lord wants, yet the Lord knows that we cannot do it, so He will be our help'
Question: We have shared these basic practices of the Christian life with many new ones, yet most of them do not pick them up very quickly
You should realize that he will not take these four practices at this time, so you must approach him from another angle
When you make such a presentation you not only show that the Bible is trustworthy but also show that you are capable in preaching the gospel
In order to adequately prove that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, you must present what the Bible says concerning Him
Today people recognize that there are only two kinds of Bibles, the Jewish Old Testament and the Christian New Testament
The Jews hold only the Old Testament, the Christians hold the Old and New Testaments, and the Moslems hold a partial imitation of the Bible
The Bible makes known all the spiritual, divine, and mysterious things, such as the origin of the universe and the origin of man
Darwin speculated about these things, but only the Bible tells us in a trustworthy and clear manner the source of the universe and of man
As to the origin of the universe, the first sentence of the Bible states clearly, 'In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth'
Concerning the origin of man, the Bible clearly says that God created man in His own image according to His likeness
None of the great philosophers could clearly tell us the origin of man, but the Bible gives some practical details concerning man's creation
In resurrection He was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God , and His believers as the many sons of God are His many brothers
He told the saints that since he had become a Buddhist, all of his material needs had been met through worshipping idols
The saints shared the gospel with her and found that she had had several unpleasant experiences in Christianity and in her own family life
By restricting people to a particular point, you can present something of the Word which is very practical for their daily life
You should also learn a number of verses about God being something to us, such as our breath , our life , and our salvation
He told them that he had experienced the Lord in a definite way in college and that he was filled with joy at that time
They had a long talk after this point in their visit and their fellowship was good, but much more could have been accomplished
Having read a portion, they could have explained it a little in order to impress him with what that portion said
After practicing to read and pray, they could have spoken to strengthen him and confirm his need to contact the Lord in such a way every day
The group of saints who visited him should remember him before the Lord and ask the Lord to remind him of what he has heard from them
In one of the home meetings the saints have visited a brother who allowed them to come in for only thirty minutes each visit
He strictly watched his clock while they were fellowshipping and responded only in a very disinterested manner
The saints tried to share with him about the mingled spirit, but it seemed to be futile because of his lack of interest
The next week they visited the brother and brought some dessert, purposely leaving their Bibles and hymnals at home
Soon the new brother forgot about his consciousness of time and began to speak for close to forty-five minutes of their meeting
To lead someone to experience Christ and to bring him into the church life is not very easy, and it takes time
In this case, it seems that to speak about the mingled spirit is inappropriate for this new brother at this time
It will be easier for you to talk more freely with him and to gradually introduce something in the field of God's salvation
On one occasion, she found her at home and tried to help the young sister by pray-reading Ephesians 1:17 with her
Though her response was very good and she wants the sister to come back, the sister is puzzled as to what to do in her next visit
If you would be a person who is qualified to work among the young people, you must be a person loving the Lord freshly every day
We have realized that when we meet a person who 'soars in the air' with their thoughts, we must restrict their thought to a particular point
We should always keep in mind that if someone is a new believer, our primary purpose in the home meeting is to feed him
You should baptize wisely, exercise some discernment, and spend most of your time in caring for the newly baptized believers
When we say 'the home meetings,' we are referring to our meetings with the newly baptized ones in their own homes
When we baptize new believers, we should immediately begin to visit them in their homes to have meetings with them
By reading church history and biographies, we can see that a number of outstanding believers were saved in homes
Although he was not a religious or ethical person, through that meeting he was deeply touched by the Lord and was saved
We are referring specifically to having home meetings with the newly saved and baptized ones in their own homes
After we have helped a number of new ones in their homes for several months, we should gather them together to form a group meeting
The title of this message-feeding the newborn babes with baby food-may seem somewhat childish, but it is based upon much experience
If he is over seventy years old and well-educated, yet you are only twenty-nine, you may feel uncomfortable in dealing with him
He may be a retired college professor and talk to you about science or computers, but you should not forget that he is a babe in Christ
You should not be carried away by his talking because, spiritually speaking, he is a babe and knows nearly nothing about the Lord
You must learn to always have a subjective realization concerning every new believer, considering that they are babes
If you teach kindergarten, you realize that these students are little children, and you treat them accordingly
A new one may ask many questions, yet you must always have the concept that you are dealing with a babe in Christ
They continually cried out for the baptism in the Holy Spirit, and eventually they claimed that they had all received it
For many years we saw very few persons saved through them; yet in our hall the new ones were added nearly every day
The new ones who were saved in that Pentecostal denomination did not have a daily walk that glorified the Father
The principle is this-in the New Testament age, God will not do anything by Himself directly, especially concerning the matter of the gospel
When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, He had Peter, John, James, and the other disciples with Him for three and a half years
The Lord appointed us for three things: that we should go forth, that we should bear fruit, and that our fruit should remain
Later, in chapter two of his first Epistle, he wrote to all the new ones: 'As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word'
It is much easier to knock on doors to bring people to the Lord and baptize them than to feed them in the home meetings
He would welcome you into his home and would sit with you until you speak something, but he would not say anything
There are some very difficult situations that you will eventually encounter in preaching the gospel and caring for the newly saved ones
He may answer you by pointing out certain things which he considers might be idols and may say, 'Isn't this thing an idol'?
When you feed them in many other matters they would accept it, but when you come to the matter of idols, they might not accept your word
While you are talking to him as to a babe, you have to look to the Lord for the wisdom to handle the situation without stumbling him
They might be serious about the idols, yet it is better for you to talk to them in a way that is not so serious
Because you have helped them to read the Bible, sooner or later, they will bring up these kinds of questions from the Bible
In handling these questions, you must always try to talk to them with the attitude and tone that you are talking to a babe
You may have a new one, a young lady, who was saved in a marvelous way, yet she lives with a young man without being married
If you say 'no,' you will stumble them, but you cannot tell them that this is not a problem, because this is a big problem
If you keep this one principle and learn this one secret, you will be safeguarded from offending and stumbling people
Recently, before a home meeting, the saints prepared to share with a new believer concerning reading the Bible
A little later, she raised another question, 'Why is it that God will not save people, even good people, unless they come to Him'?
Immediately after someone is baptized, we should help the new believer to know the two spirits-the Holy Spirit mingled with our human spirit
In this case, the new believer asked a question concerning the Spirit; therefore, the saints did not have to introduce this matter
Saying that the Triune God is a mystery was going too far, distracting from the main matter of the Holy Spirit
At the same time, we must be quick to grasp the opportunity when a proper question or subject is manifested in the meeting
To have taken two or three minutes to say something about Genesis 1 and 2 would have helped to improve the telephone conversation
God used the dust of the ground to form man's body, and He used His breath of life to create the human spirit within man
If one is a professor, we should not talk to him in a babyish way, otherwise, he may think that we despise him
We should stress these two things again and again, treating them as babes, feeding them with these deeper things in the form of baby food
You should decide whether or not your intention is to be with that new believer or to participate in the sports activity
Whenever you spend time with the new believers, you should take the opportunity to render some help to them spiritually
In that time of preparation, there should be some fellowship among the members of the visiting team concerning the goal of the home meeting
To begin a home meeting by singing a hymn without raising up a proper atmosphere is to practice a religious way
It may be that before a certain hymn is sung, one of the brothers or sisters may first read something from the Word
To help people to be revived or to love the Bible can also be a religious activity which is common in Christianity
To read and sing a hymn such as 537 in Hymns concerning Christ being so subjective would impress a new believer in a particular way
Christ is not only a historical person who is merely objective; rather, the Christ who is our Savior is so subjective
The brother caring for this new believer should stress the matter of contacting the Lord and turning to the spirit
They have asked very basic questions about such items as the human spirit, so the saints have just answered their questions
These saints have been a little too general in their care of these new believers, not having taken any definite steps to help them
At this point, the saints could have presented Mark 16:16 which says, 'He who believes and is baptized shall be saved'
We should not force people to do things, but to a certain extent, we should compel people to take the word of the Lord
To nourish the new believers without any purpose is to run the risk of damaging their spiritual health in the long run
The book Life Lessons was written according to the sequence of Christian experience, not according to doctrine
With such an atmosphere, to insist on discharging your burden concerning the human spirit would be something of legality
You must fit into the situation, sensing the atmosphere and giving a word concerning the Bible, the divine revelation
By doing this again and again, you will eventually cover each lesson in the book in a living and flexible way according to the situation
We should always conduct the home meetings with the aim of injecting one of the Life Lessons into the new believers
The material contained in one lesson may be too much for one injection, but we must realize that each lesson is like a 'basket of peaches'
Be assured that when we enter into the eternal tabernacles , these one hundred to one hundred fifty will welcome us
It implies the raising up of children, which is to provide whatever they need, including feeding, that they may grow and mature
Human history has proven that the society of a nation is built up through the raising up of children in individual homes by families
The Lord has not only appointed us to go forth and to bear fruit; He has also appointed us to insure that our fruit remains
It would be very difficult for three thousand newborn believers to remain healthy without being cared for in home meetings
Surely Peter saw the situation on the day of Pentecost and helped in the work of caring for these newborn believers
In his first Epistle, he says that the newborn babes need the milk of the word, not for knowledge, but for the growth in life
He exhorts the newborn babes to long for the guileless milk of the word that they may grow in life unto salvation
Through this we learned that every believer who preaches the gospel must also care for the new ones as a mother raising up her own children
The home meeting is for raising up the newborn believers, not only as your children but also as God's growing children
Wherever there is a group of Christians, and among them there is the proper care for the new ones, that church will become quite large
If every family raises three or four children in their home, eventually, many proper persons will be produced to benefit society
If you are a team of three members you must become a family raising up the new ones as your children yet considering them as Gods children
To leave your children in the care of others for even a short time may cause some damage; they may suffer and not grow so well
To disciple the nations, we must start by discipling individuals, yet we cannot go alone; we must go as a team
After your team has baptized a small number, stop and form a family to do the work of raising up these new ones as God's children
You have to go out continuously, not to many homes, but to those three or four homes of the ones you are caring for
The second point regarding the raising up of God's children is that you have to raise them up with the word of God, not with your own word
All the subjects of these lessons were carefully selected according to my knowledge and experience to meet the needs of the new ones
Whatever you do, you must do it in a living way, and you should try to cover at least one definite point using the best verses
The first thing we should inject into the new ones is that our Savior is the Spirit and that we as saved ones have a regenerated spirit
We must also teach them how to practice morning watch by reading some verses and then pray-reading these verses
You also have to help them to do the same thing that you did for them, that is, to preach the gospel to others
There are the washing away of our sins, the forgiving of our sins, redemption, reconciliation, justification, regeneration, and so forth
We got into the footnote on this matter in Acts 2:21 , and we also got into the Life-study of Romans where this matter is covered in detail
We continued to share going through the Old Testament and then the New Testament showing them all the verses related to calling on the Lord
In the end, we felt like we had given a message to some people who did not want to know about calling on the Lord
Do not forget that in the home meetings, you are taking care of babes; you are feeding the newborn babes with baby food
The principle is this: if you are going to help the newborn babes, you must always try to make them happy, to make them feel good
One time we were able to meet some of her grandchildren, so we thought that their home might be the key to the whole family
For people to be saved and baptized is easy, but for them to become practical, living members in the church life is difficult
Our burden is not only to get people saved and baptized; our purpose is to gain the proper increase for the church life
In visiting people, we must have the discernment to realize which ones would be very hard to bring into the church life
To spend so much time to labor on such an old sister, even if she could be brought into the church life, is not wise
You have to consider which of these fifteen are proper persons whom you could bring into the church life easily
We should also discern which communities are the best to work in and which kind of people are the best to labor on
Our commission from the Lord is not only to save sinners but also to build up the church life in the Lord's recovery as a testimony
We must save our time to work on the most promising ones that we could gain the proper increase for the church
At the end we prayed together, and in our prayer we prayed for her husband and for her further receiving of the Lord
You can work on this kind of person for your whole life, and nearly nothing may come out for the practical building up of the Body of Christ
We have to have some discernment concerning what community we should work in and which neighborhoods we should visit
When people raise up problems, you have to consider what particular point you should strike in order to feed them
By this you can know their situations and consider which of them may not be that promising and which of them may need some urgent care
Immediately after baptizing a new one, we should bring him into the church meetings and give him some impression concerning the church life
After this initial visit, we should charge him again and again in subsequent home meetings to meet with the saints and with the church
As sheep cannot live apart from the flock, Christians cannot live apart from one another and should come together often
We must lead the new believers to visit their relatives helping them to realize that this is another part of the practice of the church life
While we are caring for the home meetings, we should gradually lead our new ones into the practice of the church life
From the beginning of their Christian life, the new believers should be brought into the habit of caring for other believers
In caring for the new believers in the home meetings, we must realize that every person has a different disposition
When we are leading the new believers to call on the Lord, we should not care whether they call loudly or softly
As we care for new believers, we should trust in the nourishment we have ministered into them more than in anything else we do
They strictly pay attention to their treatment and not to the pleasant or unpleasant reaction of their patients
We should do this in a pleasant way without offending or stumbling them, leaving them with a good impression of us
In one of the home meetings, a family of new believers proposed that their family and the saints exchange Christmas gifts
In speaking with the new believers, you should never forget that they are babes and that they must be fed with baby food
Your aim in playing with them is to feed them; therefore, you should not become too occupied with the subject of Christmas
They told her that they like to sing such a song in the morning especially when they do not feel so good or when they have a lot of problems
Based upon this response, the saints read Romans 8:28-29 with her and began to share with her concerning the contents of these two verses
The new believer was excited by the saints' fellowship on this subject and remarked that she had never heard such things before
In principle when introducing something such as a new song to the new believers it is best to avoid using the word teach in your fellowship
In this home meeting, the saints should not have left their subject of singing a song to help the new one to call on the name of the Lord
It then may have been appropriate to share a short testimony of their experience of calling on the name of the Lord
As we are preaching the gospel we should learn to exercise our discernment concerning whether a person will be difficult to gain or not
We should also discern in the same way when we preach the gospel, because there are many different kinds of people on the earth
To change the persons damages the coordination among the saints who have been laboring together to take care of the home meeting
The issue of such constant changes will be confusion among the saints who are laboring, and the time with the new believer will be wasted
Though the word training is not used in the books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, the thought is surely conveyed in these books
In 2 Timothy 2:2 Paul charged Timothy to commit the things which he had heard to faithful men who would be competent to teach others
Paul later charged Timothy to stay in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently
The Lord's recovery itself is very particular, and the matter of training is also something particular within the Lord's recovery
Under the training we should not do anything according to our likes or dislikes or according to our environment
The first group wants to introduce the second group to the new believer so that they can begin to care for the new one in the home meetings
The best way to care for the new believers is to try to avoid any kind of transfer of care from one group to another group
When there is the need of a transfer, it should be done in a very careful and considerate manner and not in a light way
Whenever a new believer is passed on from one group of saints to another, it must be done in a very proper way
If such things as education are not easy, how much more difficult it is to advance in the things of the Lord, who is our King
For a nursing mother to sweep her front porch is not very significant, but to nourish her child is one of the most important things to her
In our study over the past few years, we have discovered that we need at least four steps to raise up the new believers
After gaining them by saving and baptizing them, there is the need to nourish and cherish the new ones in home meetings
Once we have fruit, we should try our best to take care of it even though we may still be young and lack the growth in life
Often, the children in a family are raised not only by the parents, but also by the elder brothers and sisters
We must realize that the older brothers and sisters in the Lord's recovery can help us to raise our spiritual children
Because of this wrong impression, most people today have a certain expectation whenever they attend a so-called church meeting
In the home meetings, the new ones are not distracted by the form of the church, and they can receive the nourishment
While we are feeding them in their homes, we should gradually let them know what the biblical way of gaining people for the Lord is
As they are helped to realize the biblical way to meet and to serve they will not pay that much attention to the form of the church meetings
In their homes we nourish and cherish them to raise them up and to educate them so that they can realize what the real things are
When they compare the attractive facade of Christianity to our way of meeting and practice, they will not be impressed with our way
The fourth step of prophesying for the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ will be covered in future messages
In the book of Acts and in all of Paul's Epistles, we can see that Paul exercised to practice this New Testament priesthood to the uttermost
There was always a group of people gathered together in these synagogues who had the Scriptures and knew something of God
He did not want to turn back, so he went straight forward until he came to the city of Troas on the Aegean Sea
It seems that when they came to Troas, Paul did not have the thought to cross over to another continent, so God gave him a vision
In the Old Testament Gods oracle Gods speaking always came through the Urim and Thummim which were on the breastplate of the high priest
God's administration in the Old Testament was carried out by His speaking in His divine oracle through the Urim and Thummim
Paul indicates that he was a priest of the New Testament , yet in Acts 16 his priesthood needed the function of the prophets
He did not know them, and they did not know him; but one of these women, Lydia, received the gospel and opened her home to the apostles
In raising up families to form the society of a nation, there is the need of births, then feeding, and then perfecting, educating
All these steps-kindergarten, elementary school, junior high, high school, college, and graduate school-are for our perfecting
Peter learned this from the Lord; so in writing his first Epistle, he charges the newborn babes to long for the pure milk of the word
We are to consider one another, we are to incite one another to love, and we are to incite one another to good works
Verse 24 ends with a comma, and verse 25 continues, 'Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is'
In these verses there are three items that characterize the group meeting: considering, inciting, and exhorting
In 1 Timothy 6:20 Paul charged Timothy to 'guard the deposit,' and in his second Epistle he repeats this charge
Paul charges that these things, the good deposit in Timothy, be committed to faithful men, who would be competent to teach others also
In 2 Timothy 2:2 the first generation perfecter charges the second generation perfecter to perfect the third generation
Among Paul's Epistles, Ephesians is a book specifically on the church, and chapter four is on the building up of the church
Although the Lord says, 'I will build My church' in Matthew 16, the entire Bible does not show us that Christ builds up His church directly
Ephesians 4 tells us that the Lord came down, not only to the earth, but He also descended into the lower parts of the earth, Hades
He came out of Hades to the earth in His resurrection, and from the earth He ascended to the height, the third heaven
According to John 17:2 and 6, the Father has given His chosen ones to the Son that the Son may give them eternal life
The Father could give all the chosen ones including Peter James and John to the Son and the Son could impart His resurrection life into them
The first ten verses of Ephesians 4 describe the procedure through which the ascended Head constituted the gifts and gave them to His Body
By reading the New Testament you can see that the truth is that the apostles were always with the saints and contacting the churches
After establishing a church with the appointment of the elders, the apostles repeatedly went back to the churches they had established
Surely the apostle did not take his hands off the church; rather, he continued to perfect them by teaching them, admonishing them, etc
We must all be perfected to do the same work as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
We all need to enter into the practice of the God-ordained way to organically build up the church as the Body of Christ
Also, through the years we have mostly had general teaching; we have not had much teaching in the way that perfects people
Through the years we have been influenced by the old traditional Christianity, and we are still under its influence
He charged the young believers to grow that they themselves could be priests to offer themselves as living sacrifices directly to God
As New Testament priests, it is not enough to offer our prayers and our giving of the material things; these are not the mail offerings
Today we are not offering bulls and goats as types of Christ; we are offering sinners who have become the members of Christ
In the Old Testament, Christ was offered in type, but today in the New Testament, the members of Christ are offered
The Bible says that on the day of Pentecost three thousand were baptized , and at another time there were five thousand
If we only raised up our children and gained our close relatives, we could have at least a five percent increase yearly
It is better for us to be ashamed today than in that day when we stand before the judgment seat of Christ to give an account of our service
Through these three portions of the Word, we can pick up some realization of the purpose of the group meetings
If we are going to be serious students of the Scriptures, we must analyze the language according to the grammatical construction
In Christ they are no longer sinners but they are the sons of God the children of God the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God Christ
In each of the local churches, there should be some advanced ones who have been perfected by the gifted persons
We may speak or sing a hymn, which is somewhat shorter than a psalm, or we may speak or sing a spiritual song, which is shorter still
The Bible says clearly that when Peter was released from prison and went to Mary's home, some there thought it was his angel
By considering the Word, we can see that there was much fellowship, interceding for one another, mutual care, and shepherding
For the perfecting of the saints, there is the need of teaching in the group meetings, and in the group meetings all are teachers
All the eyes may turn to the oldest one in the meeting, but it may be better for one who has been recently saved to answer the brother
When you come to the meeting, you may say, 'Brothers and sisters, Brother John has been in an automobile accident'
In the group meeting, singing, fellowship, and interceding should all come forth in a normal and spontaneous way
After praying for the brother who has had the automobile accident, someone may know if he is at home or in the hospital
The mutual care leads to shepherding, and the shepherding leads to the rendering of help, whether it be spiritual, practical, or material
Because the group meeting should have some very young believers, we must learn to begin our teaching with something very simple
In practicing the group meeting, although we are teaching others, we must realize that we are also learning how to teach
We may be able to respond to this question in many ways, but we must learn to answer such a question in a simple and direct way
Many times when we try to answer a question, we give a lot of good teachings, but we do not answer it according to the asker's thought
After going home, we may consider certain questions, so that the next time such a question is raised, we can answer in a better way
When someone asks a practical question, you should first give them a practical answer, and you should also try to make your answer short
Question: Sometimes in a meeting a new one will ask a question that is peculiar or bring up a subject that is not so proper
When all the older saints come into the meeting, their appearance and gesture may cause the new ones to be bound
A child learns to speak English simply by hearing, but the immigrants that come to this country have to learn by being taught
If three of them would speak at the same time, you should say something to them, but you must say it in a happy and encouraging way
When these three all start to speak at the same time, you may smile and say, 'I am so happy that you all will say something
Even if you do not say such a thing, if one is speaking quite long, for eight to ten minutes, you can still handle it in a loving way
Question: One thing we have been practicing in our group meeting is to ask the new ones a question to draw out something from them
If the new ones do not have any questions to ask in the group meeting, you must learn how to initiate a subject by asking a question
If in a group meeting the questions being asked do not match the goal of the meeting, should we answer the questions and disregard our goal?
Whether you teach justification or you teach people why we should eat and drink God, both help to fulfill our purpose
Surely you have to prepare something, but you still must leave this matter wholly in the hands of the Holy Spirit
We have to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel by going out to visit people in their homes for the preaching of the gospel
When we have gained some, we must raise them up properly through the nourishing and cherishing in the home meetings
We should bring these new ones to the group meetings that they might be perfected through the mutual teaching of all the saints
These perfected ones can prophesy in the church meetings for the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ
We all have to remember that the goal of our going out to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel is not merely to 'win souls'
In these verses the word 'unto' is used twice-'unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ'
God can have many sons to build up His house, the church, and Christ can have many members to build up His Body, which is also the church
Both the house of God and the Body of Christ are organic, and the building up of something organic requires building in life
Our goal in preaching the gospel is to go out to get sinners saved to make them the sons of God and the building members of Christ's Body
When we go out to knock on people's doors, we should not keep the old, traditional understanding concerning the goal of our gospel preaching
Based upon this goal, when we go out to visit people, we should exercise to consider people according to the discernment the Spirit gives us
It may be quite easy to get some people saved to become children of God, but for them to grow and become sons of God may not be so easy
They not only have been regenerated in their spirit and are growing in life, but they also are living and walking by being led by the Spirit
The Lord will give us the proper discernment, yet we should be careful not to try to 'measure' the new ones too quickly
If a door opens, and a lady or a gentleman comes out, you should discern whether this one is worthwhile for you to spend your time
You should not work according to any set time limits; instead, you must always exercise your discernment and follow your inward leading
If we are persistent in going out to preach the gospel and endeavor with long-suffering, we will never be disappointed
We must stop knocking on new doors and go back to the ones we have already baptized to have home meetings with them to feed them
You should go out to gain people, but at the same time, you have to exercise your discernment not to baptize more than you can care for
You should exercise to practice the second step; you must go back to have home meetings with those whom you have baptized in their homes
After the proper feeding, you must take these new ones on further by bringing them out of their homes to meet with others
You should gather together all of the ones whom you have been feeding with other saints who live nearby to practice the group meeting
Through our testing and experimenting, we have found that for every twenty homes we visit, we will get one baptized
To pray in this way means that you mean business with the Lord and are endeavoring to make some profit for Him
If you all mean business and are desperate with the Lord, out of every twenty homes you visit, you may baptize one
On this earth there is such a marvelous trade, but to work in this trade successfully, we have to mean business with the Lord
We must be clear that we are going out to get persons saved and regenerated to be sons of God and members of the Body of Christ
If we go out continuously and faithfully for the next thirty years, eventually each one of us could gain fifty as remaining fruit
It would be very good if out of one hundred meeting together, fifty would go out to practice the priesthood of the gospel
If thirty saints out of one hundred would do this, it is possible for the church to increase fifty percent in one year
Last February there were only twenty in this group, but by August it had grown to over fifty; it had more than doubled
In Taiwan it is possible to find many who have never been in Christianity and who have never learned anything about Christianity
Through this, every new one, within one or two days after being baptized, had a good morning revival and became fully revived
If a school teacher receives a message that his friend is seriously sick, does he stop teaching and go to visit his friend?
We need to realize our grave responsibility to gain sinners for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ
At least you should be able to complete these first three steps with the new ones-begetting, feeding, and perfecting
In San Gabriel, California, about fourteen began to meet together at about the same time that those in Monterey Park began
Luke 19 and Matthew 25 show that the Lord has given us some capital and that we have been charged to do business
When He comes back, He will demand that we give Him an account of our business, and we will either receive a reward or a punishment
When we come together in any kind of meeting, we must exercise to keep ourselves away from anything of religion
Some saints are very talkative everywhere else and at any other time except at the time of the meeting and in the meeting hall
We should come to the meetings as we are in our daily life-full of Christ, full of joy, and full of the Spirit
If we are a praising, singing, rejoicing, and Christ-speaking people, we will come to the meetings in this way
We usually come to the meetings in our disposition and character and behave a certain way according to our disposition and character
Usually, we do not come to the meetings in our spirit, in Christ, in our singing spirit, or in a praising attitude
The entire activity of the meetings will altogether be a matter of religion, because religion always matches our disposition and character
If we meet according to religion, disposition, and character, there will be no Spirit, no Christ, no life, and no speaking of Christ
Although many dear saints love the Lord very much, they do not meet with the Spirit or with Christ, but with religion and their disposition
Today, you may go to work on time, but tomorrow, if you feel somewhat tired, you may go to work a little later
If we live a life of praising the Lord, when we come to the meetings, we will be beside ourselves with the enjoyment of the Lord
Another way to meet is by each one coming into the meeting praising the Lord, singing, or saying, 'Amen' as they enter
Perhaps immediately after the prayer another brother would ask Brother could you please tell us what kind of occupation this brother has
The brother may respond by saying, 'He came from China to this country two years ago and has been working in a certain firm as a bookkeeper'
The matters of fellowship, intercession, practical care, and shepherding can easily be carried out in the group meetings
We may speak things which have little to do with practical care, or we may propose things which have little to do with shepherding
The result is that we waste our time and do very little to take care of the saints, to perfect them, or to build them up
Often we do a lot of religious things which have nothing to do with the actual, practical situation of the saints
Without the group meetings, the fellowship, the intercession, the practical care, and the shepherding could not be done so thoroughly
After exercising to intercede on behalf of the brother, you may be led of the Lord to shepherd and care for the brother in a practical way
The practice of the church life will become very thorough and sufficient in meeting all the needs of the saints through the group meetings
The elders of the church should oversee the group meetings in order to correct, improve, uplift, enrich, and enliven them when needed
When any of the group meetings are dead or short of life, the elders should exercise to enliven these group meetings
Most of us only know how to practice teaching in the way of religion with a learned and appointed one teaching all the others in the group
To consider one another, to incite one another, and to exhort one another are three things which show that the church life is very mutual
After a certain number of months, the mother will begin to hear intelligible words from the mouth of her child
Eventually, after a period of time, the child will begin to speak these words, and the parents of the child will be very excited
Today, you may still not be able to speak very much in the meetings, but this does not mean that you do not have the capacity to speak
After a certain time of meeting in the group meetings, you will be able to speak for the Lord in the way of prophesying
Another sister who knows a little more may add to the first sisters answer by saying that to abide in the vine is to abide in the Lord Jesus
Another brother sitting next to the first brother may then say that our need is to always stay with the Lord Jesus
Four brothers and sisters have spoken a few short sentences, but when these sentences are added together, they constitute a good message
The teaching of these four brothers and sisters is good, but it may still need to be strengthened, so another brother may add something
After listening to the speaking of the saints, some of the young ones may still not be satisfied with the saints' answers
All those in the group meetings, including the new ones, should be helped to practice all of the items of the new way in the church life
Following this, there is the need to give them some instructions in preaching the gospel and to help them to form visiting teams to go out
In subsequent group meetings, the third step of helping the young believers to group together with others needs to be touched
Once these new ones are brought into the group meeting, this may increase the size of the group from fifteen to twenty-five
If the church is still in the stage of one man speaking and all the rest listening, the church is not very healthy
In this message we will continue to fellowship concerning the third main step of the God-ordained way-the group meeting
When we come together in a group meeting, we must have the mutual fellowship, intercession, care, and shepherding
As they are being perfected, they will spontaneously learn to speak the word of the Lord, that is, they will learn to prophesy
Our group meeting may have fellowship, intercession, mutual care, shepherding, and teaching, yet still be according to the old way
In the new way, when we come to the group meeting, we must be those who are living a life of morning revival and daily victory
If we mean business with the Lord to practice the group meeting in the new way, we must be revived, victorious, and overcoming people
Even before we enter the meeting place, the meeting will have already started in our home or on our way to the meeting
Regardless of what our outward environment or situation may be, we will be at peace and will always be eager to attend the meetings
The mutual teaching will come forth from all the saints through the mutual answering of one another's questions
The perfecting work in the group meeting is carried out mainly through the mutual answering of one another's questions
Although we are rich, it seems that when we come together, many of us leave our riches at home and appear to have nothing
Some young ones may answer in a way that is not so right, yet that is still a kind of teaching that can help others
No matter who we are or how young we are in the Lord, we all can and must speak something in the group meeting
Whenever we open our mouth and exercise our spirit to say something, the Holy Spirit within us will be one with our spirit
Sometimes it seems that we are speaking something out of ourselves, but actually it is something out of the Holy Spirit
In the home the mother does not consider herself as a leader, yet she realizes that she needs to take care of the family
When the mother is gone, the older children spontaneously pick up the responsibility to take care of the family
When one of us goes to a group meeting he should not consider himself as a leader he should not consider himself as being better than others
Someone may ask, 'Suppose fifteen come together, and each one has the feeling that he has to take care of that meeting
When you come to any Christian meeting, you must have the feeling, the realization, that you must take care of the meeting
You have to collect all the new ones who are under your care, and if you do not have that many, you can work together with other teams
Once you all come together, you have to help the new ones by bringing them into the proper practice of the group meeting
We are brothers and sisters in Christ; therefore, we like to open ourselves to the other members of our family
We must stress the great mysteries in the Bible, yet we must practice the mutual care with tenderness and love toward one another
In the past we have been short of this, because to exercise this kind of mutual care without meeting in small groups is very hard
At the end of the meeting, one of you may say, 'Brothers and sisters, this is the way we have our Christian meetings
After about four months, because we are being taught and perfected, we should be able to do many of the same things that they can do
We call this kind of meeting the group meeting, and we consider this meeting as a great part of the practical church life'
Based upon our fellowship and prayer we can render some practical care to one another and we can practice the mutual shepherding
A vital matter that is crucial to the practice of the church life in the new way is our living a life of morning revival and daily victory
If we simply confess our failures, defects, wrongdoings, and shortcomings, the Lord will forgive us and cleanse us
Sometimes as you are enjoying the Lord in this way, you may have the sensation that the Lord is speaking to you
You should also fellowship with them and select a book from the New Testament to go through in your morning revival times
If you have a morning revival with an overcoming daily life, then you can take the lead to bring the new ones into the same practice
We were not so clear about the distinctions in these two types of meetings at the beginning of our study in 1984
These home meetings are only good for a short period of time in the initial stage of caring for the new believers
If you continue to have the home meetings without the group meetings, the new ones will begin to lose their interest in meeting with you
According to the history in Christianity and also among us, the strength of a congregation is apparently determined by the speaker
Through many experiences we have realized that it was not the church itself that was strong it was the speaking or preaching that was strong
Brother Nee was a strong speaker, and the more he spoke in the church in Shanghai, the weaker the church became
If a group meeting has not been established, you should form one with the newly baptized believer and the other members of your team
You should begin to practice the things of the group meeting, such as fellowship, intercession, care, and shepherding
If you baptize some others in other homes, you should try to gather them together into this group as soon as possible
After a few months of feeding the new child regularly, when the mother tries to nurse her child, the child will be naughty, refusing to eat
If you go back to visit them repeatedly, after a few months, they will lose their taste for that kind of meeting
The best way to take care of the new ones at this point is to bring other new ones together with them in a group meeting
The problem among us today is that some of the groups which have been meeting for several months are full of oldness
The older ones in the family can only speak Chinese, but the children of the family have learned to speak English
Though the younger ones may try to teach the older ones to speak English, eventually, the older ones would still prefer to speak Chinese
The second type of group meetings is the result of our going out as lambs in the midst of wolves to find the sons of peace
No group meeting should remain for over a year without subdividing, so each year the group meetings should double
The group meeting has other elements, such as fellowship, intercession, care, shepherding, and mutual teaching
We would simply preach the gospel to them, baptize them, and meet with them in the home meetings and small group meetings
Without the frustration of opinions and oldness, perhaps as many as five hundred could be gained in five years
Due to the frustrations of differing opinions, the result of the practice of the new way has been greatly reduced
To have some time with the Lord each morning does not mean that we have to spend a great deal of time with the Lord
In this time of study, it is helpful to use other publications in order to understand the Bible in a more thorough way
It is good to separate them, because if you only have a small amount of time each morning, you should try to have a revival every morning
Throughout the day, there will be a lot of failures because we are so fragile, unstable, untrustworthy, and not very steadfast
If we would practice this priesthood in a thorough way, we may be able to have a one hundred percent increase each year
How much success we will realize depends upon how much attention and labor we are able to put on the group meetings
At least two were contacted through the telephone by saints who simply began to call numbers in the phone book
Do not say, 'Brother Lee told us that we must first visit our close relatives, then our neighbors, then our classmates, and so forth
If you do not have that many new ones, you can have a smaller group meeting, even two or three would be enough
If you baptized one last night, yet his wife has not yet been baptized, two of you may go back to his home tonight to meet with him
You must help all those in your group meeting to practice having a time of morning revival in order to live a daily life in Christ's victory
Regardless of whether it is better or worse than others', as long as you have a time of morning revival with the Lord, that is wonderful
Regardless of whether you appreciate a certain type of food or not, as long as you eat it three times a day, you will be sustained
Surely every one of us, regardless of how busy we are, can find half a minute in the morning to speak to the Lord
Because all the churches are in different conditions and different situations, they may be promoting different things at different times
You may ask the saints to read John 15:16 in the meeting, and then fellowship with them concerning going out to bear fruit
Later there will be the need to promote the home meetings in order to care for the new believers and then the group meetings to perfect them
We must fellowship with the brothers and sisters in the group meeting that we all have to be burdened for our group to grow
If a group of fifteen has been meeting together for a few months without any increase, they may need to divide into two groups
Still, before you divide the fifteen, you must spend two or three weeks to fellowship with them to prepare them
While you are speaking you must discern the atmosphere, whether the atmosphere is good for you to speak more or not
You can fellowship with these companions, and the two or three of you can go out to get your relatives and neighbors saved
Do not boast and do not vindicate the new way; even more, do not criticize anything the church is doing or has done in the past
Simply labor quietly and even somewhat hiddenly as a New Testament priest of the gospel according to what you have learned
Simply tell them that you sometimes go out with one or two others to visit people and preach the gospel to them
Always work in a gradual way, bit by bit, believing that whatever you do, if it is of the Lord, the Lord will perform it
If you will read these outlines, point after point, slowly and carefully with much consideration, you will receive much help
The purpose of the messages in this series is to train us to be proper Christians and even proper human beings
In order to be proper Christians we must firstly be built up with the divine truths, the scriptural knowledge in the divine way
We must also be built up with the divine life, the life of God, which is God Himself in His divine Trinity and in His processes
If we know Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him, we will possess Him and be able to minister Him to the lost world
In our sleeping in our rising up in our dressing and in every detail of our life we should be very strict to be built up in a good character
In a single day the communists imprisoned one thousand of the leading brothers throughout the country, including this brother
They only asked that the brothers would say that they believed in Jesus Christ but did not follow Watchman Nee
They tempted them, asking whether or not they believed that Watchman Nee was always right and never made mistakes
The brother from Shanghai, however, had learned the strict lessons of life and had taught others to always follow their inner feeling
He told his questioners that as a Christian his inner feeling did not allow him to say anything negative about Brother Nee
We need to build up a habit of visiting people in their homes for the gospel, and we must learn the proper way to visit them
In the same way, we may diligently practice to visit people for preaching the gospel, but we may not be doing it in the trained way
When we visit people for the gospel, we should observe our rate of success, how many doors we knock on in order to baptize one person
When we enter into a home, the people there may be afraid of us and will not want to have anything to do with us
To Christ we should be the precious stones, but for the ones we visit, we should be a 'magnet' to attract them
We had received a revelation from the entire Bible, and we could not deny that the Lord had shown us something
When Brother Nee tried again to have a training in the early 1940s, the enemy attacked again and a turmoil arose in the church in Shanghai
At this time, however, the communists came in, terminated the training, and confiscated the buildings used for it
The training became a target for the enemy's attack because this kind of training is a crucial factor for the defeat of the enemy
Because of the training, a number of saints who have been in the church life for only a short time have been growing quickly
According to the book of Numbers, Israel was formed into an army in order for God to establish the kingdom in the good land
If possible, all the college graduates among us, both brothers and sisters, should not take a job immediately after their graduation
To knock on peoples doors for the gospel we have to exercise our discernment and to talk to people in their homes also requires discernment
The way we contact the church and the saints should not be according to our preference but according to their situation
Sometimes to contact the saints is like walking on thin ice, requiring us to exercise much care and to walk with discernment
Question: It is needful to dress properly when we visit people, but should the members of a gospel team dress uniformly?
We must do everything according to the coach's instruction, and we have to practice until that instruction gets into our being
At first we may not be successful, but if we practice the trained way for about two weeks, we will see the results
If we doubt that our message will help people, we have not first been helped by it, and we should not speak it
