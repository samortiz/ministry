   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Different Kinds of Members</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Keeping the Order in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>by Being Faithful in Their Own Functions</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have said, the members are of three main classes: the joints, the sinews, and all the other parts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The joints are for supply, for nourishment, the sinews are for knitting and uniting, and all the rest of the members are for the different kinds of operations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All these three classes of members must be under the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are joints, we must do our duty to supply and to nourish, and if we are sinews, we must be faithful to join the Body together in love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Body we need the joints to supply and the sinews to knit together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The joints cannot knit together; they are good only for nourishing and supplying.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is the need of a group of sinews to bind and knit together all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many times the members need the supply, but after they are supplied, they need someone to join, knit, and bind them together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The problem today is that many want to be only the joints to supply but not the sinews to knit together.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When this is the case, we have nourishment, but we are lacking the knitting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even the more, we lack the many other operations of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For each kind of member to be faithful is the proper way to keep the order in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all agree that we must be under the headship, but we may not properly keep the order in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are out of our function, we are out of the proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may be a sinew that tries to supply or a joint that tries to knit together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If so, then we are out of our function and not in the proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many today talk about the Body ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At first I thought that this was a good term, but now I do not like to use it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When many people speak of the Body ministry, they are referring to meetings in which everyone opens his mouth to say something, as if the Body had only a mouth with no eyes, ears, nose, or other members.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is an ugly thing for the eyes of the Body to try to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The most beautiful situation is that the hands do the work of the hands, and the feet do the work of the feet.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Body ministry is not merely a speaking ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The genuine Body ministry is all the members of the Body functioning in various ways.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God created only one mouth in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If there were two mouths, they may quarrel with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, 1 Corinthians 14:31 says that all can prophesy, so we must all prophesy properly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the other hand, though, the foot should not function as the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may have the wrong sense as to whether or not we are the mouth, but the other members can discern.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the foot tries to function as the mouth, the members will sense that something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They may say, Brother, simply be a foot.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not try to be the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The ministry of the Body is not that everyone speaks to function as the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12 tell us that the Body has many members, and all the members do not have the same function Rom 12:3-5; 1 Cor 12:14-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is a certain brother among us through whom many people have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He always realizes what and who he is, so he prepares a meal in his home and invites people, but he does not try to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, along with the unbelievers he also invites certain brothers and sisters to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the proper coordination and cooperation of the differing operations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even in gospel preaching we need this kind of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If one person is a mouth but he cannot prepare a meal in his home, he needs the cooperation of the Body in order to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a small illustration of the proper ministry in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The genuine Body ministry is the mouth speaking, the hands working, and all the members in their operation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Operation of the Members in the Proper Order</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Having a Living Effect on People</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all are under the headship of Christ, but we need to learn to keep the order in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If by the Lord s mercy we know what we are and where we are, and we remain there, this will be a great help for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is no doubt that we all have the sincere desire to build up the church, but to do this we must keep the proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are the sinews, we have to keep this order; if we are the joints, we need to do our duty; and if we are one of the other members, we must operate within our measure.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This will have a living effect on people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The main thing that impresses people is not our messages but the situation in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a matter of the true building up.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This situation among us must be enriched, uplifted, strengthened, and improved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To this end we look to the Lord for His protection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The enemy is not willing to see the prevailing building up of the Body on this earth and in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Nevertheless, the Lord will work this out.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then it will be very easy to bring people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They may be saved as soon as they come into the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It will also be easy for other Christians to come in. When they come into the meeting, they will be impressed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They will realize that something is different.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In actuality, what they will sense is the real building up.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord will work this out not only in one locality but also in every place where the seeking ones are.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is a matter not of mere doctrine nor of something outward but of the real building up in life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Nothing can prevail against this.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord said, Upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The true built-up church is the strongest testimony of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We all must realize the need today.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are under the headship of Christ, but we also must learn to know and to keep the proper order in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This will result in the genuine building up.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then through this the Lord will bring others into the same order, and Christ will head up all things in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This requires that we be built up together.</S>
