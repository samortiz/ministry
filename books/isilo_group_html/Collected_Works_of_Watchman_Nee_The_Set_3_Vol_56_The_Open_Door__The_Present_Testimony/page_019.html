Thank God! When He led His believers to go positively in the way of the church, He did not treat us poorly. His servants Brother Hua Tien-min and Brother Xing Zuo-xin were sent from Ch'ang-ch'un to Dalian on October 23. They held a fifteen-day edification conference and showed us the light which the God of glory has given His church in this age.</p><p>Thanks and praise be to God! His move in the church came unexpectedly and spontaneously. Through this move we entered into the coordination of the whole Body. This is just like when God led the Israelites out of Egypt and the entire population boldly and enthusiastically served God.</p><p>It is truly marvelous! Once the service of the entire church is manifested, the gospel goes out. Immediately after the conference, there were five days of gospel meetings. As a result, a hundred fifty-four people confessed the Lord's name, and half of them were clearly saved. With the hundred and two brothers and sisters who broke bread with us originally, the total number of people in the meetings is now almost two hundred.</p><p>According to His rich mercy and love, God has granted us the grace of all the churches and has brought us into the way of the service of the entire Body. As we move forward to follow the footsteps of the flock, we would like to spread the news to all the churches. We ask you to place us in your prayers. May the fire of the love of the gospel burn more brightly here in Dalian!</p><p>Hung Fang-zhou, Yuan Zhu-wu, Fan Xin-sheng,<br />and Wang Xing-wu<br />December 24, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">A Deep Feeling of Shallowness (Yangzhou)</h2><p>Thank the Lord that He has remembered the supplications of the brothers and sisters everywhere and their care for Yangzhou. The Lord has heard and answered your prayers. On the morning of the Lord's Day, December 24, ten brothers and five sisters were baptized. The newly baptized brothers and sisters brought their opium pipes and gambling games and burned them with fire. The Lord was with us, and the brothers and sisters were filled with joy. On January 7, we established the Lord's table and began to break bread to remember the Lord. Forty-five brothers and sisters gathered around the Lord's feet. All were touched to the point of tears. We have touched the oneness and fellowship of the Lord's Body. The Lord is worthy of the glory.</p><p>As we begin to learn to serve the Lord, we have a deep feeling of shallowness. We would still ask all the brothers and sisters to continue praying for Yangzhou.</p><p>Hsu Tien-min, Lee Zhi-xuan, Liu Shi-an<br />January 12, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord Opened a Door for the Word (Shiwu)</h2><p>In March 1948, Brother Luh Zhong-xin came to Shiwu from Singapore, and the Lord opened a door for the word. We began to have meetings to break bread in my home in Shiwu. There were fewer than ten brothers and sisters. Over the last two years, the number of believers has increased daily. My house is too small to contain them all. Therefore, we began renting a one-story building for our meetings in April of this year. Presently, we have fifty to sixty people who meet regularly. On the twenty-eighth of last month, Brother Luh Zhong-xin came to Shiwu again, and the Lord used him greatly. He held two edification meetings a day for the believers, and he preached the gospel outdoors for ten days in a row in the afternoons. On October 10, Sister Huang Bi-gui came from Singapore to Shiwu and participated in the work. We were even more excited. Around fifty people were baptized. The conference was during the busiest time for the farmers, and many brothers and sisters were unable to attend. Last year the denominations in this locality attacked and fiercely opposed us. The Lord has done some work since, and most of them are clear about the truth. I am a teacher at the Zhonghua Elementary and Secondary School in this city. I am busy with my classes and cannot serve the church. I am indebted to the Lord; may He have mercy on me.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Yi-zhang<br />December 29, 1950</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 56: The Open Door & The Present Testimony &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
