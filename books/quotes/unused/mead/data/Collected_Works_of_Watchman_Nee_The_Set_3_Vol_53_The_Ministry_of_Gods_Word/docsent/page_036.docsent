   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the church nothing is more serious than the absence of men who supply others with God's word, revelation, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we do not supply others with these things, can we expect others to receive them simply through prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By asking them to pray for these things by themselves, we are shirking our responsibility and casting the burden on their shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The responsibility is not on their shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not pass it on to them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The ministers of the word have a responsibility to minister to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With the ministers of the word, there should be much revelation, light, and anointing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When they stand up to speak from the Scripture, God should speak through the same Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God should be willing to release His own speaking through the same passage.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is what it means to be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is what it means to minister to the church with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To minister is to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is like preparing a meal and serving it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This service satisfies others' hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A minister of the word should prepare God's word in such a way that he can minister and feed others with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many people can expound the Bible today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the problem is that God will not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to know the difference between understanding the Bible and having God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may study the Bible for many days, yet God may not speak a single word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When God decides to speak to us, all problems are settled and everything is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We will say, "For years, I had read the Bible foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I did not understand anything, but that day I knew."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is a matter of whether or not God has spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some people do not have spiritual insight on anything.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They may not have experienced any speaking other than the time when they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such ones will not touch anything in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some people have been listening and listening for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some words have been repeated over ten times in their ears, yet they still do not sense anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But when some brothers speak, they suddenly hear something and are struck by it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>During the previous times, they only heard the letters of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But this time they hear God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is a fundamental difference here.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is God's word?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's word is God's release.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to see what God's word really is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only as the word is released and as God speaks are we able to function as ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a most fundamental issue.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God must speak to us, and He must speak through us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If He does not speak to us, we cannot speak His word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many people desire to be God's oracles and ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to be one, they must be men of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today the building up of the church, the reaching of the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, and the arriving at the oneness of the church's faith depend on the functioning of the ministers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is raising up His ministers to do the work of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ephesians 4 shows us that only as the work of the ministry is realized is there the growth of the stature of Christ and the arriving at the oneness of faith vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The problem today is that few can be ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is preaching every day, but it is hard to say how much of this preaching releases God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's people are short of light and revelation, and the responsibility is on us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not put all the blame on the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Souls are not saved and believers are not edified today because there is no release of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The ministers have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the ministers have failed, how can we expect the church to prevail?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The whole problem lies in the fact that we are closed to God; we have refused to allow God's light to shine on us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is why we cannot bring our brothers and sisters to God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The problem is with us, not with them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a serious thing, a very sobering thing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One reason the church is in ruin today is that the Lord cannot have a breakthrough in us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is looking for ministers of the word everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God's word is never short; His light and His revelation are never lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The problem today is that He has not gained the right men.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is bound by us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The light cannot shine out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many workers claim to be God's oracles.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Yet while they are expounding the Bible, they do not have the faintest hope or thought that God would speak through them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Their sole interest lies in their desire to present their own doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They think that as long as they have the doctrines, they have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They are interested only in their own truth, their own pet ideas, and they think that as long as these can be propagated, all will be well.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They do not have the faintest expectation of God being released through their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must remember that we have God's word only when He is released.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If God is not released, all that men hear will be man's word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only when God is released is there revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If He is not released, the same teaching will only pass from one person to another, from one mouth to another mouth, and from one mind to another mind.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If, by the grace of God, He is released from us, how great a difference it will make!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brothers, we have to realize how different the exposition of the Scripture is from the impartation of God's revelation to man.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must realize that even though we may say many words that sound reasonable, wonderful, nice, and precious, God is not in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Once we can tell this difference, we will prostrate ourselves before God and say, "Lord, from now on, I abhor works that are void of revelation, works that impart no revelation to man."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should never be professional preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Once we become professional preachers, we will speak because it is our job to speak, and we will preach because it is our job to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We will not speak or preach as a result of receiving something from God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must live in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Without His presence we will not have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God has to gain this among us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>By the mercy of God we have to receive revelation from His word and then convey this revelation to others.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>For this we can do nothing except ask for His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If the Lord does not speak through us, we cannot convey His word to others.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If what we have is nothing more than a book the Bible, we have nothing that is living.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is true that the basis of the ministry of the word is the Bible, but the Bible alone is not enough; there is the need of the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Brothers, we need the anointing of the Spirit upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We need to learn to expect the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Many times we have to say to the Lord, "Lord, anoint Your word once more today so that I can take it and use it."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When we stand in front of others, we have to say to the Lord, "Anoint the words that I am about to speak and release them with Your anointing."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Now is the time to plead for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>All of the problems are with the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Without God's word, the ministers are poor and the church is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It seems that too many people are setting their hopes on truth and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Few have set their hopes on revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In the end the gospel is preached, but few souls are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Messages are delivered, but few receive any blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If God's life does not follow His word, everything is in vain and is worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Our failure lies in the fact that we only see men praising God's word and God's preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Yet the words themselves do not convey burning light; the revelation is not strong enough to knock men to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>What is needed today is not more admiration of God's word, but more men falling on their faces at God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If as ministers we cannot accomplish this, we can only blame ourselves for the failure.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
