<p>Overcoming the world, or being delivered from the world, is also a spiritual experience that should follow a believer&rsquo;s regeneration. After being regenerated, a believer should be delivered from sin and from the world. The world is at enmity with God (James 4:4). All that is in the world is not of God and does not match His holy nature (1 John 2:16). No one who is born of God and who has God&rsquo;s life can love the world boldly or be at ease while loving the world. God&rsquo;s holy nature has made us incompatible with the things of the world. God&rsquo;s life in us demands that we be delivered from the world. First John 5:4 says, &ldquo;Everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world.&rdquo; The things that have been begotten of God are the believers who have God&rsquo;s life. Hence, those who have God&rsquo;s life can overcome the world. The nature of God&rsquo;s life demands that we be delivered from the world, and the power of God&rsquo;s life enables us to be delivered from the world. Being delivered from the world comes through the cross (Gal. 6:14).</p>
<p>Being delivered from sin comes through the cross, and being delivered from the world also comes through the cross. A person must be dead in order to be delivered from sin, and a person must be dead in order to be delivered from the world. Only the dead can be delivered from sin, and only the dead can be delivered from the world. The world can touch and attract every kind of person, but the world has no attracting power over dead persons. We thank God that we have been crucified together with Christ. We were delivered not only from sin but also from the world by Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross.</p>
<p>We were separated from the world by Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, just as the children of Israel were separated from the Egyptians by the Red Sea. Because of the Red Sea, the Egyptians were dead to the children of Israel, and the children of Israel were dead to the Egyptians (Exo. 14:21-31). Similarly, the world has been crucified to us and we to the world because of the cross of Christ (Gal. 6:14). Just as the waters of the Red Sea covered Egypt&rsquo;s army and caused it to perish, the cross of Christ destroyed the forces of the world. Just as the Red Sea annulled Egypt&rsquo;s power over the children of Israel, the cross of Christ annuls the world&rsquo;s power over us. When we accept the death of the cross of Christ, the world and the things in the world lose their power and effect on us. When we live in the death of the cross of Christ, we are delivered from the power and the usurpation of the world. Our experience of being delivered from the world and overcoming the world depends on the cross of Christ and is through the cross of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND DEALING WITH THE FLESH</h2>
<p>After a person is saved, he should experience being delivered from sin and overcoming the world, and he should also experience dealing with the flesh. Sin is an offense to God and interrupts our fellowship with God, but the flesh prevents us from submitting to God and, thus, from pleasing God. The world causes us to be at enmity with God, and the flesh also causes us to be at enmity with God (Rom. 8:7-8). The flesh strives against the Spirit, who indwells us, to prevent us from walking by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16-17). The flesh is the biggest problem and the biggest frustration to our spiritual life. Just as the Amalekites frustrated the children of Israel in their journey through the wilderness (Exo. 17:8-16), the flesh frustrates us from advancing on our spiritual path. God charged the children of Israel to destroy the Amalekites, and He wants us to deal with our flesh.</p>
<p>God condemns the evil aspects of the flesh, but He also rejects the good aspects of the flesh. Man can commit evil sins by the flesh, and he can also seek to serve God by the flesh (Phil. 3:3-4). God is offended by sins in the flesh, and He abhors our service to Him in the flesh. God condemns the flesh, and those in the flesh cannot please God (Rom. 8:8). If we want to live in the spirit, serve God in spirit, or please God, we must deal with the flesh and put off the flesh.</p>
<p>We can deal with the flesh and put off the flesh only through the cross of Christ. Galatians 5:24 says, &ldquo;They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts.&rdquo; Christ condemned and crucified the flesh on the cross. We must accept, believe, confess, and apply this fact to our flesh and to everything related to our flesh by the power of the Holy Spirit (v. 16). Objectively, we must believe that the flesh has been crucified on the cross of Christ, and subjectively, we must put to death our flesh with its passions and lusts by the power of the Holy Spirit. This is the way to deal with and put off our flesh. Putting to death our flesh and everything of the flesh by the Spirit, according to the fact accomplished by the cross of Christ, is the way to deal with the flesh and put off the flesh.</p>
<p>We must believe that the cross of Christ has crucified the flesh, and by the Spirit we must put to death the flesh with its passions and lusts under the crucifixion of the cross. Merely believing that the cross of Christ has crucified the flesh will not enable us to deal with the flesh or to put off the flesh. We must apply to our flesh the fact that the cross of Christ has crucified our flesh. We can deal with and put off the flesh only when we apply the crucifixion of Christ to our flesh by the Spirit, that is, when we let the crucifixion of Christ put our flesh and everything of the flesh to death. The experience of dealing with the flesh and putting off the flesh is through the cross of Christ and depends on the cross of Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Cross &nbsp; pg 49</div><br></body></html>
