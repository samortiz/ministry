   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Joseph had been very concerned for his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>His concern for them is seen in the fact that he charged them not to quarrel with one another on the way home 45:24, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates that they had been quarreling.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through the various tests Joseph exercised discipline over his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Reuben or Levi might have said, "Throughout our entire life we were never disciplined as much as we were in these last months."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They were disciplined by the patient and wise Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everything Joseph did in relation to his brothers was not for himself, but for them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this we see Joseph's perfection in life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, his perfection was not for himself, but for his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He exercised patience and applied great wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He constantly controlled his emotion and, prior to chapter forty-five, he did not weep regarding his brothers except privately after he had seen Benjamin 43:29-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although he had great emotion, he was not controlled by it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our married life we need to learn to control our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some say that to overcome our besetting sin is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But this is not as difficult as controlling our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To overcome your emotion is the most difficult thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Are you able to control yourself when you are about to lose your temper?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this matter we all must learn of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When his emotion was about to burst forth at seeing Benjamin, he turned aside to weep privately and to wash his face.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Likewise, if you are about to lose your temper at home, you should go to the rest room, let out your feelings privately, and then wash your face.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not think that this discipline is for the older people but not for the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Joseph was still in his thirties when he exercised control of his emotions regarding his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the most, he was in middle age.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, you should not excuse yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever you are about to lose your temper, remember what Joseph did.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When some hear this, they may say, "Brother Lee, didn't you say that the resurrection life within us is able to overcome everything?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why do we need to turn aside from others when we are about to lose control of our emotion?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The reason is that your natural life is so strong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not want simply to tell you the story of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My burden is that we would see the life Joseph lived.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Joseph's life his temper, disposition, emotion, intention, and desire were all under the control of God's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Joseph may have said, "God didn't lead me to acknowledge my brothers earlier than I did.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I had no freedom to behave otherwise.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I had to conduct myself according to the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I certainly wanted to reveal myself to them immediately and have them bring my father to me as soon as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the choice was not up to me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was a matter of the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I had to do what was best for my brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the Lord's leading, I had to put them to the test."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The result of the way Joseph revealed himself to his brothers was excellent and blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the time Joseph revealed himself to them, the atmosphere was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In that atmosphere it was easy for him to forgive them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, however, within Joseph there was not the thought of forgiving them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He fully understood that it was the sovereign God, not his brothers, who had brought him to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because his dealing with his brothers was full of patience, wisdom, and self-control, the result was so excellent that he did not even need to forgive them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Realizing that God had sovereignly sent him to Egypt to fulfill His purpose, he spontaneously received his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He embraced them and took them in.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we are under the control of life in patience and in wisdom, we shall be like Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We shall not blame or condemn anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There will not even be the need to forgive others because we shall not blame them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We shall be willing to accept everyone and we shall have a broad heart to embrace all the weaker ones, even those who have seriously offended us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, instead of feeling that we have been offended, we shall realize that everything that has happened to us was according to God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everything under God's sovereignty is for our good, for the fulfillment of His purpose, and for the edification of others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because Joseph was sold by his brothers, good came to them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Through all their dealings with Joseph, the brothers were educated and edified.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, the issue of the whole matter was excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Joseph not only carried out God's eternal purpose, but also built up his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we bring these matters regarding Joseph into our prayer and fellowship, we shall see more and we shall be nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Furthermore, we shall learn how to behave in every situation.</S>
