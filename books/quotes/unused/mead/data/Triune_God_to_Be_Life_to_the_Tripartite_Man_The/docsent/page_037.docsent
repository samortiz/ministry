   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>of the Consummated Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>from the Bondage, the Slavery, of Sin,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>the Law of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We, as God's redeemed people, are saved in the divine life of Christ by the release of the law of the consummated Spirit from the bondage, the slavery, of sin, the law of sin Rom 8:2 .</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The release from the bondage, the slavery, of sin, the law of sin, is the goal of the law of the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But in order for the law of the consummated Spirit to operate, there is the need of our cooperation by setting our mind on the mingled spirit v. 6b and by walking according to the mingled spirit v. 4 .</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This consummated Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through the final step of resurrection, the process was completed, and the Spirit was consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This consummated Spirit can bring the divine life into us to regenerate us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before incarnation, the Spirit of God had no qualification or position to impart God's life into us because our sins had not yet been dealt with according to God's righteous requirements.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to be saved from the present age of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be occupied with different department store sales annuls our being holy and promotes our being common, worldly, and modern according to the style of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to be saved from the style of this world by a holy separation.</S>
