Titus-to Maintain the Order of the Church</h2><p>The purpose of the book of Titus is to maintain the order of the church. It was written to assure that a local church would have a proper order.<p>The unveiling of God&#8217;s dispensation concerning the church in 1 Timothy, the inoculation against the decline of the church in 2 Timothy, and the maintaining of the order of the church in Titus are three aspects of one purpose: that is, to preserve the church as the proper expression of the Triune God, as symbolized by the golden lampstands in the ultimate portion of the divine revelation (Rev. 1:12, 20). For the accomplishment of this purpose, the following basic and crucial things are stressed repeatedly in these three books:<p class=otl1>1)<p class=otl1t>The faith, the contents of the complete gospel according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy; hence, it is objective, as mentioned in 1 Timothy 1:19; 2:7; 3:9; 4:1, 6; 5:8; 6:10, 12, 21; 2 Timothy 2:18; 3:8; 4:7; Titus 1:13.<p class=otl1>2)<p class=otl1t>The truth, the reality of the contents of the faith, as mentioned in 1 Timothy 2:4, 7; 3:15; 4:3; 6:5; 2 Timothy 2:15, 18, 25; 3:7, 8; 4:4; Titus 1:1, 14.<p class=otl1>3)<p class=otl1t>Healthy teaching, in 1 Timothy 1:10; 2 Timothy 4:3; Titus 1:9; 2:1; healthy words, in 1 Timothy 6:3; 2 Timothy 1:13; healthy speech, in Titus 2:8; healthy in the faith and in faith, in Titus 1:13; 2:2. All these are related to the condition of life.<p class=otl1>4)<p class=otl1t>Life, the eternal life of God, in 1 Timothy 1:16; 6:12, 19; 2 Timothy 1:1, 10; Titus 1:2; 3:7.<p class=otl1>5)<p class=otl1t>Godliness, a living that is the expression of God, as mentioned in 1 Timothy 2:2, 10 (godly); 3:16; 4:7, 8; 5:4; 6:3, 5, 6, 11; 2 Timothy 3:5, 12 (godly); Titus 1:1; 2:12 (godly). The opposite, ungodliness, is mentioned in 1 Timothy 1:9 (ungodly); 2 Timothy 2:16; Titus 2:12.<p class=otl1>6)<p class=otl1t>Faith, our act of believing in the gospel, in God, and in His word and deed; hence, it is subjective, as mentioned in 1 Timothy 1:2, 4, 5, 14, 19; 2:15; 3:13; 4:12; 6:11; 2 Timothy 1:5, 13; 2:22; 3:10, 15; Titus 1:1, 4; 2:2; 3:15.<p class=otl1>7)<p class=otl1t>Conscience, the leading part of our spirit, which justifies or condemns our relationships with God and with man, as mentioned in 1 Timothy 1:5, 19; 3:9; 4:2; 2 Timothy 1:3; Titus 1:15.<p>The faith equals the economy, the household administration, the dispensation, of God. The truth is the contents, the reality, of the faith according to God&#8217;s economy. Healthy teachings, healthy words, and healthy speech are the ministry of the truth, ministering to people the reality of the divine truths. Eternal life is the means and power to carry out the divine realities of the faith. Godliness is a living that expresses the divine reality, an expression of God in all His riches. Faith (subjective) is the response to the truth of the faith (objective), receiving and participating in the divine realities. Conscience is a test and check to preserve us in the faith.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
