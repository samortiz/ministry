<h2 class="head1">I. AN INADVISABLE EATING</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Not According to Love That Builds Up</h2><p>In 8:1 Paul says, &ldquo;Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.&rdquo; In this chapter two Greek words are used for know. One is <i>oida</i> (vv. 1, 4), signifying the inward, subjective consciousness, the intuitive knowledge, as used in John 8:55 (the second one); 1 Corinthians 12:2; 2 Timothy 1:12; 3:14-15. It is the root from which the word for conscience is derived. The other is <i>ginosko</i> (vv. 2-3), signifying the outward, objective knowledge. The word knowledge in verse 1 and in verses 7 and 10 is the noun form of <i>ginosko,</i> referring to the outward, objective knowledge, which is common and general to all.</p><p>The outward, objective knowledge that puffs up comes from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, the source of death. The spiritual, not fleshly, love, which is an expression of life as described in chapter thirteen, builds up. It comes from the tree of life, the source of life. This is the love of God (1 John 4:16) infused into us by faith which has brought us into the organic union with God. By this love we love God (1 Cor. 8:3) and the brothers (1 John 4:21), and according to this love we should walk (Rom. 14:15). Thus, our walk builds up (1 Cor. 10:23). The expression &ldquo;builds up&rdquo; in this verse refers not only to the edification of individual believers, but also to the building up of the corporate Body of Christ (14:4-5, 12; Eph. 4:16). This book stresses the matter of building up (3:9-10, 12; 10:23).</p><p>We have pointed out that the knowledge which puffs up and the love which builds up are related to the two trees in the garden of Eden. Knowledge here refers to the tree of knowledge, and love refers to the tree of life. When Paul wrote this Epistle, he probably had such an understanding of these two trees. Furthermore, in this book these two trees are illustrated, although there is no direct mention of them. Actually 1 Corinthians deals with the tree of life which supplies life and the tree of knowledge which kills. Thus, in this book there are two lines, the line of life and the line of knowledge. Knowledge puffs up and even kills, but love supplies life and builds up others with life. Life is for the building, and the building is accomplished by life.</p><p>Verses 2 and 3 say, &ldquo;If anyone thinks that he knows anything, he does not yet know as he ought to know; but if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him.&rdquo; In these verses the Greek word for know is <i>ginosko.</i> The love spoken of in verse 3 is the highest and noblest love. It must be spiritual, not fleshly, although it involves the exercise of man&rsquo;s entire being (Mark 12:30).</p><p>In verse 3 Paul seems to be telling the Corinthians that they do not need so much knowledge; instead, they need to love God. Loving God is the base of our Christian life. If we do not have such a love, we do not have the standing, the base, for the Christian life. As far as the Christian life is concerned, knowledge is like a vapor; it can disappear quickly. Loving God, however, is solid and substantial. Hence, it is the base of the Christian life.</p><p>In verse 3 Paul says that if we love God, we are known by Him. It is more necessary for us to be known by God than for us to know God. The expression &ldquo;known by Him&rdquo; is very meaningful. To be known by God means to be owned and possessed by Him. The one who is known by God becomes God&rsquo;s possession, joy, entertainment, and pleasure. Our knowledge does not please God. But if we love God, we shall make Him happy. He will know us, enjoy us, and be happy with us. He will even find in us His entertainment. All this is implied by the words &ldquo;known by Him.&rdquo;</p><p>In verse 3 Paul seems to be telling the Corinthians, &ldquo;You believers at Corinth need to realize that God does not know you. He is not pleased with you. To say that God does not know you means that He does not approve of your way.&rdquo; According to Matthew 7:22, many will say to the Lord Jesus at the time of His coming again, &ldquo;Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name do many works of power?&rdquo; The Lord will answer, &ldquo;I never knew you; depart from Me, workers of lawlessness&rdquo; (v. 23). How can the omnipotent and omnipresent Lord say that He does not know someone when He knows everything about us? The reason the Lord can say such a thing is that the statement, &ldquo;I never knew you,&rdquo; in Matthew 7:23 means, &ldquo;I never approved of what you have done. I was never happy with you or took you as My joy and treasure.&rdquo; To be known by God implies that He approves of us, enjoys us, and possesses us as a treasure.</p>
