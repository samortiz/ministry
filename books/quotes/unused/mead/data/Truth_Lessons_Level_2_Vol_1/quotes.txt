[1]  Although man did not have the divine life, he did have a spirit within him Job 32:8 .
[2]  Just as man could receive the tree of life by eating, so also he could receive the tree of the knowledge of good and evil by eating.
[3]  Hence, in this covenant, God especially warned man to reject the tree of the knowledge of good and evil lest the evil, poisonous element of Satan enter into man and be joined and mingled with man, thus damaging the upright and pure man whom God created for His eternal purpose.
[4]  Fire in the Bible always refers to the holiness of God.
[5]  Because God is a consuming fire Deut 4:24; 9:3; Heb 12:29 , anything common, unclean, or sinful is consumed by Him Lev 10 .
[6]  WITH FALLEN MAN OUTLINE The One who made the covenant Jehovah: Coming to the place of fallen man.
[7]  The one with whom the covenant was made fallen man: Transgressing God s prohibition.
[8]  After man s fall, there was a great change in man: man had the knowledge of good and evil Gen 3:22a .
[9]  Both the knowledge of good and the knowledge of evil came from the same tree, the same source, which is Satan as the source of sin and death, causing man not to depend on God but to be independent of God.
[10]  Because the contents of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are all things apart from God, its nature is death, its principle is independence, and, surely, its ultimate result is man s separation from God and the bringing in of death.
[11]  It was with such a man who transgressed God s prohibition, who had sin and death, who had the knowledge of good and evil, and who knew his nakedness and made skirts of leaves to cover the shame, that God made the second covenant with man.
[12]  In this covenant God also required the man to labor and sweat until he should return to the ground.
[13]  To the man God said, Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee...in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground Gen 3:17-19, ASV .
[14]  After man s fall, God immediately came to make a covenant with man, giving man the promise of redemption and using suffering to restrict and protect man that the existence of the human race might be preserved until the coming of God s salvation.
[15]  Moreover, by faith he presented to God a sacrifice with the shedding of blood as an offering and was accepted by God.
[16]  Noah was also a herald of righteousness 2 Pet 2:5 .
[17]  Because he preached righteousness and lived a righteous life to protest against the unrighteous, ungodly, and evil generation, he was spared from God s governmental judgment according to God s righteousness.
[18]  THE CONTENTS OF THE COVENANT A. Man to Be Fruitful, Multiply,
[19]  In the covenant which He made with Noah and his sons, God first told them to be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth.
[20]  When God created man, He blessed man, telling him to be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth that the whole earth might be filled with beautiful faces expressing God.
[21]  Now that God had saved Noah s family of eight through water and had brought them into a new age, He made another covenant with man and He blessed man in order to continue the purpose of His creation of man, telling man to be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth that man might be brought back to His original intention and that His will might be accomplished in the man who was saved through water.
[22]  E. God No More to Destroy the Earth by a Flood
[23]  Although Noah s household of eight persons came out of the ark, they must still have been fearful, not knowing whether God would again destroy the earth and man and all living creatures upon it by the waters of a flood, whether God would again allow them to encounter such a terrible catastrophe.
[24]  In this covenant God said repeatedly that there would not be a flood anymore in order to take away Noah and his family s fear, that they might hold on to the word of the covenant and have peace because of the covenant.
[25]  WITH THE CALLED ONE OUTLINE The One who made the covenant Jehovah: Jehovah.
[26]  While Abram was living in Ur, the God of glory suddenly appeared to him, telling him to go out of his land and from his relatives Acts 7:2-3 .
[27]  Because he lacked boldness, he did not answer God s call immediately.
[28]  Although God raised up an environment in which, by His sovereign hand, He took away Haran, Abram s brother Gen 11:28 , Abram still delayed and would not take action.
[29]  God also promised that He would bless those who bless Abram and would curse those who curse him Gen 12:3 .
[30]  God promised Abram not only that he would bear a son of himself but that his seed would be as many as the stars in heaven Gen 15:5 .
[31]  God promised once again to give the whole land of Canaan to Abraham and to his seed as their eternal possession Gen 17:8 .
[32]  While God was faithful to His covenant, Abraham was not faithful because he had used his natural strength with Hagar to produce Ishmael, rather than begetting a son through Sarah according to the grace of God s promise Gen 16 .
[33]  In this stage God did not appear to Abraham as the God of glory or as the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth, nor did He come to him as El-Shaddai; He came to visit him in the form of a mortal man to be his friend James 2:23; Isa 41:8; 2 Chron 20:7 and to have sweet fellowship with him.
[34]  God made a covenant with Abraham at six different times, the contents of which mainly included the following items: first, God would make him a great nation, and nations would be made of him and kings would come out of him; second, God would bless him and make his name great; third, God would give the land of Canaan to him and to his seed for an eternal possession; fourth, God would cause Sarah, his wife, to bear a son, would multiply his seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is upon the seashore, and would make him the father of many nations and Sarah, a mother of nations; and fifth, God would give him the promise of grace that all the nations of the earth might be blessed in him and in his seed.
[35]  WHO DID NOT KNOW THEMSELVES OUTLINE The One who made the covenant Jehovah: The One who set up the Passover to redeem the children of Israel.
[36]  After the fall of Adam, God revealed the way of His redemption to man, showing him that he could not be justified by God by his own works and that only by offering the sacrifices with the shedding of blood could he be acceptable to God Gen 4:3-4 .
[37]  The children of Israel did not know the grace of God.
[38]  The statutes, or laws, regulations, set forth, explain in detail, and supplement the ten basic commandments.
[39]  Their stress is on man s worship and service to God and on the rituals and regulations related to man s relationship with God.
[40]  To illustrate, Exodus 20:22-26 sets forth the prohibition against making idols and the regulations regarding the building of an altar for the worship of God; Leviticus 1 through 7 explain in detail the way to present offerings to God.
[41]  THE CONSUMMATION OF THE COVENANT A. By the Offering of Burnt Offerings
[42]  The burnt offering signifies that Christ lived a life on earth that was absolutely for God, offering Himself without blemish and spot to God to fully satisfy God s desire.
[43]  The peace offering signifies that Christ shed His blood and died for man to become the peace between man and God, that God may have harmony and fellowship with man and that God and man may enjoy peace together.
[44]  WHO WENT TO INHERIT THE LAND OUTLINE The One who made the covenant Jehovah: The One who brought the children of Israel from Egypt to Mount Sinai.
[45]  Although the old generation saw the glory of God and the signs which He did in Egypt and in the wilderness, they murmured again and again Num 11:1, 4-6 , tempted God and did not listen to His voice Num 14:22 , and even despised Him in that they did not believe in His promise of the land of Canaan to them Num 13:25-33; 14:1-10 .
[46]  B. If They Would Keep the Words of the Covenant
[47]  and Do Them, They Would Live and Be Blessed
[48]  If they would keep the words of the covenant and do them, they would live and be blessed, prosper in all things, multiply, and prolong their days Deut 29:9; 30:16, 20 .
[49]  Jehovah God is the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His lovingkindness to a thousand generations with those who love Him and keep His commandments, but repays those who hate Him to their face, to destroy them Deut 7:9-10 .
[50]  Therefore, if they would keep the words of the covenant and do them, God would love them and bless them that they might be blessed in the good land which they would enter to possess.
[51]  If the children of Israel would take God s word of blessing to heart in the land of captivity, and if they would return to Jehovah their God and obey His voice with all their heart and with all their soul, Jehovah God would return and have compassion upon them, restoring them and gathering them from all the peoples where He had scattered them.
[52]  They were cursed and suffered calamities, and God delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until He had cast them out of His sight 2 Kings 17:20 .
[53]  They have been carried away to the nations and scattered among the peoples, suffering man s mistreatment and persecution, for nearly two thousand six hundred years, just as God spoke through Jeremiah, I will even give them up to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them Jer 24:9, ASV .
[54]  The covenant which God made with David was included in the covenant which God made with Abraham.
[55]  God promised David that if his seed would commit iniquity, He would chasten his seed, but His lovingkindness would not depart from his seed 2 Sam 7:14b-15 .
[56]  It is hard to imagine that such a one as Solomon, to whom God had given the surpassing wisdom, and who was such a king who had built the holy temple after God s heart, could lust after foreign wives, allow them to lead him away from God to follow them in worshipping idols, and thus provoke God to anger 1 Kings 11:9 to the extent that God would tear the kingdom away from his son 1 Kings 11:12 .
[57]  TRUTH LESSONS LEVEL TWO LESSON EIGHT THE NEW COVENANT WHICH
[58]  GOD MADE WITH ALL SINNERS OUTLINE The One who made the covenant the Lord Jesus and God: The Lord Jesus.
[59]  Since fallen sinners have the sin which they inherited by birth and the sins which they committed themselves, they have fallen under God s judgment and condemnation and have become persons who should die and perish.
[60]  Originally man was created in the image of God to express Him and to represent Him.
[61]  Hence, man comes short of the glory of God Rom 3:23 and offends God s righteous law Rom 3:20 .
[62]  This word immediately follows the preceding text, indicating that it is according to the law of life that God is God to us and that we are a people to Him.
[63]  This means that because the divine life enters into us to quicken our spirit, we can use our spirit to worship God, enjoy God, and fellowship with God John 4:24 .
[64]  But today under the new covenant, God is God to us not according to the law of letters but according to the inward law of life, and we are His people not according to any regulations written on tablets of stone but according to the laws inscribed in our hearts.
[65]  THE CONSUMMATION OF THE COVENANT A. With Better Sacrifices
[66]  The old covenant was consummated through the sacrifice of bulls and goats as burnt offerings and peace offerings Exo 24:4-5 ; the new covenant was consummated through the offering of Jesus Christ Himself as the sacrifice Heb 9:14, 23; 10:12 .
[67]  As Christ is the eternal Son of the living God incarnated to be the Son of Man, who offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit, so His sacrifices are better than all the sacrifices of the old covenant.
[68]  Bulls and goats as sacrifices were shadows which could never take away sins Heb 10:11 , but He as the sacrifices is the reality of the shadows, and He has put away sin once for all, thus finding an eternal redemption Heb 9:26, 12 , fully satisfying God s desire, and enabling the believers in Him to have peace and fellowship with God that both God and man may be satisfied Rom 5:1; Col 1:20-22; 2 Cor 5:18-19 .
[69]  The sphere of His work of the old creation was the old heaven and old earth of His original creation Gen 1:1 ; the sphere of His work of the new creation is the new heaven and new earth, which are the original God-created heaven and earth that have become old and that will be renewed through the burning of God s judging fire 2 Pet 3:13; Rev 21:1 .
[70]  Although God s intention was that man should receive Him as life, Adam did not receive the tree of life; instead, he disobeyed God s prohibition and took in the tree of the knowledge of good and evil Gen 3:6 , receiving into himself the satanic elements of sin and death.
[71]  In order that the fallen man might receive His redemption in Christ, God came to the place of the fallen man to seek him and to call him.
[72]  Moreover, He promised that Christ would come as the seed of the woman and as the redemptive sacrifice, shedding His blood to make redemption for sins and imparting His life to rescue the fallen man, that the fallen man might have the life of God and become God s expression for the fulfillment of God s eternal economy.
[73]  Adam believed God s promise, and God made coats of skins of the sacrifice for him and his wife and clothed them to cover their nakedness Gen 3:21 .
[74]  The skin of the sacrifice typifies Christ, who died and shed His blood to make redemption for sinners, as the righteousness of those who believe, that fallen sinners might be justified and accepted by God and have fellowship with God.
[75]  He not only realized that man s emptiness and fragility needed the enjoyment of God s riches, but he also walked with God; that is, he was not presumptuous, and he did not do things according to his own concept and desire, but he took God as his center and everything, living and doing things according to God and with God.
[76]  G. That the Man Who Fell from God s Government
[77]  According to Genesis 2, after God created man, He put man in front of Himself to be under His direct government Gen 2:8, 15 , to live before Him and to be responsible to Him.
[78]  J. The Fourth Step of Man s Fall Worshipping
[79]  He openly and outwardly rejected God, worshipping as idols people and things outside of God.
[80]  However, because fallen man did not know his own weakness and corruption and therefore did not realize his impotence and his need of God s grace, God temporarily changed the way of His work of the new creation on the fallen man of the old creation.
[81]  The positive function of the God-given law was, on the one hand, to keep the chosen people of God in custody for fifteen hundred years, and, on the other hand, to provide them with a child-conductor.
[82]  God originally did not have the intention to deal with man according to the law; rather, the law was added because of man s fall and corruption.
[83]  God s intention in setting up this dispensation of law according to His economy was to accomplish the following things through the law; first, to keep the chosen people in custody that they might satisfy the requirements of the law through the offerings, which typified Christ, and thereby be guarded, as sheep are guarded in the sheepfold; second, to provide the chosen people with a child-conductor that they might be led to Christ, that through the offerings they might be forgiven, and that through the tabernacle and temple they might enjoy God s riches; and third, to cause the chosen people to have the knowledge of sin and of themselves, and thereby realize and sense their need of God s grace.
[84]  TRUTH LESSONS LEVEL TWO LESSON ELEVEN FOUR DISPENSATIONS OF GOD S WORK OF THE NEW CREATION
[85]  ON THE MAN OF THE OLD CREATION 3 THE DISPENSATION OF GRACE OUTLINE The Triune God becoming flesh in the Son.
[86]  The Triune God passing through human living in humanity.
[87]  In time, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit of God in the womb of a chaste virgin and was born as a God-man Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20 , who is both the complete God Rom 9:5 and the perfect Man Matt 1:1 .
[88]  He was the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9; John 16:15a , He was the tabernacle of God and the temple of God John 1:14a; 2:21 , He was coinherent with the Father John 14:10a, 11a; 17:21 , He was one with the Father John 10:30; 17:22 , He had the Father with Him John 8:29; 16:32 , He lived because of the Father John 6:57a , He was anointed with the Spirit by the Father Matt 3:16-17; Luke 4:18a , He worked with the Father John 14:10b; 5:17, 19 , He did things in the name of the Father John 10:25 , He did the Father s will John 5:30; 6:38 , He spoke the Father s word John 14:24; 7:16-17; 12:49-50 , He sought the Father s glory John 7:18 , and He expressed the Father John 14:7-9 .
[89]  In order to bring grace and reality to man, the Triune God needed not only to become flesh in the Son and to pass through human living in humanity, but also to pass through the death of the cross in humanity.
[90]  His death was not the death of an ordinary man; it was the death of a God-man, and it was all-inclusive.
[91]  God s eternal desire is to gain a group of people in the universe, the saved ones throughout the generations, that they may be the Body of Christ as a vessel to express Christ and that He Himself also may be expressed in Christ.
[92]  In the dispensation of grace God obtains all those who believe into Christ in the New Testament as the third part and the majority of the new race in God s new creation, signified by the sun with which the universal woman is clothed in Revelation 12, for the accomplishment of the constitution of the New Jerusalem to be God s ultimate and full expression in eternity.
[93]  ON THE MAN OF THE OLD CREATION 4 THE DISPENSATION OF THE KINGDOM OUTLINE Rewarding, according to righteousness, the just men perfected in the Old Testament.
[94]  The Lord will give us a reward according to righteousness.
[95]  In the New Testament, the most obvious example in pursuing the reward is Paul.
[96]  V. COMPLETING GOD S WORK OF THE NEW CREATION
[97]  The dispensation of the kingdom, which is the dispensation of righteousness, is only an age of restoration Acts 3:21 , and as such it is still a dispensation in the old heaven and old earth of the old creation.
