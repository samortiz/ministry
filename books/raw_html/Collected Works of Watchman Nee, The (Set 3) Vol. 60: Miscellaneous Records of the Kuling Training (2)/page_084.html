<h2 class="head1">DRUNK WITH THE BLOOD OF THE SAINTS</h2><p>Revelation 17:6 says, "And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus." It is a gruesome thing to drink human blood until one is drunk, but this is the very characteristic of the Roman Catholic Church. There is extreme cruelty in the Catholic Church; it is willing to resort to any means to annihilate genuine believers. The Lord charges us only to bless, not to curse. But the Roman Catholic Church is full of curses. It pronounces anathemas on all kinds of beliefs. It considers all believers of heresies to be accursed. When it calls someone a heretic, it means he is a believer of the Bible. At the Council of Trent one archbishop stood up and said, "We anathematize everything that is different from us." All the other bishops echoed by saying, "Let it be accursed!" They did this at the end of every meeting. What a pitiful situation!</p><p>Luke 9 says that as the days were being fulfilled for Jesus to be taken up, He steadfastly set His face toward Jerusalem. When they reached a village in Samaria, the people there did not receive them. James and John, His two disciples saw this, and they said, "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?" The Lord said, "You do not know of what kind of spirit you are" (vv. 51-55). This means they did not know what they were saying. When the disciples saw evidences of persecution, their spirits reacted strongly. They wanted to curse, but the Lord stopped them. With the Roman Catholic Church, however, every Thursday evening the pope reads twenty-seven anathemas. Everything that is different from Catholicism is anathematized. These twenty-seven anathemas are further divided into finer points. Hence, in reality there are more than twenty-seven clauses. After the pronouncement, the anathemas are set on fire, and the fire is cast into the earth with the words: "To die eternally, as this fire." Fulota (?) said that the end of those who believe in heresy is death, while Kerdiluma (?) said, "We will never have mercy on those who hold different beliefs than we do. We have to try them and consider them as Sin incarnated."</p><p>Before the Reformation, there was the Inquisition. Countless numbers of people from many countries died under its hand. Those taken before the Inquisition were subjected to all kinds of torture. The Catholics thought that pain was the only way to recover these ones. They erected many gallows and wrenched the tormented ones with ropes until all the bones in their bodies were broken. Sometimes they nailed men's feet to the floor, hung their upper bodies from the beams, and then wrung them with ropes until all their bones were dislocated. At other times they poured boiling oil into men's mouths. We can never imagine the cruelty our brothers in ancient days suffered.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PERSECUTION IN MADRID</h2><p>In Madrid during the first twelve months of the persecution, 10,220 people died. At that time the church did not kill anyone; it merely ordered the local government to execute the killing. Thomas Aquinas believed that the church had the authority to hang the heretics and put them to death in order to preserve the purity of the church. He said, "On the one hand we must not tolerate the heretics, and they should receive just recompense for their sins. But we should also be merciful to them and exhort them twice. Perhaps they can be brought back to the faith of the church. If after the second admonition they still persist in their errors, they must not only be excommunicated but must be destroyed by handing them over to the secular officers." The church would not execute the murder; it handed the job to local officials. The Roman Catholic Church openly claims that the words of Aquinas are the direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit. After the time of Martin Luther, all the bishops had to swear to do their best to persecute those who held different beliefs. All the bishops had to make such a vow before the pope. The Roman Catholic Church canon law says that five popes have ordered the secular rulers of all countries to destroy those who hold different beliefs.</p><p>In 1872 the London Times reported that the Roman Catholic Church believed that anyone who killed under the instruction of a priest was not considered a murderer. On July 13, 1895, the same newspaper reported a speech by the pope in which he said that it was a good deed to kill a Protestant. Such an act could absolve the murderer of the sin of killing a Catholic. The Catholic Church set up cellars in Madrid, in which they packed men with dissenting beliefs. Some had just died, while others could only be identified by their skeletons. There were young men and women, as well as old people. Some were chained in complete nakedness. Within the cells were all kinds of torture instruments. One of the great and spacious halls there was filled with human bones.</p>
