<h1 class="title">TOUCHING THE BIBLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to fellowship concerning touching the Bible. We must understand that the Bible is the embodiment of the Spirit of God. Hence, when we open the Bible, we must maintain an attitude of contacting the Spirit. We must always use our spirit when we read the Bible. This is the positive aspect of touching the Bible.</p>
<p>Contacting the Spirit in the Bible with our spirit requires a substantial effort. This is not an easy matter for believers who are new to the Bible. Using our spirit to contact the Spirit through reading the Bible involves learning some necessary skills. When believers who are spiritually young begin to practice this, there are many encumbrances that must be overcome.</p>
<p>When the limiting factors are reduced, our ability to touch the Spirit is increased. These factors can be likened to heavy loads that press down on a person and hinder his ability to move forward. As the loads are taken away, his ability to move forward gradually increases. When all the loads have been completely removed, he will be able to move freely. This principle applies to using our spirit to contact the Spirit while reading the Bible. After the limiting factors have been removed, we will be able to reach a higher level when we read the Bible. However, it is not so easy to deal with these limiting factors.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIMITATIONS TO CONTACTING<br />
THE SPIRIT OF GOD WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We may read the Bible many times, but our spirit will not necessarily touch the Spirit because there are many limitations within us. In other words, there are many things that press down on us. Unless these limiting factors are removed, we will be unable to rise up. Every time a limitation is removed, we will rise up a little higher. When all the limitations are taken away, we will be fully released. When the apostle Paul read the Scriptures, he used his spirit to contact the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6). There was nothing oppressing him, and he was free from every encumbrance. Having broken away from every earthly encumbrance, he was able to exercise his spirit.</p>
<p>A new believer is restricted by a number of things within him that have not been dealt with. Suppose a new believer is illiterate. He knows that God gave him the Bible and that God can be contacted in the Bible. However, he is unable to use his spirit to touch the Spirit in the Bible, because he is restricted by his inability to read. This brother would need to expend a substantial amount of effort in order to learn to read so that he can read and understand the words in the Bible. This is the way for him to remove this restriction. When he begins to read, he will be able to touch the Spirit with his spirit. The sense in our spirit must pass through the other parts of our being. If we do not understand the words we read, we will not be able to comprehend the sense in our spirit. This means that the sense in our spirit must pass through our mind. Hence, it is difficult for a person who is limited in his ability to read to understand God&rsquo;s Word and to receive inspiration in his spirit; it is difficult for him to contact the Spirit.</p>
<p>Our inability to touch the Spirit when we read the Bible should help us realize that there are limitations within us. Now we will consider some limitations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Problems of Our Heart</h2>
<p>The first limitation we encounter is related to our heart. Our heart is rather complicated and has many problems. The first problem is a heart that veers toward something other than God. A person with such a heart will not receive inspiration. It is true that when we read the Bible, we must use our spirit to contact the Spirit. However, no matter how resolute we may be, as soon as our heart leans toward something other than God, we will not receive inspiration. Our heart must be adjusted; otherwise, there will be no enlightenment from the Spirit.</p>
<p>The second problem is having an indifferent heart. Although we may read the Bible, we may have an indifferent attitude toward God and His Word. When we are indifferent, our heart falls short in its pursuit of God&rsquo;s Word. Even though our heart may not lean toward things other than God, we may have no heart for God, be indifferent toward Him, and not care for the meaning of the words we read. In this situation we will not be able to understand the Bible. This principle is not relative but absolute.</p>
<p>The third problem is a divided heart. This means that a believer wants God, yet he does not want Him. It seems as if he has no heart for God, but he still has a little heart for God. It seems as though he does not obey God, but he does obey. Such a believer has many considerations other than God and always considers the price he must pay. This situation is what the Bible calls &ldquo;double-souled&rdquo; (James 1:8; 4:8), that is, having two souls. God made man with one soul, consisting of the mind, emotion, and will. A double-souled person has a divided heart, a heart that is both for God and for the world. A person with a divided heart wants God and also other things. He wants to touch God&rsquo;s Word, but at the same time he has no firm desire. Such a believer can be likened to a light switch with a loose connection. When the switch is pressed down firmly, the light turns on, but once you take your finger off the switch, the light goes off. Only when the connection is firmly secured, will the light stay on. When our heart is divided, there is constant turmoil in our spirit. Our experience confirms this fact.</p>
<p>The fourth problem is a heart that is not absolute. Our heart may be undivided, but it is not absolute; it is not steadfast or firm. This kind of heart tends to be light and idle. The depth of our contact with God depends on the absoluteness of our heart. Our spirit always follows our heart. When our heart is not absolute, our spirit has no way to go on. We must understand that as long as there is any reservation in our heart, our ability to contact God will be limited. Hence, we need to deal with our heart.</p>
<p>The fifth problem is an agitated heart, a heart that cannot be calm. We all have experienced this. When we are disturbed, when something has stirred up our heart or agitated us, our Bible reading is negatively affected. Whenever we are disturbed, it is difficult for us to touch God in the Bible. Our moods can be likened to ocean waves that are constantly billowing up and down. No matter how serious a matter is, we should exercise to stay calm and steady. No matter how much turmoil there is in our environment, we must learn to contact God in His Word and to keep our heart calm and undisturbed. Every Christian must learn this lesson. We receive more help when we contact God in the Bible.</p>
<p>The sixth problem is a heart with worries and cares. When we have a problem or when there is turmoil in our environment, our heart is in a state of flux. At this time we need words from the Bible to comfort us. We all have experienced this. Whenever we are worried about something, such as our family or our career, we can gain much benefit from reading the Bible. The words in the Bible comfort us and become our salvation. Whereas it is one thing to receive help and salvation from God, it is another thing to touch God in our spirit. Sometimes we receive help from the words we read, but we may not touch God with our spirit. Consequently, it is possible for some believers to receive comfort from the Bible when they are afflicted and worried; however, when the difficulty passes, not much of the element of God has been imparted into them. They might remember how God&rsquo;s words comforted or helped them during their affliction, but they do not seem to gain the element of God. They were comforted by the Bible, but they did not touch the Spirit with their spirit.</p>
<p>Many famous sayings and proverbs in the world can also give comfort in times of affliction. We experienced this before we were saved. These sayings and proverbs, however, did not contain God. The way that some saints receive benefit from the Bible in times of difficulty is not any different from the help they could receive from worldly sayings and proverbs. They do not receive the element of God; instead, they receive some intellectual enlightenment or psychological fortification. They do not touch God.</p>
<p>The function of the Bible is to supply us with God. If we can learn to contact God&rsquo;s words with our spirit, then no matter what our situation is, the element of God will be imparted into us. We will not only receive comfort from His words; when the difficult situation is over, the element of God will remain in us; we will be more intimately related to God and mingled with Him.</p>
<p>We must deal with these six problems of the heart. If we have even one of these conditions, our spirit will not be able to rise up to contact God. We must deal with the problems of our heart one by one. We must deal with a heart that leans toward things other than God, an indifferent heart, a divided heart, and a heart that is not absolute, not calm, and full of worries and cares. Then it will be easy for our spirit to contact the Spirit. There are still other situations that can limit us, but these six items cover most of the problems related to the heart.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
