   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now, however, because our soul is being governed by the spirit, we can be freed from such disturbance.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Jesus said, "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls" Matt 11:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are willing to surrender to the Lord, willing to take His yoke, and willing to walk according to the His will, our soul will not be aroused.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are willing to imitate the Lord and if we will learn of Him, seeing how the Lord was despised by others and how the Lord followed not His own will but the will of God, then the turmoil in our soul will be calmed down.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reason sorrow and grief come is that we are not willing to be satisfied with the same kind of treatment that the Lord received and that we are not willing to submit to God's will and arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we put the soul-life to death and completely surrender to the Lord, our soul the soul with sensitive nerves will rest in the Lord and not misunderstand the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The soul under the control of the Holy Spirit is a soul of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once we were busy planning; now we quietly trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once we were often grieved and anxious; now we are like a weaned child resting in the bosom of the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once we were full of our own ideas, having many desires and ambitions; now we only consider the will of God to be good and thus rest in God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Truly, it is "perfect submission, perfect delight."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we completely give ourselves to the Lord, all things are peaceful and tranquil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ephesians 6:6 has a similar message: "But as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not as before, relying on the soul that is, self-relying to follow the will of God; rather, it is from the soul, to wholeheartedly, truly follow the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now, through the working of the cross, the soul-life that formerly rebelled against the will of God completely surrenders to the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Previously, we were merely on the outside, and if we were not carrying out our own affairs according to our own will, then we were doing God's will according to our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now however, we are one with God in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A soul governed by the Holy Spirit is not concerned for itself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Do not be anxious for your life soul " Matt 6:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now what we seek first is the kingdom of God and His righteousness, believing that God will take care of our daily needs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The soul-life has been dealt with through the cross by the Holy Spirit, so it can no longer be anxious for itself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Self-consciousness is the primary manifestation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since the believer has truly been in God and has lost the self, he can fully trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Self-love, self-planning, and self-care all works of the soul have now been removed in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, one no longer makes his own plans for these kinds of practical issues.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because the cross has done its work, we no longer busily plan for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Previously, we worried, but now, since knowing God, we can peacefully seek His kingdom and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we care for what God cares about, God will care for what we care about.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Previously, miracles were rare and strange to us; now we live in the God who performs miracles, knowing He will provide every need.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not by exercising the mind but by resting in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since the power of God serves as our backing, questions concerning our daily life such as eating and drinking become very insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"So then let those also who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator" 1 Pet 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sometimes people in the world only know God as the Creator and do not know Him as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The believers, however, not only know Him as the Father but also know Him as the Lord of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To speak of Him as the Lord of creation is to make His power known, to make known how the whole universe is under His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before, when we were suffering, we were afraid of man, but now we know that everything is in His hand and has His arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before, it was difficult to believe that none of the things in this world can move against His will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now we know that everything in the universe, whether of man, the natural, or supernatural, is in His careful and wise arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now we know that everything that comes upon us is permitted and predestinated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A soul governed by the Holy Spirit is a peaceful, quiet, and committing soul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only should we commit our soul to the Lord, but we should also love and long for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"My soul pursues after You" Psa 63:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now we no longer dare to have faith in ourselves, to be independent, or to serve the Lord according to the whims of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now, the One whom we follow is the Lord, and we very carefully, even with fear, follow hard after the Lord, not daring to leave Him for one moment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Someone translated this verse, "My soul is glued unto thee."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now we do not act alone but completely surrender to the Lord, not reluctantly but willingly with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now what we hate is the life of our self, and the One whom we completely love and long for is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This kind of person can only say, together with Mary, "My soul magnifies the Lord" Luke 1:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such a one is no longer openly or secretly puffed up and self-exalting, but knows himself to be useless and is willing to humble himself and exalt the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now he no longer wants to steal the Lord's glory and give it to the self soul , but he magnifies the Lord in his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the Lord is not being magnified in the soul, then the Lord is not being magnified in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only this kind of person considers his life soul of no account as if precious Acts 20:24 , but lays down his life soul for the brothers 1 John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the heart of loving oneself is not lost, then when the Lord calls us in reality to bear the cross for Him, we will shrink back.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because the soul-life is specifically rejected daily, one can, for the sake of the Lord, consider his life "of no account as if precious."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For even under normal daily situations, one must live as a martyr, willing to give his life to the cross, so that when the time comes, he can carry out that martyrdom for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because daily there is a life willing to be poured out for the brothers, not seeking one's own right or comfort but denying the self every day, one can "lay down his life on behalf of the brothers" in that special time and circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The real loving of the Lord and loving of the brothers comes from not loving the self.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A Christ who wanted to save Himself and pity Himself could not love us and die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If He "loved me," then He would give "Himself up for me."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The heart of love comes from the rejecting of the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The shedding of blood is the source of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This kind of living is the living wherein the soul prospers 3 John 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Prosperity comes not because one has gained anything but because one has lost everything.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, the soul-losing life is not a losing life because the soul is lost in God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The soul-life is restricting and selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The soul that is lost in the life of God lives in the unlimited life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is liberty, and this is prosperity.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The more loss we suffer, the more prosperous our gain will be.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our possessions are not measured by how much we receive but by how much we give.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the real fruitful living!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, forsaking the soul-life is not as quick as being delivered from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is our life, and every day we must be willing not to live by it but choose the life of God instead.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thus, the cross in us has to be borne faithfully each time more than the time before.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The time is still long.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, we should look away unto the Lord Jesus who, despising the shame, endured the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>"For compare Him...so that you may not grow weary, fainting in your souls" Heb 12:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The way His soul felt about the shame, despising it and enduring the cross, is the goal for those of us willing to tread the path of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>"Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name" Psa 103:1 .</S>
