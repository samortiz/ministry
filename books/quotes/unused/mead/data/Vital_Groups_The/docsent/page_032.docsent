   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LOVE BEING THE GREATEST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Love is not jealous, is not provoked, does not take account of evil, covers all things, endures all things, never falls away, and is the greatest 1 Cor 13:4-8, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jealousy is in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a new child is born in a family, the other child may become jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jealousy is also present in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One sister may be jealous of another sister because she receives many "amens" from the saints when she prays or prophesies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some brothers may be jealous when they see that another brother has been appointed into the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After being in the church life for over sixty years, I can testify that one of the hardest things is to appoint the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We realize that if we appoint a certain brother, another brother whom we do not feel to appoint may be stumbled because of jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a certain sister is asked to take the lead in a sisters' house, the others may become jealous, but love is not jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Also, love is not provoked.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>People are easily provoked because of the shortage of love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Regardless of how much we are rebuked, we will not be provoked if we are filled with the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Love does not take account of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to confess that we have taken account of other people's evil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some wives have a record, an account, of their husband's failures and defects.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This record may not be written but it is in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are taking account of their husband's evil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The elders need to realize that in their shepherding, they have to cover others' sins, not to take account of others' evils.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Love covers all things, not only the good things but also the bad things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whoever uncovers the defects, shortcomings, and sins of the members of the church is disqualified from the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our uncovering of the members under our eldership, our shepherding, annuls our qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Love also endures all things and never falls away.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Corinthians13 concludes by saying, "Now there abide faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>LOVE BEING THE CONCLUSION OF ALL SPIRITUAL VIRTUES AND THE FACTOR OF FRUIT-BEARING</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Love is the conclusion of all spiritual virtues and the factor of fruit-bearing that supplies us bountifully with the rich entrance into the kingdom of Christ 2 Pet 1:5-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE BODY BUILDING ITSELF UP IN LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Body of Christ builds itself up in love Eph 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The phrase in love is used repeatedly in the book of Ephesians 1:4; 3:17; 4:2, 15-16; 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God predestinated us unto sonship before the foundation of the world in love, and the Body of Christ builds itself up in love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The growth in life is in love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the last few years we have appreciated the Lord's showing us the high peak of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>My concern is that although we may talk about the truths of the high peak, love is absent among us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If this is the case, we are puffed up, not built up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Body of Christ builds itself up in love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>X. THE SPIRIT THAT GOD GIVES US BEING OF LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The spirit that God has given us is our human spirit regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This spirit is a spirit of love; hence, it is of power and of sobermindedness 2 Tim 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may think that we are very powerful and sober, but our spirit is not of love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We talk to people in a way that is full of power and sobermindedness, but our talk threatens them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul said that we need to fan our gift into flame v. 6 . The main gift which God has given us is our regenerated human spirit with His Spirit, His life, and His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must fan this gift into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that we have to stir up our spirit so that our spirit will be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Romans 12:11 says that we should be burning in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If our spirit is not a spirit of love, our fanning it into flame will burn the whole recovery in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must have a burning spirit of love, not a burning spirit of authority which damages.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whatever is mentioned in 2 Timothy is a requirement for us to face the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How can we overcome the degradation of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must have a burning human spirit of love.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Under today's degradation of the church, we all need a spirit of love fanned into flame to be burning in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Love prevails in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to my observation throughout the years, most of the co-workers have a human spirit of "power" but not of love.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need a spirit of love to conquer the degradation of today's church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not say or do anything to threaten people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead we should always say and do things with a spirit of love, which has been fanned into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is what the recovery needs.</S>
