   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From the Ages Hidden in God Who Created All Things</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Ephesians 3:9 Paul speaks of "the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's mystery is His hidden purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His purpose is to dispense Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, there is the dispensation of the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This mystery was hidden in God from the ages that is, from eternity and through all past ages, but now it has been brought to light to the New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we consider 3:9 in context, we shall see that there is a relationship between creation and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God created all things for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God created the heavens, the earth, and billions of items in order to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's intention in His creation of all things, including man, was that man would be mingled with God to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Zechariah 12:1 says that the Lord stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that the heavens are for the earth, that the earth is for man, and that man with the human spirit is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's marvelous creation, focused on man, is for the purpose of producing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, Ephesians 3:9 speaks of the mystery hidden in God, who created all things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to Ephesians 1:5 and 9, the motive of God's creating of all things was His desire and pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God carried out the work of creation in order to fulfill His desire and to satisfy His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's creation fulfills His desire and accomplishes His purpose; it also reveals His desire in the universe and manifests His purpose in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The basis of God's work in creation was God's will and plan Eph 1:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revelation 4:11 says that all things were created according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is a God of purpose, having a will of His own pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He created all things for His will that He might accomplish and fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has a will, and according to that will He conceived His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then according to that will and plan, He created all things so that He may have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not Made Known to Men in Other Generations</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The mystery of Christ "in other generations was not made known to the sons of men" Eph 3:5a .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This mystery was hidden in other generations, but it has been revealed in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The mystery of Christ, the church, which is His Body, was hidden in the Old Testament ages.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>None of the Old Testament saints knew anything regarding this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Adam, Abel, Enosh, and Enoch did not know it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Noah knew how to build the ark, but he did not know how to build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph likewise did not know the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moses knew how to build the tabernacle, but, not knowing the mystery of Christ, he did not know how to build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This mystery was also hidden from Samuel, David, and Solomon, who knew how to build the temple but not how to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>None of the prophets in the Old Testament knew this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One day John the Baptist came forth and told people three things concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, John said, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Second, John told people that Christ was the One who would baptize them in the Spirit so that they might be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John declared, "I indeed baptize you in water unto repentance; but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire" Matt 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Third, John said to his disciples that Christ is the One who will have the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom's voice" John 3:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This indicates that John the Baptist knew more than all the preceding prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, not even John had a clear vision concerning the mystery of Christ.</S>
