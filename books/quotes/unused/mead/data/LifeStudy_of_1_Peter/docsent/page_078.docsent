   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE APPEAL OF A GOOD CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Greek word rendered appeal is eperotema, a question, an inquiry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Its meaning is very much disputed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The right meaning of the phrase seems to be, as Alford said, the seeking after God of a good and pure conscience, which governs the proper Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This kind of question, asking for something, may be considered an appeal or demand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Peter s thought here may be that baptism is the appeal to God of the baptized one for a good conscience unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Baptism, as a symbol, a counterpart of our belief in all the accomplishments of Christ, testifies that all the problems we have before God and with God have been solved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, it is also a testimony, witnessing that in our conscience there is no more offense, but rather we are full of peace and confidence that we have been baptized into the Triune God Matt 28:19 and organically united with Him through the resurrection of Christ, that is, by Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without the Spirit of Christ as its reality, baptism by water immediately becomes an empty and dead ritual.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this verse we see that baptism is first our appeal, the appeal of the baptized ones, to God for a conscience that is both good and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A proper baptism will always bring the baptized one into such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before we believed in the Lord and were baptized, we were sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But when we were enlightened through the preaching of the gospel, we came to realize that we are very sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Both before God and toward man we have had many transgressions, trespasses, and offenses, and we had a great deal of guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then we repented, believed in the Lord, received His forgiveness, and were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But our repentance and believing need an outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This expression is baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, baptism and our believing, our faith, are two aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this reason the New Testament speaks of believing and being baptized Mark 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Believing and being baptized can be compared to using our two feet to take a single step.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First we believe, and our believing can be compared to the half-step forward of one foot.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our baptism can be compared to the completion of the step with the other foot.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Together, believing and baptism make one complete step.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we have pointed out elsewhere, believing is our reflection of all that Christ has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, what Christ has accomplished for our salvation is preached to us as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we listen to this preaching, the Spirit works upon us and within us to cause us to reflect what we have heard in the gospel, a reflection of what we have heard regarding Christ s accomplishment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This experience of reflecting Christ s accomplishment can be compared to taking a picture with a camera.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A camera is focused on a certain scene, and then a reflection of the scene is impressed on the film.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may compare Christ s accomplishments to a scene to be photographed with a camera.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The proper preaching of the gospel brings the view of this scenery into us, and the Holy Spirit enlightens us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then the scenery is imprinted on the film of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The result is that, from within, we believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, in our being there is a reflection of Christ s accomplishments, and this reflection is our believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have pointed out that believing in Christ requires an expression, and that this expression is baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Baptism, therefore, is the counterpart to our believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, when we are baptized, we, as baptized ones, appeal to God for a good and pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After we have been baptized and rise up out of the water, we have a conscience that is good and pure, a conscience without condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All our sins, offenses, transgressions, and trespasses have been forgiven, and all the problems that have entangled our life and our being have been buried in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that through baptism we have a clearance of our sinful past.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because of this clearance, we can have a good and pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We would emphasize the fact that baptism itself does not put away the filth of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But baptism does enable us to have the assurance and the testimony that we appeal to God for a good and pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then, after we are baptized, God answers us by indicating that we now have a conscience that is good and pure.</S>
