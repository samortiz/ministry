   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Binding the Strong Man,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Entering into His House,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and Plundering His Vessels</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 29 reveals that before the Lord cast out the demon, He firstly fought against Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This verse says, Or how can anyone enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his vessels unless he first bind the strong man?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And then he will plunder his house.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The house here signifies the kingdom of Satan, and the strong man is Satan, the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Greek word translated vessels also means instruments, apparatus; hence, goods, stuff.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fallen people under Satan are his vessels, his instruments for his use.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are his goods kept in his house, his kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word about binding the strong man indicates that when the Lord cast out demons, He first bound Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The people saw only the casting out of the demon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They did not see the binding of Satan, the strong man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, the Lord used the opportunity afforded Him by the accusation of the Pharisees to reveal the secret of spiritual fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Apparently, the Lord was only casting out the demon; actually, He was fighting, binding the strong man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This shows us that if we would build the kingdom today, we must first bind the strong man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The way to bind the strong man is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we come to chapter seventeen, we shall see that the disciples came to the Lord and asked Him why He could cast out the demon and they could not.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 17:21 the Lord told His disciples, This kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you do not pray and fast, you simply cannot cast out this kind of demon.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord s word to His disciples indicates that before He cast out a demon, He surely fasted and prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to bind the strong man, we must fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord fasted and prayed secretly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The disciples did not see this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must learn of the Lord to fast in secret and to pray in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I believe that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He often fasted and prayed to fight the battle and to bind the strong man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all must be in the same spirit today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every day our spirit must be a fasting spirit and a praying spirit so that we may daily bind the strong man, who is Satan, the king of the kingdom of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Satan has a kingdom of darkness on earth, and the whole earth is under his usurpation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is difficult to take one out of Satan s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every fallen person is a vessel in Satan s house.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Satan s house is his kingdom, and in his house are many vessels, the many fallen persons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to take a fallen person out of Satan s house, we must bind the strong man by prayer and fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the fighting of the spiritual battle for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Chapter twelve of Matthew occupies a special place in the New Testament because it reveals that Satan has a kingdom, that Satan is the strong man usurping all the God-created people, and that in order to take people out of his usurping hand, there is the need to bind him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The way to bind the strong man is by fasting and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The battle unveiled in chapter twelve is not seen in the foregoing eleven chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In those chapters we see the rest and the breaking of the regulations for the Head and for the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But we do not see the kingdom of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are two kingdoms on earth: one is the kingdom of darkness, and the other is the kingdom of the heavens in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These two kingdoms are now confronting each other on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, there is the need to fight the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all must fast and pray to bind the strong man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we shall be able to plunder his house.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a real revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not many Christians have read Matthew twelve in this way because they do not see the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To them, the kingdom is either simply a doctrinal term or something suspended for a future time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But we realize that all that the Lord is doing with us today is for the establishment of the heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today a battle is raging between two kingdoms.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The continuation of the Lord s ministry produced the opportunity for this further revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The One Not with the King</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Being against the King and the One Not</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Gathering with the King Scattering</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In verse 30 the Lord says, He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who is not gathering with Me is scattering.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At that time the Pharisees were not one with the heavenly King, so they were against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They were not gathering with Him, but were scattering away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, they were absolutely separated from Him and joined to His enemy, Satan.</S>
