   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By this in verse 30 Paul means not discerning the body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Being weak and sick in this verse is the discipline, the temporary judgment of the Lord, on the unworthy participants in the Lord s body.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then, since they would not repent of their offense, they were further disciplined to be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because they still would not repent, the Lord judged them by death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To die this way is equivalent to being strewn along in the wilderness in 10:5.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word sleep in verse 30 means die 1 Thes 4:13-16 .</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To discern ourselves is to distinguish matters that concern ourselves, to form an accurate estimate of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The purpose of being judged is that we may be brought back to God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who are astray need judgment from God to bring them back under His administration.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Condemned with the World</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 32 Paul says, But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined that we may not be condemned with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we keep ourselves under God s administration, we shall not be judged, corrected, disciplined, to be brought back to His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The discipline in verse 32 is also a matter in God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This discipline is temporary so that we may not be condemned with the world, that is, condemned forever.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The charge to wait for one another is due to the condition described in verse 21.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Waiting requires patience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Waiting for one another indicates that we are truly under God s administration.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verse 34b Paul concludes, And the remaining matters I will set in order when I come.</S>
