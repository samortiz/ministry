   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Sacrificing God's Word</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>on account of Our Own Experience</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We often sacrifice God's word on account of our personal experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because our individual experiences are partial and fragmentary, we do not have a complete, overall view of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Men think that the sun comes out in the day and the moon comes out at night.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They think that the moon only appears at night and disappears in the daytime.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, the moon is there in the daytime and at night as well.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When a person comes to God, he often makes judgments based on his own experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most people like to arrange the truth in a sequence, such as putting justification first and sanctification afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet the Bible puts sanctification before justification 1 Cor 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, justification and sanctification are two sides of one truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, we need to be delivered from human weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One cannot affect or sacrifice God's word on account of human weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only should we be delivered from doubting God's word; we must also be delivered from jeopardizing God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Under God's ordering, our knowledge of the individual life and our knowledge of the Body life should happen at the same time; we should not say which one comes first and which one comes later.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not Taking What We See Today</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>as the Whole Truth</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot judge God's word by what we see in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What we see today is still limited.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Perhaps fifty years from now, other brothers will rise up to say that we are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We only wish we could climb higher than we are to see God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just as we are not saved and then regenerated, in the same way we do not first receive an individual life and then come to realize the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just as salvation and regeneration happen at the same time, the realization of the individual life and the Body life happen at the same time Acts 9:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In every age there are truths of that age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are also errors of that age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot make the truth of an age become an error just because we do not have enough knowledge about that truth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Take again the example of baptism and the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The two things should happen at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After a person is baptized, he should immediately experience the laying on of hands, and he should immediately be brought to see the coordination, the Body, and be joined to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Due to the fact that some truths were recovered first and some later, men set a sequence to the order of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why we cannot consider what we have seen today as the whole truth, nor can we judge God's word by our own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Never forget that we are ministers of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Need for a Clear Vision of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The oneness of the Body is based on the knowledge of the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, we have to see that we have received the same life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After this seeing, we become one in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without this seeing, we have a big lack.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A person who has not seen the Body will feel that he is not much different from a person who has seen the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But a person who has seen the Body will realize that there is a big lack with those who have not seen the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is like an unsaved person considering a saved person to be more or less the same as he is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet the saved person sees a big lack in the unsaved person.</S>
