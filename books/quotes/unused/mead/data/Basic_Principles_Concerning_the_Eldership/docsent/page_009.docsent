   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HOLY SPIRIT PRESIDING OVER THE CONFERENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 28 says, It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This shows that it was the Holy Spirit who was presiding over the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The decision was made by this presiding One, the Holy Spirit as the presence of the King.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, just as the apostles and elders made the decision with the church, so also the Holy Spirit made the decision with the apostles and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must have the assurance that every decision in the church is made by the Holy Spirit with us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to learn from this example.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fellowship of the apostles and elders should be open to all the saints and all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nothing should be hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only false ones try to conceal what they are doing and are afraid to have fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every elder should feel free to open any matter in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church must be crystal clear, transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The elders must learn to keep everything open, allowing the brothers to discuss everything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not hide or conceal anything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This principle applies not only to the elders but also to the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No church should conceal anything from the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A church should never do something secretly for fear that the other churches would not agree with it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The elders in a local church should present the major problems they are facing to the elders of the other churches to seek their feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Discussion is necessary because it helps us to find the truth and receive the light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nothing should be hidden or concealed among the churches because no church has the authority by itself to make decisions affecting the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church in Antioch did not claim to have the authority to make the decision because Paul was there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To do so would have made Paul the king, but there was no human king.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must learn this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We cannot say that a particular local church can make a decision affecting the other churches without fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Of course, the local elders can make decisions concerning the local administration, but even locally no elder can make a decision by himself or rule over the other elders.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everything that a local church does must be made open to all the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The elders should discuss everything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must keep this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No elder should think that he can give orders to the other elders because he is more capable than they are.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To do so would make him a king and thereby insult the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>An elder should simply present a matter in an open way to all the other elders.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There should be much discussion, testimonies regarding the historical facts, and confirmation from the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This way allows the indwelling Spirit to speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result, whatever the eventual decision may be, we will have the full assurance that it seems good to the Holy Spirit and to us v. 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>HONORING THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no earthly king among us because our king is Christ our Head.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we keep this principle, we will have the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the church is normal, the blessing comes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all must honor the headship of Christ so that He will bestow His blessing on us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The wonderful, unique record in Acts 15 shows us the proper headship and leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the apostles and elders, including Peter, James, and Paul, honored the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>None of these great men dared to assume or presume anything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In all that they said and did, each one conducted himself not as a leader or head but as a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Similarly, no local church considered itself to be higher than others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the church in Antioch sent Paul, Barnabas, and others to Jerusalem to resolve the problem, the church in Jerusalem wrote a warm letter to Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Acts 15:23 says, Writing to them and sending by their hand the following: The apostles and the elder brothers, to the brothers throughout Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are of the Gentiles, rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This letter shows no signs that the church in Jerusalem considered itself to be higher than the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the churches were equal in the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The record in Acts 15 is beautiful because it shows that among the saints and among the churches, there was only one Head.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There was no human headship, leadership, or presumption.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We all must learn not to assume or presume anything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must conduct ourselves as brothers, allowing the Holy Spirit to speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this way we honor the headship of Christ and can have the full assurance that the blessing will be transmitted from the Head to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not only a matter of doctrine but also of truth and light.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must learn the truth and be enlightened so that we may see the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All the churches, co-workers, elders, and saints should keep these principles, not daring to assume or presume to be anything but honoring the headship of Christ, the unique King, who is present as the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must be open to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Holy Spirit made the decision in Acts 15 in the principle of incarnation in and with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The principle of incarnation can be seen throughout the chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The decision was apparently made by the apostles and elders, but it was actually made by the Holy Spirit with them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to learn to discuss, testify concerning the historical facts, and find the confirmation in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then the Holy Spirit will guide us to the proper decision.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the proper way to maintain God s administration while honoring and respecting the unique headship of Christ.</S>
