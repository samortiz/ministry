   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING PERFECTING OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our main work lies in perfecting others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul said that we have to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly in all wisdom Col 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He also said that we should present every man full-grown in Christ in all wisdom with much labor 1:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After men are saved, we have to select some seeking and advanced ones to give them some perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to bring them on until their problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to walk with them, go over the fifty-two lessons with them, and nurture and perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us learn from Paul's example.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His ministry was not a general one; it was very specific.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No ministry in the church should be general.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, there is no general ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is only one unique ministry, the New Testament ministry 2 Cor 3:6-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God speaks in the church and to the church, but His speaking is not for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the New Testament there are general Epistles to all the churches, such as the Epistle to the Hebrews and the Epistles of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are also Epistles addressed to specific churches, such as the Epistle to the Ephesians and the Epistle to the Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are also Epistles to specific individuals, such as the Epistles to Timothy, the Epistle to Titus, and the Epistle to Philemon.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul wrote not only Epistles but messages.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These messages are ministry-oriented; they are for the fulfillment of the stewardship which God committed to him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some words are for one group of people, while other words are for another group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul was all things to all men and spoke different things to different people 1 Cor 9:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some letters were to be read to more than one church Col 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Other letters were addressed to individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some commandments were given to the whole church 1 Cor 11:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Other commandments were given to individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If one applies the scope wider than it was intended, problems may arise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>CONCERNING THE EDIFICATION OF NEW BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The new believers' edification must be closely supervised.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the co-workers are inwardly living and burdened, they can closely supervise the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must also train a group of more advanced ones to be assistant tutors.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These tutors should also be under the supervision of the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They should follow the leading brothers, first to be edified themselves, and then to edify others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The way to monitor the new ones is to build up various levels of checks.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are leaders, co-workers, and then tutors.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The leading ones should check on the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Each co-worker should check on five tutors, and each tutor should check on ten saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way no one will be left out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You have to make the new believers' edification meeting very living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the life pulse of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have often said to Brother Witness that our gospel will come to a standstill if the new believers' meeting is not living.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When a new one is not properly edified after coming to the church, he will become a burden to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, if the new believers' meeting is good, the church will be solid, and there will be the sustained impact of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should do our best to mobilize everyone for the work of edifying believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the work of the church is carried out by all the members, the church will find itself going on in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if we are the only ones who are working, and no one else is perfected to work with us, sooner or later we will be exhausted even if we have the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more the saints are involved in the work of edifying the new ones, the more the church will be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If only a few are working, these few will be overburdened to the point of exhaustion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have tried visiting over thirty people a day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Such exertion can kill a man inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some may say that they cannot take care of anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They may say that they are not capable.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But even if they cannot do it, they still have to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is better to do something than to do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although one may encounter many difficulties, the more he learns, the more he will find the key.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Two months ago, Foochow was facing some real difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some were dead, and others were immobile, but others have experienced a genuine change.</S>
