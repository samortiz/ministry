   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the church the only effective way to contact people is to minister Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No one can solve all the problems of society.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus worked on the earth for three and a half years, but He did not change the Jewish society.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not touch certain matters.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we get involved in a case in the way of carrying out a social work, we will not be able to help people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, we may offend them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to shepherd all the saints, but if the Lord blesses us, there will be too many persons to take care of.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must be wise and discern the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It may be worthwhile to spend all our time on one family.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, if the Lord has entrusted us with many people, we should stay out of complicated involvements.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have no time to waste.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are not fellowshipping here about a social work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are fellowshipping concerning how to gain people for the Lord's purpose, and the best and only effective way to gain people is to minister Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, not everyone to whom we minister Christ will receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even when the Lord Jesus preached, not everyone received Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to act in His wisdom and not get involved in difficult situations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>An elder must not remain in the realm of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we remain in this realm for several years, we may get involved with many situations and offend many people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The wisest way to be an elder is to stay away from any kind of involvement in negative situations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If anyone comes to us, we should not care to be a judge or a policeman to arrest them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should simply try our best to minister Christ to people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If they receive Him, we are thankful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If they do not receive Him after several contacts, we may discover that their situation is a hard case which may waste our time.</S>
