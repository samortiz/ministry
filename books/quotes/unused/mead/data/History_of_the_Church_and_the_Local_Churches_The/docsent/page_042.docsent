   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Learning to Go outside the Camp</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Bear the Lord's Reproach</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>through Being Despised</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, many in Christianity despised him, even as a young man in his twenties.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Brother Nee was in his mid-twenties, he published the three volumes of The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One top theologian commented that Brother Nee was merely a clever young man, who could pick up many things by reading English books and translating them into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brother Nee was really despised.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Being criticized is not as serious as being despised.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Criticism "circumcises" us and "cuts us into pieces," but being despised is something more.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Especially in those days, we were reminded of Hebrews 13:13: "Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Together with Brother Nee, we were going to the Lord outside the camp to bear His reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We considered that reproach as the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more we were despised, the happier we were because we were bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Learning to Deal with the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>through Being Criticized</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Following being despised, Brother Nee was criticized by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was criticized because he repudiated and renounced the entire unscriptural system of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the twenty-four issues of his magazine The Christian, published in 1925 and 1926, Brother Nee "demolished" all of fallen Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some people today condemn me by saying that I am different from Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But what I have ministered cannot be compared in strength to what Brother Nee released to expose in detail the fallen situation of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those in Christianity had to publish many things in criticism of him in order to defend themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I noticed that by being criticized, Brother Nee learned to deal with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He never reacted to criticism in a fleshly way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He learned the lesson of having his flesh dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Learning to Be Pure in Motive</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>through Being Opposed</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In addition to suffering criticism, Brother Nee was opposed by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One Christian publication in China opposed him in issue after issue.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Following this opposition, they attacked Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They did their best to put him down.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By that time China was a constitutional country with the freedom of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Otherwise, even Brother Nee's life would have been in danger.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The strongest attacks against him did not come from the native Christians but from the missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The missionaries thought they had sacrificed their country, their homes, and so much for the Lord Jesus to go to a pagan country like China.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They did this to help people be saved and to lay the foundation for and build up their mission churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Presbyterian missionaries built up the Presbyterian church, the Baptist missionaries built up the Baptist church, etc. They all built up their so-called churches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some of them would collect the people they had converted together, take a picture of them, and send that picture back to the mission board so that they could receive some money in return.</S>
