<P>The time of the kingdom will be for a thousand years. What does this one thousand years have to do with Satan? The first few verses in Revelation 20 tell us that this will be the time when Satan himself will be bound in the abyss (vv. 1-3). This will be the time when Satan is disgraced the most.</P><P>"Do you not know that we will judge angels?" (1 Cor. 6:3). Those who have not sinned need not be judged. Only those who have sinned need be judged. In the future the church will judge the angels who have sinned. These angels who have sinned joined Satan to rebel against God. They are the principalities and powers today, the princes of the kingdom in Daniel 10:13. God said that we will judge them. When will we judge them? We will judge them when Christ comes again to set up His kingdom (Rev. 20:4).</P><P>This is the kingdom. The kingdom is the time when Satan is in the abyss. The kingdom is the time when the principalities and powers are judged. The power of Hades will be destroyed at the time of the kingdom. At the time of the kingdom, the "sons" under Satan's hand, who are the beast and the "spirit," the false prophet, will be thrown into the lake of fire. All the other countless evil spirits will be driven out of the world and will be imprisoned. Satan himself will be openly put to shame and spend one thousand years in a life of darkness in the abyss. That will be the time of disintegration for the household of Satan. It will be the time of the kingdom. It will also be the time for God's children to be vindicated, the time when the cross of God will gain the total victory. It will be the time when God's purpose concerning Satan, which was purposed in eternity past, will be fulfilled. It will be the time for Isaiah 14 to be fulfilled. That will be the time of the kingdom. In this kingdom Satan will have no more power.</P><P>The gospel of the kingdom of heaven is nothing but God (who rules in heaven today) ruling the earth and completely casting away the ruler of this present world together with his messengers and evil spirits, so that man (i.e., Christ and the church) can rule on God's behalf.</P><P>The gospel of the kingdom of heaven is aimed particularly toward the power of darkness. When the Lord Jesus first preached the gospel of the kingdom of heaven, all His works were aimed at dealing with the power of darkness. "The Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil" (1 John 3:8). He healed the sick and cast out the demons. The casting out of the demons is surely an annulling of the power of darkness. But what about healing the sick? The apostle gave us a footnote to healing: "Healing all those who were being oppressed by the devil" (Acts 10:38). If we study the Gospels carefully, we will see that throughout His life, the Lord Jesus was destroying the work of the devil. Hence, His work in this world produced more effect on the demons than on men.</P><P>The Lord Jesus said that at the end time, some of His children will rise up to bear this testimony. We thank the Lord that during the past few years, quite a number of God's children have risen up to wage war against Satan. Spiritual warfare is no longer just a term; it has become a reality that is experienced by many believers. Truly we are at the end of this age.</P><P>Brothers, if we want to see God's kingdom come, so that God's rule is manifested in this world, and the devil and his government cast out, we have to stand up to testify for the gospel of the kingdom of heaven. In other words, we have to bear testimony to the victory of the cross of Christ. We should declare that Christ has judged the prince of this world, that He is fully victorious, that the kingdom, glory, and power are all His, and that Satan, who has no further place in this present age, is occupying it illegally. Everyone who has accepted the Lord Jesus has been delivered from the power of darkness and has entered the kingdom of His beloved. We should preach the gospel of the kingdom of heaven, the gospel of the casting out of the demons, the gospel of the defeat of Satan, and the gospel of the destruction of Hades. This kind of testimony will bring this age to a close. This age is the age of the church because the church appears only in this age. But at the same time, the Bible calls this age "an evil and adulterous generation" (Matt. 12:39), an "unbelieving and perverted generation" (17:17), and "a crooked and perverted generation" (Phil. 2:15). God's purpose is to draw this age to an end. God desires that the end of this age come quickly so that His kingdom can follow. However, God's children have a duty to perform. God's children should work together with God to bring this age to a close. Prayer is one way, but testimony is also indispensable. Dear ones, we should stand up in an unprecedented way for the kingliness of the Lord Jesus Christ, and we should testify in an unprecedented way for His government. The kingdom of Antichrist will come before the kingdom of Christ. We should testify for the kingdom of Christ before the coming of the kingdom of Antichrist. We should bring this age to its end.</P><P>This is not a new gospel, but one that has been neglected by the church. The apostles preached this gospel—Acts 14:22 and 28:23 testify to this. Furthermore, after the Lord Jesus resurrected, He preached this topic to them. If we want to be the true successors to the apostles, we have to bear the testimony that the apostles bore. The church has forgotten about the victory, majesty, and kingship of Christ. Those who dare to testify that "only Christ is the king" and that "Satan is not the king" are the ones who are truly preaching the gospel of the kingdom of heaven.</P><P>Brothers, we should not be ones who have fallen behind in this age! There is only one gospel today which matches this age. We are not saying that we should not preach anything else; we are merely saying that God wants us to pay special attention to this. We must catch up with all that God has ordained for this age. God's emphasis in this age is the expatriation of Satan and the triumph of His Son. If we are not one with God in this matter and do not pay attention to what God pays attention to, we are not accomplishing God's eternal will, no matter how much work we have done. We are too far off from God's best! What we need today are Christians who match this age. God needs to gain a group of people who will sympathize with Him, who will work with Him, who will bring this age to a close, and who will bring God's kingdom in. If Christians think that their highest responsibility in this world is to save souls (which is a glorious work, and we have no intention to despise it), and they merely save souls for the sake of saving souls, they have not accomplished God's highest goal. They have to realize that they have a greater responsibility in this world than saving souls, which is to bring this age to an end and to usher in God's kingdom. Their greatest responsibility lies in the destruction of God's enemy together with all the powers of darkness. They must see that all their work should have this as their final goal. Prayer is not for prayer alone; it is to inflict a loss on Satan. Saving souls is not for saving souls alone; it is for the infliction of loss on Satan. Whatever we do, it is done with a view to inflict a loss on Satan. We do not despise the work of saving souls; but we should not lose sight of the kingdom in saving souls. Those who always put God's kingdom before them—that which touches God's will and His enemy—are the most useful workers in the hands of God.</P><P>Why will the end come when God's children testify for the kingdom of heaven in this way? Here again we see the cooperation between God and man. God desires that the end come. But unless God's children work together with Him to oppose this age and insist on the coming of God's age (the kingdom), God would rather delay. When His children truly hate the condition of this age and truly seek for His termination of this age and His giving of the kingdom, He will rise up to work. When God's children rise up to testify for the gospel of the kingdom of heaven, they will want what God wants and hate what God hates; their will will become one with God's will, and God will rise up to work. We should never think that the end will come by itself. If we reject God's will, it is possible to hinder His will. God is waiting for those who are one with Him and who will work with Him so that He can bring this age to an end. Who is willing to participate in such a great work?</P>
