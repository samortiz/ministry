   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MAN'S FALL 3:1 11:9</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to Genesis 3 through 11 mankind had four falls.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall consider the first of them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. The First Fall</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most people have at least some knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even some non-Christians know about Adam and Eve's eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, not many people, including Christians, know the significance of man's first fall.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, we must approach this subject from three directions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, we must determine the cause of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What was the cause, the basic factor, of man's first fall?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second, we must learn the process, the way in which the first fall transpired.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Third, we need to discover the result of man's first fall.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is my burden in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I realize that it is a difficult message to give because of the battle that is raging.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The enemy is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even the knowledge that we already have of Genesis 3 may frustrate us from penetrating into the depths of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must probe into the depths of the significance of man's first fall and not look at it superficially.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Cause a. The Serpent's Temptation</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If I were to ask you the cause of man's first fall, you would undoubtedly reply that the cause was Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, we should not place the entire blame upon Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we shall see, the cause of man's first fall was not primarily on Satan's side, but on man's side.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may use the illustration of catching a cold.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to catch a cold you must have cold air.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, cold air itself is insufficient to cause a cold.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You need to have the cold germs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A chair cannot catch a cold even if it is exposed to a chilly draft because it is unaffected by cold germs.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is easy for people to catch a cold because we have cold germs.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not put all the blame on the cold air, for most of the blame belongs to the cold germs.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, we should not blame Satan for the fall, since much of the responsibility rests with man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, I have put Satan as the first cause of man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Satan was the initial factor in this fall.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Satan is simply Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should never expect him to be better or different.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>1 "The Tempter"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Satan has a specific name, "the tempter" Matt 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Wherever he goes he acts like a tempter, for he is such by disposition and make-up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus spoke of him as a liar saying, "When he speaks a lie, he speaks out of his own self; for he is a liar and the father of it" John 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whatever comes out of Satan is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should never expect him to be improved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must stay away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>a "The Devil" Himself</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Bible Satan is called "the Devil" Rev 12:9; 20:2 which means "the slanderer."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He slanders God to man and also slanders man to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His talk with Eve implies some slandering of God v. 5 . His slander is always a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is by slanderous lies that he tempts man, and in this way he tempted Eve.</S>
