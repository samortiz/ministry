   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not only does God desire that man should rule, but He marks out a specific area for man to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We see this in Genesis 1:26: "Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth...."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"All the earth" is the domain of man's rule.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not only did God give man dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, and the cattle, but He further required that man should rule over "all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The area where God desired man to rule is the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man is especially related to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not only in His plan to create man was God's attention focused upon the earth, but after God made man, He clearly told him that he was to rule over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verses 27 and 28 say, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it...."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What God emphasized here is that man should "replenish the earth" and "subdue it"; it is of secondary importance that man should have dominion over the fish of the sea, the fowl of the air, and every living thing on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man's dominion over these other things is an accessory; the main subject is the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Genesis 1:1-2 says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep" ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These two verses are made more clear by translating them directly from the Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the original language, verse one says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The heavens here are plural in number and refer to the heavens of all the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The earth has its heaven, and so do all the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The direct translation of verse two is: "And the earth became not "was" waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Hebrew, preceding "the earth" there is the conjunction "and."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"; there were no difficulties, no problems, but then something happened: "and the earth became waste and void."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word "was" in Genesis 1:2 "And the earth was waste and void" and the word "became" in Genesis 19:26, where Lot's wife became a pillar of salt, are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Lot's wife was not born a pillar of salt; she became a pillar of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The earth was not waste and void at the creation, but later became waste and void.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God created the heavens and the earth, but "the earth became waste and void."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This reveals that the problem is not with the heavens but with the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We see then that the earth is the center of all problems.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God contends for the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus taught us to pray, "Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth" Matt 6:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the meaning of the original language, the phrase "as in heaven, so also on earth" is common to all three clauses, not only to the last clause.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, the original meaning is: "Your name be sanctified, as in heaven, so also on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Your kingdom come, as in heaven, so also on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This prayer reveals that there is no problem with "heaven"; the problem is with the "earth."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the fall of man, God spoke to the serpent, "Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life" Gen 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This meant that the earth would be the serpent's sphere, the place upon which he would creep.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The realm of Satan's work is not heaven, but earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the kingdom of God is to come, then Satan must be cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If God's will is to be done, it must be done on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If God's name is to be sanctified, it must be sanctified on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the problems are on the earth.</S>
