   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Teaching of the Anointing and the Feeling of the Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is an absolute relatedness between the teaching of the anointing and the feeling of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have said that the normal feeling of the conscience is derived from the Holy Spirit, who is in our spirit, and passes through our mind to enlighten us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This enlightenment is also a kind of anointing of the Holy Spirit as the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the feeling of the conscience and the teaching of the anointing are both derived from the feeling of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The anointing, after having passed through the intuition of the spirit and having been understood by the mind, becomes the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the anointing, having passed through the conscience and being understood by the mind, becomes the feeling of the conscience; this, then, is their relatedness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are, however, differences between the teaching of the anointing and the feeling of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, the conscience is an organ to differentiate right from wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The feeling of the conscience which is derived from the anointing is also limited to right and wrong, good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the teaching of the anointing, which comes by way of the anointing and is sensed directly in our spirit, is related in scope to God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It surpasses right and wrong and touches directly the will of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we only care for the feeling of the conscience, we can only be a faultless Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must go beyond this to live in the teaching of the anointing; then we can touch the mind of God and live in God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Secondly, the main purpose of the teaching of the anointing is that we may touch God, possess God, and understand the mind of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Its emphasis is upon positive guidance, which also indicates that which is forbidden.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the feeling of the conscience simply shows one's offense.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It emphasizes the negative condemnation and dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God always gives us firstly the teaching of the anointing, not the feeling of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we obey the teaching of the anointing, we will thereby eliminate the necessity for the feeling of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, if at any time we should not obey the teaching of the anointing, we immediately become aware of the condemnation of the conscience, which makes us aware of our offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This may be likened to the executive and judicial departments of a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the executive department operates smoothly, there is no need for the judicial department to take any action.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, whenever the executive organ loses its effectiveness or steps beyond its power, the judicial then exercises its power of impeachment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So also is the relationship between the teaching of the anointing and the feeling of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The teaching of the anointing is always a positive move, while the feeling of the conscience is always a negative impeachment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, the Holy Spirit as ointment first anoints the intuition of our spirit in order to guide or prohibit us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do not obey, it proceeds to anoint our conscience in order to produce a feeling in the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, if we want to maintain a normal spiritual condition, we should always live in the teaching of the anointing, without having to wait for the feeling of the conscience to correct and impeach us.</S>
