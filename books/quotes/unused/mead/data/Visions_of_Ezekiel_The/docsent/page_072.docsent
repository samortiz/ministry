   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO BOILING PLACES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the end, toward the rear of the temple, there are the two places for the priests to boil their offerings and to prepare and bake the meal offerings 46:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are the priestly kitchens.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The kitchens for the people are at the four corners of the outer court, and the kitchens for the priests are these two places within the holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE LAND SURROUNDING THE TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After the measuring of the temple was completed, Ezekiel was brought outside of the compound where the man measured the land outside the wall 42:15-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The measurement of the land was not 500 cubits but 500 reeds.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One reed equals six cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that land outside of the wall is 3000 cubits square, making a total of nine million square cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the center, a square of only 5000 cubits was used, leaving a wide, spacious land surrounding the temple compound.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The design of the temple compound gives a strong impression of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There was a wall around the spacious piece of land.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That wall separated what was holy from what was common.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Altogether, there were at least four walls: the wall around the entire lot, the wall around the outer court, the wall around the inner court, and the wall around the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They enclosed the temple and separated what was holy from what was common.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The walls signify separation and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, when a person enters into the temple, he has passed through a fourfold separation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What a great margin of separation there was!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On every side of the temple compound, there was a spacious suburb of 1250 cubits reaching to the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates the spaciousness of the separation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, the design of the temple gives an impression of progression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The further you travel inward, the higher you become.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The higher you become, the broader and wider you also become.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, it is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When you are in the temple, you are fifteen cubits higher than the ground level.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the appearance of the temple there is also a clear impression of balance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is nothing unbalanced.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, everything is square and upright.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nothing is crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church life is a life of absolute separation, a life of progression, and a life of balance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is upright, square, and straight.</S>
