<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF MARK</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THIRTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">THE PREPARATION OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR<br />FOR HIS REDEMPTIVE SERVICE</h1><h1 class="title">(5)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mark 11:27&mdash;12:44</h1><h2 class="head1">FOUR KINDS OF QUESTIONS</h2><p>In 11:27&mdash;12:34 the Lord Jesus was asked four kinds of questions. These questions represent different aspects of man&rsquo;s culture. The first question (11:27-33) concerned religion. The chief priests, scribes, and elders asked the Slave-Savior a question related to typical, bona fide religion. In particular, they questioned the Lord Jesus concerning His authority. The chief priests, scribes, and elders thought they were serving God and that they knew the law of Moses. We may say that they had a typical religion. Now they wanted to know the origin of the things the Lord Jesus was doing. Therefore, the first question asked of the Lord in 11:27-33 was related to bona fide religion.</p><p>The second question was raised by the Pharisees and Herodians (12:13-17). They came to Him and said, &ldquo;Teacher, we know that you are true, and you do not care about anyone; for you do not regard the face of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? Should we give, or should we not give?&rdquo; (v. 14). This question was related to politics.</p><p>The third question, asked by the Sadducees (12:18-27), was related to belief. In particular, the Sadducees wanted to know what the Lord believed concerning resurrection. As we have pointed out, the Sadducees, who may be considered ancient modernists, did not believe in resurrection. The third question, therefore, concerns belief.</p><p>The fourth question (12:28-34) was asked by a scribe. Mark 12:28 says, &ldquo;And one of the scribes who had approached and heard them disputing, knowing that He answered them well, questioned Him, Which is the first commandment of all?&rdquo; This question is related to the interpretation of the Bible. The scribe was asking the Slave-Savior how He interpreted the Bible with respect to which commandment was first.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE SON OF DAVID<br />AND THE LORD OF DAVID</h2><p>The matters covered by these four kinds of questions include the components of the highest human culture. However, each kind of question neglects Christ, the One who is the entire, universal replacement. Because His questioners did not pay attention to Christ, the Lord Himself made up the lack when He counter-questioned them, saying, &ldquo;How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? David himself said in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies under Your feet. David himself calls Him Lord, and how can He be his son?&rdquo; (12:35-37). Here the Lord was asking how the scribes can say that Christ is the son of David when David himself calls Him Lord. Here the Lord was indicating that the scribes knew Christ only as a man. They did not realize that Christ, the Messiah, is also God Himself and hence, a God-man.</p><p>The Lord seemed to be saying to all those who were testing and examining Him, &ldquo;You know Me only as a Nazarene. You do not know Me as God. Although I am frank and honest with you, I am also merciful. Even though I am the almighty God, your Creator, I have the patience to be examined and tested by you. If I were not merciful to you and if I manifested Myself in My divine essence, you would all be slain. But I am compassionate. Nevertheless, I am the very God whom David addressed as Lord.&rdquo;</p><p>We need to realize that Peter, John, James, and all the other close followers of the Lord Jesus were standing nearby observing what the Lord did and hearing what He said. No doubt, they were deeply impressed with the Slave-Savior. They must have talked with one another. Perhaps Peter said to John and James, &ldquo;On the one hand, our Teacher is the son of David. But on the other hand, He is the Lord. Have you ever realized this? Did you know that our Teacher is not only a man but also God the Lord?&rdquo; I believe that the disciples spoke with one another in this way.</p><p>If you had been one of the Lord&rsquo;s disciples observing how He handled the opposers, would you not have spoken to the others about it? Would you not have been impressed with the fact that your Teacher revealed to the opposers that He was not only the son of David but also the Lord of David? No doubt, the Lord&rsquo;s close followers received a deep impression concerning Him.</p><p>We have seen that the Lord Jesus brought His followers into Jerusalem with Him for a purpose. He did not intend to go into death alone. Rather, He brought a group of His followers into death with Him. Those followers are our representatives. When they were with the Lord in Jerusalem, we all were there. Hallelujah, we today are the Lord&rsquo;s close followers! As His followers, we are seeing from the Gospel of Mark a series of heavenly visions, visions that are being &ldquo;telecast&rdquo; into our being.</p><p>At the time of 12:37 the Slave-Savior had gained a full victory. He had not only received the approval of the people; He had also subdued His opposers. The chief priests, scribes, elders, Pharisees, Herodians, and Sadducees all were subdued. Jesus the Nazarene was manifested as being a marvelous Person. To be sure, His disciples were very pleased with the situation.</p>
