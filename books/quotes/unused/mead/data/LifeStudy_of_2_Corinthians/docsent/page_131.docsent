   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GIVING AND SOWING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter nine Paul goes on to liken our giving to the sowing of seed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because his deep thought was not fully expressed in chapter eight, Paul went on to write another chapter related to giving.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This chapter reveals another aspect of giving, the aspect of sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul s thought here is that we must sow and then we shall reap.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, when we sow, we should sow not merely for ourselves, but sow with blessings for others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many translations of the Bible do not render verse 6 literally.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead of saying with blessings, some versions speak of bounty or of sowing bountifully.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to these translations, if we sow bountifully, or with bounty, we shall reap bountifully, or with bounty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This, however, is a natural understanding of this word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What Paul speaks of here is literally sowing with blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our giving must be with blessings to others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Other Scriptures help us to understand the word blessings in 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Old Testament we can see that giving was a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Jacob met his brother Esau, Jacob gave him something.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That gift was a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Regarding this, Genesis 33:11 says, Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Other verses that indicate that giving is blessing are 2 Kings 5:15; Judges 1:15; and Ezekiel 34:26.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our giving to others is a blessing to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we sow with blessings to others, we shall reap with blessings from God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, the harvest will always far surpass the amount of seed sown.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It may be multiplied thirty or even one hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This does not happen miraculously; it takes place according to natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God controls the life supply among His children by miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because of this, no Christian family can maintain its wealth for generations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But sowing is according to natural law, not according to miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Regarding this, there is no need for God to do anything miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all need to sow, to give.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more we give, the more we shall reap.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, we should not do this in a superstitious way for the purpose of gaining riches for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The two illustrations of gathering and sowing are related to Paul s profound thoughts in these chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In chapter nine the deep thought is that as Christians we give in the sense of sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do not give, we are not farming, not sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moreover, we should not sow sparingly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we sow sparingly, then according to natural law we shall reap sparingly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to sow with blessings to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we sow with blessings to others, then, also according to natural law, we shall reap with blessings from God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This blessing will be many times more than what we have sown.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I can testify that, in my Christian life, I have never seen a believer who has given to God who has not been greatly blessed by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord will always honor the natural law He has ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>BECOMING FACTORS OF THANKSGIVING TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to recognize the Lord s miraculous hand and also care for His natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to both aspects, we need to give.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Perhaps at present you do not see God s balancing hand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But over the long run, perhaps over a period of many years, you will see it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then you will be able to testify of how God balances the daily supply among His children.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We also must realize that giving is a matter of sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, if we would reap, we must sow with blessings to others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we shall reap with blessings from God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should sow more and in turn reap more.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The goal is not to make ourselves rich.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The result is the abounding of thanksgivings to God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I hope that in the time to come many of the saints will become a factor of thanksgiving to God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that your giving will abound in much thanksgiving to God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have the full confidence that if the saints in the Lord s recovery are willing to give, the recovery will never be lacking in material supply.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead of lack, there will be abounding in thanksgiving to the Lord through many saints.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, let us all practice our giving, a giving which is carried out by gathering and by sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>VARIOUS MATTERS RELATED TO GIVING</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In 9:5 Paul says, Therefore I thought it necessary to entreat the brothers, that they would go before you and make ready beforehand your previously promised blessing, that this might be ready thus as a blessing, and not as covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This blessing is a bounty, a willing gift of generosity as a blessing to others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Willing and generous giving makes the gift a blessing to the receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Unwilling and grudging giving, from a withholding and covetous heart, makes the gift a matter of covetousness to the giver.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In verse 7 Paul says, Each one as he has purposed in his heart, not out of sorrow or of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This comes from Proverbs 22:9, where the Septuagint reads, God loves a cheerful and liberal man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Greek word rendered cheerful also means hilarious, gleeful.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In verses 8 and 9 Paul continues, And God is able to make all grace abound unto you, that, in everything always having all sufficiency, you may abound unto every good work; even as it is written, He scattered abroad, he gave to the poor, his righteousness abides forever.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The words all grace in verse 8 refer to every kind of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The scattering in verse 9 is the scattering in sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The word poor in this verse denotes one who is obliged to do menial work to eke out a living.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is not the common word for poor.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In verse 9 Paul speaks of righteousness abiding forever.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Generous giving is, on the one hand, a blessing to the receivers, and, on the other hand, righteousness in the eyes of both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In verse 13 Paul speaks of the approvedness of this ministry of giving material supply to the needy saints.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It refers to the approval by the needy saints in Judea of the Gentile believers ministry to them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Greek word, dokime, means test, trial, experiment; hence, approvedness, proof.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It indicates that the ministry to the saints will be tested, tried, and approved by the saints to become a proof of the generous character of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Greek word for fellowship in verse 13 also means communication see communicating in Romans 12:13, and shared in Philippians 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It refers to the ministry of supply, which is a fellowship between the Gentile believers and those in Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In verses 14 and 15 Paul concludes, And in their petition on your behalf, longing after you on account of the surpassing grace of God upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This indescribable gift is God s grace given to the believers.</S>
