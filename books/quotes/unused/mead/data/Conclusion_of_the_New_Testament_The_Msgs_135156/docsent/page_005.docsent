   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX THE BELIEVERS THEIR PRESENT 20</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the progressing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of transformation, the believers experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, they experience and enjoy God as the Father in His love.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall consider more aspects of this experience and enjoyment of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>6 Giving Grace, Even Greater Grace, to Them, Those Who Are Humble</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God as the Father in His love gives grace, even greater grace, to the believers, those who are humble.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>James 4:6 says, "He gives greater grace; wherefore it says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the context, to be proud here means to be proud toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Being proud before God causes Him to resist us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be humble is also toward God, and this causes Him to give us grace, as He desires.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to learn to draw near to God James 4:8 to receive greater grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead of being proud and resisting God, we should receive in meekness the implanted word James 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Someone who is proud cannot receive God's implanted word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are humble, we shall receive the implanted word, and we shall also receive greater grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Peter 5:5b also says, "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Greek word translated "resist" is a strong word for an army preparing to resist the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peter uses this word to show how strong God is in resisting those who are proud.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Greek word rendered "proud" here literally means showing above others .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be proud is to show ourselves above others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God resists the one who lifts himself above others and regards himself as better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead of being proud and showing ourselves above others, we should be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God gives grace to the humble.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This grace refers to the Triune God Himself as the life supply being multiplied in the humble believer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the multiplied grace 1 Pet 1:2 , the varied grace 4:10 , and all grace 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The believers have received the initial grace, yet this grace needs to be multiplied in them that they may participate in all grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The varied grace of God is the rich supply of life, which is the Triune God ministered into us in many aspects 2 Cor 13:14; 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God gives Himself as grace, as life supply, to humble believers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Greek word for "humble" in 1 Peter 5:5 also means lowly, as in Matthew 11:29, where the Lord Jesus says, "I am meek and lowly in heart."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be proud is to be high, but to be humble is to be low.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we would humble ourselves in the church life, we need to become lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead of uplifting ourselves, we should always keep ourselves low.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we shall be in a position to receive the Triune God as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We shall receive the grace, even the greater grace, God gives to humble believers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that in order to see God we need to be pure in heart Matt 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that being pure in heart is the condition, the term, for seeing God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, there are conditions for having God draw near to us and for Him to be worshipped by us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order for God to draw near to us, we need to draw near to Him James 4:8a , and in order for God to be worshipped by us, we need to worship Him by His Spirit Phil 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In like manner, there is a condition that we need to fulfill in order for God to give us grace, and this condition is that we must be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we are truly humble before God, we shall receive His grace, even His greater grace.</S>
