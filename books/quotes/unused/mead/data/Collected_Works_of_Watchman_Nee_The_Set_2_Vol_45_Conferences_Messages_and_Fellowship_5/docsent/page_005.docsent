   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he had looked at his own barren wife, he would not have had the courage to pray for the other women to bear children.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He knew that everything depended on God and that nothing can change God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is a difference between God as a father and God as the Father.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God being God the Father means that He is the Father in the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything is of Him; He is the Father of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was God's will for Sarah to cast out Ishmael; it was not a matter of Sarah's jealousy.</S>
