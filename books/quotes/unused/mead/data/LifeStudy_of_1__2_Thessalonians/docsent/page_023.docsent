   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORK OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now that we have considered verse 1 in a rather full way, let us go on to verse 3.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here Paul says, "Remembering unceasingly your work of faith, and labor of love, and endurance of hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this verse Paul speaks of three matters: the work of faith, the labor of love, and the endurance of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The work of faith comes first.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Faith comes through our acceptance of the word that is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we accepted this word, faith was produced within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have seen that this faith is both objective and subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Greek there is a definite article in verse 3, the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that this verse speaks of the work of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This faith is God's word accepted by us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word preached to us and received by us becomes faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because this faith is living and active, it results in the work of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Greek word for work in verse 3 is ergon, a word usually rendered as work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul uses this word in Romans 3:20: "Because by the works of law no flesh shall be justified before Him."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Romans 3:20 work mainly denotes our conduct, our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul is saying that no fallen person can be justified before God by his conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, in that verse work does not refer to an activity or a task that we do; it refers to particular deeds in our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What, then, is the meaning of work in verse 3?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Does it refer to deeds, or to some kind of task?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually, in Greek this word denotes acts, actions, activities.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It includes everything of our actions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our actions involve deeds, conduct, and many other things as well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the work of faith refers to all the acts, actions, of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose an evangelist preaches the gospel to an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The unbeliever accepts the word, faith is produced in him, and through this faith he is born of God and put into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now that he has faith, certain actions are sure to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, he may spontaneously declare, "O Lord Jesus, You are so precious!"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then he may go home and speak to his wife and children about believing in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both the declaration concerning the Lord and the preaching of the Lord are works of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Faith implies God, grace, power, light, and many other items.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For this reason, when a new believer preaches Christ to his wife, the faith within him may enlighten him concerning his attitude toward her.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then he will confess his shortcomings to the Lord and apologize to his wife concerning certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This also is a work of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Thessalonians 1:9 says, "For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entrance we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here Paul speaks of turning to God from idols.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the first action of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Anyone who has faith will turn to God from idols.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The work of faith includes all the actions that issue out of our living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This includes our relationship with others and all our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before a certain person was saved, he may have been unkind to others and harsh in many aspects of his behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But once he has faith in the Lord, this faith will not allow him to treat others in such an unkind way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, it will be difficult for him to behave in a harsh way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I can testify of this from my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From my youth, I hated dogs and sometimes mistreated them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But after I was saved, the faith within me no longer allowed me to behave in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such a change in behavior is an action that comes out of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who have faith are very different from those who do not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before they had faith, some indulged in sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now that they have faith, they can no longer indulge in these things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Spontaneously, as an action, a work, of faith, they refrain from those things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Others before they were saved were not good neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But after they were saved and came to have faith, they became very kind, gentle, loving, and considerate.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No one taught them to be different.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The change was produced by the faith within them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The faith caused them to be helpful to others, especially to other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is another illustration of the work of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The work of faith denotes the proper actions of a genuine believer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not the performing of a certain task or the doing of certain good deeds to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No, it is our daily action as believers, the action that is a product of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is Paul's understanding of the work of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As he was praying for the Thessalonians, he remembered their action of faith.</S>
