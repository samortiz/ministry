   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SIN ISSUING IN DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Notice that 1 John 5:16-17 speaks of a sin not unto death and of a sin unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sin of course always results in death, but some sins do not bring in death right away.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Death in some cases comes later.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The children of Israel during their wilderness wandering provide us with illustrations of both types of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Korah and his company rebelled against Moses Num 16 , they died at once.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Theirs was a sin unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Within a day of their sin they died.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Miriam, in contrast, did not die immediately after sinning against Moses Num 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That sin, however, caused both her and Aaron to die in the wilderness before the children of Israel entered the good land Num 20:1, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sin, then, always issues in death; sometimes it is immediate and other times delayed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is good to avoid sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot by ourselves overcome it, however.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only life can.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First John 5:18 says, "We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Life overcomes sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By overcoming sin, life also overcomes death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Life deals with the source or root of death, which is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By overcoming sin, it overcomes death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every sin we commit kills us a little.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even losing our temper kills us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It not only kills our spirit; it even brings death to our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is nothing good about sin, but nonetheless we cannot overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must put our trust in that life which is God, even the Son of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Trust in life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since life overcomes sin, it rescues us from death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE WORLD, THE WICKED ONE, AND IDOLS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sin is also closely related to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can neither separate the world from sin, nor can we separate sin from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we go shopping and purchase some things we do not need, we are being worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the moment what we have done may not be sin, but it is close to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The world is close to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the concluding verses of 1 John there is a cluster of negative things: sin, death, the world, the evil one, and idols.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"The whole world lieth in the wicked one."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we buy something unnecessary from the world, what we get is from within the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may think of them simply as purchases from the department store, but those worldly things are from within Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The whole world, including modern things and fashionable styles, lies in the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>John says, "The whole world lieth in the wicked one."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He does not use the word Devil or Satan, but rather "wicked one."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually in Greek the word is wicked, but it is clear that wicked denotes the wicked one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The whole world is lying in evil, or in the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you get an unnecessary article from the world, you are getting something out of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the eyes of God, that thing is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The last verse says, "Children, keep yourselves from idols."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the context we can see that idols are those things of the world which we love.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may choose to purchase a necktie, for example, because we think it is the latest style.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To take pleasure in that necktie is to like something from within the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A pair of shoes may be an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A car may be an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It may be an essential for transportation in our society, but if we go beyond fulfilling that need and love its style, it becomes an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Keep yourselves from idols.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is not to say that we should be sloppy in our dress.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But it is one thing to dress carefully and another to care for fashions and select our clothing on the basis of what is in style.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To choose our clothes according to the fashion of this age is a sign that we are short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Fashionable clothes are then an idol to us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Read over these concluding verses carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Pray-read them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Notice how interrelated sin, death, the world, and the wicked one are.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Sin issues in death.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sin comes in because we are close to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The world is lying in the wicked one.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What we choose to take out of it is an idol in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must overcome sin and the world, and we must keep ourselves from idols.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>OUR CONFIDENCE</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we sin, we not only need life ministered to us; we also need to realize that we are born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have a part within us which has been born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In our prayers we must put our trust in these two things: the life which is God Himself and the part within us which has been born of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not" v. 18 . Our spirit and the life which is the Lord Jesus Himself ministered to us as a life supply will overcome sin, death, the world, and the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then, since we are no longer under those things, our idols will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As long as we are under sin, death, the world, and the evil one, we shall have many idols.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Your experience will confirm this.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When you live in the world, you are under sin, under death, under Satan, and you have many things which are idols.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>How are you delivered out of these five negative things?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>To be brought out of them you must grow with life into God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then you will be in the three positive things: God, the Son of God Jesus Christ, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You will mature.</S>
