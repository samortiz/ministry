   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Teaching the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>by Expounding the Scriptures</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The messages released on the Lord s Day mornings related to life and truth are for the purpose of supplying life; the primary emphasis is not on teaching the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, we still need a meeting for teaching the truth by expounding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The goal of this meeting is to help the saints understand the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Over the past few years, we have presented the truth using new terms, such as the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These new terms are used to better express the mysteries of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without these terms it would be impossible to express and to convey the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, our apprehension of the truth depends upon our understanding of these new terms, but there is not much time on the Lord s Day morning to teach these basic truths.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order for the saints to receive this kind of teaching in the truth, another time is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These truths need to be taught at least once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are altogether about one thousand two hundred messages in the Life-study of the New Testament; and although the quantity is quite large, we should not be afraid to teach the truth that they contain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as we have the heart to study the messages, progressing in a proper order, we will be able to finish them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all know the story of the race between the tortoise and the hare.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although the hare was fast and the tortoise was slow, the hare lost the race because it did not run methodically.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In contrast, the tortoise ran in a steadfast manner, step by step, and it eventually won.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not have to teach the truth in a quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, it would be good to cover only fifty-two lessons in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, since the truth in each topic is interrelated, fifty-two lessons will enable us to understand more than one hundred topics.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not a heavy burden to bear.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not even necessary to finish one message in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One thousand two hundred messages can become two thousand four hundred messages.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Simply proceed one day at a time and learn the truth for that day, and before we even finish one thousand two hundred messages, our knowledge of the truth will increase greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When our knowledge of the truth increases, so will our ability to speak these truths.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a person receives a university education, his speaking will be different from that of an uneducated person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The most productive citizens are those who have a proper education.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is also true of those who have a spiritual education.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It would be good to have a meeting to teach the truth by expounding the Word once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After careful consideration before the Lord, we feel that it is more suitable for this meeting to be on Thursday night.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After the three thousand people were saved on the day of Pentecost, they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles Acts 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that the apostles were teaching the truth every day, and the saved ones were being taught and thereby lived in the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before the day of Pentecost, the three thousand who were saved were living under the teaching of the Old Testament, but once they were saved, they turned from the teaching of the Old Testament to the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From that day onward, they continued steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because we do not know God s New Testament economy, this is our need as well.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need two educational messages every week, one on the Lord s Day morning and another during the week.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This will help us enter into the teaching of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Small Groups for Nourishing The Bread-breaking Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The small group gatherings are related to the aspect of nurturing in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Acts 2:42 speaks of the breaking of bread and prayers, and verse 46 says that the believers practiced breaking bread from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This clearly shows that the bread-breaking meetings can be held in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, we would like to practice the breaking of bread in small groups in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is something worth our study and consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If there are only seven or eight who meet regularly in a small group, it will not be very easy to have a spiritual atmosphere for the breaking of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we should consider combining four or five small groups in the same neighborhood for the breaking of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A combined gathering would have about twenty to thirty people, and it would not be too difficult to hold the meeting in a saint s living room.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Based on our experience of many years, however, we also realize that the saints will lack an opportunity to meet other saints if we break bread in small groups throughout the year.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After much consideration, we feel that we should have a joint meeting to break the bread in each of the district meeting halls on the first Lord s Day of every month.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This will give the saints a chance to meet each other and to have an enlarged fellowship once a month.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The breaking of bread can be on both a smaller scale in the small group gatherings and on a larger scale in the district halls.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, the atmosphere of a Lord s table meeting with twenty to thirty people cannot be compared to the rich and uplifted atmosphere of a larger meeting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I began breaking bread in the local churches in 1932.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the past fifty-three years, I have been in several Lord s table meetings that were very uplifted and weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One Lord s table meeting in Chefoo was quite uplifted but not so weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Another Lord s table was in December 1984, in Irving, Texas, after a ten-day training.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>During this meeting, one thousand six hundred saints gathered together to break bread on the Lord s Day evening.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This meeting was truly unprecedented.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everyone who was there can testify that the meeting was wonderful and beyond description.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The praises and prayers could hardly be described in words.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whoever attends such a Lord s table meeting will feel satisfied their entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although it is not possible to have a large Lord s table meeting every Lord s Day, we should have one at least once a month.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Presently, we do not have a large meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hopefully, the church in Taipei will build a meeting hall that can hold ten thousand people and that has the best sound system.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then the whole church can gather at least once every three months to break bread together.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For the breaking of bread, there is a need for large and also small gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the first Lord s Day of every month, the saints should come together in the district meeting halls to break the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On the other Lord s Days in the month, four or five small groups, depending on the number of people, should gather in their homes to break bread.</S>
