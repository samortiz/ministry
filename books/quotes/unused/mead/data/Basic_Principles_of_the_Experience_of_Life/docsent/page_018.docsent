   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Law of Sin in Our Members</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With this point of view, we may read Romans 7 and 8.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 18 in chapter seven says, "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The phrase in my flesh explains and defines the phrase in me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As humans, we have three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Due to the fall, the body became the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The body was pure when created by God, but this body was poisoned by the nature of the devil, so it changed in nature, becoming the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must be careful when reading this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It says, "In my flesh, nothing good dwells."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This does not mean that there is nothing good in our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In other parts there may be something good.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At least in the will there is something good because we have the intention to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To will to do good is present, but to perform it through the flesh is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As far as the flesh is concerned, therefore, nothing good dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 19 begins, "For I do not do the good which I will."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will to do good; we at least have a desire to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even before we were regenerated, many times we had a desire to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I was young and before I was regenerated, many times I had the desire to be obedient to my mother and to love her, and I willed to do so, but whether or not I was able to perform it was another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 19 continues, "But the evil which I do not will, this I practice."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By this word we can realize that in us human beings there are two tendencies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One is to will to do good and not evil, while the other is that we cannot perform it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We will to do good, but we cannot do it; we will not to do evil, but we do it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To will is present with us, but to perform it is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 20 says, "But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the New Testament there are two verses that say "it is no longer I" but someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Galatians 2:20 says, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, we should not think that just because it is no longer I, it is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before we were regenerated, there was someone else within us, and now even after we have been regenerated, this one is still within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In principle, the word sin in Romans 7:20 can be capitalized as a proper noun.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For sin to dwell in us is different from simply being in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A table may be in a room, but we cannot say that the table dwells in the room.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only something living can dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This very "Sin" is something living because it dwells within us, and it also reigns, rules, dominates, and exercises its power and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is no longer we that work, but it is a living entity that dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can at least say that this living entity is something of Satan, the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not something created in us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God did not create man with such an item in him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is something of Satan, something out of Satan, which was injected into the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Within the fallen human race there is something living, dwelling, ruling, dominating, and exercising its authority to subdue people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By these verses we can realize that with humans as a fallen race there are two entities.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One is the human himself, and the other is something else called sin, which dwells in people to force them to do something which they do not will to do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today people like to talk much about independence, but not one human on this earth is independent.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everyone is dependent, either on God or on the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Why do we will to do good, but we cannot do it, and will to not do evil, yet do it?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is because it is no more we.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we were only created persons, we would simply be ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We would be independent and free.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, we have become fallen and complicated, so we are not free, and we can never be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are dependent and complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We will to do good, but someone within us does not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We will not to do evil, but someone within us does it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Moreover, this someone is much stronger than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This may be compared to marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many times I have told the young brothers and sisters that marriage apparently is a matter of happiness, but strictly speaking and in fact, it is a bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To be married simply means that we are willing to be bound and to give up our liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When a certain young brother was about to be married, he was so happy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He came to me and said, "Thank the Lord, I am going to marry!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After a few days, I will no longer be single."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I said, "Yes, brother, you will no longer be single, but you also will no longer be free.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You will be bound by the dear one you are going to marry."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Apparently he agreed with me, but he still thought that my word was too extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A short time after the marriage, however, he came back to me with tears, saying, "Brother Lee, you were right.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>From the time I was a baby, I have always liked to have the windows open at night, but my dear wife strictly insists on closing the windows.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I cannot sleep with the windows closed, and she cannot sleep with the windows open.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Furthermore, she is stronger than I am, so I am subdued."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we marry, we become complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the same way, when we became fallen, an illegal marriage took place.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now we can never be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We may will to "open the window," but sin does not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is something within us other than us, which is living, dwelling, ruling, and truly awful.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Verse 21 says, "I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is a law, a natural force, with us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Whenever we try to do good, there is always a natural force, forcing us to act to the contrary.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When I was young and my mother was ill, I said to myself beside her bed, "I have to love my dear mother," but after only two hours, I lost my temper with her.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I could will, but I could not perform.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>To will was present with me, but to perform was another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I found the law that whenever I tried to do good, evil was present with me.</S>
