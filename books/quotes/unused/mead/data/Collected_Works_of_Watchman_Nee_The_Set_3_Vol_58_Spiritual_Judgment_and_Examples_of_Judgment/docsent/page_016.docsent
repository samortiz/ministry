   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 3 Date:June 19, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER K. H.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I was a baby, I received the rite of sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Later I attended Bible classes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was a teen-ager, I received confirmation and became a regular member of the church, eligible to partake of the holy communion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All of these were formalities of the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During my first year in college, I was led to a clear knowledge of salvation through private conversations with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After I was saved, I began to meet with the local church in my locality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1935 I attended the Overcomer Conference under Brother Nee in Chuanchow, Fukien province, and consecrated myself completely to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After my consecration, I found my life completely changed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the summer of 1936, I quit my teaching job and began to serve the Lord full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, I worked in Canton and then in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Following this I preached the gospel and built up churches in K'un-ming and other cities in Yunnan province.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1941 I returned from K'un-ming to Hong Kong and served with the saints in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the spring of 1948, I went to Shanghai and attended the national co-workers' and elders' conference.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This summer I find myself able to attend this four-month training at Kuling Mountain, Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I would like to ask my brother a question: How can we tell what our own ministry is?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT Following the Lord by Violence</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In his pursuit of the Lord, our brother has to be more violent and aggressive Matt 11:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He has to take a few violent steps.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When God brings you to a crossroads, you have to make a violent choice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you do this, the lessons you learn in two or three years will equal what you otherwise could learn only in twenty or thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our brother has a pure spirit, and he has been going on step by step in a very solid way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Controlling Our Smile While We Speak</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have known Brother Weigh for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I would ask for his permission to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps I do not have to ask for permission.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I want to mention one very small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you want your spirit to be fully released, you have to hold back your smile a little.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Your facial expression, voice, and attitude all should be focused in one direction.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Your smile sometimes becomes a distraction to you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At times of solemnity, your smile is like a brake on a bicycle rolling down the hill.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Your smile in your preaching is a brake; it frustrates the release of your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In ministering the word to others, the smile on our face is a frustration to the power within; it is inversely proportional to the amount of power we have within.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We cannot peddle a bicycle and apply the brake at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This will strip our ministry of the word of its effectiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rich in Thoughts</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the ministry of the word, thoughts are useful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You have to ask the Lord to grant you mercy to have rich thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When God wants to speak through man, the Holy Spirit supplies the speaker with active, living thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we read the Bible, we have to meditate on the Lord's word by means of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This will make our thoughts rich.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If our thoughts are not rich, we will lower the level of the Spirit's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You have to be more violent in following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When you speak you have to control your smile.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the same time your thoughts have to be rich and active.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You must also push out your spirit to release the word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Formation of Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The ministry we possess is based on the work that God performs on us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When God brings us through trials, He makes us certain persons.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The kind of pathway a man takes and the trials he suffers determine the kind of ministry he has.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul suffered much, and he was comforted much.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was able to comfort those who needed comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whatever God has done and is doing in us will make us the kind of person we are.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That will be our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can only handle what we ourselves have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A young man can learn to say something, but the words will be somewhat awkward to others' ears.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It will be like a Foochow native speaking Mandarin; the Foochow accent will always be there.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we want to serve all men, we have to go through all kinds of trials.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The greater the ministry, the greater the trials.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>C. H. Spurgeon once stated simply, "If you have never wept for sin, you will tell a sinner not to worry about sin; you will tell him that there is no need to weep." This is, of course, the greatest mistake in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A doctor with little training cannot rush to treat patients.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He must have experience with an illness before he can treat others with the same illness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If God's intention is to commit more responsibilities to us, we should not be surprised when we face more trials from different directions.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Paul received the greatest ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the reason 2 Corinthians tells us of his many trials.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The most precious book in the entire New Testament is 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Ephesians is the highest book; it tells us about the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But 2 Corinthians is the most precious book; it tells us about a man who reached the loftiest height, and about the kind of things he saw and attained.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Other books do not show us as much about the person of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He was a lofty man.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the reason God gave him all kinds of revelations and allowed him to be tried materially, psychologically, physically, supernaturally, spiritually, and in things related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whatever way God leads us, that is the ministry that He will work out in us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The lessons we learn will determine the ministry we have.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should not think that we can receive a cheap ministry from the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God will never let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The discipline of the Holy Spirit is arranging everything day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We can never escape this education.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is most foolish for a man to try to run away from God or to circumvent His dealings.</S>
