   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Church in the Bible Being Local</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we shall go on to see the reason we stress the expression of unity in locality.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is because the church in the Bible is local.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have spoken about this for many years and have mentioned it even now a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church in the Bible is local.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A single exception cannot be seen in the whole New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the churches are local: the church in Jerusalem, the church in Antioch, the church in Corinth, the church in Philippi, the church in Colossae, etc. All the examples in the Bible are local.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, in the book of Revelation, the churches in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea are all local.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God ordained one church in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The localities and the churches are equal to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The countries on the earth are divided into cities; the church of God on the earth today is also divided into cities.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the world there is the locality of Shanghai; hence, there is a church in Shanghai before God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the world there is a locality of Nanking; hence, there is the church in Nanking before God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the world there are the localities of Sian and Lanchow; hence, there is the church in Sian and the church in Lanchow before God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As long as there is a place big enough to be a locality, there should be a church in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If our place is not big enough to be a locality, we cannot be a church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lanchow is big enough in the eyes of God to be a locality; therefore, there can be a church in Lanchow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before God this matter is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible determines a locality according to the limit of a city or a village.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1 Corinthians for example, which we have just read, there is a very good word: "Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church" 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Everywhere" is the locality; "every church" is the spiritual content.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In every locality there is a church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Everywhere" is divided in the Bible according to a city or a village.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus preached the gospel in every city and in every village Matt 9:35 ; therefore, the unit of locality is the city or village.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul said to Titus, "Appoint elders in every city, as I directed you" Titus 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During that time Paul preached the gospel in the cities; he had not gone into the villages.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, he did not mention villages.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the churches in the Bible are local.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the problem today: The unity of the children of God must have locality as its unit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, the minimum unit for the unity of the children of God must be the unit of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the children of God in the same locality must be one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the minimum requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There Should Be Spiritual Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>between the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now I wish to discuss a problem which God's children face in connection with this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have already spoken of the second kind of unity, part of which is right and part of which is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Should there be the "spiritual fellowship" they talk about?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Part of it should exist, and part of it should not.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The way to fulfill the part that should exist is that there should be spiritual fellowship between one local church and another local church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Bible shows us that the church is local, so there must be the unity of the church in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, I have said that if there is no unity in a locality, all other words are vain and self-deceptive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Fellowship among the churches does not mean that a locality neglects its own affairs and takes care of the affairs of another locality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It does not mean that the brothers in Tiensui take care of the affairs of Pingliang but not the affairs in Tiensui.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, it means that Tiensui and Pingliang should have fellowship in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The unity of the church, the unity of the Body, has locality as its unit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But we also must have spiritual unity with brothers in other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This spiritual unity is not a unity between one denomination and another denomination, but a unity between one church and another church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This spiritual unity is not a unity between divisions, but the unity between members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here are two local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Between these two local churches, we should seek the unity of the Holy Spirit, the unity of the Body, the unity in the Lord's way, and unity in every aspect in order to express the spiritual unity between the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we apply this spiritual unity to the denominations instead of to the churches, this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is wrong to place spiritual unity in the context of the sects instead of in the context of the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The subject is right, but the application is wrong.</S>
