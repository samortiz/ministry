   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE COMMISSION TO CARRY OUT THE NEW WAY THE COMMISSION OF GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The purpose of the practice of the new way is to practically carry out the gospel, truth, life, and the church, which God has commissioned us with.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our hope is that the new way would gain new ones, and that the new ones would walk in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through more than sixty years of experience, during which we have carefully analyzed the practices of the Christian denominations and have studied the divine revelation again and again, we have found the way which is according to the Bible and ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This way is testified to and is according to the leading of the Holy Spirit, and it is most effective.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We call it the "new way."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Over the past two thousand years, there have been some who have seemingly taken this way but have not considered it to be the unique way ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Practically speaking, this new way has four steps.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, we go out knocking on doors and visiting people to preach the gospel and to lead them to be saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the experiments in the first term of the full-time training, this point has been proven to be workable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have all heard the testimonies of the full-time trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are even some who gained one hundred twenty people in a little more than two months and brought them to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a tremendous accomplishment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Second, we must lead people into the knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we speak of the truth, we do not mean the ordinary, shallow truth spoken by most people, but the truth revealed in the Bible concerning God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's eternal economy is that God in His Divine Trinity passed through various processes to dispense Himself into men that they may be regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, conformed, and glorified to become the many members of Christ who constitute the Body of Christ as the corporate expression of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After we go out door-knocking to preach the gospel, we must establish meetings in the homes of all the newly baptized ones and begin to teach them this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This truth is the essence and the center of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This truth concerns what God intends to obtain according to His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christianity, however, has continually ignored this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From my youth until the present, I have been studying the Bible for more than sixty-one years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more I have studied it, the more I know the mystery it contains.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This mystery is about God's eternal economy, which is truly a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Within God there is an economy; by passing through various processes, He intends to dispense Himself into His chosen and redeemed people, uniting them with Himself as one entity and constituting them into the Body of Christ as the expression of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The saints should all study this truth thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They should understand it to the extent that they can open their mouths and easily teach it to the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They should also make every new one someone who teaches others after just a few months of home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If they do this, then in a very short time many people will know the truth of this mystery and all the other truths of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is what we mean by our commission concerning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The truth includes all the riches of God with light, life, power, and all spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we teach the truth to people, they will spontaneously be fed and supplied with life, and they will be able to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The life spoken of in the Bible refers to the uncreated, eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This life is not something outside of or apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This life is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, this life is the Spirit, and the Spirit is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we say that we minister life to people, we mean that we minister the Spirit and Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Life, the Spirit, and Christ are all appositives referring to one substantial matter the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we should all jump with rejoicing because we have obtained this eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God, however, does not stop here.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He has a unique purpose in dispensing His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His intention is that we, the regenerated ones, may be sanctified, renewed, transformed, and conformed to the image of His firstborn Son and that we may be constituted as His Body, the church, the golden lampstands appearing in each locality to express His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, our fourth commission is to build up the new ones those who were baptized, have been edified in the truth, have grown in life, and are being transformed into the Body of Christ as the corporate expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Most people consider Christianity a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Bible religion is a negative term, not a positive one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, the Bible actually depreciates religion; religion has no position in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, is so-called Christianity really a religion?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to the orthodox, scriptural teaching, Christianity is actually not a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The suffix -ianity was brought in by translators.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Bible there is only "Christ" without the "-ianity."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ is a living Person who is the embodiment of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and who passed through death and resurrection to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in order that we can breathe Him in and be filled and occupied by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I believe that when we meet together, He is with us, and He is also moving in many ways, giving grace to each one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the Christ mentioned in the Bible and the Christ whom we preach, believe, worship, and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is not a religion, not even so-called Christianity; rather, He is the living Christ as the contents of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the other hand, according to the degraded and deformed situation of Christianity, it has truly become a great religion, of which the largest sect is Catholicism and the second largest is Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Protestantism, there are many denominations and sects.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a universally recognized fact.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May we all understand that we do not represent any kind or any sect of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We represent the church of God, which is the church as the living Body of Christ constituted with all the saints, that is, with all those who have His eternal life.</S>
