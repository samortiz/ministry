   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SEED BEING THE WORD OF GOD, THE SONS OF THE KINGDOM, AND CHRIST HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Gospels, the Lord Jesus likened Himself to a sower sowing the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The seed is the word of God Luke 8:11 , the sons of the kingdom Matt 13:38 , and Christ Himself 1 Pet 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word of God is the embodiment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word of God being the seed means that the seed is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the sons of the kingdom, we are also the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that we are the reproduction of Christ, the unique seed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In John 12:24, the Lord Jesus indicated that He was the unique grain, or seed, who fell into the earth and died.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through the death of the one grain of wheat, many grains are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The one grain is Jesus, and the many grains are we.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, we are the reproduction of Jesus because the many grains are the reproduction of the one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Human words are not adequate to explain the marvelous and deep mystery of the rich, all-inclusive seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must remember that the word of God, Christ, and we are the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not have the ambition to be merely Bible teachers, but we have to be seeds for the reproduction of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Apostle Paul told the Corinthians that he was their father who begot them through the gospel 1 Cor 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1 Corinthians the Apostle Paul used three phrases to describe his relationship with them: "I fed you" 3:2, ASV ; "I planted" 3:6 ; and "I have begotten you" 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul emphasized the fact that he had begotten the Corinthians and that he had planted and fed them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul was a father, a farmer, and a feeder.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to be sowers and seeds in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to sow ourselves into the church life in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to be those who beget, plant, and feed others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to be the seeds with life in them for food.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not be in our localities to pass on merely teachings or knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should be there as seeds with life in them, which are good for food to feed others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to plant ourselves, sow ourselves, as the seed in our localities.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we will be fathers and farmers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We will be those who reproduce and bring forth life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>DEALING WITH OUR HEART FOR THE GROWTH OF THE SEED OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Matthew 13 and Luke 8 show us that the Lord came to sow the seed, which is Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After being sown into us, the seed of life needs to grow, and its growth needs our cooperation, our coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our cooperation, or coordination, is to have a proper heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The problem is not with the spirit but with the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The heart includes the conscience Heb 10:22 , the mind Heb 4:12 , the emotion John 16:20 , and the will Acts 11:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are going to coordinate with the growth of the seed within us, we have to deal with our conscience, our mind, our emotion, and our will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not deal with all the parts of our heart, it will be hard for the seed of life to grow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus gave four illustrations of the kind of heart we might have: the wayside, the rocky places, the thorns, and the good earth Matt 13:4-8, 19-23; Luke 8:5-8a, 11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The wayside is the outskirts, or the edge, of the field that is close to the way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because it is so close to the way, it is easily hardened by the traffic of the way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many unbelievers' and believers' hearts are hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The wayside signifies the heart that is hardened by worldly traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our heart may be too close to the traffic of today s world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The seed cannot penetrate such a heart hardened by worldly traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The seed can only fall on the surface where the birds, signifying the evil one, Satan, can come and snatch it away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Satan, the evil one in the air Matt 13:19 , realizes that the seed cannot get into the heart that is like the wayside, so he comes to snatch away the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before farmers sow seed, they generally till the soil to loosen it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the wayside is hardened, so it is easy for the birds to snatch away the seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If our heart is the wayside, it is easy for Satan to come and snatch away the word that was sown in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The next type of soil is the soil with the rocky places.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Matthew 13:5 tells us that this kind of soil lacks "depth of earth."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the surface is the earth and underneath are the rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Underneath the soil of our heart, there may be rocky places.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The wayside is hard, but not as hard as rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the surface our heart may appear to be soft, but underneath we may be hardened as rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The seed within us may grow and spring up, but it cannot root deep within us because of the rocky places.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The ones with a shallow heart and with hidden rocks cannot stand against any temptation or persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The rocks may signify hidden sins, personal desires, self-seeking, and self-pity which frustrate the seed from gaining root in the depth of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Luke 8:6 tells us that the seed which fell in the rock sprouted up, but withered because it had no moisture.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The shallow earth is easily dried up by the heat of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the earth is deep, the surface may dry up, but there will still be some moisture or water underneath that maintains the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We all have to go to the Lord and allow Him to examine us so that we may see how deep the earth is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The thorns signify the anxiety of the age, the deceitfulness of riches, and the pleasures of life that choke the seed Matt 13:22; Luke 8:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>These thorns choke the word from growing in the heart and cause it to become unfruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A good heart is a heart that has been thoroughly tilled and is soft toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is a heart that is not hardened by worldly traffic, without hidden sins, without the anxiety of the age, the deceitfulness of riches, and the pleasures of life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The wayside, the rocky places, and the thorns have to be dealt with thoroughly in order for us to have a good heart.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The good heart is a heart with a pure and good conscience, with a considerate and sober mind, with an affectionate yet restricted emotion, and with a softened and flexible will.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Such a heart gives every inch of its ground to receive the word that the word may grow, bear fruit, and produce even a hundredfold Matt 13:23 .</S>
