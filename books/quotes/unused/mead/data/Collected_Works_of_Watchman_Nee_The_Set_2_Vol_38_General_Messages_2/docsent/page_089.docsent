   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ROMANS 8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 8 tells us how we belong to Christ and how He performs everything within us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Chapter six removes the sinner; it does not remove the sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Chapter seven removes the flesh; it does not remove the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through the cross of Christ, our old man is removed and sin is made of none effect.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through the flesh of Christ, our flesh is gone and the law is made of none effect.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapters five through eight show on the one hand that we are in Christ and on the other hand that we are in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They show on the one hand that we are in the Spirit and on the other hand that we are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 5:12-21 speaks of our being in Adam; this is an objective fact before salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 6:1-11 speaks of our being in Christ; this is an objective spiritual fact after salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Chapter seven speaks of our subjective experience in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A man can understand the spiritual fact in Romans 6:1-11, but he will fail if he exercises the fleshly power in chapter seven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In chapter eight we find that the true power is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In chapter seven we have the flesh and the law, but in chapter eight we only have the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In chapter seven the law reveals God's will, but the flesh tries to do His will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In chapter eight the Holy Spirit is doing God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now the Holy Spirit Himself has become a law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are two great problems in chapter seven: 1 The law is not perfect, and 2 man is wrong in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In chapter seven we find two laws: the law of sin and the law of death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In chapter eight we find only one law: the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sin refers to what one does actively, whereas death refers to what one fails to do passively.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the active side, the law of sin relates to sin, whereas on the negative side, the law of death relates to God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sin is our committing of transgressions, whereas death is our extreme weakness to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The law of sin operates in us and causes us to sin, whereas the law of death operates in us and makes us powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The man in chapter seven first discovers the law of death and then the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Doctrinally speaking, we have the law of sin and of death, but experientially speaking, we have sin and the mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man's sin has to do with his body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The body of sin in Romans 6:6 means that the body is under sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chapter six also speaks of the body of sin being unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The sin in Romans 7:5 and 23 dwells in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that the law of sin dwells in the members.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Romans 8:9-10 says that Christ dwells in us through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is the result of these two indwellings?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These indwellings occur within us at the same time, yet there is a difference between the work of the two indwellings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Chapter eight speaks of Christ saving our spirit before our body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Chapter seven shows a man who is indwelt by Christ, resulting in his inner man desiring God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the same time, we see the evil in the mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The righteousness referred to in Romans 1:1 5:11 is an "imputed" righteousness, whereas the righteousness after 5:12 is a "dispensed" righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Romans 8:11 speaks of the Holy Spirit dwelling within us and giving life to our mortal bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to a Chinese maxim, when one draws a dragon, he does not draw the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because the drawings are so life-like, there is the thought that once the eyes are "dotted in," the dragon will fly away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Holy Spirit is "dotted in" in us, the body flies away, and this same body becomes one with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to wait for the full redemption of the body before we can allow Christ to live in us in full.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, even though the body is not yet redeemed, it no longer has to be a frustration to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Chapter six speaks of the body of death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Chapter seven says that a believer should not try to do good any longer, because he has a body of death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we want to accomplish anything, we have to look to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to believe that He is working, and we have to look to His working and believe that He has accomplished what He wanted to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Chapter eight begins with "no condemnation" and ends with glorification; this is the subject of chapter eight.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God will not be satisfied until He saves us all the way into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The result of man's fall is that he comes short of the glory of God, whereas the Lord has come to bring many sons into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A man who lives in the flesh is a man who lives by the power of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>With such a one, there are only natural power and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Chapter seven shows how weak a man in the flesh is.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His weakness is proven by the fact that he cannot keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once God puts man into the Holy Spirit, he overcomes.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Being in Christ is objective, whereas being in the Holy Spirit is subjective; the Holy Spirit dispenses all of Christ's accomplishments upon us and into us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ is our life, but the Holy Spirit makes us alive.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What is the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the Holy Spirit descends, we have the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Father designed the plan of salvation; this gives us the hope of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Son accomplished salvation; this gives us the basis of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Holy Spirit wrought this salvation into us; this gives us the fact of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Holy Spirit can only carry out His work according to Christ; He cannot do what Christ has not accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The work of the Spirit is fellowship; therefore, He transmits what the Son has done to us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Everything that is in Christ becomes living when it is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Since both Christ and the Spirit have come, why are believers still lacking in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The reason is that they have not experienced Romans 7 adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our position is in Christ, but we are not aware of the corruption of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, we still live in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The activities of the flesh put a man in the flesh and cause him to be no longer in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Only after a man has become utterly disappointed with the flesh will he be in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Whenever God's truth is separated from the Holy Spirit, it becomes the law.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whenever Christ's work is separated from the Holy Spirit, it becomes useless within man.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A spiritual matter is living only when it is put into the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Apart from the Holy Spirit, everything is dead cf.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In this world, only those who have lost hope in themselves will know the work of the Spirit.</S>
