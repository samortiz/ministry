   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE BASIC OBSTACLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO PROPHESYING Scripture Reading: 2 Sam 23:2; Acts 6:10; Rev 2:7; 22:17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For many years Christians have read 1 Corinthians 14, but they have not had a way to carry out what is spoken in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a result, for centuries Christian teachers, for the most part, have neglected this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, some did give an adequate definition of the word prophesying, saying that to prophesy is to speak for, to speak forth, and to foretell.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But, they did not see that in 1 Corinthians 14, to prophesy denotes only speaking for God and speaking forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this chapter it does not bear the denotation of foretelling.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is proved by verses 3 and 24.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 3 says, "But he who prophesies speaks to men building up and encouragement and consolation."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 is to speak building up for the church, encouragement for the Lord's work, and consolation for our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Building up, encouragement, and consolation have nothing to do with foretelling.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 24 says, "But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To convict and judge people, to expose their condition, is not to predict.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most Christians did not see this clearly; thus, they did not have the proper practice of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Pentecostal believers paid much attention to 1 Corinthians 14, but they understood it wrongly, teaching that to prophesy in this chapter means to foretell.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1937 Brother Nee saw a vision concerning prophesying as speaking for God and Christ and speaking forth God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He saw that prophesying is the basic factor of a church meeting in mutuality and that there should not be only one speaker in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Corinthians 14:31 says, "For you can all prophesy one by one," and verse 24 says, "But if all prophesy."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all can speak, and we all must speak.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 26 says, "Whenever you come together, each one has."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Based on all these verses, Brother Nee saw that 1 Corinthians 14 refers to a meeting of mutuality in which everyone speaks and everyone listens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, at that time we did not find the way to replace the traditional Lord's Day morning "service" in which one person spoke and all the others listened.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, we too somewhat put this matter aside in our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Almost fifty years later, in 1984, we began to consider this matter further, and since that time we have spoken concerning this for more than five years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have studied this matter again and again, and I believe that the Lord has been merciful to us and has shown us the real denotation of prophesying according to 1 Corinthians 14 and the way to practice this kind of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Of all the messages I have given on this matter in the last five and a half years, the first three messages of this series, entitled "The Basic Knowledge," "The Patterns," and "The Basic Constituents of a Prophecy," are most crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I hope that all the saints will spend much time to dive into those three messages and practice what is written in them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we learn to prophesy in a proper, adequate way according to 1 Corinthians 14, we will take a big step for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have the basic knowledge concerning prophesying, and we have seen the patterns of prophesying and the constituents of a prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, there is a basic obstacle to our prophesying that we all need to strive to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>TO PROPHESY BEING TO COOPERATE WITH THE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>SPEAKING SPIRIT OF GOD AND CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we have seen, to prophesy is to speak for God and Christ and to speak forth God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To speak in this way is to cooperate with the speaking Spirit of God and Christ 2 Sam 23:2; Acts 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible unveils to us that God is a speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hebrews 1:1-2 says, "In many portions and in many ways, God, having spoken of old to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is not a dumb God; He is always speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The highest and greatest speaking in the universe is the Bible, which contains sixty-six books of God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible is the book of books because it is the speaking of God.</S>
