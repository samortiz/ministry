   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>For a clearer understanding, I will give an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible shows that God accepted Abel's offering but not Cain's Gen 4:2-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Cain was a farmer and cultivated the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is what his father did when he was in the Garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When his father tilled the soil in the Garden of Eden, he brought the produce of the land and offered it to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even though Cain was outside the Garden of Eden because of sin, he tilled the soil as before.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He received produce from the land as before, and he offered it to God as before.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God not only refused to accept him, but also was displeased with him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some people ask, "Why?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is very simple and has but one significance: What man did before he sinned was acceptable to God, but nothing can be worse before God than to do the same thing after man sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose that at eight o'clock each evening a child wants his mother to prepare a snack for him before he goes to bed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But one day he causes some trouble, and his mother has to apologize and pay for damages.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What would happen if he asked his mother to prepare a snack for him as usual as though nothing had occurred?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the child had been crying and was upset over his actions, you might not feel too bad.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if he acts as if nothing has happened, you would feel very bad.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a child is not bothered after making trouble, when he grows up he may even kill people and not be bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Cain was just like this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What he had done before, he continued to do in the same way after having sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He continued to offer things to God as though nothing had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He considered committing sin a small matter; he did not think it was anything serious.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Abel was accepted because he acknowledged that he was outside the Garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His offering acknowledged that he had sinned and that his present situation was different from what it had been in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are afraid of frivolous people like Cain; this kind of people cannot serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They say, "We are in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The denominations were not formed by us; they were formed by our forefathers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We bear some responsibility in them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot say, Good!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let us be united tomorrow.'</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What about the denominations we are in?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God wants the church to be united, but denominations divide it!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When one begins to be conscious that it is wrong to be divided in this way, he must confess that this is wrong before God; he must tear it down.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He should say, "O God, although this denomination was not formed by me but by my forefathers, I am sinful as long as I am a part of it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not just a personal matter; it involves the whole church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today I would ask You to tear it down; today I would declare that there is something wrong in it."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the right way to act.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose I form a denomination and afterwards realize that something is wrong and try to ameliorate it by saying, "Let us have fellowship."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am afraid of this kind of frivolous and light-minded behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is Cain's behavior, not condemning sin after he had sinned but trying to repair the situation instead.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is very unchristian.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers, are you clear?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not think it is all right to not condemn but only attempt to repair it after you have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is never the expression of God's life!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, suppose I offend a brother by speaking many things behind his back.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What should I do when I am rebuked by God's light?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>First, I must go to him and confess my sin: "Brother, I have sinned against you by speaking many things to undermine you behind your back.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please accept my apology."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then it is right for me to express some love to him the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What if a man sins against you, steals many things from you, speaks against you, and then behaves as if nothing has happened?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He does not confess his sin at all, but turns around to treat you well and to send gifts to you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How would you feel about him?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We Christians do have a way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we have done something wrong, we cannot change a little without confessing our mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not right to act this way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is not the way before God to solve our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Such a person should come to you and confess, "Brother, I am wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I owe you money, and I owe you other things."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He must first confess his sin before he can show his love.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the principle by which a Christian may be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The principle here is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today it is not just a matter of whether or not the denominations are right.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What matters is that if we feel they are right, we must support them, but if we feel they are wrong, we have to tear them down.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should not shake hands over the fence.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we say it is right to have the fence, then we must build it higher.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we feel the fence is wrong, we must tear it down.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should not have "spiritual" fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What they call "spiritual" fellowship means a fellowship that is not thorough enough.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even though the denominations are wrong, some are reluctant to forsake them; they still want to preserve them while at the same time stretching their hand out for a little fellowship with others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we fall into this category, it is definitely not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I do not know if we see this clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must see this thoroughly before we can go out to deal with the situations in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is not enough for those who formerly closed themselves from others to merely open the window, shake hands over the fence, and think that this is all they need to do.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If this fence should exist, I will build it stronger and higher, but if this fence should not exist, I will tear it down.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Keeping different denominations and yet having fellowship is self-deception.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Today in China, there are probably three kinds of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The first kind is the unity of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The second kind is the "spiritual unity," which means that although the separating "cups" still exist outwardly, one tells himself that such "cups" do not exist in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This seems strange to me!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If the denominations are not important, why should people allow them to exist?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If the denominations are not important, why do people react when the denominations are touched?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is quite puzzling.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If the denominations are important, we should support them; if they are not, we should tear them down.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If fellowship is necessary, let us fellowship and not have the so-called "spiritual" fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is a really good term, but its usage has been spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is not really a "spiritual" fellowship but only a "half-way" fellowship!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If this matter is made clear, I think the problem of unity can be solved easily.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>With this kind of "spiritual" unity there is a great problem: Those who advocate "spiritual" unity give their attention to God's children while neglecting God's command.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In other words, they pay attention to the feeling of God's children but forget the feeling of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>A man who supports the denominations is one who knows God very little.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But many people dare not support the denominations if they are asked.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They feel that the denominations are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>However, because they have a consideration for many of God's children in the denominations, they are not faithful enough to thoroughly unveil the truth of God to them.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They do not show them how the divisions among God's children are against God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>They are afraid that this will create some kind of partition between them and many of God's children who are in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If they are asked whether or not they advocate and support the denominations, they would be somewhat bothered because they have studied the Word and received some light.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Denominations are condemned before God and rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Nevertheless, they want to have a "spiritual" unity.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This kind of "spiritual" unity or this attitude of shaking hands over the fence is nothing but a method to accommodate, a method to reconcile, and a method of compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>They dare not utterly uphold the denominations, but they are reluctant to utterly forsake the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Consequently, they allow the denominations to exist and advocate a "spiritual" unity, a "spiritual" fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The real significance of what they call "spiritual" unity is a reluctance to be absolute toward God or to follow His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>They dare not be absolute toward God for fear of men.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The fear of being absolute toward God is today's difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In fact, many advocate "spiritual" fellowship and "spiritual" oneness because they cannot come up to the Lord's demand; they are not absolute toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This method is not from the teaching of the Scriptures, but from man's wisdom and fear.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I believe that when we do not stand on the side of God's children to excuse their weaknesses and their failures, but stand on the Lord's side to look at His glory and His holiness, we will see that unity by accommodation is not of the Lord's will and is not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We must be very clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If we are clear about this, we can solve the problems.</S>
