   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Exchanging the Birthright for a Pottage of Lentils</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One day Esau came back from his hunting in the field and was fainting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He spoke to Jacob, saying, "Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jacob said, "Sell me this day thy birthright."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time Esau was very tired and answered carelessly, "I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a result, Esau sold his birthright to Jacob Gen 25:29-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This incident reveals the craftiness of Jacob's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jacob treasured the birthright, which shows that he treasured God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is good, but it was not good for him to acquire the birthright through such a deception.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This shows that Jacob was a person who used his own strength to gain what God wanted to give to him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Receiving His Father's Blessing through Deception</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jacob plotted with his mother to deceive his father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His father told Esau, "Go out to the field, and take me some venison; and make me savory meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die" 27:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But Jacob, under his mother's guidance, took advantage of the weakness of his father's old age and feeble eyesight.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He put on Esau's clothes, took skins of the kids of the goats, made savory meat, and received the blessing, thus deceiving his father vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>6-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once again this shows the craftiness and wickedness of Jacob's character.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some may ask, "If this blessing had gone to Esau, the elder would not have served the younger.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Would that not have put God's promise in jeopardy?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's promise was to bless Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By doing this, Jacob fulfilled God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Was this not very good?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, we have to know that God's promise does not require man's hand for its fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Will God's throne shake, and does it require man's hand to uphold and stabilize it?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These are man's thoughts!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jacob was a supplanter in his mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When he was young, he deceived his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then he deceived his father with trickery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These incidents reveal Jacob's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was very clever and crafty!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was Jacob's natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was his natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>JACOB'S DISCIPLINE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God had to deal with a person like Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After he received his blessing through deception, he could no longer remain at home.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He knew that his brother would kill him, and he could only escape.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He ran away like a refugee.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Away from Home</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He cheated his brother out of the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet in the end he received God's disciplining hand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The result of his fleshly activity was discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God exercises more discipline on those who are clever, capable, shrewd, and resourceful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, we must thank the Lord because through His discipline, Jacob received the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From this time on, God continued to discipline him so that he would be blessed through the discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was forced to leave his father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He left his parents and set out on his lonely journey to Padan-aram.</S>
