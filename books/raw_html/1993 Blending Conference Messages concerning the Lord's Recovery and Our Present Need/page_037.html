<P>This is the oneness of the Spirit defined by the apostle Paul in Ephesians 4. We need this oneness to be in the realm where the Body of Christ can grow and be built up. Without this realm, the Body of Christ is mere terminology. That is why Paul charged us to keep the oneness of the Spirit with all diligence. We have this oneness in actuality, but we need to keep it in practicality.</P><P>Paul goes on to tell us that just to have the oneness of the Spirit in reality is not sufficient. Eventually, all the members of the Body should attain to the oneness of their common faith in Christ and of their common knowledge of the Son of God (Eph. 4:13). Merely to have the oneness of the Spirit is not sufficient for the building up of the Body of Christ. We need the oneness in practicality, that is, the oneness of our common faith in Christ.</P><P>The faith here refers to the objective faith, which is all the things we believe in for our salvation. The three main items of our faith are God Himself, the person of Christ, and the work of Christ. We believe in what God is, what Christ is, and what Christ has done. This is our faith. We believe in the Triune God Himself who is the unique God in the universe, the Creator of heaven and earth and all the things in them. We also believe in Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, the One who possesses both divinity and humanity. We also believe in all the work that Christ has done. We believe that He was incarnated, crucified, resurrected, ascended, and that one day He is coming back. All these are the items of our faith that cause us to be saved.</P><P>We need to be one in these items of our faith. Unfortunately, many Christians are more concerned with many minor items, such as head covering, how we should be baptized, or the miraculous gifts. But these are not items of our faith which bring us salvation and which cause us to be one. So not only do we have the reality of the oneness of the Spirit; we need to go on and grow up until we arrive at the oneness of our common faith in Christ. We should drop all the minor items that cause dissension. We need to come back to the unique faith that brings us salvation.</P><P>Not only so, Paul said that we need to arrive at the practical oneness of our common knowledge of the Son of God. Jesus Christ as the Son of God is all-inclusive and all-extensive, yet the knowing of this Christ by all the believers varies a great deal. Many Christians know Him only as the Savior, as the Lamb of God. But in the Lord's recovery, we know this Christ not only as the Savior, as the Lamb of God, but also as the all-inclusive One. He is the living bread (John 6:51), the living water (4:10, 14), the light of life (8:12), and the breath of life (20:22). In John 10 He is the door for the sheep to go in and out and the green pasture on which we feed (v. 9). Christ is so much to us, but because of the differences in the knowing of Christ among the believers, there is a lack of oneness. Thus, there is the need to grow, to go on, to arrive at the full knowledge of the Son of God. We want to know Christ in His all-inclusiveness and His all-extensiveness.</P><P>When we arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, we will not merely possess the oneness in reality, but we will be one practically. We need to be in this realm of oneness for the Body of Christ to grow and to be built up. As the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ is constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God through the dispensing of the Triune God and by the transfusing of the ascended Christ. Then after being formed, this Body of Christ is growing and is being built up.</P>
