EXERCISING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Blending in spirit does not refer merely to our coming together to have exciting prayers. Rather, it refers to the need to pray with our spirit. All our dealings with God are a matter of the spirit. In order to touch God and anything of God, we must be in spirit. We must exercise our spirit so that our spirit can be enriched and strengthened. The best way to exercise our spirit is to pray. The fundamental way to blend in spirit is to pray with our spirit.</p>
<p>In the past we did not spend enough time to pray. Now we are promoting blending in spirit in order to encourage the saints&mdash;including the co-workers, the elders, and the responsible ones&mdash;to be praying persons. We need to exercise our spirit so that we can pray at any time and in any place. Even while we are walking or driving, we can still pray. This kind of praying in any place will cause us to exercise our spirit more, and our spirit will become stronger. Herein lies our real growth.</p>
<p>The secret to blending in spirit is to exercise our spirit. We should exercise our spirit individually in our daily life; also, every time we meet with the saints, we need to release our spirit to pray together. It does not matter what kind of meeting we are in or who is in the meeting, our spirit should be released. If we would all practice in this way, our meetings would be rich, and every saint would be released. Thus, our spirits would be blended and become one flow, and the river of water of life would flow among us. This is the way for death and sins to be washed away and for the riches of the Spirit to flow in. Therefore, we must be diligent to exercise our spirit until it is strong, uplifted, fresh, and living. We should use every occasion to exercise our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THOUGHTS AND WORDS<br />
BEING CRUCIAL IN OUR EXERCISE</h2>
<p>In order for our spirit to come forth effectively, our thoughts need to be properly exercised, and our speaking needs to match our thoughts. Such an exercise depends on our praying more. Prayer causes us to exercise not only our spirit but also our mind when we speak. Suppose a brother who does not often pray decides to pray. His thoughts and words may not express his burden. He will probably be able to utter a few sentences, but he will not be able to express the burden in his spirit. However, if he prayed regularly, once his spirit is exercised, his words will express the burden in his spirit. Our thoughts and words must match the burden in our spirit.</p>
<p>We must spend more time to pray regularly. On the one hand, we must exercise our spirit, and on the other hand, we must not overlook the importance of our thoughts and words. Then when we pray in the meetings, our spirit will be strong and fresh, our thoughts will be clear, and our words will be adequate. This is the way for our prayers to be rich and for the Spirit to be expressed through us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>The purpose of this fellowship concerning blending in spirit is to encourage us to pray more. Whenever we come and meet, every saint needs to open his spirit and pray. We should pray not only once but often so that our spirits are released, the Spirit is expressed, we are blended in spirit, and the whole church is full of life.</p>
<p>In order to be blended in spirit, our spirits must be released in a strong, rich, and living way. As long as the Spirit of life can flow, death and sins will be washed away because the flow of life has the function of watering and also the function of washing and cleansing. It not only supplies us with life but also washes away defects and impurities and brings in the spiritual riches. The spiritual riches in the church will increase when we allow the Spirit of life to flow freely within us.</p>
<p>In the past we did not allow the Spirit of life to flow freely in us; therefore, we suffered a great loss. It was as if we were sitting in a foul-smelling house, but we were unwilling to open the windows. Now we must open the windows and let in fresh air.</p>
<p>I hope that we will stress the flow of the Spirit of life through prayer. We should not stress the messages or other aspects of the work. May the Lord cause the churches to become praying churches, where the Spirit of life flows freely. We are not seeking the outpouring of the Spirit, nor are we seeking excitement. However, when we are blended in spirit, the outpouring of the Spirit will be brought in. In the blending we touch the unsearchable riches of Christ, and this is much more precious than momentary excitement. When we touch the fountain that flows endlessly, our spirit will be living, fresh, uplifted, and rich, even if we are not excited. May the Lord lead us to be blended in spirit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of the Spirit and the Building of God &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
