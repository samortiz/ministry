In a sense our training qualifies us to put forth our requirements. We would all like to go to a place where the elders are so positive and one with us to help us carry out what we have been trained to do. But where is such a church that is positively taking the new way according to what we have been hearing in the training and where all of the elders are really one with us? When we go to serve the Lord, we should not have any choice. All the churches are good. No church is not good. Regardless of how much training we have received, every church is good for us. For example, suppose a church is opposing the new way. Is that still the church or not? It is a genuine local church since it is still right in its nature. It is the church of God. It is also right in its ground. It is the church in a certain city. Furthermore, it is right in its element. It is sanctified in Christ. Even though a church opposes the new way to the uttermost, it is still the church if it is right in its nature, element, and ground. However, would we recognize it as the church? If the Lord speaks to us to go to that church to serve Him, would we go there? We have to go; we have no choice. No church is not good for us to serve. Regardless of its situation and condition, as long as it is right in its nature, in its element, and in its ground, it is the church. As long as it is the church of God in a certain city and sanctified in Christ, it is the church. We must go and serve there.</P><P>We should never go there to revolt, revolutionize everything, or do something to chase away the elders and set up new elders. To revolt is wrong, to revolutionize is wrong, and to chase away the elders is wrong. We have to go along with the church and with the elders. We should not rekindle a fire. However, this does not mean that we should not practice what we have been trained to do. We can still practice the preaching of the gospel, the feeding of the lambs, the perfecting of the saints, and the raising up of others to prophesy.</P><P>We may say that to do this is against what the church practices there. But whether it is against what that church is practicing or not depends on how we carry out these four things. If we go to a church which is opposing the new way and we are not allowed to revolt, to revolutionize anything, to chase anyone away, or to rekindle a fire, we can still preach the gospel. No one would condemn us just because we are preaching the gospel. We should just go to preach the gospel. We must go to visit people. When we reach their door, we preach the gospel. Do not promote or declare that we practice door knocking. There is no need to say this. But we do tell people that we have a burden to save the sinners and to visit our relatives, friends, and colleagues. We do have a genuine burden to preach the gospel. No one would condemn any kind of preaching of the gospel. We should just go. If there is the need of a telephone call, we just make the telephone calls. If there is the need of knocking on doors, we just do it. If there is the need of writing a letter, we just do it. Do not promote it, and do not impose any point on anyone. We should do the preaching of the gospel in the way that we have been trained. Do not advertise, and do not declare that we are going to visit people by knocking on doors. This is wrong. We may preach the gospel by door knocking, by telephone calls, or by writing letters.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Instruction and Exhortation to the Trainees &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
