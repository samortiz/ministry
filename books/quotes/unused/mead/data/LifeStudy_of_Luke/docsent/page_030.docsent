   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the first three and a half chapters of the Gospel of Luke we see that two angels and a number of human beings were involved in the preparation of the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1:30-35 we have the prophecy of the archangel Gabriel, who came to Mary and told her that God intended that she conceive the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In that prophecy Gabriel spoke of four matters concerning the coming Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, Gabriel said that the Man-Savior would be called Jesus 1:31 , which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, Gabriel indicated that the coming Man-Savior would be called Son of the Most High v. 32 , a title that refers to His deity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Third, Gabriel said, The Lord God will give to Him the throne of David His father v. 32 . Here we see that in His humanity the coming Savior was to be a descendant of David.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Fourth, the archangel Gabriel refers to the coming Savior as the holy thing which is to be born and who will be called Son of God v. 35 . Therefore, according to Gabriel s word, the Man-Savior is Jesus, the Son of the Most High, a descendant of David, and the holy thing.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here Elizabeth speaks of the Man-Savior as the fruit of Mary s womb and as the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fruit refers to His humanity, and Lord refers to His deity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Zachariah</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Another Angel</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 2:11 we have the angel s announcement at the birth of the Man-Savior: A Savior was born to you today in David s city, who is Christ the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the angel s announcement the Man-Savior is mentioned as being the Savior, Christ, and the Lord.</S>
