   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-SIX PAUL AND AGABUS GUIDANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God never allows the church to take over the individual's responsibility of receiving guidance from God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Agabus was a prophet and a very earnest one, but he was young, inexperienced, and very anxious to display his guidance for Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, we find in God's Word that one needs clear guidance from God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the other hand, we need the backing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But there may be a group of Christians who say, "We are the church, you must obey us."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The prophetic voice, however, should never come before the voice of the Spirit to an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Otherwise, we will have a Romish church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The so-called church often uses its authority like this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Holy Spirit may not speak to us directly; He may speak to another and then to us through him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But He cannot ignore us; He cannot fail to inform us at the same time by giving us the witness in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He will let us know that we are to receive guidance through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, this guidance cannot be contrary to any light He has already given us or any partial guidance we received in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If it is from Him, He will give us clarity in our spirits, and our spirits will respond to what the church says.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In other words there will be the confirmation in our spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Holy Spirit will always let us know if we are going to receive guidance through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Having a prophet come to us first and tell us what God wants us to do is part of the Old Testament dispensation, not the New Testament dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the Lord had meant to give Paul guidance through the disciples He would have intimated this fact to Paul first, preparing his heart for their word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then Paul would have responded and acquiesced.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Agabus's act was contrary to God's way of guidance in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result, Paul did not go along with his suggestion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Subsequently, we hear nothing more concerning this prophet, but God uses eight out of twenty-eight chapters in Acts to tell us of Paul's doings after he made this so-called false step!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was not God's will for him to go to Jerusalem, but because a dangerous precedent would have been set, He allowed Paul to go and blessed him in it because his heart was perfect toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The prophet precipitated this by rushing in instead of waiting for God to show the same thing to Paul first.</S>
