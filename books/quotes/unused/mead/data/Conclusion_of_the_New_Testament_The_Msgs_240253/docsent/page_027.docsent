   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ITS NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to the nature of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We shall use six adjectives to describe the kingdom in its nature: divine, heavenly, spiritual, human, pure, and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. Divine the Kingdom of God,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>with the Divine Attributes</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In its nature the kingdom of God Mark 1:15 is divine, having the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word divine means being of God, having the nature of God, or being transcendent and distinct from all others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only God has the nature of God, and only God is transcendent and distinct from everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, only God is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The nature of the kingdom is divine because it is the kingdom of God with the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because the kingdom is the kingdom of God, its nature will be the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since God is holy, surely His kingdom also will be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Likewise, since God is righteous, His kingdom will be righteous as well.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is divine, and the kingdom, being the kingdom of God, will also be divine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. Heavenly the Kingdom of the Heavens,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>with the Transcendency of the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The kingdom is also heavenly in nature, for it is the kingdom of the heavens Matt 3:2 , with the transcendency of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church today should also be transcendent; there should be a certain transcendency in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As members of the church, we are not low but have the heavenly nature with the transcendency of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>C. Spiritual of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>in the Human Spirit,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>with the Bountiful Supply of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The kingdom is spiritual in nature because it is of the Holy Spirit in the regenerated human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Romans 14:17 tells us that the kingdom of God is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Matthew 5:3 says, Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From these verses we can see that the kingdom is a matter of the Holy Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the kingdom in its nature is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Philippians 1:19 Paul speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the Spirit mentioned by the Lord Jesus in John 7:39.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord s incarnation but the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit with divinity, after the Lord s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a Spirit has a bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since the Spirit has a bountiful supply, the kingdom, which is of the Spirit in our spirit, is full of the bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>D. Human the Kingdom of the Son of Man,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>with the Human Virtues</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In nature the kingdom is also human, for it is the kingdom of the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After man was seduced by Satan to follow him, God became a man to undo the works of the Devil 1 John 3:8 and destroy him Heb 2:14 , so that He might reclaim the earth to be His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the coming kingdom, which Christ will bring in Dan 7:13-14; Luke 19:12-15 , He will be the Son of Man as a sign both of His victory and glory and of Satan s defeat and shame.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the kingdom is human in its nature, having the human virtues, the Lord charged us not to cancel any commandment related to morality Matt 5:17-48 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the contrary, we should keep all commandments related to morality in order to have the human virtues to match the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>E. Pure the Salt of the Earth,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>with the Killing Power of the Death of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God s kingdom is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is the salt of the earth Matt 5:13 , with the killing power of the death of Christ 2 Cor 4:10a, 12a; Phil 3:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Matthew 5:13 the Lord Jesus says, You are the salt of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By nature, salt is an element that kills the germs of corruption and eliminates them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the kingdom of God there is a nature which is as pure as the salt of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This nature has the killing power of the death of Christ to kill the germs of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>F. Eternal the Eternal Kingdom,</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>with Its Unlimitedness</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Finally, in its nature the kingdom is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is the eternal kingdom 2 Pet 1:11 , with its unlimitedness.</S>
