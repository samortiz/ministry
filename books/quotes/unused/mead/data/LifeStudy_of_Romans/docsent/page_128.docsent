   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE BEING FREED FROM DEATH 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have seen, the focal point of the revelation in this book is that God is transforming sinners into sons to form the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is expressed in the Son, the Son is expressed in the Body, and the Body is expressed in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before we became sons, we were constituted sinners 5:19 , not only in name and in position, but in constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We were constituted sinners because sin had entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>SIN ENTERING INTO OUR BEING</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order for a substance to be constituted in a certain way, a particular element must be added into it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By God s creation, we were good, righteous men.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, due to the fall of Adam, sin was injected into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When man fell, he not only made a mistake and did something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If man had only made a mistake, his fall would not have been that serious.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, in the fall something more serious than a mistake occurred: sin was injected into man s being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose a mother has a bottle of poison at home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She keeps it in a specific place and tells her little boy never to touch that bottle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day, while the mother is outside, the little boy, wondering what is in the bottle, takes it, opens it, and drinks some of the poison.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the mother finds out what happened, she is not concerned about the mistake her son has made.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She is worried about the poison that has gotten into him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Most Christians think that man merely disobeyed God and made a mistake in taking the fruit of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not many realize that by man s eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, something evil and even satanic entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through the fall an evil, satanic element was injected into him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible calls this element sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sin is not merely a matter of lying or stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Such things are the fruit of sin, not sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sin is the very nature of Satan, the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Romans 5 through 8 there are many indications that sin is like a living person: it entered 5:12 , it reigns 5:21 , it can lord it over us 6:14 , it deceives us 7:11 , it kills us 7:11 , and it dwells in us 7:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once sin, the evil element of Satan, was injected into man, man was constituted a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now instead of being proper men, we are sinners by our very constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The amount of good or evil we have done makes no difference because sin is now in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although our deeds may not be sinful outwardly, we have a sinful nature inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE RESULTS OF SIN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sin results in a number of things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It has brought in both the flesh and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, we have the problems of sin, the flesh, and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we have still another problem, the ultimate issue of sin, which is death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Where there is sin, there is death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 5:12 Paul says, As through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin; and so death passed to all men because all have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Death comes in through sin and reigns because of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, sin issues in three things: the law, the flesh, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>FREED FROM SIN, THE LAW, AND THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Romans 5 reveals that we have been constituted sinners, and Romans 6 reveals that the body of sin has been made of none effect 6:6 since our old man has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through the death of the old man, we are freed from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we pointed out in a previous message, in Romans 6 we are freed from sin, in Romans 7 we are freed from the law, and in Romans 8 we are freed from the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are free from sin because our old man has been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The death of the old man has caused the body of sin to be unemployed, to be made of none effect.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because the body of sin has lost its job, we no longer need to serve sin as slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that we have been freed from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Likewise, we have been freed from the law because the old husband has died and has been given a funeral.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the time of this funeral, we were married to our new husband.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By losing our old husband and marrying our new husband, we are freed from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As Romans 8 reveals, we are freed from the flesh by walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are freed from sin by having our old man crucified and our body of sin made of none effect; we are freed from the law by burying our old husband and by marrying another; and we are freed from the flesh by walking according to the spirit.</S>
