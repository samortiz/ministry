<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will go on to look at the matter of the believers&rsquo; corporate experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity through entering into the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Living the Kingdom Life<br />
in the Church</h2>
<p>As believers in Christ, we are living the kingdom life in the church life because the church is the kingdom of God in the present age (Matt. 16:18-19; 1 Cor. 6:10; Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5). In one sense, the church is God&rsquo;s family, God&rsquo;s home (2:19; 1 Tim. 3:15); in this home we enjoy grace and receive the life supply. In another sense, the church is also a kingdom. The church is a family, a home that is full of grace and life, yet the church is also a kingdom, a government. The church is our home, and the church is the kingdom. In our home we have the enjoyment of love, the supply of grace, and the riches of life. In the kingdom we have rule, exercise, and discipline.</p>
<p>Romans 14:17 is strong proof that the church is the kingdom of God: &ldquo;The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Here the apostle does not say <em>will be;</em> rather, he uses the present tense <em>is</em> in reference to the kingdom of God. Romans 14 speaks of receiving the believers; hence, according to the entire context, the kingdom is the church life. The reality of the church life is the kingdom. Romans 12 speaks of the Body life, and Romans 14 speaks of the kingdom life. This indicates that in the book of Romans the kingdom life is the reality of the Body life.</p>
<p>Romans 14 says that the kingdom of God is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. When the authority of the kingdom of God is operating within us, righteousness, peace, and joy become the characteristics of our daily living. Righteousness, peace, and joy mean a great deal; these items are the expression of Christ. When Christ is expressed, He is our righteousness toward ourselves, our peace toward others, and our joy before God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Righteous toward Ourselves</h2>
<p>When the believers live the kingdom life in the church, they live a life that is righteous toward themselves. This means that in the practical kingdom life in the church today, we must be strict with ourselves and make no excuses for ourselves. Toward ourselves we must be strict and righteous in everything we do.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Peaceful toward Others</h2>
<p>Furthermore, in living the kingdom life in the church, the believers live a life of peace toward others. This means that our relationship with others must have the characteristic of peace. Toward others we must endeavor to pursue peace, continually seeking to be at peace with them. We must be careful to maintain peace with everyone related to us. This peace is in actuality Christ lived out from our being. Hebrews 12:14 says, &ldquo;Pursue peace with all men.&rdquo; Ephesians 4:3 tells us to be &ldquo;diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.&rdquo; Peace and righteousness are always related to one another. Without righteousness, we cannot have peace. Righteousness must come first; then peace follows. If we deal with ourselves in righteousness, we will have peace with others.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
