<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO SEE<br />
THE TRUTH OF THE DIVINE TRINITY<br />
ACCORDING TO THE REVELATION<br />
OF THE PURE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>The matter of the Divine Trinity has been taught and debated throughout the past nineteen centuries since the early church fathers. This controversy continues even today. I studied all the traditional teachings when I was young, but I eventually began to see certain points concerning the Divine Trinity that are directly according to the revelation of the pure Word of God. Because some of these points differ from the traditional teachings concerning the Trinity, my ministry related to these points has faced opposition. Some condemn us for teaching what we have seen plainly revealed in the Bible and even say that our teachings are heretical. Although we have published some booklets to refute such accusations, we have not completed a thorough study of the Divine Trinity in the holy Word. Our burden in this study is mainly positive&mdash;not to debate but to minister what the Lord has shown us.</p>
<p>We need to complete a thorough, exhaustive study of the Divine Trinity throughout the entire Bible. The best way is not to argue or fight concerning particular points but to come back to the Bible to study the matter. We need to study every verse in the Bible in which the Trinity is either directly indicated or indirectly implied. Because this kind of study of the Word is for our proper apprehension, there will not be many illustrations. Instead, in a precise and brief way we will see what the Bible actually says about the Trinity. For this kind of study we need to concentrate our entire being, exercising both our mind and our spirit. The conclusion of such a thorough and exhaustive study should be the standard by which we measure all other teachings, including those of the church fathers, councils, and creeds. In order to see where there are shortages, excesses, or errors, we should examine these teachings not by human thought nor by our understanding or our view but by a thorough and exhaustive study of the Bible.</p>
<p>Studying the creeds, councils, and teachings from the first six centuries of church history reveals that many of the great teachers became tritheistic. Tritheism is the wrong teaching that there are three Gods. Most of the early teachings concerning the Trinity may be classified into three main categories: conscious tritheism, implied tritheism, and subconscious tritheism. Conscious tritheism is clear tritheism. Included in this category is the great teacher Origen. Many of his teachings were good, but he made a great mistake by teaching that Christ was inferior to God the Father. Many others erred in a similar fashion. Nearly all the creeds, beginning with the Nicene Creed, come under the category of implied tritheism. The creeds do not directly say anything tritheistic, but they contain an implication of tritheism. The third category is subconscious tritheism. Subconsciously, or unconsciously, many teachings have the thought of God as three persons and therefore three Gods. These matters require much consideration, and the most fair and accurate way is by a thorough study of the Bible.</p>
<p>I believe that this study will be a great help not only to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery but also to all the believers. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is a recovery of the truth. With Martin Luther the Lord recovered the truth concerning justification by faith. The crucial truth of the Divine Trinity has been debated for nineteen centuries. It is altogether worthwhile for us to spend our time and energy with a spirit of prayer to conduct a thorough and exhaustive study of the Divine Trinity as revealed in the holy Word. We intentionally use the phrase <em>as revealed in the holy Word</em> in a polemical spirit to imply that we care only for what the Bible says, and we recognize that what the Bible says may be different from traditional teachings. Nevertheless, our spirit is not to fight but to minister the truth to inoculate the saints against wrong teachings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING TRIUNE NOT FOR TEACHING BUT<br />
FOR US TO PARTAKE OF, EXPERIENCE, AND ENJOY HIM</h2>
<p>The Bible contains many explicit teachings, such as the apostle Paul&rsquo;s teaching concerning justification in Romans 3 through 5. However, the Scriptures do not contain any direct teaching or doctrine concerning the Divine Trinity. Instead, the Trinity is only indicated throughout the Scriptures in many narrations of the divine and spiritual facts. For instance, Genesis 1:1, which says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,&rdquo; indicates the Trinity. Although this verse does not contain any teaching or doctrine of the Trinity, we will see that the narration of God&rsquo;s creation definitely indicates that God is triune.</p>
<p>Through the past nineteen centuries many great scholars have primarily considered the Trinity as a teaching for us to know about God&rsquo;s person, His Godhead. However, the fact that the Bible contains no doctrines concerning the Trinity indicates strongly that the Trinity does not exist for teaching but for God to work Himself into us so that we may partake of, experience, and enjoy Him. This is fully proven by Matthew 28:19 and 2 Corinthians 13:14, which are the best verses concerning the Trinity in the Bible.</p>
<p>In Matthew 28:19 the Lord charged His disciples, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Although there is no teaching or doctrine concerning the Trinity here, there is a spiritual fact that those who preach the gospel should baptize the believing ones into the name of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. We are baptized into the Triune God so that we may participate in and enjoy Him. In <em>Word Studies in the New Testament</em> M. R. Vincent says, &ldquo;Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual and mystical union with him.&rdquo; This shows that the Trinity is not for teaching.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; This verse mentions the Trinity&mdash;Jesus Christ the Son, God the Father, and the Holy Spirit&mdash;but it does not teach us a doctrine concerning the Trinity. Instead, the way the Triune God is mentioned indicates that we need to enjoy the Triune God as love, grace, and fellowship. Love as the source corresponds to God the Father. Grace as the expression and the course corresponds to God the Son. Grace and love are transmitted into us through the reaching, the fellowship, of God the Spirit. This is the enjoyment of the Triune God as love, grace, and fellowship. This indicates that the Triune God is for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>Every direct or indirect mention, indication, or implication of the Trinity in the Bible is not for teaching but for our participation in the Triune God. God is triune not for teaching but for dispensing Himself into us that we may enjoy Him. This needs to be deeply impressed into us. Whenever we study a verse in the Bible concerning the Trinity, we should not be content to look for doctrinal teaching but must realize that this verse is for us to know how to participate in, enjoy, and experience the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED IN GENESIS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;In the Beginning God Created<br />
the Heavens and the Earth&rdquo;</h2>
<p>There are at least twelve instances in Genesis that indicate or imply the Trinity. The first is Genesis 1:1, which says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; The subject of this verse, <em>God,</em> which is <em>Elohim</em> in Hebrew, is plural in number, but the predicate, <em>created,</em> is singular. Thus, <em>Elohim</em> is uni-plural, implying the Trinity. The plural subject, <em>God,</em> implies the three of the Godhead, and the singular predicate, <em>created,</em> implies the one God. The three of the Godhead worked as one to create.</p>
<p>God created the heavens and the earth in His trinity because He created the heavens and the earth for man (vv. 26-27). Zechariah 12:1 says, &ldquo;Thus declares Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him.&rdquo; This verse reveals that God&rsquo;s intention and goal in creating the heavens and the earth were to have a man with a spirit so that man may possess Him and enjoy Him and so that God may work Himself into man to fulfill His eternal plan. The first indication of the Trinity in the Bible, revealed in God&rsquo;s creation of the heavens and earth, is for man to exist so that God may dispense Himself into man for man&rsquo;s enjoyment and God&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;The Spirit of God Was Brooding upon<br />
the Surface of the Waters. And God Said,<br />
Let There Be Light; and There Was Light&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:2-3 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters. And God said, Let there be light; and there was light.&rdquo; Initially, we may not see that these verses also imply the Trinity. However, we must consider why the subject of verse 2 is <em>the Spirit of God</em> and not simply <em>God</em> as in verses 1 and 3. After verse 1 says, &ldquo;God created,&rdquo; verse 2 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of God was brooding.&rdquo; This implies the Trinity. God is not as simple as some think&mdash;He is triune. In a sense, the word <em>triune,</em> meaning &ldquo;three-one,&rdquo; is a complicated, puzzling word.</p>
<p>Verse 1 describes God&rsquo;s original creation, and verses 2b and 3 describe His restoration and further creation after the judgment and corruption implied in verse 2a. God carried out His restoration and further creation by His Spirit and His speaking&mdash;His word. John 1:1-3 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...All things came into being through Him.&rdquo; All things came into being, were created, through the Word. Hebrews 11:3 says, &ldquo;The universe has been framed by the word of God.&rdquo; The universe was framed, that is, created, by the word of God. Psalm 33:9 says, &ldquo;He spoke, and it was.&rdquo; This means that God&rsquo;s speaking created. In Genesis 1:1 it is God who is creating, but in verses 2 and 3 it is the Spirit of God and God&rsquo;s word who are creating. Here is the implication of the Divine Trinity&mdash;God, His Spirit, and His word. Revelation 19:13 says that Christ is called the Word of God.</p>
<p>The Divine Trinity being implied by God, His Spirit, and His word shows that the three of the Trinity are distinct but not separate. God&rsquo;s Spirit is God&rsquo;s breath (Job 33:4), and God&rsquo;s word is God&rsquo;s breathing (2 Tim. 3:16), which is by God&rsquo;s breath&mdash;Spirit. Job 33:4 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of God has made me, / And the breath of the Almighty has enlivened me.&rdquo; In this verse we can see that the Spirit of God is the breath of the Almighty. Second Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed.&rdquo; God, His Spirit, and His word are distinct, but they are inseparably related to one another. A man, his breath, and his speaking are three distinct things, but they cannot be separated from one another. It is impossible to speak if we do not breathe. Therefore, speaking is a kind of breathing. Thus, the implication of the Trinity in Genesis 1:1-3 with God, His Spirit, and His word establishes a basic principle concerning the Trinity&mdash;that the three are distinct but not separate.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;God Said, Let Us Make Man in Our Image, according to Our Likeness;...<br />
God Created Man in His Own Image;<br />
in the Image of God He Created Him;<br />
Male and Female He Created Them&rdquo;</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s aspect of being singular yet plural is also shown in Genesis 1:26-27, which says, &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness;...God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.&rdquo; Elohim referred to Himself in verse 26 using <em>Us</em> and <em>Our,</em> but Moses referred to Elohim in verse 27 using <em>His</em> and <em>He.</em> The pronouns <em>Us</em> and <em>Our</em> are plural, but <em>His</em> and <em>He</em> are singular. Again, this reveals that God is uni-plural, triune. Furthermore, the Trinity is clearly indicated here directly for the creation of man in God&rsquo;s image with the intention that man may express God by having God wrought into him. These points strongly confirm that the Trinity is for God to dispense Himself into us for our enjoyment and experience so that we may express Him.</p><h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Jehovah God Said, Behold, the Man Has Become like One of Us, Knowing Good and Evil;<br />
and Now, Lest He Put Forth His Hand<br />
and Take Also from the Tree of Life<br />
and Eat and Live Forever&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Genesis 3:22 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God said, Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat and live forever.&rdquo; In this verse Elohim again referred to Himself with the plural pronoun <em>Us.</em> This implication of the Trinity is in relation to man&rsquo;s eating of the tree of life&mdash;to take God in as man&rsquo;s life. This proves again that the Trinity is for man&rsquo;s enjoyment of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Jehovah Said, My Spirit<br />
Will Not Strive with Man Forever&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Genesis 6:3 says, &ldquo;Jehovah said, My Spirit will not strive with man forever.&rdquo; At Noah&rsquo;s time, because mankind became rotten, corrupted flesh, God had no way to go on with man. In a good sense, God gave up striving with man. However, Jehovah did not say, &ldquo;I will not strive with man,&rdquo; but, &ldquo;My Spirit will not strive with man.&rdquo; Here it is not merely Jehovah but the Spirit of Jehovah who would not strive with man. This refers to the Divine Trinity working on the fallen man. Again, we see that the Trinity is related to God&rsquo;s work on man so that man may enjoy Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Jehovah Said,...Let Us Go Down<br />
and There Confound Their Language,<br />
That They May Not Understand<br />
One Another&rsquo;s Speech. So Jehovah Scattered Them<br />
 from There over the Surface of All the Earth&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Genesis 11:6-8 says, &ldquo;Jehovah said,...Let Us go down and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another&rsquo;s speech. So Jehovah scattered them from there over the surface of all the earth.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s speaking to Himself with the pronoun <em>Us</em> in this passage was in relation to the confounding and scattering of mankind so that man might not be successful in frustrating God in the fulfillment of His purpose with man. This is also related to man&rsquo;s partaking of God. Even though this instance is on the negative side, it still implies that the Trinity is for God&rsquo;s dispensing into man so that man may enjoy Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Jehovah Appeared to Him [Abraham]<br />
by the Oaks of Mamre...and<br />
He Lifted Up His Eyes and Looked, and<br />
There Were Three Men Standing Opposite Him&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Genesis 18:1-2 says, &ldquo;Jehovah appeared to him [Abraham] by the oaks of Mamre...And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and there were three men standing opposite him.&rdquo; Verses 13, 14, and 22 clearly reveal that one of these three men was Jehovah and that the other two were angels (v. 22; 19:1). Jehovah appeared to Abraham before His incarnation (John 1:14) as a real man. Abraham washed His feet and served Him a meal, and He ate it. We may ask if the Son of God became a man two thousand years ago or four thousand years ago, when Abraham lived. With us there is the element of time, but with God there is no element of time. For instance, the Lord Jesus was crucified about two thousand years ago, but Revelation 13:8 says, &ldquo;The Lamb...was slain from the foundation of the world.&rdquo; In the eyes of God Christ was crucified when the world came into being. This is God&rsquo;s way of taking account of things.</p>
<p>Jehovah appeared to Abraham as a man in relation to the ancestry of Christ for fulfilling God&rsquo;s purpose to redeem man and work Himself into man (Gen. 19:36-37; Ruth 1:4; 4:13, 21-22; Matt. 1:5-16). The Lord appeared to Abraham in Genesis 18 directly for the purpose of rescuing Lot out of Sodom (chs. 18&mdash;19). After Lot was rescued, he produced two sons by improper means. One of Lot&rsquo;s sons was Moab, and Ruth was one of Moab&rsquo;s descendants. Ruth married Boaz, who was the grandfather of David, and David was a great grandfather of Christ. Thus, Christ came partly from the genealogy of Lot. The entire book of Genesis is a genealogy of Christ. The first few verses of Matthew 1 are an extract of Genesis. Genesis was written as a full record of Christ&rsquo;s generation. Thus, when the Lord came to rescue Lot in Genesis 18, He was taking care of one of His ancestors. Here we see the Trinity in relation to the generation of Christ, to bring God into humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;The Angel of Jehovah Said to Her [Hagar],<br />
I Will Greatly Multiply Your Seed&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Genesis 16:10 says, &ldquo;The Angel of Jehovah said to her [Hagar], I will greatly multiply your seed.&rdquo; Verses 7 and 9 also mention the Angel of Jehovah, and verses 11 and 13 show that the Angel of Jehovah turned out to be Jehovah Himself.</p><h2 class="head2">&ldquo;The Angel of God [Elohim] Called to Hagar<br />
out of Heaven and Said to Her...<br />
God Has Heard the Voice of the Boy<br />
Where He Is. Rise Up; Lift Up the Boy...<br />
for I Will Make of Him a Great Nation&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Genesis 21:17-18 says, &ldquo;The Angel of God [Elohim] called to Hagar out of heaven and said to her...God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. Rise up; lift up the boy...for I will make of him a great nation.&rdquo; The Angel of God, who is the Angel of Jehovah, turned out to be God, Elohim. This implies the Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;The Angel of Jehovah Called to Him<br />
from the Heavens and Said, Abraham...<br />
Now I Know That You Fear God [Elohim],<br />
Since You Have Not Withheld Your Son,<br />
Your Only Son, from Me&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Genesis 22:11-12 says, &ldquo;The Angel of Jehovah called to him from the heavens and said, Abraham...Now I know that you fear God [Elohim], since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.&rdquo; <em>Me</em> at the end of these verses refers to God, to whom Isaac was offered (vv. 1-2). God&rsquo;s reference to Himself not simply as Jehovah and God but also as the Angel of Jehovah and the Angel of God [Elohim] implies the Trinity. There was a need of the Trinity for God to work on man that man may participate in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;The Angel of God [Elohim] Said to Me<br />
in the Dream, Jacob...I Am the God [El] of Bethel&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Genesis 31:11-13 says, &ldquo;The Angel of God [Elohim] said to me in the dream, Jacob...I am the God [El] of Bethel.&rdquo; The Angel of God turned out to be <em>El,</em> which is another form of <em>Elohim.</em> The speaker in this verse being the Angel of God instead of simply God implies that God deals with man as the Trinity. We need to learn to understand the Trinity according to the revelation of the Bible. God&rsquo;s work on us that we may partake of Him is done through the Trinity. God&rsquo;s trinity is for His economy, the dispensing of Himself into man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;He [Israel] Blessed Joseph and Said,<br />
the God [Elohim] before Whom My Fathers Abraham and Isaac Walked,<br />
the God [Elohim] Who Has Shepherded Me<br />
All My Life to This Day,<br />
the Angel Who Has Redeemed Me<br />
from All Evil, Bless the Boys&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Genesis 48:15-16 says, &ldquo;He [Israel] blessed Joseph and said, / The God [Elohim] before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, / The God [Elohim] who has shepherded me all my life to this day, / The Angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys.&rdquo; <em>The Angel</em> in verse 16 is in apposition to <em>the God</em> in verse 15. Thus, the Angel is the very Elohim, the Triune God of the three generations&mdash;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The Trinity is implied here because this portion concerns God&rsquo;s shepherding of Jacob in order to preserve the race of Israel to bring forth Christ and work Himself into man and that man may participate in and enjoy God. The Trinity is always mentioned in relation to God&rsquo;s economy. God&rsquo;s being triune is for His economy. God&rsquo;s trinity is not a matter of His essence but of His economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Divine Trinity Being Indicated<br />
in Genesis 16&mdash;48<br />
in Relation to the Genealogy of Christ</h2>
<p>Genesis 16:10; 21:17-18; 22:11-12; 31:11-13; and 48:15-16 all indicate the Divine Trinity in relation, directly or indirectly, to the genealogy of Christ (Matt. 1:1-2). Hagar and her son Ishmael are indirectly related to Christ&rsquo;s genealogy. Abraham and Jacob are directly related to the genealogy of Christ, who came to redeem man so that God could work Himself into man. This is all for God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>By studying the Trinity in Genesis, we can conclude that God&rsquo;s trinity is for His economy, which is to dispense Himself into man so that man may enjoy Him and become His expression. In addition, according to the revelation in Genesis, there are two crucial points concerning the Trinity. First, the three of the Trinity are distinct but not separate. Second, in His essence God is one, but in His economy, His dispensing, God is three. God is essentially one and economically three.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED IN EXODUS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 3:2, 4, 6-7, 14-15</h1>
<p>In Genesis 48:15-16 Jacob said, &ldquo;The God who has shepherded me all my life to this day, / The Angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys.&rdquo; The revelation of the Trinity in Genesis ends with the Angel of God [Elohim] and the Angel of Jehovah (16:10; 21:17-18; 22:11-12; 31:11-13; 48:15-16). Exodus stresses two matters concerning the Trinity: the Angel of God, or the Angel of Jehovah, and the Spirit of God. An angel is one who is sent by God. The Spirit of God is the One who comes from God to reach man and, in a deeper sense, to enter into man. One who is sent to us may come to us but not enter into us, but the Spirit comes from God to reach us not only objectively but also subjectively by entering into us. In Exodus God is the Angel of God, who is sent to be with man, and the Spirit of God, who comes to reach man in a subjective way. In the New Testament the One sent by God to us was Jesus Christ, the second of the Trinity. In John the Lord often said that He was sent by the Father (e.g., 5:36; 6:57; 8:16; 12:49; 14:24). Then this sent One said that He would ask the Father to send another Comforter, the Spirit (14:16, 26; 15:26). These two, Christ and the Spirit, in the New Testament are the fulfillment of the Angel and the Spirit in Exodus. Christ, the second of the Trinity, came as the sent One to be with us, and the Spirit, the third of the Trinity, came to reach us and even enter into us. We need to enter into the deeper revelation of the Trinity.</p>
<p>Exodus 3:2 says, &ldquo;The Angel of Jehovah appeared to him [Moses].&rdquo; Verse 4 continues, &ldquo;When Jehovah saw that he had turned aside to look, God called to him.&rdquo; Verse 6 says, &ldquo;He said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&rdquo; <em>He</em> and <em>I</em> in verse 6 refer to <em>the Angel of Jehovah</em> in verse 2. The Angel of Jehovah is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. This threefold mentioning of God indicates the Trinity. Verse 7 says, &ldquo;Jehovah said, I have surely seen the affliction of My people.&rdquo; Here we see that the Angel of Jehovah is Jehovah Himself. Verses 14 through 15 say, &ldquo;God said to Moses, I AM WHO I AM. And He said, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you...Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob...This is My name forever, and this is My memorial from generation to generation.&rdquo; The Angel of Jehovah is Jehovah, God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and the I AM WHO I AM, the great I AM.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWO BASIC DIVINE TITLES IN HEBREW</h2>
<h2 class="head2"><em>Elohim</em></h2>
<p>In the Old Testament there are two basic divine titles in Hebrew, the first language used for the revelation of God&rsquo;s Scriptures. The first title, <em>Elohim,</em> indicates God. In the Scofield Reference Bible, Dr. Scofield says that <em>Elohim</em> (God) is &ldquo;formed from <em>El</em> = strength, or the strong one, and <em>Alah,</em> to swear, to bind oneself by an oath, so implying faithfulness.&rdquo; Hence, <em>Elohim</em> denotes God&rsquo;s attributes&mdash;His strength, power, and might with His faithfulness. In other words, Elohim is the mighty and faithful One.</p>
<h2 class="head2"><em>Jehovah</em></h2>
<p>The second basic divine title in Hebrew is <em>Jehovah.</em> According to Dr. Scofield, Jehovah is &ldquo;literally (as in Exo. 3:14), &lsquo;He that is who He is, therefore the eternal I AM.&rsquo; But <em>Havah,</em> from which Jehovah, or <em>Yahwe,</em> is formed, signifies also &lsquo;to become.&rsquo;&rdquo; Hence, <em>Jehovah</em> denotes God&rsquo;s existence. He is the self-existent and ever-existent One, the great I AM, the great TO BE, to be whatever we need. Whatever we need, He is.</p>
<p>Jesus, Jehovah our Savior, in the New Testament is this great I AM. <em>Jesus,</em> a name that comes from Greek, means &ldquo;Jehovah the Savior,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the salvation of Jehovah,&rdquo; in Hebrew. In John 8:24 the Lord said to the Jews, &ldquo;Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins.&rdquo; When the Lord said, &ldquo;Believe that I am,&rdquo; He meant, &ldquo;Believe that I am Jehovah your God.&rdquo; Verse 28 says, &ldquo;Jesus therefore said to them, When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am.&rdquo; Then in verse 58 the Lord said, &ldquo;Before Abraham came into being, I am.&rdquo; According to grammar, it seems that the Lord should have said, &ldquo;Before Abraham came into being, I was.&rdquo; But the Lord Jesus is Jehovah, the I AM.</p><h2 class="head3">The Divine Title <span class="normal">Jehovah</span><br />
Being Used in Relation to Man</h2>
<p>The divine title <em>Jehovah</em> is used in relation to man&rsquo;s creation (Gen. 2:7) and man&rsquo;s salvation (3:21).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Seven Compound Names of Jehovah<br />
Revealing Him as Meeting Every Need<br />
of His People</h2>
<p>Seven compound names of Jehovah reveal Him as meeting every need of His people. <em>Jehovah-jireh</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah will provide&rdquo; (22:13-14). This indicates that Jehovah is our Provider. <em>Jehovah-ropheka</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah your Healer&rdquo; (Exo. 15:26). <em>Jehovah-nissi</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah is my banner&rdquo; (17:8-15). A banner is a sign of triumph, victory. Because Jehovah is the Warrior fighting the battle for us and triumphing over all our enemies, He is our triumph, our victory. <em>Jehovah-shalom</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah is peace,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah of peace&rdquo; (Judg. 6:24). <em>Jehovah-ro&lsquo;i</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah is my Shepherd&rdquo; (Psa. 23). Jehovah shepherds us and takes care of us. <em>Jehovah-tsidqenu</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah our righteousness&rdquo; (Jer. 23:6). <em>Jehovah-shammah</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah Is There&rdquo; (Ezek. 48:35). This means that Jehovah is present for us to enjoy Him. Thus, Jehovah provides, heals, and triumphs over the enemies and shepherds us, He is our peace and our righteousness, and we enjoy Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ANGEL OF JEHOVAH BEING JEHOVAH HIMSELF,<br />
AND JEHOVAH BEING GOD, THE GOD OF ABRAHAM,<br />
THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB</h2>
<p>The Angel of Jehovah (Exo. 3:2) is Jehovah Himself (v. 4), and Jehovah is God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob (vv. 4, 6). That the Angel of Jehovah is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob implies that He is threefold, the Triune God. The God of Abraham refers to the Father, the God of Isaac refers to the Son, and the God of Jacob refers to the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord has burdened me and given me the grace to uncover many &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo; in the &ldquo;mine&rdquo; of the Scriptures showing that Christ is truly all-inclusive. As God&rsquo;s sent One, Jesus is the Angel of Jehovah, who is Jehovah and God. Furthermore, the Angel of Jehovah being the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob indicates that Jesus is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, the Spirit. Jesus Christ, the incarnated God, came not only to the New Testament saints but also to Abraham in the Old Testament. In Genesis 18 He came to Abraham in the form of man with a physical human body. Abraham washed His feet and fed Him with a meal, which He ate.</p>
<p>In Genesis 48:15-16 Jacob said at the end of his life, &ldquo;The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, / The God who has shepherded me all my life to this day, / The Angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys.&rdquo; The God before whom Abraham and Isaac walked and the God who shepherded Jacob all his life was the Angel who redeemed him from all evil. The following book, Exodus, reveals that this Angel is Jehovah, God, and the Triune God. This precious One is everything&mdash;He is our Provider, our Healer, our triumph, our peace, our Shepherd, our righteousness, and our enjoyment. This Old Testament revelation of the Lord&rsquo;s all-inclusiveness seems to belong to the New Testament. However, there are many riches in the Old Testament that cannot be found in the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY COMING<br />
AS THE SENT ONE TO SAVE GOD&rsquo;S PEOPLE<br />
INTO THE ENJOYMENT OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h2>
<p>The Angel of Jehovah being Jehovah and God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, implies the Divine Trinity for saving God&rsquo;s people into the enjoyment of the Divine Trinity. This point is based on Exodus 3, in which the Angel of Jehovah told Moses, &ldquo;I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey&rdquo; (v. 8).</p>
<p>The Divine Trinity came as the sent One (the Angel) to save God&rsquo;s people into the enjoyment of the Divine Trinity from their fallen state, their slavery in Egypt (vv. 8-10); to serve the Triune God (v. 12); to be God&rsquo;s firstborn son (4:22-23), implying the impartation of the divine life into God&rsquo;s redeemed people; and to hold a feast unto the Triune God (5:1), implying the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s redeemed people with the Triune God. God&rsquo;s redeemed people enjoyed the Triune God with the Triune God. To hold a feast unto the Triune God is to enjoy the Triune God as our feast, and we enjoy this feast with Him. This indicates again that the Trinity is for God&rsquo;s dispensing of Himself into His redeemed people for their enjoyment. The underlying thought in the Bible is that the Divine Trinity is not for doctrine or teachings but for the dispensing of God into us for our enjoyment. The Divine Trinity is for God&rsquo;s dispensing and our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TITLE <em>JEHOVAH</em> REFERRING TO<br />
THE FIRST AND THE SECOND OF THE TRINITY<br />
IN DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF THE SCRIPTURES, PROVING THAT THE THREE OF THE TRINITY ARE ONE</h2>
<p>The title <em>Jehovah</em> refers to the first and the second of the Trinity in different portions of the Scriptures, proving that the three of the Trinity are one. In the Old Testament the Angel of Jehovah, who was Jehovah Himself and was fulfilled in Jesus in the New Testament, refers to the second of the Trinity. However, in Revelation 1:4-5 the expression <em>Him who is and who was and who is coming,</em> which indicates Jehovah as the ever-existing I AM, refers to the first of the Trinity. This also shows that it is impossible to systematize the Trinity.</p>
<p>We have seen in the Old Testament that the Angel of Jehovah is Jehovah Himself and that Jehovah is Elohim [God], the threefold God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Abraham was the father, Isaac was the son, and Jacob, the naughty one, was under the transformation of the Spirit. Thus, the threefold God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is the Triune God. The Angel, Jehovah, God, and the Triune God are all one person.</p>
<p>The Triune God comprises God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. Some think that it is heretical to say that Christ is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. However, in Exodus 3 the Angel of Jehovah said to Moses, &ldquo;I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob...I AM WHO I AM&rdquo; (vv. 6, 14). Furthermore, as the sent One of God, the Angel of Jehovah is fulfilled in Jesus in the New Testament. Thus, Jesus Christ is Elohim with the divine attributes, full of strength and faithfulness, and He is also Jehovah, the self-existing and ever-existing One, the great I AM, the great TO BE. As the I AM, Christ is everything&mdash;He is the Angel of Jehovah, Elohim, God the Father, God the Son, God the Spirit, our Provider, our Healer, the Warrior who triumphs over all our enemies, our peace, our Shepherd, our righteousness, and the One who is present for our enjoyment. The Bible thus reveals that Christ is truly all-inclusive.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED IN EXODUS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 14:19-20, 24-25; 17:6; 23:20-23, 25; 25:31-37; 30:23-25; 31:3; 32:34; 33:2-3; 35:31; 40:34</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we love You, and we love Your word. How we thank You for Your speaking. Lord, we trust in You, Your grace, Your anointing, and every word that You would speak to us. Lord, cover us. We praise You for Your cleansing blood, which allows us to enjoy Your rich anointing.</p>
<p>In Exodus there are two main matters related to the Divine Trinity: the Angel of God and the Spirit of God. These two matters correspond with the New Testament revelation of the Trinity. The Lord Jesus is the New Testament fulfillment of the Angel of Jehovah as God&rsquo;s sent One, and the Spirit is also a major item in the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OLD TESTAMENT TYPES<br />
REVEALING THE TRINITY IN DETAIL</h2>
<p>The thought concerning the Divine Trinity in the Old Testament is exactly the same as the thought in the New Testament. However, the revelation of the Trinity is clearer in the New Testament but more detailed in the Old Testament. The New Testament revelation is clear because verses like Matthew 28:19 explicitly mention the three of the Trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Divine Trinity is also clearly revealed in 2 Corinthians 13:14, which says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; Revelation 1:4-5 says, &ldquo;Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth.&rdquo; These verses in Revelation 1 refer to the Father, the Spirit, and the Son, indicating the Divine Trinity. Several other New Testament passages reveal the Divine Trinity in a similar way.</p>
<p>Although the revelation of the Trinity in the Old Testament is not as clear as in the New Testament, the Old Testament conveys more details concerning the Trinity. When the children of Israel were thirsty in the wilderness, God told Moses to strike the rock in Horeb, and water came out of the smitten rock (Exo. 17:6). In 1 Corinthians 10:4 Paul says that the rock typifies Christ, the second of the Trinity, who was smitten by God to flow out living water (cf. John 19:34). In John 7:37-38 the Lord Jesus cried out, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; Verse 39 indicates that the living water is the Spirit. Therefore, the New Testament allows us to see that the Old Testament type of the smitten rock flowing out living water portrays the Triune God flowing out to dispense Himself into His thirsty people. These details concerning the Trinity are particularly revealed in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Another Old Testament type is the lampstand. The lampstand in Exodus 25:31-37 typifies Christ as the embodiment and expression of the Triune God (Matt. 4:16; John 1:4-9). According to Zechariah 4:10, the seven lamps of the lampstand signify the seven eyes of Jehovah. Revelation says that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God (4:5), which are the seven eyes of the Lamb (5:6). By these verses we can see that the lampstand is Christ shining with the Spirit as the lamps. The nature, or substance, of the lampstand is gold, which signifies God the Father in His divine nature. Thus, the lampstand reveals the Father as the substance, the nature; the Son as the embodiment, the form; and the Spirit as the shining, the expression.</p>
<p>The compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25, which signifies the all-inclusive Spirit in the New Testament, is another type full of details that can be found only in the Old Testament picture. We need much time, prayer, and appreciation to digest the details of the Divine Trinity as revealed in the Old Testament. The revelation concerning the Trinity is clear in the New Testament, but it is more detailed in the Old Testament. For this reason, we need to study the entire Bible concerning the Trinity.</p>
<p>We need a proper heart in order to thoroughly study the Trinity in the Bible. Since my youth I have had a heart for this. Anytime I heard others talking about the Trinity, I would leave whatever I was doing and go to listen. Whenever I learned of a book concerning the Triune God, I would buy it and read it.</p>
<p>The Divine Trinity is the structure of the entire Bible. Although steel may not be visible in a large building, the basic structure of the building is a steel frame. The rest of the building does not mean anything without the steel frame. Similarly, the framework of the entire divine revelation is the Divine Trinity.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE TYPE OF THE PILLAR OF CLOUD</h2>
<p>Exodus 14:19-20 says, &ldquo;The Angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them. And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. And the cloud was there with the darkness, yet it gave light by night to them. Thus one did not come near the other all night.&rdquo; Verses 24 through 25 say, &ldquo;At the morning watch Jehovah looked down upon the camp of the Egyptians from within the pillar of fire and of cloud and threw the camp of the Egyptians into confusion...So that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from Israel, for Jehovah is fighting for them against the Egyptians.&rdquo; In these verses we can see three key items concerning the Trinity: the Angel of God, the pillar of cloud, and Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Pillar of Cloud Signifying the Triune God<br />
Embodied in Christ and Realized as the Spirit</h2>
<p>It is not easy to understand what the pillar of cloud was. By day it appeared as a cloud, but in the night it appeared as a fire (13:21). Normally, it is impossible for clouds and fire to remain together. As I began to study the Word in the early years of my Christian life, I discovered that many such matters were not addressed adequately in Christian literature. For this reason, I am not content with the shallow, traditional teachings common among Christians today. We need a thorough study of the divine Word.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 10:2 Paul says, &ldquo;All were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.&rdquo; The New Testament believers are baptized into the death of Christ and into the Spirit (Rom. 6:4; 1 Cor. 12:13). Thus, in typology the Red Sea prefigures the death of Christ, and the cloud signifies the Spirit. The New Testament also says that the believers are baptized into name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19) and into the name of the Lord Jesus (Acts 8:16), which is to be baptized into Christ Himself (Rom. 6:3; Gal. 3:27). Thus, we are baptized into four items: the death of Christ, the Spirit, the Triune God, and Christ Himself. However, in the type of baptism there are only two items: the sea and the cloud. We have seen that the sea typifies the death of Christ, and the cloud typifies the Spirit. Thus, we may wonder what typifies Christ and the Triune God. Actually, Christ is the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17), and the Spirit is the consummate expression of the Triune God (John 7:39; Rev. 22:17). This means that to be baptized into the Spirit is to be baptized into Christ and into the Triune God. In the Gospels we are told to be baptized into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19), in Acts we are told to be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus (8:16), and in the Epistles we are told to be to be baptized into the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13). This also indicates that to be baptized into the Triune God is to be baptized into Christ and into the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Triune God is embodied in Christ (Col. 2:9), and Christ is realized as the Spirit (John 14:16-18; 2 Cor. 3:17). Christ embodies God, and we experience Christ as the Spirit. We come to the Triune God through Christ in the Spirit (Eph. 2:18), and the Triune God comes to us in Christ through the Spirit. Therefore, to be baptized into the Spirit is to be baptized into Christ, and to be baptized into Christ is to be baptized into the Triune God. It is one thing to be baptized into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the Spirit. The children of Israel were baptized in the water of the Red Sea, which typifies the death of Christ, and in the cloud, which typifies the Triune God embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit. The pillar of cloud is the Spirit as the realization of Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God. Today the Spirit dwells in us as the pillar of cloud. In the clear day He is the cloud, and in the dark night He is the fire.</p>
<p>The cloud in Exodus 14 is a wonderful type of the Triune God in Christ as the Spirit. This cloud was continually with the children of Israel from the Passover until they entered into the good land. When the tabernacle was erected, the cloud covered it, and the element of the cloud filled it as glory (40:34). The cloud and the fire were only the outward appearance; the inward element of the cloud was the divine nature of the Triune God. The cloud settled on the tabernacle, and when the cloud moved, the children of Israel journeyed with it. The cloud led the way, fought the battle for them, and abode with them. This is our Triune God. Because of religious concepts, it may be difficult for some to accept the thought that the cloud is the Triune God. However, this is what the Bible reveals. Our God, who is triune, is the pillar of cloud today to the church. This cloud abides with the church, leads the church on, opens the way and fights the battle for the church, and is the glory in the church. When we sense the Lord&rsquo;s glory in the church, what we sense is the element of the Triune God.</p>
<p>Such details concerning the Trinity are found only in the Old Testament pictures. The expression <em>pillar of cloud</em> is composed of plain words, but these words convey a picture, a sign, that allows us to see something. Pictures are used to teach children in elementary school. It is important that the children not only read and hear but also see what they are learning. The cloud in Exodus is such a picture; it is not an ordinary cloud. Similarly, when the Lord was baptized and came up out of the water, the Spirit descended upon Him like a dove (Matt. 3:16). Here the picture of the dove represents the Spirit well. By seeing the picture of the dove, we can understand more than many words could explain. The standing pillar of cloud in Exodus is a picture full of meaning concerning the Triune God. At the crucial time this pillar moved behind the camp of Israel and stood between them and the camp of the Egyptians as a pillar full of darkness on the side of the Egyptians and shining with light on the side of Israel. This cloud represents the Triune God in Christ as the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">The Angel of God, the Pillar of Cloud, and Jehovah, as the Divine Trinity,<br />
Protecting God&rsquo;s Redeemed People<br />
and Fighting Their Enemies for Them<br />
for the Purpose of Bringing the Redeemed<br />
into the Enjoyment of the Triune God</h2>
<p>The Angel of God, the pillar of cloud, and Jehovah, as the Divine Trinity, protected God&rsquo;s redeemed people and fought their enemies for them for the purpose of bringing the redeemed into the enjoyment of the Triune God. In Exodus 14 God appeared as the Angel of God, the pillar of cloud, and Jehovah. We may wonder why God did not do things as Himself directly but was &ldquo;complicated&rdquo; by doing things as the Angel of God and the pillar of cloud. According to verses 19 through 20, it was the pillar of cloud that protected Israel from Pharaoh and the Egyptian army. However, verses 24 and 25 say that it was Jehovah who fought from within the cloud (cf. Num. 14:14). Actually, it was the Triune God who fought. Although many such points concerning the Trinity are puzzling and even inexplicable, we know that the Trinity exists for the purpose of dispensing God into us.</p>
<p>One of the compound names of Jehovah in the Old Testament is <em>Jehovah-shammah,</em> which means &ldquo;Jehovah Is There,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah is present&rdquo; (Ezek. 48:35). The presence of God today is God Himself as Spirit. The Spirit is not something other than God. The presence of God as the Spirit is for dispensing. Thus, <em>Jehovah-shammah</em> is God Himself for dispensing. While the children of Israel were in the wilderness, the pillar of cloud and of fire was a sign that gave them peace by causing them to realize that God was with them. Moreover, they all knew when it was time to move, because they all could see when the cloud moved. This typifies the Triune God moving with them and dispensing Himself for their enjoyment.</p>
<p>According to Exodus 14:24 and Numbers 14:14, Jehovah was in the cloud and in the fire. Although normally nothing can exist within fire, our God was in the fire for the purpose of dispensing Himself to His people that they could partake of Him, participate in Him, and enjoy Him. The Angel of God, the pillar of cloud, and Jehovah, as the Divine Trinity, brought God&rsquo;s redeemed people first to feast with the Triune God, then into the tabernacle, and finally into the good land. The feast, the tabernacle, and the good land signify the Triune God for His people&rsquo;s enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE TYPE OF JEHOVAH<br />
AND THE ANGEL OF JEHOVAH BRINGING<br />
HIS REDEEMED PEOPLE INTO THE GOOD LAND<br />
AND CUTTING OFF THEIR ENEMIES</h2>
<p>Exodus 23:20-23 says, &ldquo;I am now sending an Angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. Be careful before Him, and listen to His voice; do not rebel against Him;...for My name is in Him. But if you will indeed listen to His voice and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries. For My Angel will go before you and bring you to the Amorites;...and I will cut them off.&rdquo; Verse 25 says, &ldquo;You shall serve Jehovah your God, and He will bless your bread and your water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as the Angel came in the name of Jehovah, the Lord Jesus as the sent One of God came in the name of the Father (John 5:43). Exodus 23:22 shows that the Angel&rsquo;s voice was Jehovah&rsquo;s speaking, proving that the Angel and Jehovah are one. The Angel&rsquo;s voice being Jehovah&rsquo;s speaking is similar to the Lord Jesus never speaking from Himself but only from the Father (John 8:28; 12:49). When others heard the Lord&rsquo;s voice, they received the words of the Father. For this reason, the Lord said in John 5:24, &ldquo;He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exodus 23:23 says that that the Angel of Jehovah will go before Israel, but verse 25 says that Jehovah will cut off their enemies. This also shows that the Angel and Jehovah are one. Exodus 32:34 says, &ldquo;Now go, lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you. Now My Angel will go before you.&rdquo; Exodus 33:2-3 says, &ldquo;I will send an Angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanites...Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey.&rdquo; In these verses also, the Angel of Jehovah and Jehovah are used interchangeably. The Angel of Jehovah, Jehovah as the Triune God (Elohim), brought His redeemed people into the good land and cut off their enemies so that the redeemed could enjoy the riches of the Triune God. This is the Trinity revealed in the second book of the Old Testament. This shows that we cannot systematize the truth in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE TYPE OF THE CLEFT ROCK</h2>
<p>In Exodus 17:6 Jehovah said to Moses, &ldquo;I will be standing before you there upon the rock in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it so that the people may drink.&rdquo; Moses represented the law. Jehovah as the smiting God, the rock as the crucified Christ, and water as the Spirit of life signify the Divine Trinity (1 Cor. 10:4). The water flowing out signifies the dispensing of God. This clearly reveals that the Divine Trinity is for God&rsquo;s flowing out into His people. By the authority of God, the Christ was smitten on the cross and the living water flowed out (John 19:34). This living water is the Spirit, who flows into our being. The rock being smitten typifies Christ being crucified so that the Triune God might gush out as the thirst-quenching Spirit into His redeemed people for their enjoyment and satisfaction (John 7:37-39; Rev. 22:1).</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE TYPE OF THE LAMPSTAND</h2>
<p>Exodus 25:31 says, &ldquo;You shall make a lampstand of pure gold. The lampstand with its base and its shaft shall be made of beaten work.&rdquo; Verse 37 says, &ldquo;You shall make its lamps, seven.&rdquo; The lampstand as God&rsquo;s embodiment (Christ the Son), gold as God&rsquo;s nature (the Father), and the seven lamps as God&rsquo;s expression (the sevenfold Spirit) signify the Divine Trinity and show that the Triune God is consummated as the sevenfold intensified Spirit to shine out the Triune God as light into us (Rev. 4:5; 5:6).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE TYPE OF THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</h2>
<p>Exodus 30:23-25 says, &ldquo;You also take the finest spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, two hundred fifty shekels, and of fragrant calamus two hundred fifty shekels, and of cassia five hundred shekels...and a hin of olive oil. And you shall make it a holy anointing oil, a fragrant ointment compounded.&rdquo; One hin signifies the unique God, and olive oil signifies the Spirit of God. The three units of five hundred shekels signify the Triune God; the split middle unit, comprising two units of two hundred fifty shekels each, signifies the crucified Christ as the second of the Divine Trinity. Four signifies the human nature of Christ. The spices signify Christ&rsquo;s death (myrrh), the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death (cinnamon), Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (calamus), and the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (cassia). All these ingredients and measurements are compounded into one ointment as the holy anointing oil, signifying the processed, all-inclusive compound Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God to anoint His redeemed people. The compound ointment was used to anoint the tabernacle, the altar, and the priests. Anointing is similar to painting. When paint is applied to an object, the paint becomes one with the painted object. We are &ldquo;painted&rdquo; with the Triune God and thereby become one with Him. The Triune God was processed to become the all-inclusive compound Spirit for the purpose that the Triune God in His ultimate expression may impart His divine element with all the processes He went through, including incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, into His redeemed people, making them one with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE SPIRIT OF GOD FILLING<br />
THE WORKERS OF THE TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>Exodus 31:3 says, &ldquo;I [Jehovah] have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom and with understanding and with knowledge and with all kinds of workmanship.&rdquo; Exodus 35:31 says, &ldquo;He [Jehovah] has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom.&rdquo; The design of the various parts of the tabernacle with all its furniture is marvelous. No human mind could produce such a design. The wisdom came from the Spirit, who is God Himself. For the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling, which is the church today, what is needed is not a momentary, sudden outpouring of the Spirit, as with speaking in tongues, but the inward filling of the Spirit. God filled the builders of the tabernacle with His Spirit not in power but in wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and workmanship. The Spirit of the Triune God (Elohim) filled the workers of the tabernacle for the building up of God&rsquo;s dwelling place on the earth so that the Triune God might be experienced and enjoyed by His redeemed people. The tabernacle was built so that God&rsquo;s redeemed people could enter into it to experience God and could stay there to enjoy God through the work of the filling Spirit, that is, of the Triune God.</p>
<p>In Exodus the Angel of Jehovah God as the second of the Trinity delivered God&rsquo;s people out of their bondage, brought them to the wilderness to feast with the Triune God, and brought them farther into the good land to enjoy the riches of the Divine Trinity. The Spirit of God as the third of the Divine Trinity and the ultimate expression of the Triune God, typified by the water flowing out of the cleft rock, the seven lamps of the lampstand, and the compound ointment, reached God&rsquo;s redeemed people to satisfy them, enlighten them, and anoint them with the element of the Triune God and all the &ldquo;ingredients&rdquo; of His processes for the building up of His habitation on the earth so that they might partake of Him, enjoy Him, and express Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 33:2-23; 34:5-10</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we take You as our sin offering and trespass offering. Thank You for cleansing us. We praise You for opening Your Word to us, and we ask You to continue to be with us.

<h2 class="head1">GOD DEALING WITH HIS PEOPLE<br />
AS THE DIVINE TRINITY<br />
TO KEEP THEM IN THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD</h2>
<p>In Exodus 33 and 34 God deals with His redeemed people in a special way after their great failure of making and worshipping the golden calf. This failure happened not at the beginning of their journey but in Exodus 32 after they had experienced and enjoyed many positive things given by the Lord, including the Passover, the pillar of cloud, the heavenly manna, and the living water from the cleft rock. The Passover lamb, which was for their initial salvation, typifies Christ. After they experienced Christ in type in their initial salvation, they began to follow Jehovah. In their journey they first passed through the Red Sea, which was a type of the death of Christ and dealt with their enemies. Afterward, on their journey through the wilderness they enjoyed the heavenly manna, which also typifies Christ, and the rock cleft to flow out the living water to quench their thirst, which typifies the crucified Christ flowing out the Spirit.</p>
<p>After the children of Israel had experienced and enjoyed all these wonderful things, they were brought to Mount Sinai as they followed the Lord in their journey. At Mount Sinai they saw something unprecedented in human history&mdash;God descended upon the mountain (19:18). They stood at the base of the mountain, and Moses, their representative, went up to the mount to stay with God. Although Mount Sinai is a negative type of the covenant of the law according to Galatians 4:24-25, Message 50 of <em>Life-study of Exodus</em> points out that Mount Sinai has a much more positive significance. Mount Sinai was not only where the Old Testament law was decreed; more importantly, the children of Israel were brought into the presence of God at Mount Sinai (Exo. 19:11) through sanctification (v. 10) and in resurrection (v. 11) to hear the speaking of God (v. 9). Furthermore, in fellowship with God they were brought into the knowledge of God to know the grace of God (v. 4) and the holiness of God (vv. 10-24) and to become God&rsquo;s personal possession, God&rsquo;s peculiar treasure (v. 5), a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation (v. 6). They stayed at Mount Sinai for a considerable length of time. Moses went up to the mountain for two periods of forty days each (24:18; 34:28), which is nearly three months. Additionally, there was the time required for the children of Israel to make all the furniture of the tabernacle and the tabernacle itself. God remained on the mount in the cloud, and manna descended every day to feed the people. What a wonderful scene this is!</p>
<p>In spite of all these experiences of God and of His gifts, the children of Israel made and worshipped the golden calf. They did this when they were still eating manna and in sight of the cloud on Mount Sinai. It is difficult to comprehend how it is possible that a people who had experienced and enjoyed God to such extent could make an idol to worship. They were not ignorant; their forefathers gave them much knowledge concerning God while they were there in Egypt. Nevertheless, they committed such a sin before God, even while they were enjoying His supply.</p>
<p>Moses, who was on the mount with God, surely did not expect this to happen, but God saw it and told Moses, &ldquo;Go, get down&rdquo; (32:7). Moses went down with the two tablets of the Testimony, which were inscribed by God. When Moses saw the calf and the dancing, he could not restrain himself and threw down the two tablets, shattering them. Moses could not tolerate such a terrible sin. He did not pray to God to seek His will about what to do but immediately told the sons of Levi, &ldquo;Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Let each man put his sword upon his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and each man kill his brother, and each man his companion, and each man his neighbor&rdquo; (v. 27). They slew three thousand that day. Actually, there was no need for Moses to pray, because he already knew what God wanted (v. 27a). He was a man who was in God&rsquo;s heart and knew God intimately. The next day Moses returned to the mountain to appease God. His heart was for Israel and even the more for God. God would not give up His rebellious people, yet there was the need of a mediator to reconcile them. Moses, who knew what was in God&rsquo;s heart, was such a mediator.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s answer to Moses&rsquo; petition for the children of Israel comprised two main aspects: God&rsquo;s mercy and God&rsquo;s government (34:6-7). God is merciful, yet He is altogether righteous and orderly. God&rsquo;s heart was not to give up the children of Israel but to keep and preserve them. In His mercy God wanted to forget about Israel&rsquo;s sins, but God&rsquo;s government would not allow Him to do this. According to His government, God should have destroyed the people, but His mercy would not allow Him to do this. To carry out what was in God&rsquo;s heart for His people, both God&rsquo;s mercy and God&rsquo;s government had to be satisfied. The only way God could deal with His people in a way that maintained both His mercy and His government was through the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>Human fathers know the difficulty of dealing with rebellious children. We love them, but we must discipline them. We have to play different roles as a loving father and a chastising father. It is no wonder that in order to describe the Trinity, early theologians chose the Latin word <em>personae,</em> which denotes the various masks of a stage actor.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s dealing with this situation presents a detailed picture concerning the Divine Trinity. As we have seen, the principle is that the New Testament contains clear words concerning the Divine Trinity, but the details are in the Old Testament. The most detailed pictures concerning the Divine Trinity are in Exodus. God&rsquo;s dealing with His redeemed people in Exodus 33 and 34 after they committed the gross sin of idolatry is a special part of this picture. Jehovah could deal with His rebellious people only through the Trinity as signified by the Angel, the pillar of cloud, the cleft of the rock, the hand of Jehovah, the presence of Jehovah, and Jehovah Himself. This dealing through the Divine Trinity was primarily to preserve God&rsquo;s redeemed people so that they could remain in the enjoyment of God. Message 179 of <em>Life-study of Exodus</em> emphasizes the enjoyment of the three feasts and the Sabbath rest. However, we also need to see that this enjoyment can be recovered and maintained only by God&rsquo;s dealing through the Trinity. Once God&rsquo;s people lost their enjoyment through the sin of idolatry, the only way for them to be brought back to the enjoyment of God was to be dealt with through the Divine Trinity. Thus, in Exodus 33 and 34 the Trinity is for dealing with God&rsquo;s redeemed people for the continuation of their enjoyment of the Triune God. In this we can again see that the purpose of the Divine Trinity is for God to dispense Himself into us so that we may enjoy Him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED IN EXODUS 33</h2>
<p>Exodus 33:2-5 says, &ldquo;I [Jehovah] will send an Angel before you...Jehovah had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, You are a stiff-necked people; if I were to go up in your midst for one moment, I would consume you.&rdquo; This is God&rsquo;s government. When Moses heard this, he must have been disappointed and wondered what he could do to save Israel from destruction. The Angel is Christ as God&rsquo;s sent One, the second of the Trinity. Without the Angel, God had no way to go on with His people. He could not go with them in a direct way but indirectly through His Angel. However, this Angel was God Himself. This implies the Trinity.</p>
<p>Verse 9 says, &ldquo;Whenever Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stay at the entrance of the tent, and Jehovah would speak with Moses.&rdquo; In the original Hebrew text it is not clear whether the one speaking with Moses was Jehovah or the pillar of cloud. This is similar to what is recorded in the Gospel of John. The Lord said, &ldquo;The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works&rdquo; (14:10b). The Lord also said, &ldquo;Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father&rdquo; (v. 9). It is difficult to say whether the Son and the Father were two or one. When the Son came, the Father was also there. Likewise, in Exodus when the pillar of the cloud was there, Jehovah was there as well. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?&rdquo; (John 14:10a). Similarly, Jehovah was in the pillar of cloud (Exo. 14:24; 34:5; Num. 14:14).</p>
<p>The pillar of cloud is the pneumatic Christ. The cloud in Exodus 19 becoming a pillar in Exodus 33 indicates that the cloud has more form, is more solid. The pneumatic Christ is Christ who has become the Spirit. The cloud is the Spirit, and the pillar of cloud signifies the pneumatic Christ. The presence of Jehovah is also the Spirit. The glory of Jehovah is Jehovah manifested, expressed.</p>
<p>Exodus 33:10-14 says, &ldquo;When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would rise up and worship...And Jehovah would speak to Moses face to face, just as a man speaks to his companion...And Moses said to Jehovah,...You have not let me know whom You will send with me...He said, My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest.&rdquo; Moses&rsquo; question was regarding a person, but the answer, Jehovah&rsquo;s presence, was seemingly not a person. In Exodus Jehovah&rsquo;s presence was the cloud, which signifies the Spirit. Today we have the presence of God as the Spirit. When we sense the Lord&rsquo;s presence, we are sensing the Spirit. After Jehovah said to Moses, &ldquo;My presence shall go with you,&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;And I will give you rest.&rdquo; The subject changed from Jehovah&rsquo;s presence to Jehovah Himself. This indicates the Trinity. The cloud signifies the Triune God remaining with His redeemed people for them to enjoy. The presence of a mother is dear and precious to her young children. This cloud is similarly the embracing and presence of the Triune God for the children of Israel to enjoy the Triune God. This is the Divine Trinity for the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>Verses 15 through 19a say, &ldquo;He [Moses] said to Him,...Is it not by Your going with us, so that we...are distinct from all the other people who are on the face of the earth?...And he said, Please show me Your glory. And He said, I will make all My goodness pass before you.&rdquo; Moses requested God&rsquo;s glory, but God answered with His goodness. God&rsquo;s glory is God Himself expressed. God&rsquo;s goodness is a general term that comprises all the divine virtues toward us, including mercy, kindness, compassion, grace, and reality. When God&rsquo;s glory is incarnated, it becomes God&rsquo;s goodness. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality.&rdquo; Grace and reality are aspects of God&rsquo;s goodness. Furthermore, the grace and reality in John 1 are very much related to God&rsquo;s glory. When God&rsquo;s glory comes in a hidden, covered way, it is God&rsquo;s goodness. God&rsquo;s goodness is all the good things of what God is. This implies God&rsquo;s glory incarnated.</p>
<p>Exodus 33:19b says, &ldquo;I [Jehovah] will proclaim the name of Jehovah before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.&rdquo; Grace and compassion are items of God&rsquo;s goodness. Jehovah does not say, &ldquo;I will proclaim My name,&rdquo; but &ldquo;I will proclaim the name of Jehovah,&rdquo; making it seem as though the name of Jehovah is another&rsquo;s name. This again indicates the Trinity.</p>
<p>Verse 20 says, &ldquo;He said, You cannot see My face, for no man shall see Me and live.&rdquo; John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; The thoughts in John 1 are all prefigured in Exodus.</p>
<p>Exodus 33:21-23 says, &ldquo;Jehovah said, Here, there is a place by Me, and you shall stand upon the rock; and while My glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with My hand until I have passed by. And I will take away My hand, and you will see My back; but My face shall not be seen.&rdquo; God told Moses first to stand on the rock and then to hide in the rock. The rock signifies Christ in His death as our standing and hiding. The hand of Jehovah signifies Christ as the covering of God&rsquo;s manifestation in His dealing with His people. The incarnated Christ was God manifested yet in a covered way. Christ&rsquo;s humanity was the &ldquo;hand&rdquo; to cover the manifested God. God manifested Himself to Moses, yet His manifestation, His glory, was covered by His hand, which signifies Christ in incarnation, God&rsquo;s glory manifested within human nature. Christ covers us and also covers the manifested glory of God. Because of our sinful situation, there is the need of a covering, which is the incarnated Christ.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s arm is for saving and delivering us, and His hand is for holding and keeping us (John 10:28-29). According to Exodus 33, God&rsquo;s hand is also for covering us. Isaiah 53:1-2 and John 12:37-38 reveal that the arm of Jehovah is Christ. Likewise, the hand of the Father in John 10 and the hand of Jehovah in Exodus 33 must also be Christ. Christ saves, holds, and covers us. The cleft of the rock is Christ in His death, who hides us but still allows us to see something of God. The details of the picture in Exodus 33 include the first of the Trinity as Jehovah, the second as His hand, and the third as His presence. In Revelation 5:6 we see that the seven eyes of Christ are the seven Spirits of God. This means that the third of the Trinity is the eyes of the second. In Isaiah 53 we are told that the second is the arm of the first. Moreover, Exodus 33 shows that the second is the hand of the first. This reveals something of the Trinity. Although this is not merely a doctrinal matter, we surely need to seek to understand such details in the Bible that are related to God&rsquo;s being in His dealing with His people.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED IN EXODUS 34</h2>
<p>Exodus 34:5-10 says, &ldquo;Jehovah descended in the cloud and took His place there with him [Moses] and proclaimed the name of Jehovah. Then Jehovah passed by before him and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah, God compassionate and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth, keeping lovingkindness with thousands of generations, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; but He will by no means clear the guilty, but visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the grandchildren, to the third and fourth generations. And Moses made haste and bowed to the ground and worshipped. And he said, If now I have found favor in Your sight, O Lord, let the Lord please go in our midst; although they are a stiff-necked people, pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for Your inheritance. And He said, Now I hereby make a covenant: Before all your people I will perform wonders such as have not been produced in all the earth, nor among any of the nations; and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of Jehovah, for it is an awesome thing that I will do with you.&rdquo; In this portion the Trinity is implied by the mention of Jehovah, God (<em>El</em>), and the Lord (<em>Adonai</em>).</p>
<p>Exodus 33 and 34 are in the section concerning the children of Israel&rsquo;s sin of the worshipping the golden calf, which occurred after they had experienced salvation by the Passover lamb and the enjoyment of the heavenly manna and the living water from the cleft rock. In this dealing, God proclaimed His name, Jehovah, in showing mercy according to His character and in His governmental dealing according to His standing. God&rsquo;s character is merciful, and His standing is governmental. He declared His name in these two things, which indicates that He has to take care of these two things for His name. If either of these two things were neglected, it would damage His name. Both His merciful character and His governmental standing were preserved in carrying out this dealing through His trinity. The Trinity is needed for carrying out God&rsquo;s dealing by taking care of His mercy and government. In dealing with His redeemed and rebellious people, God was nine items&mdash;the Angel, the pillar of cloud, the presence of Jehovah, the glory of Jehovah, the rock, the hand of Jehovah, Jehovah, God, and the Lord. These are all details of the Trinity.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s dealing with His redeemed people through the Trinity was for the purpose of keeping them in the enjoyment of His riches through His divine dispensing. Without the Angel of Jehovah, Jehovah had no way to go with them in their midst. For Jehovah to be with His people, there was the need of the Angel. Today without Christ, God has no way to be with us. Furthermore, the cloud and the pillar of cloud were necessary for God to come to His people and stay with them. Similarly, today the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, enables God to come to us and stay with us so that we may enjoy His presence. The crucified Christ as the cleft rock is our standing and hiding before the manifested God. <em>Hymns,</em> #298 says, &ldquo;On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand; / All other ground is sinking sand.&rdquo; <em>Hymns,</em> #206 says, &ldquo;I stand upon His merit; / I know no other stand.&rdquo; Because the crucified Christ, Christ in His death, is our standing and our hiding, we can communicate with and contact God. The merciful and governmental God and the rebellious, stiff-necked people can be brought together only through the Angel, the pillar of cloud, the cleft rock, and the hand of Jehovah, which typify Christ as God&rsquo;s sent One, the pneumatic Christ, Christ in His death, and Christ as the covering in God&rsquo;s manifestation. Because of the operation of the Trinity in this way, we now enjoy God&rsquo;s continual presence. Moreover, He manifests Himself to us, and we see Him in a hidden way. We have a standing and a hiding, a covering. This all-inclusive care of the Divine Trinity is for the purpose of His remaining with us to dispense Himself for our enjoyment.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED IN EXODUS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 40:2, 9, 34, 36-38</h1>
<p>At the end of Exodus we see a profound and wonderful picture of the Divine Trinity. Most readers of the Bible probably do not consider that there is a picture of the Trinity in this brief portion of the holy Word. We need to pray for the proper understanding in our apprehension of the following verses. Exodus 40:2 and 9 say, &ldquo;You shall raise up the tabernacle...And you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle.&rdquo; Verse 34 says, &ldquo;Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.&rdquo; Verses 36 through 38 say, &ldquo;Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel set out on all their journeys; but if the cloud was not taken up, they did not set out until the day that it was taken up. For the cloud of Jehovah was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel on all their journeys.&rdquo; The crucial figures in this picture that show us the Divine Trinity are the tabernacle, the anointing oil, the cloud, the glory, and the fire.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TABERNACLE COVERED BY THE CLOUD<br />
AND FILLED WITH GLORY<br />
TYPIFYING THE EMBODIED TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>In Exodus 40 we see the entire, completed tabernacle for the first time. Immediately after the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud descended to cover it, and the glory entered to fill it. For the tabernacle to become an entire, completed, living, and genuine tabernacle, it needed not only to be constructed and raised up but also to be covered by the cloud and filled by the glory. When the tabernacle was raised up, covered by the cloud, and filled with the glory, it became a full type of the Triune God. John 1:14a says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; Therefore, the type of the tabernacle was fulfilled in Christ, the second of the Trinity, God the Son incarnated. According to 1 Corinthians 10:1-2 and 12:13, the cloud that descended and covered the tabernacle is a type of the Holy Spirit, the third of the Trinity. That the descending cloud typifies the Spirit is also confirmed by John 1:32, which says, &ldquo;John testified, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him.&rdquo; John saw the Spirit descending upon Christ, who was identified as the fulfillment of the tabernacle in verse 14 of the same chapter. Furthermore, verse 14b says, &ldquo;We beheld His glory.&rdquo; This glory corresponds to the glory that filled the tabernacle. Thus, the picture of the tabernacle covered by the descending cloud and filled with the glory of Jehovah in Exodus 40 was fulfilled in Christ in John 1.</p>
<p>Because the tabernacle is a type of Christ, the cloud represents the Spirit, and glory is God Himself expressed, the picture of the tabernacle covered by the cloud and filled with glory embodies the entire Triune God in figure. The day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud descended and covered it, and the glory entered and filled it was a great day in history. Never before had the Triune God been embodied on the earth. As human beings created by God, what more could we want? The tabernacle covered by the cloud and filled with glory was a great blessing to the children of Israel, but today we have the reality of what they had only in figure.</p>
<p>In order to understand what is recorded and revealed in John 1, we must compare it with the picture in Exodus 40. If we consider these two chapters together, we will see the light. The embodiment of the Triune God was God&rsquo;s goal throughout Genesis and Exodus. It took more than twenty-five hundred years from the creation of man to reach the goal of raising up the tabernacle. In Genesis 1:26 God said, &ldquo;Let Us make man in Our image.&rdquo; Thus, the Triune God conferred with Himself to produce an expression of Himself in man. However, God did not reach this goal with Adam or any of the forefathers in Genesis. Therefore, God went on in Exodus to deliver His chosen people out of their fallen state and bring them to Mount Sinai, where the tabernacle was produced as the first fulfillment of the desire God expressed in creating man.</p>
<p>Such a profound revelation requires that we be built up in the understanding of the spiritual things and in the apprehension of the inner revelation of the holy Word. We thank the Lord that He has shown this to us. It is easy to see the positive examples of Enosh calling on the name of the Lord, Enoch walking with God, Noah working together with God, Abraham being called and following God, and Joseph living a holy and victorious life. However, it is not so easy to see the significance of the tabernacle in Exodus 40. We need to see that at the end of Genesis God had not reached His goal. Joseph was dead and in a coffin in Egypt. There was no remaining expression of God. Joseph was humanly good, but the tabernacle is divinely wonderful.</p>
<p>There is no record in the Bible of how the children of Israel reacted when the tabernacle was erected, the cloud descended, and the glory entered, but I believe that many were beside themselves with joy. Today we have something much more profound. If we are not beside ourselves, this indicates that we have not seen the revelation. When we read John 1, we need to see that Christ as the fulfillment of the tabernacle is with us today, the covering Spirit is upon this tabernacle, and the glory is filling this tabernacle. This revelation of the Triune God is not mere doctrine. We are seeing a vision of the living Trinity. For years people had told me that when traveling by road between San Francisco and Los Angeles, I should take the Pacific Coast Highway to see the view along the coast. When I finally took this route several years ago, I could not believe the beauty of the scenery. The descriptions that I had heard did not compare to the actual view. I even stopped at several points and got out of the car to better appreciate the scenery. Similarly, we need not only to hear others describe what they have seen of the tabernacle but also to see for ourselves Christ as the tabernacle covered by the Holy Spirit and filled with the glory of God. As long as we see this scene, we will be joyful, regardless of whether others who do not see criticize us. Some are self-righteously content with their traditional concepts and inherited doctrines concerning the Trinity, but we want to see the revelation in the holy Word.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ANOINTING OIL TYPIFYING<br />
GOD THE SPIRIT COMPOUNDED WITH<br />
THE TRIUNE GOD, CHRIST&rsquo;S HUMANITY,<br />
CHRIST&rsquo;S DEATH WITH ITS EFFECTIVENESS, AND CHRIST&rsquo;S RESURRECTION WITH ITS POWER</h2>
<p>The anointing oil used to anoint the tabernacle in Exodus 40:9 typifies God the Spirit compounded with the Triune God, Christ&rsquo;s humanity, Christ&rsquo;s death with its effectiveness, and Christ&rsquo;s resurrection with its power. This anointing oil is the compound ointment described in Exodus 30:23-25: &ldquo;Take the finest spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, two hundred fifty shekels, and of fragrant calamus two hundred fifty shekels, and of cassia five hundred shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and a hin of olive oil. And you shall make it a holy anointing oil, a fragrant ointment compounded according to the work of a compounder; it shall be a holy anointing oil.&rdquo; The olive oil signifies the Spirit of God. The three units of five hundred shekels each, the measure of the spices, signify the Trinity, the three of the Godhead. The middle unit of five hundred shekels was split into two halves of two hundred fifty shekels each, signifying the second of the Trinity, who was &ldquo;split&rdquo; in crucifixion as the cleft rock (John 19:34; Exo. 17:6). The one hin of olive oil signifies the unique God, and the four spices signify Christ&rsquo;s humanity, since the number four denotes God&rsquo;s creatures (Ezek. 1:5), of which man is the head (Gen. 1:26). Myrrh, a spice used in burial, typifies Christ&rsquo;s death, and cinnamon typifies the sweetness and effectiveness of His death. Calamus, a reed growing in marshy ground, typifies the resurrection of Christ, and cassia, used to repel insects and snakes, typifies the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. The anointing oil was used to anoint every part of the tabernacle (Exo. 30:26-30; 40:9-11, 13). In other words, the entire tabernacle within and without was painted with this oil. The anointing oil corresponds to the Spirit after Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, the Spirit in the Epistles. John 7:39 says, &ldquo;The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; After Christ&rsquo;s resurrection the Spirit was compounded to include the Triune God, Christ&rsquo;s humanity, Christ&rsquo;s death with its effectiveness, and Christ&rsquo;s resurrection with its power.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CLOUD SIGNIFYING THE SPIRIT IN THE DAY<br />
AND THE FIRE SIGNIFYING THE SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>The cloud that was upon the tabernacle by day is the Spirit, and the fire that was in it by night is also the Spirit. As the anointing oil, the Spirit first anoints us, and then as the pillar of cloud and fire, He leads and guides us. Romans 8:14 says, &ldquo;As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&rdquo; The cloud in the day and the fire in the night refer to the same guiding Spirit. God ordained that there would be day and night (Gen. 1:5). In the night we need the Spirit as the enlightening fire, and in the day we need the Spirit as the guiding cloud.</p>
<p>The children of Israel, numbering about two million, journeyed with the tabernacle. The children of Israel moved the tabernacle whenever the cloud was taken up. As the tabernacle was carried along, the cloud was always above it. The cloud and the fire never left the tabernacle, because even in type there can be no separation between the Spirit and Christ; They are always together. Strictly speaking, the journey of the children of Israel was actually not their journey but the journey of the tabernacle. When the cloud moved, they moved with the tabernacle, and when the cloud remained, they remained. The children of Israel journeying according to the move of the cloud was for the move of the tabernacle, which typifies Christ. Today the Spirit&rsquo;s guiding and enlightening is for the Lord&rsquo;s move. For instance, we may desire to be married, but the goal and purpose of our &ldquo;journey&rdquo; should be not marriage but Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GLORY BEING GOD HIMSELF</h2>
<p>The glory mentioned in Exodus 40:34 is God Himself. The Bible does not record anything about the physical appearance of this glory; it only says, &ldquo;The glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.&rdquo; It is only by experience that we can apprehend what the glory of God is today. Most days we do not experience much glory, but sometimes in our Christian experience we sense that we are filled with glory. When this is our experience, it is difficult to describe. How wonderful it would be if we were filled with glory all the time! When we show a fallen countenance to our spouse, we are certainly not filled with glory. However, we cannot be glorious simply by being cheerful toward our spouse. We should not try to be glorious. If we exercise to enjoy the Lord in every situation, we will be filled with glory.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD BEING EMBODIED<br />
IN CHRIST AS THE TABERNACLE<br />
FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISPENSING HIMSELF<br />
INTO HIS REDEEMED PEOPLE FOR THEIR ENJOYMENT OF ALL THE RICHES OF HIS BEING</h2>
<p>The Triune God was embodied in Christ as the tabernacle for the purpose of dispensing Himself into His redeemed people for their enjoyment of all the riches of His being. The tabernacle and the offerings, which also typify Christ, show that the Triune God mingles Himself with His people to dispense all the riches of His being into them for their enjoyment and their portion as their eternal inheritance so that they might become His enjoyment and His portion as His inheritance for eternity. Ephesians 1:11a says, &ldquo;In whom also we were designated as an inheritance.&rdquo; The footnote for the phrase <em>designated as an inheritance</em> says, &ldquo;On the one hand, we have become God&rsquo;s inheritance (v. 18) for God&rsquo;s enjoyment; on the other hand, we inherit God as our inheritance (v. 14) for our enjoyment.&rdquo; Verse 18b mentions &ldquo;the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints.&rdquo; The footnote for the word <em>inheritance</em> says, &ldquo;First, God made us His inheritance (v. 11a) as His acquired possession (v. 14b) and caused us to participate in all that He is, all that He has, and all that He has accomplished, as our inheritance (v. 14a). Ultimately, all these will become His inheritance in the saints for eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In type, the children of Israel enjoyed and possessed the Triune God in the divine mingling and dispensing, and the Triune God enjoyed and possessed them. The proper living, work, and move of God&rsquo;s redeemed people in the Old Testament were altogether according to this mingling and dispensing. The New Testament reveals the full reality of the divine dispensing and mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed ones. This revelation is especially clear in the Gospel of John, Revelation, Ephesians, and Paul&rsquo;s other Epistles. Although the two Epistles to the Corinthians present a somewhat negative picture of the church&rsquo;s condition, the revelation in these two books concerning the Divine Trinity is profound. In 2 Corinthians 13:14 Paul writes, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matthew also has a profound word concerning the Trinity. Matthew 28:19 is a unique word in the Bible. It says, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Although it seems that this verse lists three names, the noun <em>name</em> in this verse is singular in number, indicating that there is one name for the Divine Trinity. In a footnote on this verse, Dr. Scofield says, &ldquo;Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is the final name of the one true God.&rdquo; According to the revelation in the New Testament, it is clear that God is eternally triune, but this was not made entirely clear in the Old Testament times. Perhaps this is because the Triune God had not yet been processed. The Son had not passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, and the Spirit was not yet consummated (John 7:39). After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, He spoke a clear word to the disciples concerning the Trinity in Matthew 28:19.</p>
<p>Ephesians is composed with the Divine Trinity as its basic element and structure. Every chapter of Ephesians reveals the Triune God. Thus, Ephesians is a clear explanation and definition of the tabernacle in Exodus 40. The tabernacle typifies Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God for God&rsquo;s redeemed people to enter and enjoy all the inward contents. Furthermore, the Triune God entered into His people in type through the offerings, which typify Christ. Before the tabernacle was the altar with all the offerings. No one could enter the tabernacle without first passing through the altar by partaking of the offerings there. This signifies that Christ first enters into us as the offerings, and our enjoyment of Christ as the offerings ushers us into Christ as the tabernacle for us to fully enjoy the Triune God. Through this picture we see the Triune God&rsquo;s mingling with and dispensing of Himself into His redeemed for their enjoyment and their portion as their inheritance, which causes them to became God&rsquo;s enjoyment and portion as His inheritance for eternity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE TRINITY<br />
AS REVEALED IN LEVITICUS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Lev. 1:3, 8-9; 2:1-2; 3:1-3, 11; 7:11-12; 4:3-6; 5:6-7</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the Divine Trinity as revealed in the types of the five basic offerings in the first part of Leviticus. Although I began to study Leviticus decades ago, I did not realize until recently how much of the Divine Trinity is revealed and applied to us in the types of the offerings. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we are receiving much revelation in this study of the Divine Trinity in the holy Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE TYPE OF THE BURNT OFFERING</h2>
<p>Leviticus 1:3 says, &ldquo;If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd...he shall present it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, that he may be accepted before Jehovah.&rdquo; Verses 8 through 9 say, &ldquo;Aaron&rsquo;s sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, the head, and the fat in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar; but its inward parts and its legs he shall wash with water. Then the priest shall burn the whole on the altar, as a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.&rdquo; The crucial items revealing the Divine Trinity in these verses are the burnt offering, the Tent of Meeting, Jehovah, the priest, the fire, and the water. We need to know the interpretation of these items in order to understand the type of the burnt offering.</p>
<p>In Numbers 28:2 Jehovah said, &ldquo;My offering, My food for My offerings by fire of a satisfying fragrance to Me.&rdquo; Thus, the burnt offering typifies Christ the Son as the food for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. It is difficult to understand how Christ could be God&rsquo;s food, since Christ as the Son is part of the Triune God. However, this revelation is not according to the traditional, doctrinal teachings concerning the Trinity. We need to study the entire Bible to discover all the verses concerning the Trinity, but if we try to systematize the Trinity, we will become spiritually dead. The healthiest persons are not those who know the most but those who breathe, eat, sleep, and exercise properly. In our knowledge of the Trinity, we need to be simple and brief. We even need to learn to sometimes say, &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo; Then we will be at peace. Martin Luther said that anyone who claims to understand the Trinity is a teacher of God. No one can fully understand the Trinity. Every illustration used to describe the Trinity falls short in certain aspects and may even be misleading. We must beware of heresies such as modalism, which denies that the three of the Trinity coexist and coinhere, and tritheism, which denies the oneness of God. In order to properly understand the Divine Trinity, we must see that God is one and yet also three who eternally coexist and coinhere. We cannot adequately illustrate or explain the Trinity, because the Trinity is beyond our comprehension. Most people have some knowledge about the Trinity, but we need to leave our knowledge aside and keep a clear mind as we consider the revelation of the Trinity in the holy Word.</p>
<p>The Tent of Meeting in Leviticus 1:3 typifies Christ the Son as the place of offering. The offerings were offered at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. In order for an offering to be legitimate, it could not be offered anywhere else. Similarly, in order to offer anything to God, we must take Christ as the ground for our offering. If we do this, God will accept our offering. In Deuteronomy 12:5-14 God charged the Israelites not to offer anything outside of this place. If anyone offered something to God apart from this place, it was a great sin. To offer something to God in the wrong way is a sin. Cain&rsquo;s offering was rejected because he offered something to God without taking Christ as the base for his offering (Gen. 4:3, 5).</p>
<p>We have seen that Jesus is Jehovah in the New Testament, because the name <em>Jesus</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah the Savior.&rdquo; However, we have also seen that in Exodus 3:6, as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Jehovah is the Triune God. Here in Leviticus 1, because Christ the Son is offered to Jehovah, Jehovah refers to the Father as the Receiver of the offering. This shows that the Divine Trinity cannot be systematized according to the doctrines of traditional theology.</p>
<p>In verses 8 and 9 the priest typifies Christ the Son as the serving One. The priest served the offering. In Hebrews Paul writes that Christ is our great High Priest (4:14-15; 5:5) and a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedek (v. 6; 7:17). Thus, as typified by the burnt offering, the Tent of Meeting, and the priest, Christ the Son is simultaneously the offering, the place of the offering, and the One who serves the offering. Logically speaking, this is incomprehensible. It is as if a restaurant, the food, and the waiter were all one. This shows that traditional teachings concerning the Trinity are inadequate and that the Trinity cannot be fully understood according to the human mentality.</p>
<p>The fire in Leviticus 1:8-9 signifies God as the accepting agent. Fire consumes and devours. We accept food by our mouth. Similarly, God accepted the offering by burning it. Therefore, strictly speaking, the fire was Jehovah&rsquo;s mouth. However, we do not say, &ldquo;My mouth eats.&rdquo; Instead, we say, &ldquo;I eat.&rdquo; Thus, in the matter of eating, our mouth is our person. Accordingly, the fire that burned the burnt offering was God Himself. Hebrews 12:29 says, &ldquo;Our God is also a consuming fire.&rdquo; The divine fire may function for judging or for accepting. The fire that consumed the burnt offering was not for judgment but for acceptance by God. The burning of the burnt offering was the divine eating.</p>
<p>The water that washed the inward parts and legs of the burnt offering signifies the Spirit as the washing agent. This does not imply that Christ is unclean; rather, it indicates that Christ&rsquo;s inward parts and His daily walk were continually being washed by the Holy Spirit, signified by the water (John 7:38-39), to keep Him from becoming defiled by His contact with earthly things.</p>
<p>We have seen that the burnt offering signifies Christ as food to satisfy God. We have also seen that the entire Trinity is involved in the burnt offering. God the Father is the Receiver; God the Son is the offering, the place of the offering, and the serving One; and God the Spirit is the washing One. The accepting fire refers to the entire Godhead. Some may think that it is wrong to consider the Son as part of the fire, since the Son as the offering is burned by the fire. Especially when studying the Old Testament types, traditional, systematic teachings concerning the Trinity are altogether inadequate. Systematic teachings concerning the Trinity open the door for endless debate, because the Trinity is a mystery that we cannot completely understand.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE TYPE OF THE MEAL OFFERING</h2>
<p>Leviticus 2:1-2 says, &ldquo;When anyone presents an offering of a meal offering to Jehovah, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it and put frankincense on it. Then he shall bring it to Aaron&rsquo;s sons the priests, and he shall take from it his handful of its fine flour and of its oil with all its frankincense. And the priest shall burn it as its memorial portion on the altar, an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.&rdquo; The items that indicate the Trinity in these verses are the meal offering, Jehovah, the oil, the priest, and the fire. The Trinity is involved with the meal offering in a very subjective way.</p>
<p>The meal offering typifies Christ the Son as the food to satisfy God and man. The meal offering was served mainly as the priests&rsquo; food, but a part of the meal offering was also burned on the altar as an offering by fire for food to God. Thus, the meal offering was food for both God and man. The meal offering typifies Christ mainly in His humanity, because the main ingredient of the meal offering was fine flour, which signifies Christ&rsquo;s humanity. Christ as a man with all His perfect and complete virtues is food to God and to those who serve God.</p>
<p>The oil typifies the Spirit, the divine element of Christ as the offering. Christ as a man was full of the Spirit. The oil was added to the meal offering in at least three ways. Verse 1 says that the oil was to be poured on the meal offering. Verse 4 says that the oil was to be mingled with the cakes of the meal offering, and verse 5 says that the oil was to be mingled with the fine flour of the meal offering. When the oil was poured, it covered the outside of the offering; and when the oil was mingled with the offering, the oil came into and saturated the offering. This shows that the Spirit was poured upon Christ, and the Spirit was mingled with Him and saturated His human element. Christ as a man was thoroughly mingled with and saturated by the Spirit. When Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit, Christ&rsquo;s human element was mingled with the divine element of the Spirit (Matt. 1:18). The Spirit was poured upon Christ later, when He began to minister at the age of thirty (3:16). At that time, the Spirit anointed Him (Luke 4:18).</p>
<p>As in the type of the burnt offering, in the type of the meal offering Jehovah is God the Father as the Receiver of the offering, the priest typifies Christ the Son, the serving One, and the fire typifies God as the accepting agent. The fire and water are agents because they act upon the offering but are not part of the offering. The oil is an element because it is a basic constituent of the offering.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE TYPE OF THE PEACE OFFERING</h2>
<p>Leviticus 3:1-3 says, &ldquo;If his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings...he shall present it without blemish before Jehovah...Aaron&rsquo;s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood on and around the altar. And from the sacrifice of peace offerings he shall present an offering by fire to Jehovah.&rdquo; Verse 11 says, &ldquo;It is the food of the offering by fire to Jehovah.&rdquo; Leviticus 7:11-12 says, &ldquo;This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings that one shall present to Jehovah: If he presents it for a thanksgiving, then he shall present with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil and unleavened wafers anointed with oil and saturated cakes of fine flour mingled with oil.&rdquo; The crucial items indicating the Trinity in these verses are the peace offering, Jehovah, the priest, the fire, the sacrifice of thanksgiving, the unleavened cakes, the oil, the unleavened wafers, and the saturated cakes of fine flour mingled with oil.</p>
<p>The peace offering typifies Christ the Son as the peace between God and man. In order for someone to become the peace of two parties who are at enmity, much is required. Christ became the peace between God and man by being many things and by accomplishing many things. As in the types of the other offerings, Jehovah is God the Father as the Receiver of the offering, the priest typifies Christ the Son, the serving One, and the fire typifies God as the accepting agent.</p>
<p>The sacrifice of thanksgiving signifies Christ the Son for the offerer&rsquo;s thanks to God. In addition to the ordinary, general peace offering mentioned in Leviticus 3, a particular kind of peace offering, one for thanksgiving, is described in Leviticus 7. When the children of Israel wanted to make an offering to God because they had a thanking heart, they made an offering of thanksgiving that was part of a peace offering. The general peace offering was only an animal from the herd (3:1) or from the flock (v. 6), but the peace offering for thanksgiving was accompanied by a meal offering.</p>
<p>Three kinds of meal offerings accompanied the peace offering as a sacrifice of thanksgiving: unleavened cakes, unleavened wafers, and saturated cakes of fine flour mingled with oil. The unleavened cakes typify Christ the Son as the pure and clean food. Christ&rsquo;s humanity is without sin, wrongdoings, faults, or defects and is perfect and pure. Cakes may be thick, but wafers are thin and easy to eat and digest. Therefore, the unleavened wafers typify Christ the Son as the pure and clean food that is easy to eat and digest. Certain experiences of Christ are difficult, but more often Christ is easy to eat and digest. In our experience Christ is both a cake and a wafer. Because the oil again signifies the Spirit as the divine element of the meal offering, the saturated cakes of fine flour mingled with oil typify Christ the Son as food saturated and mingled with the element of the Spirit. The cakes were saturated with the oil, and the fine flour was mingled with the oil. As we have seen, this denotes Christ&rsquo;s divine conception by the Holy Spirit, in which divinity mingled with His humanity and saturated His being.</p>
<p>Christ as the peace offering is for Christ to be the co-enjoyment of God and man in peace for fellowship. The peace offering is not only for peace but also for enjoyment. This is not individualistic enjoyment but co-enjoyment and fellowship. Christ is able to be such an offering for our peace, co-enjoyment, and fellowship through the involvement of the Divine Trinity.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE TYPES OF THE SIN OFFERING<br />
AND TRESPASS OFFERING</h2>
<p>Leviticus 4:3-6 says, &ldquo;Let him present a bull of the herd without blemish to Jehovah for a sin offering...He shall bring the bull to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting before Jehovah...The anointed priest shall take some of the blood of the bull and bring it into the Tent of Meeting, and the priest shall...sprinkle some of the blood seven times before Jehovah.&rdquo; Leviticus 5:6-7 says, &ldquo;He shall bring his trespass offering to Jehovah for his sin which he has committed...as a sin offering; and the priest shall make expiation for him on account of his sin. And if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring as his trespass offering...two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.&rdquo; The crucial items indicating the Trinity in these verses are Jehovah, the sin offering, the Tent of Meeting, the priest, and the trespass offering, which includes the sin offering and the burnt offering.</p>
<p>As in the types of the other offerings, Jehovah is God the Father as the Receiver of the offerings, the Tent of Meeting typifies Christ the Son as the place of offering, the priest typifies Christ the Son as the serving One, and the fire typifies God as the accepting agent. The sin offering represents Christ the Son as an offering for our sin. Sin refers to the indwelling sinful nature that we inherit by birth. The trespass offering represents Christ the Son as an offering for our sins. Sins refer to the sinful deeds that we commit. Our sinful nature is the source of our sins. Christ is the sin offering and the trespass offering to redeem us from our sin and sins. Christ deals with the sin in our nature and the sins that we commit.</p>
<p>According to verse 7, the trespass offering could be composed of two turtledoves or two young pigeons&mdash;one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. In this case, the sin offering signifies Christ the Son as an offering for our sin to deal with the source of our sins, and the burnt offering signifies Christ the Son as the offering for God&rsquo;s satisfaction to deal with the cause of our sins. After committing a sin, we may repent, confess, and take Christ as our trespass offering. However, we also need to realize that our sins come out of the indwelling sin in our nature. The source of every trespass is the inward sin in our flesh. Thus, in addition to taking Christ as our trespass offering for our sinful deeds, we also need to take Christ as our sin offering for the sinful nature that produces those sins. Furthermore, the reason for our trespasses is our not living absolutely for God. Therefore, we also need a burnt offering to deal with the cause of our sins. Christ as the sin offering deals with the source of our trespasses, and Christ as the burnt offering deals with the cause of our trespasses.</p>
<p>We need to practice daily to take the Lord as our sin offering and trespass offering. We tend to apply the Lord more often as our trespass offering because we are aware of our many trespasses, yet we also need to realize that the source of all our trespasses is our sinful nature, and the cause of our trespasses is that we are not absolute for God. When we apply Christ as our trespass offering, we may pray, &ldquo;Lord, I trespassed again. I trespass again and again because I am inwardly sinful and because I do not love You enough and am not absolutely for You.&rdquo; We may not use the terms <em>trespass offering, sin offering,</em> and <em>burnt offering</em> in our prayer, but such a confession implies that we have the proper realization of our situation and that Christ as the reality of the offerings is the solution to our problems of sin and sins.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>In the five basic offerings in Leviticus 1&mdash;7 we see that the Triune God is the working One as the accepting Father, the serving Son, and the mingling Spirit. The Triune God is also the elements of the offerings, such as the oil, which is an element of the meal offering. The Triune God is also the functioning agents, which are the washing water and the burning fire. The five offerings as a whole depict how the Triune God as the working One, the elements of the offerings, and the functioning agents redeems and brings His chosen people into the full enjoyment of the divine riches of the Divine Trinity. The picture of these types reveals that the operation of the Triune God is not only to redeem us but also to bring us into the enjoyment of the riches of the Trinity. The offerings are for God&rsquo;s enjoyment and our enjoyment as well. The operation of the Triune God as typified by the offerings produces peace. Peace is for fellowship, and fellowship is for co-enjoyment.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE TRINITY<br />
AS REVEALED IN LEVITICUS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Lev. 8:2, 12, 14, 18, 26, 30-31; 9:23-24; 14:4-5, 10, 12, 17-19; 24:2-4</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we need Your blood to cleanse us, and we need Your Spirit to anoint us. Grant us the understanding. Show us Your mystery, and give us a full revelation concerning the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>In the preceding chapter we saw that the Divine Trinity is fully involved with the basic offerings. The Divine Trinity is the structure, the elements, and every aspect of all five basic offerings. Genesis reveals the fall of man. Exodus reveals the redemption of fallen man, consummating in the tabernacle, which was God&rsquo;s dwelling among His redeemed for God to fully give Himself to them and for them to enter into Him to enjoy Him in full. Then Leviticus continues to show us how God&rsquo;s redeemed people can enjoy God in fellowship through the offerings in the Tent of Meeting. Leviticus is a full revelation of the divine fellowship.</p>
<p>The subject of 1 John is the fellowship of the divine life (1:3-7). First John reveals that we need to abide in the Lord (2:27-28; 4:13) by the anointing (2:20, 27) and by confessing that we have sin within us (1:8), that we commit sins (v. 9), that we need the cleansing of Lord&rsquo;s blood (v. 7), and that we need Him as our Advocate, our Paraclete, to take care of our trespasses as our propitiation (2:1-2). First John is only five chapters, but the twenty-seven chapters of Leviticus are a full development of the divine fellowship. To see this is a great blessing. In the ordinances concerning the offerings in the first section of Leviticus (chs. 1&mdash;7) we can see the Trinity for our experience of fellowship with God.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will consider three cases in the second section of Leviticus. First, we will study portions of Leviticus 8 and 9 that reveal how a saved one can be a priest to serve God. Chapter 8 concerns the consecration of the priests. The word <em>consecration</em> comes from a Hebrew term meaning &ldquo;the filling of hands&rdquo; (cf. Exo. 28:41; 29:9) The consecration of the priests is the filling of their hands to serve the Triune God. A redeemed one must serve God not with himself or with anything else but with the Triune God. Such service requires the full experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity as revealed in detail in the consecration of the priests. In order to serve God we need not doctrinal knowledge of the Trinity but much experience of the Trinity. The Trinity is not for doctrine but for experience. In order to serve God as priests with our hands filled, we need the experience of the Triune God.</p>
<p>The next case we will consider in Leviticus is the cleansing of the leper in chapter 14. In type the Divine Trinity is fully involved with the cleansing of the leper. Early in my Christian life I learned from the Brethren teachings that a leper in the Old Testament typifies a sinner. Leprosy signifies sin in both its inward and outward aspects. I often referred to this case in Leviticus when preaching the gospel, but until recently I did not see that the cleansing of a typical leper depends upon the Trinity. It is through the Divine Trinity that a leper can be cleansed. The cleansing of a sinner is altogether a matter of the experience of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>The last case of the experience of the Divine Trinity in Leviticus is the arrangement of the lampstand for the shining of the divine light in chapter 24. Although we may be cleansed, without the shining of the divine light we cannot walk or move, much less serve God. In order to serve God, we need to have our hands filled with the Trinity and to be in the shining of the divine light. Within the tabernacle there were all the offerings, utensils, and furniture, but the priests needed the shining of the lampstand to be able to do anything. Similarly, the construction of a modern building may be completed, but without electricity to provide light, nothing can be done within the building. A lack of light causes disorder, but the shining of light results in order. Light controls. It is through light that we are able to move. Furthermore, light and life go together, just as darkness and death go together.</p>
<p>According to the complete revelation of Leviticus, we need the offerings, the filled hands of the priests, cleansing, and divine shining so that we can serve God by enjoying Him. This is the divine fellowship. The divine fellowship is simply our enjoyment of the Triune God for our service rendered to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE CONSECRATION OF THE PRIESTS</h2>
<p>Leviticus 8:2 says, &ldquo;Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread.&rdquo; The anointing oil typifies the compound Spirit. According to Exodus 30:23-31, the anointing oil is a compound ointment of five elements compounded together. These elements and their quantities and measurements are rich in significance. The anointing oil in Leviticus 8:2 is related to the sin offering. The sin offering typifies Christ for the priests&rsquo; sin. We should not think that those serving as priests do not have sin. Like all men, they have sin within and sins without. The sin offering is for their indwelling sin.</p>
<p>Verse 12 says, &ldquo;He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron&rsquo;s head and anointed him, to sanctify him.&rdquo; When the anointing oil was poured on the head of the serving priest, it is no longer objective but became subjective to him. When it was poured on his head, it must have run down and covered his entire body, including his face and his clothing. The serving priest was sanctified not by doctrine or teaching but by being anointed with the compound ointment. The compound ointment signifies the compound Spirit, which includes the Triune God mingled with Christ&rsquo;s humanity, crucifixion, and resurrection. We cannot be sanctified by teaching; instead, we need to experience the compound Spirit to become holy.</p>
<p>Verse 14 says, &ldquo;He brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.&rdquo; The laying on of hands indicates union and identification. The oil was poured upon the priests, and the priests laid their hands on the bull. This indicates that the compound Spirit anoints us and that we lay our hands on Christ to be united and identified with Him. The Old Testament pictures convey many details that are not found in the plain words of the New Testament. The clear, plain word concerning the divine fellowship is in 1 John, but the details of the divine fellowship are found throughout Leviticus. The picture of the oil being poured upon Aaron&rsquo;s head and of Aaron laying his hands on the bull of the sin offering typifies the compound Spirit anointing us and also typifies our union and identification with Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 18 says, &ldquo;He presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.&rdquo; The priests laid their hands not only on the sin offering but also on the burnt offering. The burnt offering signifies Christ for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. The bull was the offering for sin, and a ram was a burnt offering for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. Christ is the offering both for our sin and for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. Because we are identified with Him in these two aspects, our sin is terminated, and we can satisfy God.</p>
<p>Verse 26 says, &ldquo;From the basket of unleavened bread that was before Jehovah, he took one unleavened cake and one cake of oiled bread and one wafer.&rdquo; Jehovah is God the Father, and the oil typifies the Spirit. The unleavened bread signifies the sinless Christ, and the oiled bread typifies Christ mingled with the Spirit. Christ lived a life without sin but full of the Spirit. These breads were for the priests to eat and live on (v. 31). In order to serve God, it is not enough to be outwardly sanctified; we also need the nourishment of an inward supply. The offerings were mainly God&rsquo;s food, but a portion of the meal offering was the priest&rsquo;s food. The sinless Christ, who is mingled with the Spirit, is the nourishing supply to sustain us in our priestly service.</p>
<p>Verses 30 through 31 say, &ldquo;Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons and on his sons&rsquo; garments with him; and he sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons and his sons&rsquo; garments with him. And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of consecration, just as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.&rdquo; After the anointing oil was poured on Aaron in verse 12, it was sprinkled bit by bit on the priests and their garments. The Tent of Meeting typifies Christ as the dwelling of God among His people. The flesh of the ram of consecration typifies Christ as the priests&rsquo; food (v. 22; cf. Exo. 29:31-32). One ram was fully burned to be food for God, but the flesh of the second ram, which was an offering for consecration, was for the priests to eat. The bread of the meal offering that was in the basket of consecration also typifies Christ as the priests&rsquo; food (Lev. 8:2). The priests ate the flesh of the ram of consecration and the bread of the meal offering. The best diet is composed of the animal life, signifying Christ as the redeeming life (John 1:29), and the plant life, signifying Christ as the generating life (12:24). As the reality of these offerings, Christ is our food for redemption and generation.</p>
<p>Leviticus 9:23-24 says, &ldquo;Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting. And they came out and blessed the people; and the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the people. Then fire came forth from before Jehovah and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar.&rdquo; After the consecration of the priests, Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle; then they came out and blessed the people. Glory, which is God expressed, appeared. The fire that burned the offerings on the altar was not a fire kindled by human hands but a fire that came from God. The children of Israel were brought to Mount Sinai and stayed there for nine months, receiving the divine revelation and building the tabernacle. After Israel erected the tabernacle, Moses filled the hands of the priests to sanctify them. This was the first time that an offering was made to God before the tabernacle. In Exodus 40 the tabernacle and the altar were prepared, but the priests, who were required to carry out the offerings, were not yet ready. Thus, the priests needed to be consecrated. Leviticus is a continuation of the record in Exodus. After Aaron and his sons were inaugurated into the priesthood in Leviticus 8, they immediately began to make offerings in chapter 9. As soon as Moses anointed and consecrated the priests, Aaron began to place the various offerings on the altar. However, nothing happened to the offerings until Moses and Aaron entered into the tabernacle and came out. Then fire came forth from God to burn the offerings (vv. 23-24). This divine fire remained burning; it was never extinguished (6:12-13; cf. 16:12).</p>
<p>The fire that consumed the offering signifies God as the accepting agent. As we have seen already, this fire represents the mouth of God, for God received the offerings on the altar through this fire. Because the fire was not an earthly fire from human hands but a heavenly fire from God Himself, the burning of the offering was God&rsquo;s accepting the offering. This fire was not a judging fire but an accepting fire. The consummation of this burning was ashes, which were a sign that God had accepted the offering. Ordinarily, ashes are not a pleasant sight, but the priests making the offerings hoped to see ashes. When they saw ashes, they had the assurance that God had accepted their offering. In other words, God had enjoyed the food they offered.</p>
<p>The consecration of the priests, the filling of their hands, was so that they might enjoy the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. According to the New Testament, Christian service is a priestly service, a priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5, 9). If we do not have the priesthood, nothing we do is a service to God. The service that God requires of us is a priestly service. Regrettably, not many Christians today see this revelation, and as a result, many who think that they are serving God are actually laboring in ignorance and blindness. We need the Old Testament to give us the details of the divine revelation. In Leviticus 10 two sons of Aaron died because they made an offering with strange, man-made fire, which signifies man&rsquo;s natural enthusiasm, affection, strength, and ability. We cannot serve the Lord by our natural life or ability. Our service must be the filling of our hands with the Divine Trinity; otherwise, our service will be an abomination in the eyes of God. The filling of our hands with the Divine Trinity as the reality of the types in Leviticus 8 and 9 will usher us into the enjoyment of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. Our hands need to be filled with the Divine Trinity, and our entire being needs to be daily nourished by and mingled with the Divine Trinity. Then we will be able to serve God, and the service that we render to God will be altogether acceptable.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE CLEANSING OF THE LEPER</h2>
<p>Leviticus 14:4-5 says, &ldquo;The priest shall command that two living clean birds...be taken for the one who is to be cleansed. And the priest shall command that one of the birds be slaughtered in an earthen vessel over running water.&rdquo; The priest typifies Christ the Son. The cleansing of the leper required two living and clean birds, which typify Christ the Son, who is living and pure. The bird that was killed signifies the crucified Christ, and the bird that was released signifies the resurrected Christ (v. 7). The cleansing of our sinful condition requires the crucified Christ with His shed blood and the resurrected Christ with His resurrection life. The running water, which was also for the cleansing of the leper, signifies the Spirit. After we enjoy Christ as the crucified and resurrected One, the life-giving Spirit makes us living and pure.</p>
<p>Verse 10 says, &ldquo;He shall take two male lambs without blemish and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish and three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering mingled with oil.&rdquo; The two male lambs, the ewe lamb, and the meal offering each typify Christ the Son. Verse 12 says, &ldquo;The priest shall take one of the male lambs and present it as a trespass offering.&rdquo; The three lambs served as a trespass offering, a sin offering, and a burnt offering to be God&rsquo;s food (vv. 19-20). Lepers signify unclean persons, sinners. As sinners, we need Christ as the reality of these offerings to cleanse us. Christ as the trespass offering deals with our sins. Christ as the sin offering deals with our sinful nature. Christ as the burnt offering is God&rsquo;s food for His satisfaction. These details are found only in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>The meal offering typifies Christ&rsquo;s humanity as God&rsquo;s food, and the oil typifies the Spirit. Thus, the meal offering mingled with oil signifies Christ the Son mingled with the Spirit in His humanity as God&rsquo;s food. Only the proper humanity can satisfy God. Therefore, Christ needed to become a man to satisfy God. Christ&rsquo;s humanity is perfect and is fully mingled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>Verses 17 through 19 say, &ldquo;From the rest of the oil that is in the palm of his hand the priest shall put some on the lobe of the right ear of the one who is to be cleansed and some on the thumb of his right hand and some on the big toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering. The rest of the oil that is in the palm of the priest&rsquo;s hand he shall put on the head of the one who is to be cleansed. Then the priest shall make expiation for him before Jehovah. And the priest shall offer the sin offering and make expiation for the one who is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness, and afterward he shall slaughter the burnt offering.&rdquo; Before the oil was put on the leper, the blood of the trespass offering was put on his right ear, the thumb of his right hand, and the big toe of his right foot (v. 14). This shows that without the blood of Christ, we cannot enjoy the anointing Spirit. The ear is for listening, for hearing; the hand signifies doing; and the foot is for walking. This indicates that we have trespasses because we do not hear the word of God properly, we do not do things according to God&rsquo;s will, and we do not walk in the ways of God.</p>
<p>In the cleansing of the leper we can see the relation between the trespass offering, the sin offering, and the burnt offering. We first need the trespass offering, then the sin offering, and finally the burnt offering. Because we have many trespasses, we first need Christ as our trespass offering to deal with our sins. Then we need to realize that because the source of our sins is indwelling sin, our sinful nature, we also need Christ as our sin offering. Finally, we need to realize that because the cause of our sins is our not being absolute for God, we also need Christ as our burnt offering. Additionally, we need Christ as our meal offering to supply us to live absolutely for God. By Christ as these four offerings, a sinner is fully cleansed of his uncleanness.</p>
<p>The Old Testament types reveal many details of our spiritual experience. Jehovah being God the Father, the various offerings typifying Christ the Son, and the running water and oil representing the Spirit show us that sinners, signified by the leper, need to be cleansed in order to be brought back to the enjoyment of the Triune God. In fact, the cleansing itself is an experience and enjoyment of the Triune God. All three of the Trinity are fully involved in the cleansing of a sinner. When we were saved, we enjoyed Christ, who shed His blood and resurrected for us; we enjoyed the living Spirit, who gave us life to make us living; and we enjoyed God the Father, who joyfully accepted us. Furthermore, salvation is only the beginning of our enjoyment of the Triune God and initiates us into a life of following and fully enjoying the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE LAMPSTAND</h2>
<p>Leviticus 24:2-4 says, &ldquo;Command the children of Israel to bring to you pure oil of beaten olives for the light, to make the lamps burn continually. Outside the veil of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting Aaron shall set it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah continually. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations. He shall keep the lamps in order on the pure lampstand before Jehovah continually.&rdquo; The pure oil typifies the Spirit. The light is the shining of God. The lamps are the seven lamps (Exo. 25:37), which are the seven Spirits of God, the sevenfold intensified Spirit (Rev. 4:5), as the expression of God. The Tent of Meeting typifies Christ as the dwelling of God among His people. Here Jehovah is the Triune God.</p>
<p>The gold of the lampstand (Exo. 25:31) signifies God the Father in His divine nature; the form of the lampstand signifies God the Son as the embodiment of God the Father; and the seven lamps signify God the Spirit as the sevenfold intensified expression of the Father in the Son. Therefore, the pure lampstand signifies Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God. This embodiment shines so that the serving ones can live, walk, and work under the shining of the Triune God.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the arrangement of the lampstand reveals that the Divine Trinity is applied for the shining of the divine light within God&rsquo;s dwelling so that the people of God might serve Him through the enjoyment of the Divine Trinity. In type, the consecration of the priests, the cleansing of the leper, and the shining of the light of the lamps are all issues of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. This revelation requires much consideration, prayer, and fellowship.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>

AS REVEALED IN NUMBERS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Num. 6:13-16, 22-27; 7:1, 11-17; 9:15-18, 21; 20:6-8</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we believe that the reality of the Divine Trinity is with us. We thank You for Your cleansing blood and the anointing Spirit. Lord, we trust in You for Your blessing. We realize that we are nothing and that we can do nothing. Whatever we do by ourselves is in vain. How we need You! We need You for the divine revelation, the divine mystery, of the Divine Trinity. Make the Trinity real to us. Lord, we need Your fresh speaking so that we may receive the bountiful supply of Your life. Lord, cleanse us once again, and accept us. May our heart be open to You and hungry and thirsty for You.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the Divine Trinity as revealed in five cases in Numbers: the separation of the Nazarite, the threefold blessing of Jehovah to His people, the function of the tabernacle and the offerings, the cloud and the fire covering the tabernacle, and the smitten rock.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE SEPARATION OF THE NAZARITE</h2>
<p>The word <em>Nazarite</em> means &ldquo;one who is separated.&rdquo; The root of the noun <em>Nazarite</em> is the Hebrew verb <em>nazar,</em> which means to be separated (6:2). The Nazarites were separated from the world unto God. In the Old Testament God ordained that the descendants of Aaron would be the priests. Thus, some were born into the priesthood according to God&rsquo;s selection. However, the door was not closed for others who desired to serve God, for God also established the principle of the Nazarite. If those who were not born into the priesthood had a heart to serve God, they could volunteer as Nazarites. Samuel was a Nazarite. He was not born a priest, but by becoming a Nazarite, he eventually acted and served as a priest (1 Sam. 1&mdash;3). The Aaronic priests were chosen by God, but the Nazarites volunteered themselves. These two principles still exist in the church life today. On the one hand, we are chosen by God (Eph. 1:4); on the other hand, we need to volunteer as Nazarites in order to serve as priests. Although we know that we are chosen by God, in our actual service we do not have much consciousness of being chosen. Instead, when we serve in the church life, we are mainly conscious of the need to volunteer. The Lord Jesus was the real Nazarite. As His followers, we need to volunteer to serve God. Romans 12:1-2 speaks about voluntarily offering ourselves and being separated from the world unto God.</p>
<p>I knew from my youth that to be a Nazarite means to volunteer oneself, yet only recently did I see that the Trinity is altogether involved with the separation of the Nazarite. In the separation of the Nazarite there was the need of several offerings&mdash;the burnt offering, the sin offering, the peace offering, and the meal offering of different kinds of cakes anointed and mingled with oil. These four kinds of offerings are basic to the separation of the Nazarite.</p>
<p>Numbers 6:13 says, &ldquo;This is the law of the Nazarite when the days of his separation are fulfilled: He shall be brought to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.&rdquo; The Tent of Meeting refers to Christ as the dwelling place of God and the meeting place of His people. Every instance of enjoying the Trinity that we have seen throughout Exodus and Leviticus is at the Tent of Meeting. We must never leave Christ as the Tent of Meeting, because He is the ground and sphere for our enjoyment of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>Verse 14 begins, &ldquo;He shall present his offering to Jehovah.&rdquo; The Old Testament almost always uses the expression <em>offering to Jehovah;</em> very rarely does it use the expression <em>offering to God.</em> The divine title <em>Jehovah</em> bears two primary characteristics in the Old Testament. It denotes God&rsquo;s relationship with man, and it denotes the Trinity. We have seen that in Exodus 3:6 Jehovah said, &ldquo;I am...the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&rdquo; Jehovah identifies Himself as the God of three generations, a threefold God, implying the Divine Trinity. Thus, in the separation of the Nazarite in Numbers 6 Jehovah is the Triune God.</p>
<p>Verse 14 continues, &ldquo;One male lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering, and one female lamb a year old without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for a peace offering.&rdquo; The burnt offering signifies Christ for God&rsquo;s satisfaction, and the sin offering signifies Christ for the Nazarite&rsquo;s sin. The burnt offering was the base, the basic offering, of the Nazarite vow. In order to be a Nazarite, we need to live a life as a burnt offering&mdash;a life absolutely for God. The sin offering is necessary because our sinful nature frustrates us from living absolutely for God. The vow of the Nazarite does not include a trespass offering because the basic cause of our not living a life absolutely for God is not our trespasses but our sinful nature. Even if we did not commit any sins or trespasses, we would still have this inward sin. Some unbelievers are apparently able to be good people with a high character and may even control their temper better than some seeking Christians do. However, such well-behaved ones are far away from God, and sin is still within them. Our natural constitution is sinful and not for God regardless of how good it might be in the eyes of man.</p>
<p>The peace offering in the Nazarite vow shows that we enjoy peace when we live a life of volunteering to serve God. When we do not live a Nazarite life, a life absolutely for God, it is difficult to have peace. If we do not live a Nazarite&rsquo;s life, outwardly we may have no problem with others, but inwardly we will have a problem with everyone. The peace offering typifies Christ as the Nazarite&rsquo;s peace with God and with His people.</p>
<p>Verses 15 through 16 say, &ldquo;A basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal offering and their drink offerings. And the priest shall present them before Jehovah and offer his sin offering and his burnt offering.&rdquo; The basket of unleavened bread contains the constituents of the meal offering. Anointing is an outward union; mingling is an inward blending. Few Christian teachers dare to talk about mingling, because in the early church an erroneous doctrine of mingling was condemned as heretical. Some oppose our teaching that in Christ God was mingled with man, because they think that mingling two things of different natures produces a distinct, third nature. However, <em>Webster&rsquo;s Third New International Dictionary</em> defines <em>mingle</em> as &ldquo;to bring or combine together or with something else so that the components remain distinguishable in the combination.&rdquo; Thus, when two things are mingled together, their natures remain distinguishable. When tea and water are mingled together, they do not lose their distinct natures. The picture of the fine flour being mingled with oil in the Old Testament type of the meal offering shows us clearly that in Christ humanity was mingled with divinity.</p>
<p>The unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil and the unleavened wafers anointed with oil refer to the sinless Christ mingled with and anointed by the Spirit as food to both God and the priest. Christ is sinless, and He is anointed outwardly by the Spirit and mingled inwardly with the Spirit. He is without sin, and He is full of the Spirit. Such a Christ is food to both God and to the serving ones.</p>
<p>The meal offering typifies Christ for God&rsquo;s satisfaction, and the drink offering typifies Christ for God&rsquo;s pleasure. The drink offering was of wine (Lev. 23:13), which is for the pleasure of the drinker. Satisfaction and pleasure are different. Although we are satisfied with the main course of a meal, we may not experience pleasure until we eat dessert. God desires not only satisfaction but also pleasure. We may satisfy God by offering ourselves to Him, but we also need to please God by pouring ourselves out.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul said that he was poured out as a drink offering to God (Phil. 2:17; 2 Tim. 4:6). Paul poured out his entire being for God&rsquo;s pleasure. The part of Paul&rsquo;s life that was a pleasure to God was his martyrdom. Paul lived a consecrated life, a Nazarite&rsquo;s life, which was a reproduction of Jesus&rsquo; life and a satisfaction to God, and when Paul was martyred, he was poured out as a drink offering to God. Paul satisfied God as food while he was alive, and he pleased God as a drink offering at the conclusion of his life.</p>
<p>With the consecration of the priests in Leviticus 1&mdash;7 there was the burnt offering, the sin offering, the peace offering, and the meal offering but no drink offering, but with the separation of the Nazarite the drink offering was included. This indicates that if we serve God based only on His selection, we may satisfy God, but we must volunteer to serve God to give Him pleasure. Voluntary service is very pleasant to God.</p>
<p>The separation of the Nazarite was so that he might participate in the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in type. Even before a Nazarite began serving, he participated in the riches of the Trinity when he separated himself from the world unto God. According to the charge in Romans 12:1, we need to voluntarily consecrate ourselves to God, and the types in the separation of the Nazarite in Numbers 6 show that the Divine Trinity is fully involved in our consecration.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE THREEFOLD BLESSING OF JEHOVAH<br />
TO HIS PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Numbers 6:22-27 says, &ldquo;Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, Thus you shall bless the children of Israel; you shall say to them, Jehovah bless you and keep you; Jehovah make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you; Jehovah lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace. So shall they put My name upon the children of Israel, that I Myself may bless them.&rdquo; Jehovah charged the priests to bless His people in His name in a threefold way. This was the threefold blessing of Jehovah the Triune God to His people.</p>
<p>Because Jehovah is mentioned three times&mdash;once in each part of the threefold blessing&mdash;Jehovah is the Divine Trinity. The first part of the blessing, &ldquo;Jehovah bless you and keep you,&rdquo; implies the Father, the first of the Trinity. The second part, &ldquo;Jehovah make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you,&rdquo; implies the Son, the second of the Trinity. <em>Face</em> signifies presence. <em>Shine</em> implies light and means that something is coming. <em>Be gracious</em> means &ldquo;give grace.&rdquo; Thus, in the second part of the threefold blessing, Jehovah comes to us and gives grace to us, which is more subjective and experiential than Jehovah&rsquo;s blessing and keeping us. In the third part of Jehovah&rsquo;s threefold blessing, which implies the Holy Spirit, the third of the Trinity, Jehovah lifts up His countenance upon us and gives us peace. The face (v. 25) denotes the presence of the person, and the countenance denotes the expression of the person. The countenance is more particular and intimate and is mostly for pleasant expressions such as love, mercy, and kindness.</p>
<p>Verses 24 through 27 are the blessing of the Triune God. The Father blesses and keeps us. The Son, who is God incarnated, is the shining of God&rsquo;s presence and brings grace (John 1:14, 16-17). The Spirit is God&rsquo;s intimate, pleasant presence and gives us peace. Several New Testament Epistles say, &ldquo;Grace to you and peace&rdquo; (e.g., Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:3; 2 Pet. 1:2; Rev. 1:4). Grace is God for our enjoyment, and peace is the result of our enjoyment of God. Grace is Christ (2 Cor. 13:14a; cf. 1 Cor. 15:10; Gal. 2:20), and peace is the Spirit (Rom. 14:17). God&rsquo;s face and God&rsquo;s countenance, Christ and the Spirit, and grace and peace are all similarly related. The Trinity is uniquely unveiled in the threefold blessing in Numbers 6.</p>
<p>The threefold blessing of Jehovah the Triune God to His people was for the priest to bless the children of Israel that they could enjoy the riches of the Divine Trinity. This Old Testament blessing prefigures the New Testament blessing of the Triune God dispensing Himself in the Divine Trinity into us for our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE FUNCTION OF<br />
THE TABERNACLE AND THE OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>Numbers 7:1 says, &ldquo;Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it and all its furnishings and the altar and all its utensils, and had anointed them and sanctified them.&rdquo; Verses 11 through 17 say, &ldquo;Jehovah said to Moses, They shall present their offering, one leader each day, for the dedication of the altar. And he who presented his offering the first day was Nahshon...of the tribe of Judah. And his offering was one silver plate...one silver bowl...both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal offering; one golden cup...full of incense; one bull of the herd, one ram, one male lamb a year old, for a burnt offering; one male of the goats for a sin offering; and for the sacrifice of peace offerings, two oxen, five rams, five male goats, five male lambs a year old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The furnishings of the tabernacle were its furniture, and the utensils of the altar were its vessels. The tabernacle typifies Christ as the dwelling place of God among His people. The anointing oil typifies the all-inclusive compound Spirit. Jehovah is the Triune God. The pure oil in the meal offering typifies the Spirit. The meal offering typifies Christ as food to satisfy God and His serving ones. The incense typifies Christ as a sweet savor to God for His acceptance of His people. The burnt offering typifies Christ for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. The sin offering typifies Christ crucified for the sin of God&rsquo;s people. The peace offering typifies Christ as peace between God and His people for their co-enjoyment. God and His people enjoy Christ as the peace offering together.</p>
<p>Numbers is a continuation of Leviticus, which is a continuation of Exodus. Actually, these three books are one record. The first part of this record, Exodus, stresses the tabernacle; the second part, Leviticus, stresses the priesthood; and the third part, Numbers, stresses the function of the tabernacle and the altar and the service of the priesthood. The tabernacle and the altar are set up in the last chapter of Exodus, but their function begins in Numbers 7 with the offerings for the dedication of the altar. This dedication was for the tabernacle with all its furnishings and the altar with all its utensils to be put into function through the dispensing of the Divine Trinity so that God&rsquo;s redeemed people could enjoy the riches of the Divine Trinity all the time through all their generations. The beginning of the function of the tabernacle and the altar altogether involved the Divine Trinity.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE CLOUD AND THE FIRE<br />
COVERING THE TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>Numbers 9:15-18 says, &ldquo;On the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the Tent of the Testimony; and in the evening it was like the appearance of fire over the tabernacle until morning. So it was always; the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night. And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tent, then after that the children of Israel set out; and in the place where the cloud settled, there the children of Israel encamped. At the commandment of Jehovah the children of Israel set out, and at the commandment of Jehovah they encamped; as long as the cloud settled upon the tabernacle, they remained encamped.&rdquo; Verse 21 says, &ldquo;If sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning, when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they set out; or if it remained a day and a night, when the cloud was taken up, they set out.&rdquo; The cloud typifies the Spirit in the day, and the fire typifies the Spirit in the night. The tabernacle typifies Christ as God&rsquo;s dwelling among His people. Jehovah is the Triune God.</p>
<p>The cloud and the fire covering the tabernacle indicate that the Divine Trinity is for God&rsquo;s people to stay or to journey that they may enjoy the riches of the Divine Trinity all the time and all the way. When they remained and when they journeyed, God&rsquo;s presence was with them as the Trinity. God is sometimes objective to us, but the Trinity is always subjective. In other words, when we experience God, He is the Trinity. The Trinity is not for doctrinal knowledge of the Godhead but for the experience and enjoyment of God by His people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE SMITTEN ROCK</h2>
<p>Numbers 20:6-8 says, &ldquo;The glory of Jehovah appeared to them. Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Take the rod...and speak to the rock before their eyes, so that it yields its water. Thus you shall bring forth water for them out of the rock and give the assembly and their livestock something to drink.&rdquo; In these verses, glory is God expressed, and Jehovah is the Triune God. The rock typifies the crucified Christ following God&rsquo;s people. First Corinthians 10:4b says, &ldquo;They drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.&rdquo; Christ today as the Spirit follows us everywhere. The water typifies the Spirit of life (v. 4a; John 7:38-39). This water began to flow out of the smitten rock in Exodus 17 and continued in Numbers 20. According to Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Corinthians 10:4, the rock must have followed the children of Israel and flowed out water to quench their thirst throughout their journey in the wilderness for forty years. The Spirit as the living water flowing out of Christ as the smitten rock is the flowing out of the Triune God, and the issue of this flow is the conclusion of the entire Bible. The river of water of life that proceeds out of the throne of God with the tree of life growing alongside in Revelation 22:1-2 is the flowing out of the Triune God. This is a great matter. The smitten rock in Numbers 20 shows that the Divine Trinity follows God&rsquo;s people on their journey to quench their thirst so that they may enjoy the riches of the divine life.</p>
<p>The five cases we have considered in Numbers&mdash;the separation of the Nazarite, the threefold blessing of Jehovah to His people, the function of the tabernacle and the offerings, the cloud and the fire covering the tabernacle, and the smitten rock&mdash;all involve the Triune God. We need the Divine Trinity for our consecration as Nazarites. The Trinity is the structure and content of the divine blessing to us. We need the Trinity for the function of the tabernacle and the altar. We need the Trinity as God&rsquo;s presence to stay with us, journey with us, and guide us. We need the Trinity to be the source of living water that always follows us to quench our thirst.</p>
<p>Apparently, the book of Numbers is a record of the numbering of God&rsquo;s people and their journey in the wilderness. Actually, such a record is structured with the Divine Trinity. Without the Divine Trinity, the record in Numbers would be empty. The intrinsic reality of the record in Numbers is the Divine Trinity, as revealed in the separation of the Nazarite, Jehovah&rsquo;s threefold blessing to His people, the function of the tabernacle and the altar, God&rsquo;s continual presence with His people in their journey, and the thirst-quenching rock that followed them as they followed God. This reveals how crucial the Trinity is. The Divine Trinity is our way to follow the Lord, our way to serve Him, and our way to be supplied with life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE TRINITY<br />
AS REVEALED IN JUDGES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Judg. 5:23; 6:12, 14, 19, 21-26, 34; 11:29-30, 32; 13:3-25; 15:14, 19</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for all that You are to us. We thank You for Your Word and for Your speaking. Grant us Your gracious visitation. We need You. Lord, cleanse us and anoint us. We trust in Your anointing. Thank You, Lord, that You are the all-inclusive Spirit continually anointing us. Thank You for Your Spirit and Your word.

Defeat the enemy, and give us Your fresh speaking to meet all our needs. Lord, we praise You, thank You, and give You all the glory.</p>
<p>In the previous chapters we saw much concerning the Divine Trinity in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers. However, there is little indication of the Trinity in Deuteronomy and Joshua. We need to consider why this is. In Genesis the Trinity was involved in God&rsquo;s creation and, after man&rsquo;s fall, in God&rsquo;s redemption. Then the Trinity was involved in God&rsquo;s choosing and calling His people and His going on with His elect, mainly with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Exodus is a record of God&rsquo;s all-inclusive redemption and God&rsquo;s bringing His redeemed people through the Red Sea and the wilderness to arrive at Mount Sinai, where they could receive the revelation of the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place. The Trinity was absolutely necessary for the carrying out of these divine activities. Leviticus is a record of the redeemed people&rsquo;s fellowship with God and enjoyment of God. For this fellowship and enjoyment, there surely was the need of the Divine Trinity. After Leviticus God&rsquo;s people had been redeemed, God&rsquo;s dwelling place had been erected, the priesthood had been prepared, and all the offerings had been ordained. Thus, there was the need of a beginning to bring the redeemed people, the tabernacle, the priesthood, and all the offerings into function. Numbers concerns this beginning, which fully involved the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>Deuteronomy contains no new commandments from God but repeats what God commanded in Exodus and Leviticus. It is a repetition and review of the laws and ordinances given by God. Moses was like an aged father speaking to his children before his death, and out of his loving concern for God&rsquo;s people he reviewed all the commandments and ordinances, hoping that they would walk according to them so that they would please God. In principle, there was no need for the Trinity to be involved for such a review. The book of Joshua records the redeemed people entering into and taking possession of the good land and the allotment of the portions of the land to the twelve tribes. Because there was not a need for the Trinity in this allotment, there is little indication of the Trinity in Joshua. The Divine Trinity is not for knowledge, theology, or doctrine but altogether for experience. Therefore, in Deuteronomy and Joshua the Divine Trinity is not as involved as in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers.</p>
<p>After God&rsquo;s people received their respective portions of the good land to enjoy, in Judges we see that they did not keep Moses&rsquo; exhortation to live according to God&rsquo;s law and ordinances so that they might please God. Instead, they became a total failure. They failed by worshipping idols, which is spiritual fornication. In Deuteronomy Moses charged them strongly, lovingly, and definitely that when they entered into the good land, they should not worship idols but should worship only God and should do so only in the unique place chosen by God (ch. 12). If the children of Israel had kept Moses&rsquo; exhortations, they would have avoided idol worship and division. However, the children of Israel instead chose to worship idols (Judg. 2:11-13; 10:6). These idols were set up in different high places according to the people&rsquo;s choice. Thus, the people were divided by worshiping the idols. This is a type of the divisions in Christianity. Every division is caused by human choice, and every human choice that is different from God&rsquo;s choice is related to idolatry. In Judges we see idol worship that produced division. Nearly every case of failure in Judges is the same in principle. Because the children of Israel did not walk in a way pleasing to God, God allowed their enemies to defeat them.</p>
<p>The lowest record in the Bible is in Judges. The defining and concluding verse of this book is Judges 21:25, which says, &ldquo;In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes&rdquo; (cf. 17:6). Therefore, we may be surprised to discover that the Divine Trinity is revealed in at least four cases in Judges: the cases of Deborah, Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson. There was a need of several overcomers in Judges because the situation among God&rsquo;s people was entirely abnormal. Of the many overcomers in Judges, the first was Deborah, a female. This should be encouraging to the sisters. In the abnormal situation of God&rsquo;s people recorded in Judges, God did something extraordinary by raising up a woman to be a leader. In a normal situation the principle God has ordained is that the position of a woman is one of submission. The second case that indicates the Trinity in Judges is the case of Gideon, who was the highest example of an overcomer. The third case, which is less well known, is that of Jephthah. The last case that we will consider is the case of Samson.</p>
<p>These four overcomers defeated four kinds of enemies. Deborah defeated the Canaanites, Gideon defeated the Midianites, Jephthah defeated the Ammonites, and Samson defeated the Philistines. These four kinds of enemies have much spiritual significance. The Canaanites were merchants (cf. Zech. 14:21); they cared only for commerce. Midian was the son of Abraham by his last wife, Keturah (Gen. 25:1-2); Ishmael was Abraham&rsquo;s son by Hagar (16:15). In figure, both the Midianites and the Ishmaelites signify the flesh, the natural strength. The Ammonites are the descendants of one of the two sons of Lot who were brought forth by incest (19:36-38). They represent increase gained by improper, sinful, or worldly means. The Philistines took the Ark and kept it for a time (1 Sam. 4&mdash;6). When they returned the Ark, they moved it on a cart pulled by two cows (6:7), but God had ordained that the proper way to carry the Ark was upon the shoulders of the Levites (1 Chron. 15:2; Num. 7:9). Thus, the Philistines signify worldly people who handle the divine things in a worldly way.</p>
<p>The record in Judges is similar to the abnormal situation among God&rsquo;s people today. When Israel said that there was no king among them, this meant that they had annulled God and His status. Because many Christians do what is right in their own eyes, there are endless divisions with different ways of meeting. The Canaanites, Midianites, Ammonites, and Philistines were mixed with and oppressed the children of Israel in the good land; similarly, commerce, the flesh, improper increase, and worldliness have come in and conquered God&rsquo;s people today. God&rsquo;s people are defeated and suffering under these enemies. Many are crying for salvation.</p>
<p>In such an abnormal situation there is a great need of overcomers. We need many brothers and sisters like Deborah, Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson. In addition to the case of Deborah, the cooperation of Samson&rsquo;s mother with God in the miraculous birth of Samson shows that the sisters are needed not only to be overcomers but also to produce overcomers by contacting the Lord. When we have a heart for the Lord, He will visit us and use us to produce some who will overcome the present situation so that God&rsquo;s people might be released from the usurpation of those who handle the things of God in a worldly way. In the abnormal situation in Judges there was also a great need for the Divine Trinity to be involved. The more abnormal the situation, the more there is the need of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>I emphasize the Trinity in my ministry not because of my personal preference but because of my burden to help the saints to have the real experience of the Triune God. It is because God is triune that we are able to experience Him. Christians may speak of Christ and the Spirit without realizing that these titles imply the Trinity and are for our experience. God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit for our experience. Moreover, we most need to experience Him in abnormal situations such as today&rsquo;s situation, which is prefigured in Judges.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE CASE OF DEBORAH</h2>
<p>Judges 5 is the song of Deborah and Barak. Verse 23 says, &ldquo;Curse Meroz, says the Angel of Jehovah; / Bitterly curse its inhabitants. / For they did not come to the aid of Jehovah, / To the aid of Jehovah against the mighty.&rdquo; The Angel of Jehovah is Christ as the sent One of God, and Jehovah is the Triune God.</p>
<p>The Divine Trinity&rsquo;s involvement in Deborah&rsquo;s victory over Sisera, the captain of the Canaanite army, was for her and her followers to enjoy the Triune God. Verse 12 says, &ldquo;Awake! Awake, Deborah! / Awake! Awake, speak forth a song! / Arise, Barak; / And lead captive your captives.&rdquo; Verses 15 through 16 say, &ldquo;The princes in Issachar were with Deborah; / And Issachar was true to Barak; / Into the valley they were sent behind him. / Among the divisions of Reuben / There were great resolutions in heart. / Why did you sit among the sheepfolds / Listening to the pipings for the flocks? / In the divisions of Reuben / There were great searchings of heart.&rdquo; These verses indicate that when Deborah was stirred up by the Triune God, Barak came in to help her. Then many of the defeated children of Israel were stirred up as well, and they seriously considered their situation and made a strong decision to follow Deborah and Barak to fight the enemies. A great resolution in heart is a firm decision. We need to search our heart and strongly resolve to fight for God. Verse 31 says, &ldquo;May all Your enemies so perish, O Jehovah. / But may those who love Him be like the sun / When it rises in its might.&rdquo; When we consider these verses together, we can see that Deborah, Barak, and those who followed them to fight the battle were enjoying the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE CASE OF GIDEON</h2>
<p>Judges 6:12 says, &ldquo;The Angel of Jehovah appeared to him [Gideon] and said to him, Jehovah is with you.&rdquo; Verse 14 says, &ldquo;Jehovah turned to him and said, Go in this strength of yours, and save Israel from the hand of Midian.&rdquo; We should not say that we are weak and do not have strength. What we have is enough; we need to go with whatever we have. Verse 19 says, &ldquo;Gideon went and prepared a kid and an ephah of flour in unleavened cakes...And he brought it out to Him...And he presented it.&rdquo; Verses 21 through 26 say, &ldquo;The Angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in His hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And fire came up from the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes...Gideon saw that He was the Angel of Jehovah. And Gideon said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah! For I have seen the Angel of Jehovah face to face. And Jehovah said to him, Peace be with you...Then Gideon built an altar there to Jehovah, and he called it Jehovah-shalom...Jehovah said to him, Take your father&rsquo;s bull...And build an altar to Jehovah your God...And offer a burnt offering.&rdquo; Verse 34 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of Jehovah clothed Gideon; and he blew the trumpet.&rdquo; When Gideon blew the trumpet, many followed him.</p>
<p>As in the case of Deborah, in the case of Gideon the Angel of Jehovah was Christ as the sent One of God, and Jehovah was the Triune God. The kid typifies Christ as our burnt offering, and the unleavened cakes typify Christ as our meal offering. The fire typifies God as the accepting agent. We have seen that such a consuming, devouring, accepting fire is God Himself (Heb. 12:29). The rock signifies Christ as the ground for God to grace His people. The Lord Jehovah is the Triune God as the Lord. <em>Jehovah-shalom</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah is peace,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah of peace.&rdquo; <em>God</em> in Judges 6:26 in Hebrew is Elohim, indicating the Triune God. The burnt offering typifies Christ for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. Finally, the Spirit of Jehovah is the Spirit of the Triune God.</p>
<p>The Divine Trinity&rsquo;s involvement in Gideon&rsquo;s victory over the Midianites was for Gideon to enjoy the Triune God with His redemption in Christ and with the Spirit. The sacrificed animals indicate redemption. Jehovah, the Angel of Jehovah, and the Spirit of Jehovah imply God, the Son of God sent by Him, and the Spirit of God, indicating the Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE CASE OF JEPHTHAH</h2>
<p>Judges 11:29-30 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah...And Jephthah made a vow to Jehovah.&rdquo; Verse 32 says, &ldquo;Jephthah passed on to the children of Ammon to fight against them, and Jehovah delivered them into his hand.&rdquo; We can see the Trinity involved here because there is the Spirit of Jehovah, who is the Spirit of the Triune God, and Jehovah, who is the Triune God. The Divine Trinity was for Jephthah&rsquo;s victory over the Ammonites.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE CASE OF SAMSON</h2>
<p>Judges 13:3-25 says, &ldquo;The Angel of Jehovah appeared to the woman...Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me; and His appearance was like the appearance of an angel of God...Then Manoah entreated Jehovah and said, Oh, my Lord! Let the man of God, whom You sent, come again to us, I pray; and let Him teach us what we should do with the boy that is to be born...And the Angel of God came again to the woman...And the woman hurried and ran off; and she told her husband and said to him, The man who came to me that day has just appeared to me. And Manoah rose up and followed his wife and came to the man...And Manoah said to the Angel of Jehovah, Let us detain You, we pray, that we may prepare a kid for You. And the Angel of Jehovah said to Manoah...If you prepare a burnt offering, offer it up to Jehovah. For Manoah did not know that He was the Angel of Jehovah. Then Manoah said to the Angel of Jehovah, What is Your name?...And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, Why do you ask about My name, since it is wonderful? And Manoah took the kid with the meal offering and offered it up upon the rock to Jehovah; and He acted wondrously, while Manoah and his wife looked on. And when the flame went up from the altar to heaven, the Angel of Jehovah went up in the flame of the altar...Then Manoah knew that He was the Angel of Jehovah. And Manoah said to his wife, We will surely die, for we have seen God...And the woman bore a son, and she called his name Samson...And Jehovah blessed him. And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him at Mahaneh-dan.&rdquo; Judges 14:19 and 15:14 say, &ldquo;The Spirit of Jehovah rushed upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Angel in Judges 13 is called the Angel of Jehovah and the Angel of God. However, He is also called a man. This was Christ as a man more than a thousand years before His incarnation. This fact cannot be systematized. The Angel of Jehovah and the Angel of God refer to Christ as the sent One of God. The Angel of Jehovah did not allow Manoah to offer anything to Him but told Manoah to make an offering to Jehovah (v. 16). Thus, the Angel kept His position as the sent One, just as the Lord Jesus did (John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38; 7:16; 12:44).</p>
<p>The titles <em>Jehovah, Lord,</em> and <em>God</em> in Judges 13 refer to the Triune God. Thus, the Spirit of Jehovah was the Spirit of the Triune God. The kid that Manoah offered typifies Christ as the burnt offering for God&rsquo;s satisfaction, and the meal offering typifies Christ for God&rsquo;s food. The rock upon which Manoah made the offering typifies Christ as the ground for God to grace His people.</p>
<p>The Angel of Jehovah appeared to Manoah&rsquo;s wife for the producing of a son, Samson. This shows that the sisters are crucial for the producing of the overcoming Nazarites. However, both times that the Angel appeared to the woman, she went to her husband. This indicates that she did not take the place of the head but took her husband as her head. It is very good for the sisters to aspire to produce those who meet God&rsquo;s need, but they must not take the position of the head. The sisters should not become proud or independent when the Lord appears to them. There was much coordination between Manoah and his wife. Such coordination between sisters and brothers in their married life is needed in the church life today. Sometimes the Lord may come first to the wife, but she should not forget her husband, who is still her head.</p>
<p>Manoah asked the Angel of Jehovah, &ldquo;What is Your name?&rdquo; Manoah&rsquo;s wife needed her husband to negotiate. The Angel came to her twice, but she did not ask who He was. When we deal with others, it is important to know their name, especially if we may need to reach them again. Manoah attempted to discover the Angel&rsquo;s identity, first by trying to offer something to Him and then by asking His name. The Angel of Jehovah answered Manoah in a peculiar way, saying, &ldquo;Why do you ask about My name, since it is wonderful?&rdquo; A few hundred years later, the prophet Isaiah received a revelation concerning this One. Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us... / And His name will be called / Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father.&rdquo; When Manoah made an offering to Jehovah, the One whose name was wonderful &ldquo;acted wondrously&rdquo; (Judg. 13:19). There is no record of exactly what He did, because it was too wonderful to explain. When something is truly wonderful, we cannot explain it. Then Manoah and his wife saw the Angel of Jehovah ascend in the flame of the altar. This was truly wonderful and caused Manoah to know that He was the Angel of Jehovah. When Manoah realized that he had been speaking to the Angel of Jehovah, he said to his wife, &ldquo;We have seen God.&rdquo; Thus, in Judges 13 the Angel of Jehovah is called the Angel of God, a man, and God.</p>
<p>The riches of the Divine Trinity were involved in bringing forth Samson to defeat the enemies by the mighty Spirit of the Triune God. Similarly, we can defeat the enemies in today&rsquo;s situation by the Triune God. The riches of the Divine Trinity revealed in the case of Samson are God, the Spirit, and Christ the Son as God&rsquo;s sent One, a man, the burnt offering, and the meal offering. Thus, we can see the Triune God in a full way. We can also see incarnation, redemption, resurrection, and ascension. Just as the Spirit came after the sent One ascended in the case of Samson, so the Spirit descended after the Lord&rsquo;s ascension in the New Testament. Thus, the case of Samson prefigures many New Testament items. Just as the Spirit empowered Samson to defeat the Philistines, so the Lord Jesus was empowered by the Spirit to defeat God&rsquo;s enemy (Matt. 12:28; Acts 10:38). This can be fully applied to us in today&rsquo;s situation. We need to experience the riches of the Divine Trinity to produce the overcomers who, by the mighty Spirit of the Triune God, will release God&rsquo;s people from the bondage, oppression, and usurpation of those who handle the divine things in a worldly way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>

<h2 class="head1">A REVIEW OF THE REVELATION<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY FROM GENESIS TO JUDGES</h2>
<p>We need to see the significance of the sequence of the books of the Bible according to the crucial points in each book. Genesis shows us God&rsquo;s creation and God&rsquo;s purpose in creation, which is to gain an expression. God made man in His image for His expression (1:26). Genesis eventually reveals that God desires a house. This revelation came to Jacob while he was fleeing from his brother, Esau, after taking Esau&rsquo;s birthright and blessing. Jacob had a dream from God, and upon waking from the dream, he prophetically named the place Bethel, which means &ldquo;the house of God&rdquo; (28:17-19, 22). This prophecy concerning God&rsquo;s house was initially fulfilled at the end of Exodus when the tabernacle was built as God&rsquo;s dwelling place among His people (40:17).</p>
<p>In Genesis and Exodus four basic items are revealed and applied by God: God&rsquo;s sent One, the tabernacle, the offerings, and the Spirit. As the sent One, God came to His created and chosen people as an angel and as a man. The first time God came to His people as a man was in Genesis 18. Three men appeared to Abraham, and one of them was Jehovah (vv. 13-14, 22). We know that Jehovah came to Abraham as a genuine man because Abraham washed His feet and served Him a meal (vv. 4-8). Jehovah also appeared several times in Genesis as the Angel of Jehovah, the sent One of God (16:7, 13; 22:11-12). This sent One also appeared to Moses in Exodus 3, where the Angel of Jehovah is called Jehovah (vv. 2, 4), the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob (v. 6), and I AM WHO I AM (v. 14). After Exodus 3, this Angel appeared quite often. The Angel fought the battle for Israel against Pharaoh&rsquo;s army (14:19-20, 24-25). He was continually with the children of Israel from the time they left Egypt and crossed the Red Sea.</p>
<p>The Angel of Jehovah appeared several times in Judges. When the Angel appeared to Samson&rsquo;s parents, He was repeatedly called a man (13:3, 6, 11). Judges 13:20 says, &ldquo;When the flame went up from the altar to heaven, the Angel of Jehovah went up in the flame of the altar, while Manoah and his wife looked on.&rdquo; More than a thousand years before Christ ascended in a cloud (Acts 1:9), the Angel of Jehovah, as a man, ascended in the flame of the altar. Actually, the Angel of Jehovah was Christ as a man. The Old Testament reveals that the Angel of Jehovah was Jehovah, and the name Jesus means &ldquo;Jehovah the Savior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The appearing of the Angel in Exodus issued in the children of Israel building the tabernacle, which is a type of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God. Exodus also mentions the offerings, which are described in detail in Leviticus, and are all types of Christ. John 1, which is an extract of the entire Gospel of John, shows that Christ is the fulfillment of the tabernacle (v. 14), and as the Lamb of God, He is the aggregate and the fulfillment of all the offerings (v. 29).</p>
<p>Exodus also contains several types of the Spirit. The cloud fighting for Israel in 14:19-25 and covering the tabernacle in 40:34 typifies the Spirit (1 Cor. 10:2; cf. 12:13). The water that flowed out of the smitten rock in Exodus 17:6 also typifies the Spirit (John 7:37-39; 1 Cor. 12:13). The compounded anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-25 typifies the all-inclusive, compound Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; John 7:39; Phil. 1:19). Thus, by the end of Exodus we have seen the four major items: the Angel of Jehovah, God&rsquo;s sent One as a man; the tabernacle as the embodiment of the Triune God and His dwelling place among His people; the offerings as the means by which God&rsquo;s people enter into the enjoyment of the Triune God; and the Spirit. These items are fully revealed and realized in Christ in the New Testament. Thus, we can see that the Old and New Testaments actually speak concerning one thing: God&rsquo;s economy to work Himself into His chosen people through the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>The Trinity is crucial for God&rsquo;s economy. If God were not triune, He would not be able to reach and enter into His creature man. In order to dispense Himself into man, God had to be triune. God needed to become a man as the sent One. This sent One also needed to be the embodiment of God and the reality of the offerings in order to be the means, the sphere, and the entrance for God&rsquo;s chosen ones to enter into the enjoyment of God. In order for all these accomplishments to reach and be applied to God&rsquo;s people, the sent One had to be the Spirit. Because God is the Spirit, His people can drink Him, and He can anoint them as ointment. The Triune God as the Spirit is mingled with His elect by entering into them as living water and covering them as the anointing ointment. This is the picture presented by both the Old and New Testaments.</p>
<p>Apparently, the Old Testament contains biographies, history, poetry, and prophecy, and the New Testament contains accounts of the Lord&rsquo;s earthly ministry and the letters that the apostles wrote to the early churches. However, the Old Testament and the New Testament intrinsically reveal the same thing. While I am speaking, others see my clothing, my face, and my hair, but these things do not represent me. There is something more intrinsic, that is, what I am speaking. The Bible similarly has an intrinsic content. We need to get into this intrinsic content. God&rsquo;s sent One, God&rsquo;s embodiment, the offerings, and God the Spirit are the intrinsic content, the innermost essence and elements, of the Holy Scriptures. The entire Bible is constructed with these four items. Primarily through these items, we have seen the Divine Trinity in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Judges.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BACKGROUND OF 1 AND 2 SAMUEL</h2>
<p>In order for God&rsquo;s chosen people to be His house, His expression, the Trinity was needed. The children of Israel entered into the good land, but the good land was filled with enemies. The book of Judges reveals the Trinity because the Trinity was needed to defeat the enemies. However, God&rsquo;s purpose for His people was not merely to defeat the enemies and take full possession of the land but for them to set up a kingdom. Because this purpose had not been fulfilled, the conclusion of Judges says, &ldquo;In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes&rdquo; (21:25). The children of Israel did whatever was right in their own eyes because there was no king or kingdom. What was needed at that time was for a kingdom to be set up.</p>
<p>Samuel was one who brought in the kingdom. First and 2 Samuel are crucial for the bringing in of the kingdom. In order for God to fulfill His intention to have an expression, He needed to have a kingdom. The kingdom of God is a sphere in which God is expressed. When the Lord taught His disciples how to pray, He began, &ldquo;Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come&rdquo; (Matt. 6:9-10). The New Testament opens with the Gospel of Matthew, which is the Gospel of the kingdom. In Matthew 3:2 John the Baptist declared, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.&rdquo; Many Christians today preach the gospel of a heavenly mansion, but the New Testament preaches the gospel of the kingdom (cf. 4:23; 9:35; 24:14). The gospel leads us to repent because God&rsquo;s kingdom requires our repentance.</p>
<p>God needs a kingdom so that He may have an expression. The children of Israel were brought out of Egypt and through the wilderness, where they built the tabernacle for God. Then they entered into the good land, and every tribe was allotted a portion of the land. In Judges the enemies were defeated to some extent so that the children of Israel could enjoy the good land. Nevertheless, there was no expression of God in Judges because there was no king. Everyone acted according to what was right in their own eyes. Therefore, at that time God needed a kingdom with a king.</p>
<p>In Judges God used Deborah. In 1 and 2 Samuel the first person God used to bring in His kingdom was another female, Samuel&rsquo;s mother, Hannah. She bore Samuel, who brought in the king with the kingdom. There is no book in the Old Testament called David; instead, the record of David is included in 1 and 2 Samuel. David was trained, called, anointed, and enthroned in 1 and 2 Samuel. Without David, 1 and 2 Samuel would be empty. The reality of Samuel was David. Samuel was for David, but without Samuel, there would have been no David. David was brought in and initiated into his position and function through Samuel, who was the issue of the desperate prayer of a female seeker of God.</p>
<p>Because of the miserable situation in Judges, there was an urgent and desperate need for one like Samuel. The vow of the Nazarite allowed those like Samuel who were not descendants of Aaron to become priests. Samuel was a Levite (1 Chron. 6:33-38), but he was not born into the priesthood, because he was not of the house of Aaron, the family of priests ordained by God. According to Joshua 21, the Levites were not allotted a particular portion of land; instead, the descendants of Levi were given land among the other tribes. Samuel&rsquo;s family lived in Ephraim (1 Sam. 1:1). Samuel was a Levite by birth and an Ephraimite by residence, but he was a Nazarite by consecration. Even before he was born, his mother consecrated him as a Nazarite to Jehovah (v. 11; cf. Num. 6:1-5). After he was born and weaned, his mother brought him to the house of God and left him in the care of Eli the priest. From his childhood Samuel wore the priests&rsquo; ephod (1 Sam. 2:18). Although he was not born a priest, he came into the priesthood by the vow of the Nazarite. Because God foresaw that the ordained priests, Eli and his sons, would not be faithful to the priesthood, God used the &ldquo;back door&rdquo; of the Nazarite vow to bring a faithful one into the priesthood.</p>
<p>Samuel was a Nazarite, a priest, a prophet, and a judge. This fourfold status qualified Samuel to be the one who could bring in the king and set up the kingdom. In order for such a one to be raised up and carry out his commission, there was a crucial need of the Divine Trinity. Only the Trinity could work this out. For this reason, in 1 and 2 Samuel there is a detailed, fine revelation of the Divine Trinity. What happened in Judges is somewhat rough, but in Samuel the application of the Divine Trinity is very fine.</p>
<p>First Samuel begins with a man named Elkanah who had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah (1:1-2). Elkanah loved Hannah more. However, Hannah had no children, while Peninnah had sons and daughters. This was the sovereign hand of the Lord. According to the Mosaic law, Elkanah went with his family every year to the house of God, the tabernacle, which was in Shiloh at that time, to worship and make offerings to Jehovah (v. 3). Whenever Elkanah sacrificed, he would give a double portion to Hannah since he loved her (v. 5). Because Jehovah had shut up Hannah&rsquo;s womb, she was forced to pray a desperate, consecrated, and consecrating prayer (vv. 10-12, 15). She prayed for a male child, whom she would not keep for herself but would give to the Lord for His need. Her prayer was for a son who would be a Nazarite from birth, one who would be absolute for the Lord. The Lord answered her prayer, and a son was born (v. 20). Hannah named her son Samuel, which means &ldquo;asked for of God,&rdquo; or &ldquo;heard of God.&rdquo; When we ask of God, He will hear our request. Samuel&rsquo;s mother asked for him of the Lord, and the Lord heard and answered her request.</p>
<p>From his childhood Samuel was a Nazarite, serving as a priest in the house of God (v. 24; 2:11, 18). While Samuel was staying with Eli in the temple, God appeared in a vision to Samuel (3:4-14). Samuel was still a boy, just as the Lord Jesus was when He went to Jerusalem with His parents (Luke 2:42). Eventually, Samuel became a renowned prophet and the judge of Israel (1 Sam. 3:20; 7:6). However, for Samuel to be a priest, a prophet, and a judge was not God&rsquo;s goal. God intended to set up a kingdom with a king. Therefore, God twice sent Samuel to anoint someone. First, he anointed Saul to be ruler over Israel (9:16; 10:1). Later, Samuel anointed David to be king (16:1, 13). David was brought in through Samuel. The crucial point in this history is that there was a need of the Divine Trinity.</p><h2 class="head1">THE APPLICATION OF THE CASE OF SAMUEL<br />
TO OUR PRESENT SITUATION</h2>
<p>Our present situation and God&rsquo;s need today are the same in principle as the situation and the need at the time of Samuel. Some today need to pray according to God&rsquo;s need, as Hannah did. God needs some like Samuel, who was a Nazarite, a priest, a prophet, and the last judge. Samuel was the last judge because God used him to terminate the confused situation among God&rsquo;s people, who were without a king or a kingdom. God needs such ones who are qualified to terminate the negative situation and bring in the king and the kingdom. The fulfillment of the kingdom is the coming kingdom, which will be brought in by the Lord Jesus, but there is a need today for some like Samuel to cooperate by bringing in that kingdom. In a sense, Christ our King is not here yet, and we are still in a confused situation, just as in the age of the judges. We should aspire to be the last judge. The sisters especially should aspire to be like Hannah, praying to bring forth some like Samuel, who will terminate the confused age so that Christ the King may come with His kingdom.</p>
<p>We need to realize how greatly the Divine Trinity is needed for this to be accomplished. In order for Hannah to pray such a prevailing prayer and receive a definite reply, she needed the tabernacle and the offerings, which typify Christ the Son as the embodiment of God and the reality of all the offerings. Similarly, in order for us to pray to meet God&rsquo;s need today, we need Christ as the embodiment of God and the reality of the offerings. We also need the fulfillment of the Tent of Meeting, which is the church as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Hannah did not pray her prevailing prayer in her home. We need God&rsquo;s embodiment and His full salvation in the church life. Then we can pray prevailing prayers for God&rsquo;s goal, to bring in the kingdom. This is the experience of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE BRINGING FORTH OF SAMUEL AND DAVID<br />
TO USHER IN THE KINGDOM</h2>
<p>First Samuel 1:3-7 says, &ldquo;This man [Elkanah] went up from his city year by year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh...When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed,...he would give a double portion to Hannah...So it happened year after year; when she went up to the house of Jehovah.&rdquo; Verses 10 through 11 say, &ldquo;She was bitter in soul and prayed to Jehovah and wept much. And she made a vow and said, O Jehovah of hosts,...give to Your female servant a male child.&rdquo; Verse 20 says, &ldquo;In due time Hannah conceived and bore a son; and she called his name Samuel.&rdquo; Verse 24 says, &ldquo;As soon as she weaned him, she brought him up with her, along with three bulls and one ephah of flour and a skin of wine; and she brought him to the house of Jehovah.&rdquo; In these verses the sacrifices typify Christ as all the offerings. Jehovah is the eternal great I Am, and the house of Jehovah is Christ as the embodiment of God to be God&rsquo;s dwelling place among His people. Furthermore, the bulls, flour, and wine signify the Christ whom we experience and bring to the house of God to offer to Him. This section mainly shows us the house of God as the embodiment of the Triune God and the offerings as the means for us to enter into the embodiment of God, that is, redemption. Therefore, in these verses we see God&rsquo;s embodiment and God&rsquo;s full redemption.</p>
<p>In the following verses we see the Spirit. First Samuel 19:20 says, &ldquo;Saul sent messengers to seize David; and when they saw the company of prophets prophesying and Samuel standing and presiding over them, the Spirit of God came upon Saul&rsquo;s messengers, and they also prophesied.&rdquo; Verse 23 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of God came upon [Saul] as well, and he went on and prophesied.&rdquo; Saul intended to arrest and kill David. It was not physical force but prophesying that stopped Saul&rsquo;s activity. Samuel was not commanding an army but was directing the prophesying. This was all the doing of the Spirit of God, who is the third of the Trinity reaching God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>Second Samuel 22:1-3 says, &ldquo;David spoke the words of this song to Jehovah...Jehovah is...my rock.&rdquo; Verse 47 says, &ldquo;Exalted be God, the rock of my salvation.&rdquo; Second Samuel 23:1-3 says, &ldquo;These are the last words of David...The Spirit of Jehovah spoke through me, / And His word was on my tongue. / The God of Israel spoke, / The Rock of Israel spoke to me.&rdquo; In these verses the rock is Christ as the ground for God to grace His people. The Spirit of Jehovah is the Spirit of the Triune God. God in these verses in Hebrew is <em>Elohim,</em> indicating the Triune God. Second Samuel 24:25 says, &ldquo;There David built an altar to Jehovah, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.&rdquo; The burnt offerings typify Christ for God&rsquo;s satisfaction, and the peace offerings typify Christ for the peace between God and His people.</p>
<p>In this portion of the Word we can see that the Triune God with His embodiment and redemption was fully involved in bringing forth Samuel and David so that the kingdom of God might be brought in. To bring in the kingdom of God is a great thing. Many Christians today speak of the Lord&rsquo;s coming, but most do not realize there is the need for some like Samuel to bring in Christ the King with His kingdom. Samuel brought in David so that the heavenly kingdom could be set up on the earth for God&rsquo;s expression. The Lord&rsquo;s prophecy of His return can be fulfilled only through some like Hannah and Samuel. Hannah brought in Samuel, and Samuel brought in David.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED<br />
IN THE ANOINTING OF SAUL</h2>
<p>First Samuel 10:1 says, &ldquo;Samuel took the vial of oil and poured it upon his [Saul&rsquo;s] head...and said, Jehovah anoints you ruler over His inheritance.&rdquo; Oil here typifies the Spirit of God, and Jehovah is the eternal One. Verses 6 through 10 say, &ldquo;The Spirit of Jehovah will rush upon you; and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man...For God is with you...I will come down to you to offer up burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings...God gave him [Saul] another heart...And when they came there to the hill, there was the group of prophets, coming to meet him. And the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied among them.&rdquo; First Samuel 11:6 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of God rushed upon Saul.&rdquo; As in the previous verses, the Spirit of Jehovah is the third of the Trinity reaching man, and <em>God</em> in Hebrew is <em>Elohim,</em> the Triune God. Similarly, the burnt offerings typify Christ for God&rsquo;s satisfaction, and the peace offerings typify Christ for the peace between God and His people. Christ as the offerings is for redemption. The Spirit of God is the Spirit of the Triune God. In order for Saul to be anointed as a ruler over God&rsquo;s people, there was the need of Christ&rsquo;s redemption and the Spirit. The Divine Trinity was involved in the anointing of Saul.</p>

IN THE ANOINTING OF DAVID</h2>
<p>First Samuel 16:1-3 says, &ldquo;Jehovah said to Samuel...Fill your horn with oil, and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have selected for Myself a king among his sons...Take a heifer with you...Then call Jesse to the sacrifice.&rdquo; Verse 13 says, &ldquo;Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him [David] in the midst of his brothers, and the Spirit of Jehovah rushed upon David from that day forward.&rdquo; This case is more positive, more subjective, and deeper than the record of Saul&rsquo;s anointing. In these verses we see the Triune God as Jehovah and the Spirit of the Triune God as the Spirit of Jehovah. The oil again typifies the Spirit of God. The sacrificed heifer typifies Christ as the offering. Thus, the Divine Trinity was involved in the anointing of David, making him the king over Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>First and 2 Samuel reveal that the bringing in of the king and the setting up of the kingdom depend on the involvement of the Divine Trinity with His people. The Triune God is still involved with us today. The Triune God, with His embodiment, His redemption, and His Spirit, is constituting us into useful persons for His coming and His kingdom. We must trust in the involvement, the work, of the Divine Trinity. If we see this, it will revolutionize our concept about what it means to be a Christian. Our natural, religious, cultural, moral, and ethical concepts concerning the Christian life need to be replaced with a vision of the fully involved Triune God.</p>
<p>When we see the involvement of the Divine Trinity with His people in the Old Testament, we will realize that the intrinsic structure of the Old Testament is exactly the same as that of the New Testament. The Divine Trinity as the intrinsic structure of the Word is especially evident in the Epistles of Paul. In 2 Corinthians 13:14 Paul writes, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; The book of Ephesians mentions the Trinity in every chapter and is thus constructed with the Divine Trinity as its basic structure (1:3-14; 2:18; 3:16-17a; 4:4-6; 5:18-20; 6:10-11, 17). As we read the Word, we need to see the Divine Trinity as the intrinsic structure.</p></body></html>
