<h2 class="head2">Living in the Anointing</h2>
<p>We can also examine our condition by asking, &ldquo;Are we learning to live in the anointing every day; have we surrendered to the inner anointing?&rdquo; This is not a matter of listening to messages. If we love the Lord, we will give ourselves over to the inner anointing and live in the anointing all day long. This is the way to have genuine growth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning Lessons through Our Circumstances</h2>
<p>Finally, we can examine our condition by asking, &ldquo;Are we learning spiritual lessons through the circumstances in our daily living?&rdquo; We must learn lessons from the circumstances that we encounter in our environment. This is the way to have genuine growth in life. I hope that we would answer these three questions before God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Heart<br />
Not Being the Same as Having Love</h2>
<p><em>Question: Is having a heart for the Lord equivalent to loving Him?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Having a heart is not equivalent to having love. We often say, &ldquo;So-and-so still has a heart for the Lord.&rdquo; This is not clear. Let me ask, &ldquo;Do you have the heart to eat every day?&rdquo; This is a strange question, because if we needed to have a heart in order to eat, we would starve to death. We eat whether or not we have the heart to eat. Suppose I ask, &ldquo;Is So-and-so attending a university?&rdquo; You should tell me whether or not he is attending a university. There is no need to say that he has the heart to attend a university. If he has the heart to attend a university, he should be at a university. Or I may ask, &ldquo;Are those two people engaged?&rdquo; If you reply, &ldquo;They have the heart to be engaged,&rdquo; then I would ask, &ldquo;Why are they not engaged if they have the heart to be engaged?&rdquo; Likewise, with regard to a person&rsquo;s condition before the Lord, when we are reluctant to say whether or not a person loves the Lord, we speak of him as having a heart for the Lord. This indicates that having the heart is not equivalent to having love.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Acknowledging and Confessing</h2>
<p><em>Question: In the past I sensed the presence of my flesh and the mixture within me, and I often confessed my sins, asking the Lord to deliver me. Later I heard that we are already dead and do not need to confess our sins. Is this correct?</em></p>
<p>Answer: To confess our sins is to deal with the sins that we have committed. If a sin has been committed, it needs to be confessed. If we have not committed a sin, yet we see our corruption, then we need acknowledgment, not confession. If in the light we see that our corrupted flesh has already been nailed to the cross, we need only to praise the Lord. In contrast, if we commit a definite sin, it is not sufficient merely to say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord.&rdquo; We must confess our sin before God and before man; we must confess the actual sins that we have committed. However, regarding our corrupt nature, we need only to acknowledge it and receive the work of the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living, Not Leading,<br />
Being the Emphasis of the Anointing</h2>
<p><em>Question: When we have doubts about whether something is of the Lord, should we stop or continue?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The things that are necessary in our daily living should be taken care of according to common sense; as long as we lack a sense of prohibition, we may do them. We need the inner leading for special matters. However, the teaching of the anointing does not emphasize leading. Many people incorrectly understand the teaching of the anointing merely as leading. The anointing is not merely a matter of whether or not we should do a certain thing; rather, it is for us to live in the anointing and to do everything according to the anointing.</p>
<p>As soon as the anointing is mentioned, people understand it as leading. This is the influence of Christianity. For example, if I want to write a letter, I ask the anointing to teach me whether or not I should write the letter. This is an erroneous concept. The anointing is not a fortuneteller, who previously had nothing to do with us but now tells us whether what we are about to do is good or bad. The proper situation is to live in the anointing so that the anointing becomes our life, just like the feelings of our body. For example, when we taste sugar, we immediately sense sweetness, and when we taste vinegar, we sense sourness. We do not need to ask the anointing to be our fortuneteller and tell us whether what we are about to do is right or wrong. We must live in the anointing so that when we &ldquo;taste something,&rdquo; we will immediately sense whether it is sweet or sour.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Exercise</h2>
<p><em>Question: What should we do in order to live in the anointing practically?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We need to exercise. For example, we may say that we want to consecrate ourselves to the Lord because we love Him. However, to say that we want to consecrate ourselves to the Lord is vague; we need to know where the Lord is. The expression <em>give ourselves to the Lord</em> is doctrine. In our experience, it means to give ourselves to the inner anointing and to the discipline in our environment. How should I respond when a brother gives me a long face? Can I give thanks and praise the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, this long face is from You. I give myself to You&rdquo;?</p>
<p>In terms of experience, to love the Lord and to give ourselves to Him mean to submit to the inner anointing and to our outward circumstances. We live in the anointing, and we also accept our circumstances. We know the Lord in the anointing, and we also know Him in our circumstances. Then in our experience the Lord will lead us to know when we are in the self, when we are natural, and when we are living in the old creation. He will lead us to know the meaning of resurrection and the cross. Furthermore, He will lead us to know the power of resurrection and to be conformed to His death (Phil. 3:10). When we do not care for the inner anointing, the discipline of the Holy Spirit may become necessary. The circumstances in our environment are coordinated with the anointing in order to break us and to expose us so that we know how much we are still in the self. If we desire to grow in life, this must be a daily exercise.</p>
