   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ELDERSHIP BEING ORGANIC</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The leading ones' care for the church is not an organizational matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church is not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is God's family, God's household Eph 2:19; Gal 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the elders should be the teaching fathers and the nourishing mothers 1 Thes 2:7, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the way to take care of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is altogether an organic matter, not organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The term elder also indicates something organic, something of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>An elder is a person who is mature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To see more concerning the organic service in the Body of Christ, let us read 1 Corinthians 12:28: "And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Administrations refers to the eldership in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Helps refers to the services of the deacons and deaconesses 1 Tim 3:8-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Administrations and helps are listed with apostles, with prophets, with teachers, and with works of power, healing, and tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This proves that both the helps by the deacons and the administration by the elders are not organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we need to read 1 Corinthians 12:4-7: "But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distinctions of ministries, yet the same Lord; and there are distinctions of operations, but the same God, who operates all things in all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for what is profitable."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word distinctions in these verses can also be translated as distributions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These verses are a summary and a governing word of the whole chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of course, they govern verse 28, which lists administrations and helps.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to our natural thought, the government of the church has nothing to do with the distribution of gifts by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But 1 Corinthians 12 tells us clearly that even the service of the deacons as helps and the function of the elders as administrations are distributions of gifts by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This has to be something of the Spirit organically, not something of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many years ago, I considered that the administration by the elders was not a gift from the Spirit, but later I received the light to see that it is a gift from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since this is the case, it has to be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The spiritual gifts are of two categories the miraculous gifts and the gifts of life given according to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Romans 12:6 speaks of the gifts of life given according to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These gifts are the issue of the development of our spiritual function in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1 Corinthians 12:28 Paul puts the gifts of life and the miraculous gifts together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Helps and administrations are gifts of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since they are gifts, they are something of the Spirit, and they are organic.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Romans 12:8 Paul refers to taking the lead as a gift according to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This refers to the elders in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To lead in the church is to administrate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may consider that the administration of the church is not of any gift, not of life, or not of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may think that it is altogether a positional, organizational matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But Romans 12 tells us that to lead, to administrate, to function as an elder in the church, is one of the gifts given according to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that the leading of the elders is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is by life and not organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These three words eldership, administration, and lead are misunderstood by Christians as something organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After much study of the Word, we can see that they are not organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They are organic.</S>
