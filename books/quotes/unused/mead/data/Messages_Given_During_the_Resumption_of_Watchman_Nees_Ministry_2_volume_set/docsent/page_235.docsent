   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Everything Done</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Fellowship of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and for the Benefit of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The brothers and sisters should know that their future, their jobs, occupations, dwellings, businesses, possessions, and everything that forms a part of their living should be put in the fellowship of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Formerly, one could make decisions on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now, if he is to take the service of God as his center, everyone has to take one great step forward.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From now on, no one can make his own decisions or do things his own way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many enterprises and occupations do not render much help to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The responsible brothers will ask you to change these occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What we do must be of maximum benefit to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>CONCERNING MONEY</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning money, we have the following fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the coming days, many brothers and sisters will have to leave their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Shanghai, we have asked two sisters and two brothers to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother Hsia Hsi-ling has been working in the customs department for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are asking him to leave that job.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In addition, perhaps twenty to thirty brothers and sisters will also have to hand themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps we will need fifty or sixty brothers and sisters to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If they give up their jobs and offer up themselves full-time, their support will be on the shoulders of you brothers who are holding jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During the past twenty years, we have not mentioned the matter of money.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This platform can testify for me concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But today, we are going into business as partners and preaching the gospel as partners.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this reason, the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should work conscientiously, and they should do their best to make money as well as to save money.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today we stand on a different ground, and that is why we are not afraid to say something and do something.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today I can pass around my hat to ask money for a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If some have misunderstood what we have said and are no longer willing to offer up everything, you can claim back your consecration slip from Brother Witness after the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is no need to be shy and no need to be ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not force anyone to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But when the brothers come together to discuss matters, and when a decision has been reached, you cannot draw back.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today, we are not asking you to save money to such an extent that you will suffer in your physical health.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not asking for one-tenth, or one-half, or one-hundredth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are asking you to offer up all you have besides what you need to spend.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you make ten million dollars a month, and you need all ten million, you do not have to offer a cent. If you make only eight million, the church will gladly give up two million to make up enough to meet your need.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if you make eleven million, you can only keep the ten million that you need, and you have to offer up the remaining one million.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you make a hundred million, then the ninety million will all have to be offered up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you do not do this, you owe these brothers who are giving up their jobs something.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to learn to bear the responsibility of the gospel together with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only by doing this will the gospel spread, and only then will we be able to go on in the way before us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>FOUR THINGS CONCERNING THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Concerning the future of the work, there are a few things that we have to pay attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order for God's work in China to be carried out properly, four things are indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first is that strong messages need to be delivered in the local meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The second is that the literature work needs to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The third is the need to perfect the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The fourth is the need for joint conferences everywhere yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If any of these four things are lacking, our work will not be covered adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Shanghai and Foochow should maintain very strong message meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way, when a person wants to be perfected, he has to come to the church.</S>
