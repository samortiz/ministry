   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS OUR SALVATION BY DRINKING HIM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Most people do not consider that God's salvation is so subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most think of His salvation in an objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some think that they need the Lord Jesus to stretch out His hand to rescue them and pull them out of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, the Lord's salvation is absolutely not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we want the Lord to save us, we must drink Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The way to receive the processed Triune God as our salvation is by drinking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the water gets into us, it permeates our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The way that we get nourished, transformed, conformed, and glorified is by drinking Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the way to receive God as our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The source of this water is a fountain, which is immeasurably deep and wide, and this fountain has many springs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The springs at Niagara Falls are not drinkable because they are too great and fierce, but Jesus is a gentle spring.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the ancient times in the Middle East, people would go to a spring where there was a well from which they drew water for themselves and for others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can also come to the Lord to draw living water from Him for ourselves and for others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that the processed Triune God as our salvation is very subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The water that we drink passes through our entire being, is assimilated by us, and even becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In both the Old and New Testaments, water is used as an illustration of our Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the end of the Bible in Revelation 22, there is a picture of a throne, upon which the Lamb-God is sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Out from the throne underneath the Lamb, flows the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this river grows the tree of life, and this river passes through the entire holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The river actually spirals down from the throne in the middle of the golden street to water the whole city.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every part of the city is nourished and watered by this river.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a full picture of the Triune God to be our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every day we need to drink Him.</S>
