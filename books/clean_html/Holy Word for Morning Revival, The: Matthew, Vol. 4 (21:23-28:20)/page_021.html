<p class="bold">WEEK 18 — DAY 6</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 25:35-41, 46</h2><p class="bold">35 &nbsp;For I was <sup>1</sup>hungry and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me a drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in,</p> <p class="bold">36 &nbsp;Naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.</p><p class="bold">37 &nbsp;Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, Lord, when have we seen You hungry and have fed You, or thirsty and have given You a drink?</p> <p>38 &nbsp;And when have we seen You a stranger and have taken You in, or naked and have clothed You?</p> <p>39 &nbsp;And when have we seen You sick or in prison and have come to You?</p><p class="bold">40 &nbsp;And the King will answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you have <sup>1</sup>done it to one of <sup>2</sup>these, the least of My brothers, you have done it to <sup>3</sup>Me.</p> <p>41 &nbsp;Then He will say also to those on the left, Go away from Me, you who are cursed, into the <sup>1</sup>eternal fire <sup>2</sup>prepared for the devil and his angels.</p><p>46 &nbsp;And these shall go away into eternal <sup>1</sup>punishment, but the <sup>2</sup>righteous <sup>3</sup>into eternal life.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>35<sup>1</sup> All the sufferings in vv. 35-39 will befall the believers who are left to be tried (Rev. 3:10 and note 2) during the great tribulation (24:21).</p><p>40<sup>1</sup> This will happen in the great tribulation, when the believers suffer the persecution of Antichrist (Rev. 13:6-7; 20:4).</p><p>40<sup>2</sup> These should refer to the believers who overcome the persecution of Antichrist (Rev. 15:2 and note 2). They will be with Christ at this judgment.</p><p>40<sup>3</sup> Christ is one with the believers, who are His members, as indicated in Acts 9:4.</p><p>41<sup>1</sup> The fire in the lake of fire (Rev. 20:14-15). The “goats” will perish in the lake of fire, after Antichrist and the false prophet (Rev. 19:20) and before the devil and the resurrected sinners (Rev. 20:10, 15). This is part of the fulfillment of Rev. 14:10.</p><p>41<sup>2</sup> The lake of fire was prepared for the devil and his angels, not for man. However, if any man follows the devil in opposing the Lord, he will share the lake of fire with the devil and the fallen angels.</p><p>46<sup>1</sup> This is to perish in the lake of fire (v. 41).</p><p>46<sup>2</sup> So that the believers left on earth will be cared for during Antichrist’s persecution, an eternal gospel will be preached to the nations (Rev. 14:6-7 and notes), as illustrated by the parable of the net in [Matt.] 13:47-50. The Lord will then judge the nations not according to the law of Moses or the gospel of Christ, but according to the eternal gospel. This is a matter of God’s dispensation. Those who obey that gospel and treat the suffering believers well will be blessed and reckoned as righteous and will inherit the kingdom (Matt. 25:34); but those who do not will be cursed (v. 41) and will perish for eternity.</p><p>46<sup>3</sup> The gospel of grace (Acts 20:24) brings eternal life into the believers (John 3:15-16) that they may live by God’s life, whereas the eternal gospel brings the “sheep” into eternal life that they may live in the sphere of God’s life.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>In the kingdom of God as the sphere of God’s administration, there is the need for three kinds of people: the priests, the kings, and the people or the citizens. The prophecy concerning the kingdom given by the Lord on the Mount of Olives concerns God’s economy to bring in His kingdom.… The nation of Israel is like a woman in travail to deliver the remnant of Jews who will be the priests during the millennium [Zech. 8]....They will teach all the nations to serve God....The believers, covered in the second section of this prophecy, will be the kings, and the citizens will be taken from among the nations. How wise the Lord is, including all of God’s economy in a prediction just two chapters long!
