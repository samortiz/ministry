[2]  This book is composed of gospel messages given by Brother Watchman Nee in Tientsin in 1936.
[3]  Appendix One, entitled "Towards the Church," was included in an earlier English edition of The Normal Christian Faith as Chapter Sixteen.
[4]  We will look at the Christian faith from its very foundation.
[5]  The first subject we are confronted with is God.
[6]  As a prosecutor I ask you first to check the qualification of these people.
[7]  Many people are not really convinced that there is no God; they merely hope so.
[8]  I then said to the young man, "And here you are!
[9]  You have not even walked through the whole earth, and yet you consider yourself greater than the whole universe.
[10]  Let me ask you, do you know how vast the universe is?
[11]  Some will immediately step back and say, "I have never said that I know there is no God.
[12]  One can never tell whether there is a God or not."
[13]  Well, if you cannot give a conclusion, I will ask witnesses whom I consider trustworthy to present arguments to you and prove the existence of God.
[14]  What are the characteristics of things that come about by chance?
[15]  Once I was preaching the gospel with a co-worker of mine in a village.
[16]  Do we have any desires other than social identity and self-propagation?
[17]  Deep in everyone there is a craving for God.
[18]  Once a missionary to South America saw a man preaching before a crowd in an open space in a forest.
[19]  The man forcefully and vehemently denied the existence of God.
[20]  With enthusiasm he gave more than ten reasons, one after another, to prove the nonexistence of God.
[21]  Once I went with a few brothers to a village to preach.
[22]  Many people there said, "Our god is most powerful; he is called Dah-wang i.e., the Great King .
[23]  I shall begin by assuming that the issue of God's existence is settled.
[24]  As those who desire to know the truth, we must go one step further to find out what kind of God He is.
[25]  There are two kinds of religion: religion based on natural concepts and religion based on revelation.
[26]  He is the one that is seeking after God and studying about Him.
[27]  If there is a book written by God, it must first of all mention God.
[28]  It must tell you that it is from God and that its author is God.
[29]  After searching through all the books, you have to come finally to the Bible.
[30]  If God desires to communicate with man, and if He does so through writing, then this is the only book that can pass the four tests.
[31]  If you read this book carefully, you have to admit that God's hand is behind all the writings.
[32]  More than thirty people of varied backgrounds and ideas in different times and places wrote these sixty-six books.
[33]  This book seems to be very simple and easy.
[34]  If you consider it from the historical point of view, it tells the origin of the universe, the earth, the plants, human beings, how they established their kingdoms, and how they will eventually end. This is all.
[35]  I wanted to tell them, "Little birds, I have no special intention in doing this.
[36]  We will set down these five conditions and put the whole of humanity to the test.
[37]  Let us find out if someone meets the five requirements.
[38]  Such a person would surely be qualified to be God.
[39]  Of course, you are not God, because you have never claimed to be God.
[40]  Let us read John 3:31-32: "He who comes from above is above all; he who is from the earth is of the earth and speaks out of the earth.
[41]  What He has seen and heard, of this He testifies, and no one receives His testimony."
[42]  Read carefully John 14:6-7: "Jesus said to him, I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him." It says clearly that if you know Jesus of Nazareth, you have known the invisible God.
[43]  CHAPTER FOUR GOD BECOMING MAN 2 THE BIRTH OF JESUS
[44]  If God is to be a man, He must come into the world in a way that is very different from all other mortals.
[45]  We come into the world through our parents and are conceived by our mothers.
[46]  To ascertain whether Jesus of Nazareth is an ordinary person or the incarnated God, we need to examine His birth.
[47]  On the same day, their opponent gave the rebuttal.
[48]  Let me briefly mention a few of his arguments.
[49]  Perhaps we should read the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew.
[50]  Every philosopher or founder of religion, at one time or another, has said, "I repent," or "I regret such and such a matter.
[51]  One day He came to the synagogue in His hometown.
[52]  The fourth qualification we mentioned is that one who claims to be God incarnated must be able to perform what an ordinary person cannot.
[53]  In John 14:11 He said to His disciples, "Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me."
[54]  This is the same as saying that He is the invisible Father.
[55]  Our Christian faith is based upon the revelation of God.
[56]  From its outset, Christianity is built on the man Christ.
[57]  Since this is a crucial question related to our basic faith, we have to find the answer in the Bible.
[58]  We will pay more attention to the Gospel of John and discover that only Christ Himself is the center of the Bible and the focus of the whole of Christianity.
[59]  Prior to the coming of Christ, a forerunner was sent by God to prepare a way for Christ that men might be ready to acknowledge Christ.
[60]  Besides regeneration, there is another crucial matter, which we call Christian satisfaction.
[61]  A genuine Christian feels that his hopes are fulfilled, his aspirations attained; he has no want; he is absolutely satisfied.
[62]  "The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet" v. 19 . Because Christ told her everything that she ever did, she perceived that this was no ordinary man.
[63]  Jesus said something more to show her that He was not merely a prophet: "Believe Me" v. 21 . The woman said, "I know that Messiah is coming He who is called Christ ; when He comes, He will declare all things to us" v. 25 . What did Jesus answer her? He said, "I, who speak to you, am He" v. 26 . The first thing that a sinner needs to do is not to repent and change his behavior, but to realize who Jesus is.
[64]  Is this not the Christ?" v. 29 . I do not like the words, "Is this not." Since she knew that this man was the Christ, why did she say, "Is this not"? At any rate, she believed and went to tell others that Christ had come.
[65]  John 6:51: "I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world."
[66]  Further on in John 8:12, Jesus told the crowd, "I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
[67]  You can see that again His words are not doctrinal.
[68]  It is to bring man to believe that He is the Son of God.
[69]  He asked the healed person only one question: "Do you believe into the Son of God?" v. 35 . He answered, "Who is He, Lord, that I may believe into Him?" v. 36 . "Jesus said to him, You have both seen Him, and He is the One speaking with you.
[70]  We have said that Christianity does not emphasize doctrines.
[71]  Another very important doctrine in the Bible concerns death.
[72]  The Bible depicts man as being totally corrupted, without any possibility of being reformed.
[73]  HE IS THE WAY, THE REALITY, AND THE LIFE
[74]  Once when Christ Jesus was about to leave the world, He spoke of a very amazing doctrine.
[75]  Of course, this doctrine is again closely related to Him.
[76]  Verse 17: "For if by the offense of the one death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ."
[77]  Because of Jesus Christ, the grace and gift of God can be bestowed upon all men.
[78]  Romans 8:1: "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus."
[79]  First Corinthians 1:30: "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption."
[80]  Not only so, God has made Christ our wisdom,...etc. We think that though we are not too brilliant, if we study more books, read more of the Bible, and listen to more sermons, we will be more intelligent.
[81]  First Corinthians 4:17: "Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church."
[82]  You will discover that not only here, but in numerous passages, it is mentioned that the Christian walk should be one that is in Christ.
[83]  Verses 16-17: "And knowing that a man is not justified out of works of law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we also have believed into Christ Jesus that we might be justified out of faith in Christ and not out of the works of law, because out of the works of law no flesh will be justified.
[84]  Galatians 2:20 is another precious verse: "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me."
[85]  I did not kill myself; I was crucified with Him.
[86]  When He died on the cross, I died also, because I am in Him.
[87]  Ephesians 1:3: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ."
[88]  Verses 4-7: "Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love, predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved; in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace."
[89]  We have seen that one cannot separate Christ from truth or from the doctrines.
[90]  Nor can He be isolated from the Christian faith.
[91]  Now we can turn to chapter seven of the book of Hebrews.
[92]  Let us first read verses 1 through 10: "For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all; first being interpreted king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace; being without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually.
[93]  How does the Bible view the fall of mankind?
[94]  It shows us that due to the unity of men, when the first man Adam sinned, all sinned in him, although none were yet born.
[95]  Even if I had never sinned from the day I was born, God would ask from whom I came.
[96]  Because the Bible regards the whole of humanity as two men, we will not be surprised if we read 1 Corinthians 15:45 and 47: "So also it is written, 'The first man, Adam, became a living soul'; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit....The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second man is out of heaven."
[97]  Romans 5:15 follows, by saying, "But it is not that as the offense was, so also the gracious gift is; for if by the offense of the one the many died, much more the grace of God and the free gift in grace of the one man Jesus Christ have abounded to the many."
[98]  If, through the sin of Adam, all became dead, then when Jesus Christ was made righteousness, grace abounded much more to everyone!
[99]  Every religion makes some contribution to the well-being of society.
[100]  Every one of them has a point in common: giving man something or bringing man towards some goal.
[101]  A CHANGE OF BEHAVIOR FOLLOWS A CHANGE OF LIFE
[102]  Suppose that a person is very interested in the research of small animals.
[103]  He wants very much to see a bird swim.
[104]  Based on this realization, man begins to think of ways to change his mode of living.
[105]  I believe that trying to improve our human behavior is just like cleaning the faces of those dolls.
[106]  We think that if we rid ourselves of our proud attitude and all our lies and behave in a more refined way, we will be a better person.
[107]  I know a lady who is very good-tempered.
[108]  We still need to look at the Scripture to understand the matter of regeneration.
[109]  First Corinthians 2:14: "But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually."
[110]  CHRIST AND THE NEW LIFE CHAPTER NINE FORGIVENESS OF SINS
[111]  Many people have an erroneous concept concerning this matter.
[112]  When we sin, our conscience also does not let us go.
[113]  Sometimes when the conscience is hushed, we do not sense too much guilt.
[114]  This does not mean that God does not have the power to forgive sins, but it means that God can only grant forgiveness when it comes up to His dignity.
[115]  Once a man argued with me concerning this point.
[116]  He said, "Mr. Nee, if God wants to forgive our sins, why can He not just say so? Why did He have to send His Son to be crucified on the cross? This is too cumbersome!" He thought that God is a nice fellow who writes off our sins unscrupulously without any concern for the law! He did not realize that God had to go through many steps before He could issue forgiveness.
[117]  We have to realize that Christ is a man.
[118]  God looked at Christ as a man and included all of us in Him.
[119]  Hence, God has judged us in Christ and also forgiven us in Christ.
[120]  Romans 3:25-26: "Whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred, with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus."
[121]  This portion of the Scripture is not easily understood.
[122]  It is true that God is full of grace, but you do not have to be saved by His grace.
[123]  The grace of God is based upon His love towards us.
[124]  We will select a few more passages to see how Christ accomplished redemption for us.
[125]  Romans 5:6-8: "For while we were yet weak, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
[126]  But God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
[127]  There is a hymn which well describes the joy of this salvation:
[128]  The highest goal in the salvation of God is the dispensing of His life into man.
[129]  Not only are we unable to change it; even God cannot change it.
[130]  One time I was at the home of one of my friends.
[131]  He had a maid who gave him much trouble.
[132]  Not only in Romans, but other places in the Bible say that we are crucified with Christ.
[133]  Galatians 2:20 says, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."
[134]  It is no longer I who live, because the "I" has been crucified with Christ on the cross.
[135]  We have seen that by including us in Christ, God accomplished redemption.
[136]  This identification with Christ is purely the work of God.
[137]  In other words He is God clothed with humanity.
[138]  If God had not clothed Himself with flesh, He could never have accomplished redemption.
[139]  If you asked me whether I would like to see Christ walking today in the flesh in the manner that the twelve disciples knew, I would tell you a strong no. This would be absolutely useless to me! If Jesus of Nazareth were here today, He would be isolated.
[140]  I write a great deal, yet my handwriting is not very good.
[141]  The reason is probably due to my failure in early years to learn the art properly.
[142]  Please note the pronouns in verses 17 and 18.
[143]  Verse 17 says that "He" shall be in you, while verse 18 says that "I" am coming to you.
[144]  Let us read verses 19 and 20: "Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.
[145]  In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."
[146]  The goal of this is that the believers may know that "I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you," that a full and perfect union may be realized.
[147]  Only in that day would we know the oneness of having Christ in the Father, us in Christ, and Christ in us.
[148]  This union moreover transmits to us everything that God did in Christ and everything that God is through Christ.
[149]  When did Peter begin to know Christ in such a clear way?
[150]  Unless Christ is in the Holy Spirit and unless He comes into us, we can never know Him in a real way.
[151]  Now we come to the critical point of the Christian faith; it is the peak of the salvation of God.
[152]  We want to see how Christ can be our life in a subjective way.
[153]  In order that we may know and contact Him, God was incarnated to become a man.
[154]  But receiving the forgiveness of sins merely recovers us back to the state before Adam's fall.
[155]  He was just a man, and his life was merely a human life at the proper level.
[156]  But God intends to give His only begotten Son to us so that we may receive eternal life.
[157]  John 3:7 says, "You must be born anew."
[158]  First John 5:12 says, "He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life."
[159]  Verse 13 continues, "I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God."
[160]  John 3:16 should be read with 1:12 of the same book.
[161]  John 3:16 tells us that God gave His only begotten Son to man, and 1:12 says, "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name."
[162]  A brother told me, "I have believed in the Son of God to be my life.
[163]  CHRIST AND THE CHRISTIAN CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE MEANING OF FAITH
[164]  A Christian is a person who has received Christ and His great salvation.
[165]  If we read through this verse casually, we may think that we understand the definition of faith.
[166]  Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.
[167]  But when we think about this definition carefully, we will find that it does not lead us much of anywhere.
[168]  If we merely exercise our five senses, we have to conclude that God does not exist, that there is no Christ, and that neither forgiveness of sins nor redemption of sinners is substantial, that there is no such thing as a new life, and that all spiritual matters are mere fantasies.
[169]  He has also put Christ into the Holy Spirit so that everyone can henceforth enjoy Him anywhere and anytime.
[170]  A few years ago, an Italian warship was anchored off Gibraltar.
[171]  In the evening all the sailors went on shore to gamble, drink, and cause trouble.
[172]  If a man has not believed in Christ, nothing will happen to him.
[173]  But once he believes, everything in Christ will come into him.
[174]  We have mentioned the resurrection of Christ and shown how we can receive a new life in this resurrection.
[175]  But there is another crucial matter which has decisive bearing upon our Christian life.
[176]  The Spirit of God gave the answer through the words of Paul: "The law entered in alongside that the offense might abound" Rom 5:20 .
[177]  He said, "How difficult it is for those who have riches to go into the kingdom of God.
[178]  The commandments of Christ can only be fulfilled by Christ Himself.
[179]  Hence, the answer to our second question is that only the Son of God can fulfill the requirements of God.
[180]  Hebrews 8:8-9 says, "For finding fault with them He says, 'Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah, not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.'"
[181]  How did God establish His covenant with the children of Israel?
[182]  Hebrews 8:10 and 11 say, "For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me. And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them."
[183]  Once I was invited to dinner at a missionary's home.
[184]  We sat and talked for a long time concerning this matter.
[185]  I asked him, "Can you say that you have overcome all your sins?"
[186]  A friend asked me once, "I have believed in Jesus Christ and received forgiveness of sins through His redemption.
[187]  Now that I am saved, what should my attitude be towards my country, towards society, and towards international problems?
[188]  What should our attitude be as Christians towards all these problems?
[189]  In the midst of all these debates and arguments, where should Christians stand?
[190]  First, we have to see that God has already prepared the solution to all these problems.
[191]  You may jump at me immediately, saying, "Are we going to ignore society and betray our country?
[192]  Are we going to overlook things while races are being oppressed, nations are being harassed, and classes are being exploited?"
[193]  The function of salt is to preserve dead objects from turning stale and stinky.
[194]  They asked whether or not it was right to pay tax to Caesar.
[195]  If a Christian does not know the order of God's work, and if he gives up the work of evangelism to engage himself in social and political reforms, the result is not merely a matter of right or wrong, it is a dead-end street.
[196]  All the problems of today are caused by man being out of order.
[197]  The Lord said that there will be an end to this world.
[198]  What will happen at the end of the world?
[199]  In the last century, there was a British woman politician named Christobel Pankhurst.
[200]  Some people think that as long as one is a Christian, it is good enough; there is no need to be part of a church.
[201]  Putting it another way, they want Christ but they do not want the church.
[202]  There are many big revelations in the book of Ephesians which relate to the church.
[203]  In chapter two we see one of them the church is the habitation of God.
[204]  What God has been desiring for a long time is a habitation, or a dwelling place.
[205]  We have to realize that the life we received is perfect but not complete.
[206]  The causes of the present confusion and divisions among churches can be summarized into the following categories:
[207]  But the Bible gives a clear and simple word concerning the matter of the church.
[208]  If you read the Acts of the Apostles or the beginning of all the Epistles or the first chapter of Revelation, you can see what the Bible calls the churches.
[209]  A church can only be named after its locality.
[210]  APPENDIX TWO THERE IS A GOD Scripture Reading: Psa 14:1; Heb 11:6; Rom 3:19-20
[211]  This afternoon we will speak on a difficult subject.
[212]  In fact it may be quite hard to speak on such a subject.
[213]  I must admit that this is the second time in my life that I have spoken of this subject.
[214]  It is the part of man's psychological makeup which controls his wants, likes, and dislikes, his preferences and aversions, and his pleasures and displeasures.
[215]  Some people do not want God; they dislike God.
[216]  Since they prefer not to have God, they say that there is no God.
[217]  I do not know if anyone can be so bold as to say that there is no God in the universe.
[218]  But let us set this question aside for now.
[219]  The above examples are merely objective proofs of the existence of God.
[220]  Let us consider the question of God's existence from another angle: the psychological makeup of man.
[221]  We have seen the greatness and smallness of the universe, the order of the universe, and man's psychology, and pointed out that they all prove the existence of God in the universe.
[222]  We will now consider another aspect, which is the Christian experience of God.
[223]  It was so strange that on the night of the 9th, we received a promise, which was "Where is the God of Elijah?"
[224]  On the eve of the 11th, that is, the night of the 10th, we prayed again.
[225]  If it did not rain the next day, it would be impossible for us to preach the gospel to the ten thousand or more people in Plum Flower Village again, and the door of the gospel would be closed there.
[226]  We cannot go away from this subject in a light way.
[227]  We have to ask, "If there is a God, what should we do?"
[228]  It is not enough to believe that there is a God.
