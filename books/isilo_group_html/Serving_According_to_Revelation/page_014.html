<p>We need to come forward to God and seek His shining so that we would see that all our problems are the result of our looseness. I hope that the responsible saints in every local church would be willing to be enlightened and judged by God and to condemn their looseness. If we would be willing to be enlightened and to condemn our looseness, we would see that our problems are unresolved because of our looseness. We know that we should read the Bible diligently, but we do not do so because of our looseness. We know that we should pray frequently, but we do not do so because of our looseness. We know that we need to be dealt with, but we do not go to the Lord because of our looseness. We know that we need to be broken, but we are not because of our looseness.</p>
<p>Because of our looseness, we cannot see the light, we miss opportunities to learn, we do not make progress, and we miss God and His grace. D. L. Moody once said that he never saw a lazy person be saved. I have never seen a loose person receive light or enjoy grace in a rich way. Many saints lack light and grace primarily because they are loose. They are satisfied with every situation. Everything is the same to them. If we are satisfied with any situation, we will lose God&rsquo;s light and grace. Then we have no way to go on.</p>
<p>Some people are habitually loose. They are loose in their daily living. They are loose when they read the Bible and pray. They are loose when following the inner sense and when bearing responsibilities. They are loose in everything that they do; looseness has become their habit. Such people cannot be strong Christians. They can only be casual Christians. If we want to be strong Christians and have a strong service, we must deal with our looseness. The Lord may want us to deal with the discord that exists between us and a brother, but we are so loose that we put off dealing with it for many days. If we would be a little stricter and condemn our looseness, the Lord would not let us go. He would shine on many things that need to be dealt with and on the problems that we need to address. We would be enlightened to see that our temper, flesh, disposition, boastfulness, and desire to be praised frustrate the gospel and hinder us from fulfilling our proper function in the church and from coordinating with other saints in the service. If we would be willing to condemn our looseness, we would be enlightened and delivered.</p>
<p>If we are willing to obey the light and condemn our looseness, we will receive more light. If we are willing to condemn our looseness, the Lord will expose our problems and remove the limitations. If we desire to meet God&rsquo;s need, we should go to Him and deal with our looseness. We should not be loose in dealing with our wrongdoings or shortcomings. While we are dealing with our wrongdoings and shortcomings, God&rsquo;s commission and our function will be manifested.</p>
<p>Our way to go on depends on our willingness to condemn our looseness. All our problems are the result of looseness. Dealing with our looseness is the only way out of our problems. We do not need spiritual prayers. We should simply ask the Lord to deal with our looseness. Instead of being loose with ourselves, we should, under the light of God&rsquo;s judgment, condemn all the looseness in our being. If we are willing to be strict and to deal with our looseness, God will shine in us and lead us in a strong way. Otherwise, we will have no way to advance.</p>
<p>If we do not judge, condemn, and deal with our looseness, how can the Spirit move or work among us, and how can His power and authority be manifested? If the responsible brothers do not condemn and deal with their looseness, how can the churches have a future? We need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy so that we would be willing to condemn and deal with our looseness.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Serving According to Revelation &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
