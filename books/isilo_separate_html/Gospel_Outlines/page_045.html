<h1 class="title">LOOK UNTO GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Isa. 45:22</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Man is separated from God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Because man fell, he is separated from God.</li>
	<li>To be separated from God means that man turns away from God, and forsakes Him, and then loses God&rsquo;s presence.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Man looks at things lower than himself
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When man forsakes God, his heart turns toward things other than God. These things include parents, wife, children, possessions, money, and job or profession. In conclusion, whatever is outside of God are things.</li>
	<li>When men turn to things, they pay their attention to them, and their hearts turn from God to things. All things are outside of God, and they are lower than man. Therefore, when man pays attention to things, he looks downward.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The anguish of man&rsquo;s separation from God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Outside of God, all things are death. All the anguish is a sign of death. All the anguish of man&rsquo;s life firstly shows that he is separated from God.</li>
	<li>In addition, the anguish foretells man&rsquo;s death.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God is man&rsquo;s salvation
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man has only one need&mdash;man needs God. All man&rsquo;s difficulties are due to the lack of God.</li>
	<li>Man&rsquo;s salvation is in God.</li>
	<li>God is waiting for man to receive Him.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The way to obtain salvation
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To obtain salvation is to accept God, because God is our salvation.</li>
	<li>God firstly was crucified on the cross for us. Secondly, He resurrected and ascended. Thirdly, today He is in the heavens waiting for men to accept Him as their Savior.</li>
	<li>When man accepts God, he must look up unto God. He must look up unto the God who died on the cross, look up unto the God who ascended, look up unto the God who sits in the heavenlies to be our Savior. No matter whether we speak of His death, His resurrection, or His sitting in the heavenlies, He is always above us. It is just the opposite of all the things outside of God. They are all beneath us. Therefore, when we accept Him, we must look up unto Him.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The result of looking up
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Sins are forgiven.</li>
	<li>We receive God as our life.</li>
	<li>We are saved from all anguish, including sin, death, judgment, and hell.</li>
	</ol></li>
