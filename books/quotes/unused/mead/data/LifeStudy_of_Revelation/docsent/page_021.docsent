   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE FIVE THE COMING AGAIN OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Most Christians hold the concept that the book of Revelation is a book of Christ s second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is absolutely correct to hold this concept because Revelation does cover the second coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, throughout the years, Christians have not been clear about the Lord s second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Due to this lack of clarity, there has been much disputing and wrangling about it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The revelation regarding Christ s second coming is not simple; rather, it is quite complicated and has several aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, it has been difficult for most Christians to understand thoroughly the Lord s coming again.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During the past century and a half, many books have been written, especially by the Brethren, about the second coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some of the leading teachers among the Brethren held different opinions about the Lord s coming back, and the first division between them was the result of these different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The so-called Brethren testimony was raised up in 1828 or 29 under the leadership of John Nelson Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Darby taught that Christ would come back before the great tribulation, while Benjamin Newton, another leading teacher, said that Christ would come back after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because these two great teachers held different opinions, there were many debates about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, this brought about the first division among the so-called Brethren between those under the leadership of Darby and those under the leadership of Newton.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I was associated with the Benjamin Newton group for seven and a half years during which time I learned all their teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They certainly had a strong ground for saying that the second coming of Christ would be after the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you read the best writings of all the great teachers during the past one hundred fifty years, you will find that some taught that Christ s coming would be before the tribulation and others taught that it would follow the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During the past century, the Lord raised up some careful students of the Word, such as G. H. Pember, Robert Govett, and D. M. Panton.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These men discovered that Christ s second coming is not a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They saw that, on the one hand, Christ will come back after the tribulation, but that, on the other hand, He will also come back before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These careful students of the Bible have supplied strong proof to substantiate the correctness of this view.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ s coming back has at least two aspects one before the tribulation and the other after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, these students of the Word also learned that the rapture of the saints will be of more than two categories.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that some saints will be raptured before the tribulation and others after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not react to such statements too hastily.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I reacted that way when I was young, but eventually I was subdued and convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible is not as simple as some think it is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this message, we shall consider the subject of Christ s coming again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We thank God for all the teachers of the Word who have gone before us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are grateful to them, and whatever we see, we see as those who are standing upon their shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we would understand the second coming of Christ, we must study the Bible and also read the books written by these great teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we shall be able to have a comprehensive view of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do this, we shall be fully convinced that Christ s coming has two aspects: the secret, private aspect and the open, public aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I. THE SECRET ASPECT A. Coming as a Thief</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In both Matthew and Revelation we see the secret aspect of Christ s coming again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Revelation 3:3 and 16:15 both tell us that Christ will come as a thief and that we should be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No thief comes openly or announces his coming.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we pointed out in a previous message, when the Lord comes as a thief, He will come to steal the precious things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Matthew 24:40 and 41, the Lord spoke of His secret coming, saying, Then shall two men be in the field; one is taken, and one is left.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Two women shall be grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus was very wise, using two brothers in the field and two sisters grinding at the mill as illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Apparently the two brothers are the same and the two sisters are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But suddenly one of the brothers and one of the sisters are taken.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After giving this illustration, the Lord said, Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But know this, that if the householder knew in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, you also, be ready, for the Son of Man comes in an hour that you think not vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>42-44 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As we are working, having no consciousness that Christ is coming, some of us will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since He is coming as a thief, we must be watchful.</S>
