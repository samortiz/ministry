<h2 class="head2">The Extent to Which a Christian<br />Should Submit to Earthly Government</h2><p>However, there is a limit to our submission. Should we obey all ordinances? We cannot pledge unqualified obedience to every ordinance of a government. We can only obey every party under God with qualifications. Only God is the object of our unqualified submission. If the law of a state clearly contradicts God's commandment, we cannot obey it. In Exodus Pharaoh ordered the midwives to kill all the male babies born of Hebrew women. Moses' mother and the midwife kept Moses out of their fear of Jehovah. The book of Hebrews praises them as examples of faith (11:23). In every circumstance we have to obey God's commandment. Daniel's three friends would not worship the image. Although they violated the king's order, God was pleased with them. They would not follow the order to worship the image, even when their lives were threatened with death. Darius forbade the people to pray to any of their gods. After Daniel found out about this law, he continued to pray with his face towards Jerusalem three times a day. In the end he was thrown into the lions' den, but God shut up the mouth of the lions. When a Christian is confronted by laws that contradict God's commandment, his only choice is to sacrifice himself; he has no other choice. In Matthew 2:13-14 Herod ordered all the babies under two years old be killed. Joseph could only run to Egypt with the child and His mother.</p><p>In Acts 5:29, when the Jewish elders and High Priest forbade the apostles from teaching in the name of the Lord, they replied, "It is necessary to obey God rather than men." Our obedience to men cannot go beyond our obedience to God. This word referred to the Jewish government. Sometimes we can only obey God, not men. Romans 13:1 says, "Let every person be subject to the authorities over him." We have two things: submission and obedience. One is a matter of attitude while the other is a matter of conduct. Romans speaks of the attitude, while Peter spoke of the conduct. It is wrong to obey men more than to obey God. In our attitude we should be absolute in submission to those in authority, but in conduct, our obedience is relative. Submission is absolute, while obedience is relative. If your father wants you to do something, you can refuse him. This is to disobey. In our attitude, however, we still have to be submissive. Christians should always be submissive in their attitude towards the government. But we cannot fully obey those laws that are in direct contradiction against God's commandments.</p><h2 class="head2">Christians Not Engaging in Revolutions<br />for Themselves</h2><p>A Christian must not engage in any revolution to advance his own cause. Our obedience is conditional, but our submission is unconditional. Our submission to God is unconditional, and our obedience to Him is also unconditional. While our submission to men is also unconditional, our obedience to them is conditional. We cannot oppose the government just because it touches our faith or persecutes us for its sake. Although we cannot obey it, we should still submit to our government unconditionally. We must never engage in any revolution for ourselves. Christians are basically men who stand for submission. We do not engage in revolutions. Except in matters related to our faith, Christians obey the government in everything. Today the Christian responsibility is to preach the gospel, to save sinners, and to satisfy man's spiritual needs. The world has its physical and psychological needs, and we must leave it to the worldly people to satisfy these needs. We live only for the spiritual things on earth. We do not fight or struggle. Except in matters related to faith, we should obey all governmental authority.</p>
