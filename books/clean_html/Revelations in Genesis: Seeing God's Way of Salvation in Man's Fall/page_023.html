<h2 class="head1">THE CAUSE OF MAN&rsquo;S FOURTH FALL</h2>
<p>We need to consider the cause of man&rsquo;s fourth fall. In each of the four falls there is a cause related to Satan and a cause related to man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Instigation of Satan</h2>
<p>On Satan&rsquo;s side, the cause of man&rsquo;s first fall was Satan&rsquo;s tempting of man by hiding himself in the serpent. The cause of the second fall was Satan&rsquo;s deception of man by hiding in man&rsquo;s will. The cause of the third fall was due to the mixing of evil spirits with man. The cause of the fourth fall was Satan&rsquo;s instigation of man to rebel against God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Rebellion of the Human Race</h2>
<p>On man&rsquo;s side, the cause of man&rsquo;s first fall was man&rsquo;s assumption of the headship. The cause of the second fall was man&rsquo;s acting according to his own will. The cause of the third fall was man&rsquo;s acting according to the flesh. The cause of the fourth fall was man&rsquo;s rebellion against God, his rising up to oppose God.</p>
<p>In the first fall mankind had not yet rebelled against God. At that time man committed sin, but he still had a heart that feared and revered God. Although man violated God&rsquo;s prohibition, he still feared God. In the second fall man was corrupted and became arrogant toward God, but his heart was still fearful of God. Although Cain sinned and was dealt with by God, Cain and his descendants still acknowledged God. Among his descendants, some had names that included the Hebrew root <em>el,</em> meaning &ldquo;God,&rdquo; indicating that they still acknowledged God&rsquo;s right and authority and were not rebellious toward God. Among Cain&rsquo;s descendants, one was named Mehujael, meaning &ldquo;opposed by God&rdquo; or &ldquo;smitten of God,&rdquo; and another was named Methushael, meaning &ldquo;man of God&rdquo; (Gen. 4:18). Even after the third fall of mankind, man still acknowledged God&rsquo;s right and authority. Although man was utterly corrupt in his morality individually, he did not rise up to oppose God collectively or to rebel against God&rsquo;s right and authority collectively. However, the fourth fall was not related to individual conduct or behavior; it was a collective rebellion to deny God&rsquo;s right and authority.</p>
<p>In considering the four falls of mankind, man&rsquo;s violation of God&rsquo;s prohibition in the first fall can be likened to making a mistake. In the second fall man committed an individual act of murder. In the third fall all the people on earth began to indulge in lusts, murder, and fornication. Although this process shows a continuing corruption, it still involves problems related only to individual behavior. However, in the fourth fall people conferred with one another to collectively rebel against God in heaven. In this fall mankind collectively rebelled to deny God&rsquo;s right and authority.</p>
<p>Satan instigated this fall because his intention when he rebelled was to overthrow God&rsquo;s authority. According to Isaiah 14:13-14, Satan said in his heart, &ldquo;I will ascend to heaven...I will exalt my throne...I will make myself like the Most High.&rdquo; Hence, the thought of overthrowing God&rsquo;s authority is entirely of the evil one, Satan. He wanted to overthrow God&rsquo;s throne, but he did not succeed. At the time of the fourth fall he imparted the thought of overthrowing God&rsquo;s authority into man, causing man to rise up collectively to oppose God&rsquo;s right and authority. At that time the people said, &ldquo;Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower whose top is in the heavens&rdquo; (Gen. 11:4). To have a tower with its top in the heavens was to set themselves against the heavens. They seemed to say, &ldquo;Since God is working to come down from heaven to the earth, we will work to go up from the earth to heaven.&rdquo; They opposed God to this extent, and their intention in building a tower was to make a name for themselves. God considered this fall as something that could no longer be tolerated. The previous three falls were related to the corruption of individual morality and behavior, which could be considered as falls on a smaller scale. The fourth fall, however, which involved the rebellion of mankind collectively, was a fall on a much larger scale.</p>
<p>The universe cannot be without authority, and the authority in the universe is God. Man was created by God and therefore should be under God&rsquo;s government and authority. However, in Genesis 11 the human race united together to deny God&rsquo;s authority collectively and to exalt man to the heavens. They attempted to build a tower with its top in the heavens. They said, &ldquo;Let us make a name for ourselves&rdquo; (v. 4), meaning that they intended to exalt man and put God aside. This was not an issue of individual morality or behavior but an issue of authority, an issue of collective rebellion. In God&rsquo;s eyes this was an extremely serious matter.</p>
<p>The fourth fall may be likened to a family with four children who at first are secretly disobedient to their father&rsquo;s forbidding word. Later, the eldest brother may hit his younger brothers, and still later, all four may create a mess by playing in the house. However, none of these acts are as serious as all four saying, &ldquo;Down with our father! Let us be the king!&rdquo; This is no longer merely a matter of disobeying the father&rsquo;s word, hitting younger brothers, or turning the house into a mess; it is a matter of collectively overthrowing the father&rsquo;s position, a matter of exalting themselves to the position of the father. This is a serious matter. By the fourth fall man had fallen to the uttermost. In the first three falls God still wanted to rescue man. With the fourth fall, however, God came down to see the city and the tower that the children of men had built (v. 5), and He said, &ldquo;Come, let Us go down and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another&rsquo;s speech&rdquo; (v. 7). God seemed to say, &ldquo;We have to go down and see what they are doing. Created mankind is attempting to overthrow Our authority; this is very serious. Come, let Us confound their language and scatter them.&rdquo; This shows that the fourth fall was the most serious fall.</p>
<p>In the first fall man assumed the headship; that is, man did not live according to his spirit. In the second fall man lived according to his own will, his own idea, that is, according to his soul. To act according to one&rsquo;s will or idea is to live according to the soul. Not only was Cain&rsquo;s murder of his brother Abel an issue of living according to the soul, but even his offering to God was an issue of his living according to the soul. In the third fall, man lived according to the flesh.</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s creation in the beginning, man should live according to the spirit, with the soul under the direction of the spirit, the body under the direction of the soul, and the spirit under the direction of God. In this way man and God can have a proper relationship. However, in the first fall man did not live according to the spirit but rather assumed the headship. In the second fall man lived according to the soul. In the third fall man fell into the flesh and lived according to the flesh. Thus, the more man fell, the more he fell from the inside to the outside.</p>
<p>The closer a person lives in relation to his deepest part, the spirit, the nobler he is. In contrast, the closer a person lives in relation to his flesh, the baser he is. The more a person lives according to his inward parts, the more virtuous he is, but the more he lives according to the lusts of his body, the more corrupt he is. Before the fall man had fellowship with God because he lived according to his innermost part, his spirit. He was honorable and noble. Man fell the first time because he failed to continue to live according to the innermost part, the central part, of his being. In effect, man fell from his innermost part into his soul to live according to the soul. This was man&rsquo;s first fall. When man fell yet again, he fell from his soul into the body, which became the flesh. The human body with Satan&rsquo;s sin became the flesh. The more a person lives in his flesh, the more he indulges in its lusts. The more a person comes under the control of his soul and then under the control of his body, the more corrupt he becomes. The Chinese sages speak of the bright virtue, which is man&rsquo;s conscience. By the time of the third fall, the function of man&rsquo;s conscience was made completely void, and man was living according to his flesh and indulging in its lusts.</p>
<p>After the third fall man had fallen into the flesh. However, there was still a fourth fall related to man&rsquo;s collective rebellion. At this point, man was completely of the flesh, and these fleshly people consulted one another, &ldquo;and they said to one another, Come&rdquo; (v. 3). These words indicate that they were going to rebel in a collective action. The first three falls resulted in a progressive corruption from the spirit to the flesh, resulting in the complete corruption of their entire being. However, in the fourth fall, they expressed an intention to rebel against God and to deny God&rsquo;s authority collectively. In God&rsquo;s eyes they were not only utterly corrupt but also extremely wicked. The first three falls involved matters of individual morality, but the fourth fall involved the matter of collective rebellion. This is very serious.</p>
