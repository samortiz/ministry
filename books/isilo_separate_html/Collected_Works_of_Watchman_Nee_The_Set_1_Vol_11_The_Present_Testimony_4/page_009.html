However, our goal and our center are not our brothers. Christ is God's center and our center as well. We are here to testify for the Son of God, and our heart is set on His gaining the preeminence in all things.</P><P>The number of readers this year has increased from that of last year. We had to increase the print quantity by five hundred copies. At present we are printing six thousand five hundred copies. This means that the needs and burdens before us have increased. But faith does not set its eyes on these things. Since God has led us in the past, we believe that He will lead us on in the future. Here we would like to thank those who in the past have fellowshipped with us in the matter of financial giving. May God "fill your every need according to His riches" (Phil. 4:19). The God of the receiver is supplying the need of the supplier!</P><P>What lies before us is the third Overcomer Conference. We hope that we can meet many of our readers there. Everything is in God's hand. We are merely the servants. By the time you receive this issue of the magazine, the Lord willing, the conference will be about to begin. Our desire from you is your supplicating prayers.</P><P></P><P>Your brother,</P><P>Watchman Nee</P><P>January 6, 1934</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
