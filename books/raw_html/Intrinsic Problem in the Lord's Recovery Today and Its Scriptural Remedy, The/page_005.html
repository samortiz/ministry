 <h2 class="head1">THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The first kind of oneness revealed in the New Testament is the oneness of the Lord&rsquo;s aspiration and prayer. The model for the genuine oneness was there at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s prayer, but the actual oneness had not yet come. On the day of Pentecost, the actual oneness came. At that time the oneness of the Lord&rsquo;s aspiration and prayer became the oneness of the Spirit (Eph. 4:1-6). This matter touches the depths of the holy Word. The Spirit is the very consummated Triune God. When we have the Spirit, we have the totality of the processed and consummated Triune God. The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, and this consummation is now one with the saved ones. This is the enlarged oneness in actuality, but still not in practicality. To have something in actuality means that it exists, that it is a fact; whereas to have something in practicality means that such a thing has become our practice, our experience. Hence, in the second kind of oneness, the oneness of the Spirit, we have only the actuality of the oneness; we do not yet have the practicality. First, this oneness was in Christ&rsquo;s aspiration, and it became His prayer. Then this oneness became the oneness of the Spirit, which is the oneness in actuality, the oneness in fact.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, the Triune God mingled Himself with His redeemed people, and this mingling became the actuality of the oneness. In John 17 this oneness was there among the Divine Trinity only as a model; it had not yet been enlarged. But on the day of Pentecost, the Triune God, after being processed and consummated, was poured out as the Spirit; that is, the processed and consummated Triune God mingled Himself with His chosen and redeemed people. This mingling is the actual oneness, and this actual oneness is the enlargement of the model of the oneness of the Divine Trinity. In John 17 the oneness was an aspiration in Christ which Christ uttered into a prayer. On the day of Pentecost, the oneness that had been in Christ&rsquo;s aspiration and prayer came into being. This is the oneness of the Spirit, which is fully defined by the Apostle Paul in Ephesians chapter four. In verse 3 Paul said that we all must be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit. Then, in the subsequent verses he gave a definition of the oneness of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">This Oneness in Actuality<br />
Being Composed of Four Factors<br />
by Two Means with One Goal</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Composed of Four Factors</h2>
<p>This oneness is composed of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God as its four factors (vv. 4-6). These four factors are four persons&mdash;the Body, the Spirit, the Lord, and God. The Body as the object is mingled with the Divine Trinity as the elements to be the factors of the oneness of the Spirit. The three factors&mdash;the Spirit, the Lord (the Son), and the one God (the Father)&mdash;are the elements of the oneness of the Spirit. These three elements are mingled with the Body, producing a fourth factor. The mingling of these four factors is the oneness of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">By One Faith and One Baptism<br />
as the Two Means</h2>
<p>The one faith and the one baptism mentioned in verse 5 are the two means to accomplish this oneness. Faith is the means for the Body to be joined to Christ the Head, and baptism is the means for the Body to be separated from Adam, the old head. Baptism separates us from Adam, and faith joins us to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">With One Hope as the One Goal</h2>
<p>The oneness of the Spirit has the one hope of our calling, mentioned in verse 4, as the one goal. This goal is for the Body to be brought into the divine glory of the processed Triune God, who is mingled with the Body. Thus, in the oneness of the Spirit, there are four factors, two means, and one goal. The genuine oneness is the Spirit, the Son, and the Father mingled with the Body through baptism and faith, with a hope of something to come. This is the oneness. Anything besides these seven items is a foreign article that divides the Body.</p>
