   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EVE CAME OUT OF ADAM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Adam needed a help meet.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What did God do to meet this need?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Genesis 2:19-20 says, "And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God brought every kind of living creature before Adam, but Adam could not find his help meet among them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>None of the living creatures made out of earth could be a help meet for Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, "the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This one was Adam's help meet and the figure of the church in Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible says very clearly that all of the things made of earth and not taken out of the body of Adam could not be his help meet.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the beasts of the field, the cattle, and the birds of the air were made of earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were not taken out of Adam; therefore, they could not be the help meet to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must remember that Eve was formed out of a rib taken from Adam; therefore, Eve was the constituent of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that the church comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only that which is out of Christ can be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Anything that is not of Christ is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to note a few more words in Genesis 1:26 and 27.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 26 says, "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them..."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Hebrew language the word "man" is singular, but immediately following, the plural pronoun "them" is used.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The same pattern is used in verse 27 which says, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The noun "man" is singular, but the following pronoun "them" is plural.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God created one man; but we can also say that He created two!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One is two, and yet the two are one because Eve was in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Notice further that verse 27 says, "God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way God created "man" is the same way He created "them."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only was Adam created, but Eve also was included in him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"God created man in his own image."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This "man" is singular and typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"In the image of God created He...them."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Them" is plural and typifies Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God not only wants to have an only begotten Son, He also wants many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The many sons must be just like the one Son.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From these verses we see that if the church is not in a state which corresponds with Christ, God will not rest and His work will not be completed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not only is Adam in the image of God, so also is Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only does Christ have the life of God, the church also has God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE CHURCH COMES OUT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should then ask, "What is the church?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church is that part which is taken out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to see the two aspects of Adam, and then it will be easy for us to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On one hand, Adam stands merely as himself; on the other hand, he is a type.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As far as Adam himself is concerned, he was made of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All natural men are made of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But Adam also typified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The fact that Eve was made from Adam signifies that the church is made from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eve was made with Adam's rib.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since Eve came out from Adam, she was still Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then what is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church is another form of Christ, just as Eve was another form of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Oh, there are many people who think that the church is the coming together of the "people" who believe in the Lord and who are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No, this is not true!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then who constitutes the church?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church is only that portion which has been taken out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In other words, it is the man which God has made by using Christ as the material.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not a man made of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The material of the church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Without Christ, the church has no position, no life, no living, and no existence.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>First Corinthians 10:17 says, "Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This verse means that even though we are many, the bread which we break is one; therefore, the Body is also one.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The apostle Paul clearly stated that the one loaf represents the Body of Christ, that is, the church as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Though we are many, yet the Body is one.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we remember the Lord, I take a little piece from the loaf, you take a little piece from the loaf, and others do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For many centuries throughout the world, all Christians have taken a little portion of this loaf and eaten it!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you could take all the pieces they have eaten and put them together, they would become the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The church is not an individual "I" plus an individual "you."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is not Mr. Smith plus Mr. Jones or even all the Christians in the whole world put together.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The church is the Christ in you, the Christ in him, and the Christ in all the Christians around the world throughout all the centuries put together.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our natural man has nothing to do with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The only part of us which is related to the church is the portion of the loaf which we have eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is especially shown in the Gospel of John, where it is revealed that all those who believe in the Lord have Christ dwelling in them and are therefore one in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The church is composed of that which is out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Man's talent, ability, thought, strength, and all that he has are outside the church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Everything that comes from the natural life is outside the church, and anything that is brought into the church of the natural life will only result in a tearing down, not a building up.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Only that which comes out of Christ is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Eve was not made from clay, but from Adam, the one who typified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The preciousness is that God took a rib from Adam and made Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Only that which came out from Adam, not from clay, can be called "Eve," and only that which comes from Christ can be called the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Whatever is not from Christ has nothing to do with the church.</S>
