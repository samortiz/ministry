        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE STEPS OF GOD ENTERING INTO MAN<br />
TO BE MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1; 4:24; 6:63; 14:6; 2 Cor. 3:17</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A MYSTERY&mdash;FIVE YET ONE</h2>
<p>John 1:1 says that &ldquo;the Word was God.&rdquo; Here <em>Word</em> does not refer to a brief word but to a long speech. In New Testament Greek, both <em>logos</em> and <em>rhema</em> are translated as &ldquo;word.&rdquo; <em>Logos</em> denotes a long speaking; it is the constant word. <em>Rhema</em> denotes a brief word; it is the instant word. The Word in John 1:1 is <em>logos.</em></p>
<p>John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo; The first part of 6:63 says, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life.&rdquo; Here the expression <em>gives life</em> has two meanings in the original Greek: to cause people to have life and to cause people to live. Hence, an expanded translation is, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who causes people to have life and live.&rdquo; The second part of this verse says, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; <em>Words</em> here is <em>rhema,</em> that is, short and instant words. In John 14:6 Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the way and the reality and the life.&rdquo; Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The verbs in the above verses are important. The Word <em>is</em> God, God <em>is</em> Spirit, the words that the Lord speaks to us <em>are</em> spirit, the words that the Lord speaks to us <em>are</em> life, the Lord <em>is</em> life, and the Lord <em>is</em> the Spirit. These are six instances of the verb <em>to be</em> concerning the following items: the Word, God, the Spirit, life, and the Lord. God, the Lord, and the Spirit refer to the Triune God. The three of the Triune God plus the Word and life are five items.</p>
<p>The verb <em>to be</em> in these portions can be likened to an equal sign that links all five items together, making the five items one. The Word is equal to God, God is equal to the Lord, the Lord is equal to the Spirit, and the Spirit is equal to life. It is amazing that five items are one item. These are five truly mysterious items, yet the five items are also one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD ENTERING INTO MAN TO BE MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>God desires to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life. This is His purpose. Everything else that God does relates to this purpose. In other words, God&rsquo;s purpose depends upon God entering into man, being man&rsquo;s life, living in man, and living out of man. A seed is a good example. When the life in a seed is activated, the seed will sprout, and a stalk and leaves will grow. This plant will continue to grow until it blossoms and bears fruit, in which are more seeds. In this endless cycle, life is produced and duplicated. We can say that the purpose of a plant is to blossom and to bear fruit and seeds. However, everything in this cycle depends on life.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s purpose, His intention, is to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life so that He can live in man and then be lived out of man in every situation. We need a change in our concepts. We should not have the religious concept of worshipping God, serving or working for Him, doing things that He needs, pleasing Him, or being pious. Although these may be good, they are religious concepts and are not God&rsquo;s purpose. God&rsquo;s purpose is to enter into us in order to be our life and then to be lived out of us in all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STEPS OF GOD ENTERING INTO MAN</h2>
<p>God enters into us to be our life in three steps.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Dwelling in Eternity Past as the Father</h2>
<p>The Bible says that God dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16). The Bible also says that God inhabits eternity (Isa. 57:15) and that His name is Eternal Father (9:6). Eternity transcends time and space. There is no way for man to contact the God who dwells in eternity. In His holiness, He is like a consuming fire (Heb. 12:29). Anyone who would attempt to approach Him would be consumed. Hence, it is impossible for man to contact the God who dwells in eternity, let alone to receive Him as life. This is the first step.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Being Manifested among Men as the Son</h2>
<p>We thank God that in addition to being the Father, He is also the Son. Thus, He is able to contact man. He is God, and He is the Lord; He is the Father, and He is the Son. As the Father, He is hidden, but as the Son, He is manifested. Every one of us is someone&rsquo;s son; hence, we have a father. We usually ask people if they have sons, but we never ask if they have a father. As long as a person exists, he must have a father. A man is the manifestation of his father. This is what the Bible means when it refers to the Father and the Son. The Father is the source of the Son, and the Son is the manifestation, the expression, of the Father. The eternal God who dwells in unapproachable light is the source; this is the Father. One day He was manifested; this is the Son. John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; When Philip asked the Lord to show them the Father, the Lord rebuked him, saying, &ldquo;Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?&rdquo; (14:8-10). These words show that the Father and the Son are one. We might say that the Son hidden is the Father and that the Father manifested is the Son. The Son is the manifestation of the Father, and the Father is the source of the Son. The two are one. Hence, in the second step, God came in His Son, the Lord Jesus, to be manifested among men.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
