   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE ABIDING IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND LEARNING THE LESSON</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE CROSS FOR THE ONENESS Scripture Reading: John 15:5, 8; 17:21-23; Matt 10:18-20</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Gospel of John reveals Christ as life and the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because of this, it can be considered an extract of the entire Bible, which begins with the tree of life and ends with the holy city the consummation of the Body of Christ , in which is the tree of life Gen 2:9; Rev 21:2; 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These two matters of the tree of life and the holy city are simple yet very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>MAN BEING CREATED TO CONTAIN CHRIST AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Scriptures reveal that we were created as vessels of God Rom 9:21, 23; 2 Tim 2:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A vessel by itself is empty and must be filled with something.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Scriptures show us that as vessels we must be filled with God 2 Cor 4:7; Eph 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s intention is that we would be containers for Him and that He would fill us with Himself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why God created man according to His own image, which is Christ Himself Gen 1:26; 2 Cor 4:4; Col 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first man, Adam, who was created according to the image of Christ, was a figure or photograph of Christ Rom 5:14 ; that is, he had the image of Christ, but he did not have Christ as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, God put Adam in front of the tree of life Gen 2:8-9 with the intention that he would take of the tree of life and receive Christ as life, but Adam failed to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After a long period of time, Christ came to us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ, who is the expression and embodiment of God, came to present God to us so that we could take Him and gain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must realize that God s intention is to be life to us and that our relationship with God is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to our natural concept, our relationship with God should be a matter of our doing something for God or worshipping God in a formal way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the Scriptures show us something absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the very beginning of the Scriptures, God presents Himself to man as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, God s intention is that we would take Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Lord Jesus came to the earth, instead of demanding that everyone worship Him, He told them that He was the bread of life for them to eat John 6:35, 48-51 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He said, He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me v. 57 . Our relationship with God should be one of taking and enjoying Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>STOPPING OUR DOING</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>AND SIMPLY ABIDING IN CHRIST AS THE VINE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has no intention of asking us to do anything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The concept of doing good and of working for God is from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, not from the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Throughout the whole Gospel of John the Lord never told anyone to do anything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, He told us that we need to believe into Him v. 29 . For us to believe into Him is simply to receive Him into us 1:12 . The Lord also told us that after receiving Him we must learn how to abide in Him and how to let Him abide in us, just as the branches of a vine abide in the vine and let the vine abide in them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In John 15 the Lord said, I am the vine; you are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing...In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit and so you will become My disciples vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>5, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The branches of a vine do nothing except abide in the vine and let the vine abide in them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the branches abide in the vine, the life of the vine in the sap becomes their sufficient supply, and they spontaneously bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The fruit is not the issue of the branches good works or doings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, it is the overflow of life, the overflow of the rich sap of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You must realize that you are a branch of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has no intention of asking you to do anything for Him, so you should forget about doing good things for God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you begin to do something for God, He will tell you to stop your doing and simply abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, you should simply keep yourself in contact with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let Christ be everything to you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let Christ be your life, let Him grow in you, and let Him live Himself out of you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is nothing for you to do except abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What a joy and a rest this is!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When many of the Lord s children come to talk to me, they talk only about their negative situations.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must all forget about the negative situations and instead realize the positive situation that we are branches of Christ and that Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we realized this, we would say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am a branch of Christ, and Christ is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is my life and my everything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The sisters often tell me that they need more patience in dealing with their children and in handling family matters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They do not realize that Christ is their patience and that as long as they allow Christ to live in them, they will have patience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we allow Christ to live in us, Christ as patience will prevail, but without Christ living in us, we cannot have patience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The only matter we should focus on is Christ and the glorious fact that we are members of Christ; we should not pay attention to anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are branches of the divine vine, and in this vine Christ is within us and is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can apply Him, employ Him, and appropriate Him in such a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must realize that we are no longer in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have been reborn, so we are in Christ and have Christ as life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Not only so, we are also parts of Christ as the increase of Christ and parts of the counterpart of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The life, nature, essence, and riches of Christ are within us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May the Lord open our eyes to see that we not only have Christ in us but are also parts of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we realize this, we will stop doing so many things all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We may even stop our old way of praying; instead of praying that the Lord would do various things for us, we may pray that we would abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord today is living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we abide in Him and let Him abide in us, we will spontaneously be fruit-bearing branches.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We do not need to strive to bear fruit, because this is the responsibility of the life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We simply need to abide in Christ and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One day a sister came to me and said, I understand that Christ is my life and that I have to trust Him regarding my husband.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, I want to know what to do to deal with my husband.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Immediately I told this sister that she was outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we must ask what to do regarding a certain matter, we are practically outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we are abiding in Christ, there will be no need for us to ask what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Suppose you ask a branch that is abiding in a vine what it is going to do regarding a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If the branch could speak, it would answer, I do not know what I am going to do.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I only know to abide here and to enjoy the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Look how happy and restful I am!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I do not have any burdens or even responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I am simply abiding in the vine and letting the vine abide in me.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Praise the Lord that we are branches of the vine and that Christ is living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we are going to practice abiding in Christ, we need to see the glorious and divine fact that we are vessels, that Christ is our life, and that this life will take care of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Christ will live Himself out through us and will be everything to us, including our patience and love.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the tree of life the vine with all the branches as its increase bearing fruit all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This tree is a picture of the church, which is composed of all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we would consider this picture of the vine with the branches, we would realize the full, intrinsic significance of what it means to be a Christian and what it means to be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We need a heavenly vision of what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We need to see that we are no longer parts of Adam; rather, we are parts of Christ, branches of the divine vine.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The life, nature, wealth, and riches of the vine are all in us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Thus, we do not need to do anything; all we need to do is to abide in the vine, to keep ourselves in contact with Christ day by day and moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is to keep ourselves in the inner man, which is our spirit, and in contact with the Holy Spirit, who is the reality of Christ Eph 3:16; John 14:17 .</S>
