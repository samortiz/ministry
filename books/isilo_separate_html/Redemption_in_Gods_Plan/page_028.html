<h1 class="title">THE APPLICATION OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 16:7, 13-16; 14:16-20</h1>
<p>In chapter 6 we said that Christ accomplished redemption through His death in the flesh on the cross according to God&rsquo;s eternal plan. In chapter 7 we said that Christ&rsquo;s resurrection proves and confirms His accomplishment on the cross and also brings redeemed humanity into the status of the new creation. Through His death and resurrection all the requirements for us to be saved have been fulfilled. However, the accomplishments of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection could not be applied to us if He had merely resurrected from the dead. In order for these accomplishments to reach us and become our experience, Christ had to become the Spirit.</p>
<p>Only the Spirit can reach us and enter into us. Only the Spirit can cause us to receive the redemption accomplished by God. Only the Spirit can bring what was accomplished through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection into us to become our spiritual experience and reality. The goal of God&rsquo;s redemption is for man to receive Him as life so that God and man may be fully mingled as one. This can be accomplished only by the Spirit. Only the Spirit can enter into man and enable man to receive God as everything so that God and man may be joined as one. Redemption can be applied to man only in the Spirit, and the goal of God&rsquo;s redemption can be attained only in the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REDEMPTION BEING APPLIED IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In order to accomplish redemption, it was not sufficient for God to be incarnated. He had to take a further step and become the Spirit in order to apply His redemption. God accomplished redemption as a man in the flesh, but as a man in the flesh, He could not apply redemption. As a man in the flesh, He could accomplish redemption for man objectively, but He could not apply it to man subjectively so that it would become man&rsquo;s practical salvation. As a man in the flesh, Christ could accomplish the fact of redemption for man, but He could not enable man to experience this salvation. As long as Christ was a man in the flesh, His accomplishments could not be applied to man. In order for His accomplishments to be applied to man, Christ had to become the Spirit.</p>
<p>The objective aspect of redemption was accomplished by God as a man in the flesh. The subjective aspect of redemption is accomplished by God as the Spirit. God was incarnated in order to accomplish the objective aspect of redemption, and He became the Spirit in order to make the subjective experience of redemption real to redeemed humanity. Without His becoming flesh, there would not be the fact of redemption. However, without His becoming the Spirit after accomplishing redemption, there would be no experience of salvation. The experience of salvation is the subjective application of redemption, which is received through the Spirit. In other words, the fact of redemption, which was accomplished by God as a man in the flesh, becomes our experience of salvation in the Spirit. The fact of redemption from sins becomes our experience of forgiveness of sins in the Spirit. The fact of His being put to death on the cross becomes our experience of co-crucifixion with Him in the Spirit. His resurrection life becomes the life that enlivens us and the life by which we live in the Spirit. His being our righteousness, our sanctification, and the redemption of our body in the future are realized by us in the Spirit. In the Spirit, God&rsquo;s redemption and all that is of Him are applied to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD GOING AND THE SPIRIT COMING</h2>
<p>After accomplishing redemption, the Lord Jesus needed to go in order to come again. He had to go in order for the Spirit to come. In John 16:7 the Lord said, &ldquo;If I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you.&rdquo; This means that the Spirit could not come as long as the Lord remained on the earth as a man in the flesh. Furthermore, the Lord would not have been able to apply His accomplished redemption to man, which causes man to receive salvation. His redemption must be applied by the Spirit in order for man to receive His salvation. Hence, the Spirit had to come. However, in order for the Spirit to come, the Lord had to go. Through His going, He was able to send the Spirit (v. 7). His going enabled the Spirit to come and ensured that the Spirit would come.</p>
<p>The coming of the Spirit was the coming of the Lord Himself. In 14:17 the Lord said, &ldquo;Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive...but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.&rdquo; In this verse the word <em>He</em> refers to the Spirit, who would come to abide with the disciples. In verse 18 the Lord continued, &ldquo;I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.&rdquo; In this verse the word <em>I</em> refers to the Lord, who would come to be with the disciples. &ldquo;He&rdquo; in verse 17 is &ldquo;I&rdquo; in verse 18. When the Lord told His disciples that He would not leave them as orphans, He told them of His coming as the Spirit to abide in them.</p>
<p>Hence, in verse 19 the Lord said to the disciples, &ldquo;Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the Lord would go away in the flesh and return as the Spirit in order to enter into the disciples so that they might live as He lived. Then they would know that the Lord was in them and that they were in the Lord (v. 20). In 16:16 He said to the disciples, &ldquo;A little while and you no longer behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me,&rdquo; because He was going away in the flesh and coming again as the Spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> </body></html>
