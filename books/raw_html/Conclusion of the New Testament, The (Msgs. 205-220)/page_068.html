<h2 class=head5>(2) Having God as the Light within Christ as the Lamp</h2><p>Revelation 21:23a says, “The city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it.” God as the light is within Christ as the lamp. The glory of God, which is God expressed, illumines the New Jerusalem. Hence, the glory of God, with God as its substance, essence, and elements, is the light of the New Jerusalem, which shines in the Lamb as its lamp.<h2 class=head5>(3) Having Christ as the Lamp Containing God as the Light</h2><p>Revelation 21:23b says of the New Jerusalem that “its lamp is the Lamb.” In the New Jerusalem Christ, as the lamp of the holy city, will shine with God within as the light to illumine the city with the glory of God, the expression of the divine light. Because such a light will illumine the holy city, it will not need any other light, whether created by God or made by man (Rev. 22:5). Christ, the lamp, will shine with God as the light.<h2 class=head5>(4) Bearing the Spirit’s Expression</h2><p>The New Jerusalem will also bear the Spirit’s expression. Revelation 21:11b says, “Her light was like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone, clear as crystal.” Jasper, a precious stone, signifies the expression of the Spirit in His transforming work with all the unsearchable riches of Christ. Likewise, the other precious stones in the New Jerusalem signify that the city bears the Spirit’s expression.<h2 class=head5>(5) Expressing the Processed Triune God in Eternity</h2><p>As the consummation of the golden lampstands, the New Jerusalem will express the processed Triune God in eternity. The New Jerusalem will be a mountain of gold with pearl gates and with a jasper wall built upon twelve layers of precious stones. Gold expresses God in His nature, pearls express Christ in His death and resurrection, and the precious stones express the Spirit in His work of transformation. Therefore, the New Jerusalem will be the triune expression of the processed Triune God—the expression of the Father as the source, the Son as the embodiment, and the Spirit as the realization and transmission.
