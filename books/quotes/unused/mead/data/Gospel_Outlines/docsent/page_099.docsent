   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This shows us that when man sinned, he should have died, but God used the lamb to be the substitute for man, to shed its blood for the sins of man; thus the lamb became the clothing for man to cover himself before God.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Son of God, Jesus Christ, came to this earth, His forerunner John the Baptist testified of Him saying, Behold the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From the days of their forefathers up till that time, the Jews were offering sacrifices every day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, on that day when John said, Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world, they immediately knew what this referred to.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God forsook Him not because He was sinful, but because God had put the sins of all mankind upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because He bore and took away the sins of man in such a way, today, the blood He shed can wash away the sins of man and solve the problem between man and God.</S>
