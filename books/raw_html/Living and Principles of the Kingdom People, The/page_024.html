        <h2 class="head1">NOT GIVING OTHERS THE TRUTH<br />
OR OUR EXPERIENCES CARELESSLY</h2>
<p>In verse 6 the Lord brings up another matter: &ldquo;Do not give that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the hogs, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn and tear you.&rdquo; In order to understand this verse, we need to consider the background in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>According to Leviticus 11, the animals of the earth are either clean or unclean. Animals that have a divided hoof and chew the cud are clean and may be eaten by God&rsquo;s people. Animals that do not have a divided hoof or that do not chew the cud are unclean and may not be eaten by God&rsquo;s people (vv. 1-8). For example, dogs do not have a divided hoof, nor do they chew the cud. Hogs have a divided hoof but do not chew the cud. Hence, both dogs and hogs are unclean and may not be partaken of by God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>Spiritually speaking, God&rsquo;s intention in Leviticus 11 is to show principles for His people in their dealing with others. Chewing the cud signifies receiving God&rsquo;s word and pondering over it. A divided hoof signifies being separated in our living and walk by receiving the word of God. Those who receive and ponder over the word of God are separated in their living and walk before God. God&rsquo;s people are allowed to contact and deal only with such ones.</p>
<p>The Gentiles do not receive the word of God, and nominal Christians can be no different from the Gentiles in their living and walk, even though they seem to receive the word of God. In the eyes of God, such ones are unclean like the dogs and hogs in Matthew 7:6. God&rsquo;s people should not have dealings with them.</p>
<p><em>That which is holy</em> in verse 6 refers to the truth of God, the word of the Lord. In particular, it refers to the Lord&rsquo;s teaching on the mountain, which belongs to God. <em>Your pearls</em> refers to our experiences of life. If we receive the Lord&rsquo;s word, obey the truth of God, and live according to the life of God, we will have pearl-like experiences. We should not speak carelessly about the Lord&rsquo;s word and His truth to those who do not receive the Lord&rsquo;s word and who have no separation in their conduct. Nor should we speak with such ones concerning our experiences of life. People who do not receive the Lord&rsquo;s word and have no separation in their being neither know that which is holy nor treasure pearls. Hence, they are likely to trample God&rsquo;s truths and our experiences and will cause us to suffer loss.</p>
<p>For example, a brother may testify to an evil man, saying, &ldquo;Whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also, and to him who wishes to take your tunic, yield to him your cloak also.&rdquo; The evil man, however, may not treasure or appreciate such a testimony. Instead, he may take advantage of the brother by slapping his face and taking his clothes. This is to turn and tear the brother.</p>
<p>We often encounter such situations in our practical living. Therefore, we need to be careful when speaking to others. When we preach the gospel, we should not carelessly speak the words in the Bible, lest they are presented to people who are like dogs or hogs, and we suffer loss. Whether we should speak to others about God&rsquo;s truths and the extent to which we should speak depend on the kind of person we are speaking to.</p>
<p>Matthew 7:1-6 reveals that we need to exercise caution and should not be careless in dealing with others. We should not judge others carelessly. We also should not speak of the truth and our experiences of life in a careless way. Just as we need to be careful in our views of others, we also need to be careful when speaking the truth to others. If we are not careful, we will bring judgment upon ourselves and suffer loss.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DOING TO PEOPLE WHAT WE WISH GOD TO DO TO US</h2>
<p>In verses 7 through 12 the Lord turned to the matter of prayer. It seems as if He was speaking about how God deals with us, but He was speaking about how we deal with others. If we read these verses carefully, we will realize that they are related to how we deal with others, because at the end of this section the Lord said, &ldquo;Therefore all that you wish men would do to you, so also you do to them; for this is the law and the prophets&rdquo; (v. 12). According to the context, this is a concluding word. In this section the Lord seemed to be saying that we should do to people what we wish God to do to us. We often pray and hope that God would be good to us. Therefore, the Lord was saying that we should treat others in this way as well.</p>
<p>According to the principles in our dealings with others, we should do to others what we wish God to do to us. If we want God to be generous to us, we need to be generous to others. If we want God to be gracious to us, we need to be gracious to others. If we want God to give good things to us, we need to give good things to others. God never gives us inferior things. Even when we ask for the wrong things, God still gives us good things. We should also deal with others in this way. This is the principle of the kingdom people in their dealing with others.</p>
<p>How does God deal with us? In verse 7 the Lord said, &ldquo;Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.&rdquo; Asking, seeking, and knocking all refer to prayer, but each step is deeper and more advanced than the previous step. For some matters we need only to ask, and God will give them to us. For other matters it is not sufficient to ask; we also need to seek. For yet other matters we cannot stop with seeking; we also need to knock. There is a distinction between these three steps of prayer. With asking, the emphasis is on asking God for blessings; with seeking, the emphasis is on gaining God; but with knocking, the emphasis is on gaining God&rsquo;s presence. However, whether we are asking for blessings, seeking God, or gaining His presence, God will always give us something good.</p>
<p>Even when we ask for the wrong thing, God gives the right thing to us, because He knows the difference between a loaf and a stone. He knows what is profitable and what is harmful. For example, a sister, who wants to study abroad after graduating from college, may ask God about going abroad every day in her prayer. In the eyes of God this matter may be a stone, not a loaf, in relation to this sister. He may consider it to be a serpent instead of a fish (vv. 9-10). Hence, God does not give her what she asks; rather, He gives her a different future. Although the sister may not initially understand God&rsquo;s arrangement, she will eventually realize that God has given her the best.</p>
<p>We need such wisdom when dealing with others. For example, a young brother may want to borrow three thousand dollars from us, but we know that if we lend him this money, we will be doing him harm. Hence, we need to exercise wisdom and help him. The brother is asking for a stone, thinking that it is a loaf. If we give him the stone, we will harm him.</p>
<p>There are two implications in the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 7:1 through 12. The first implication is that we should do to others what we wish God to do to us. The second implication is that God will do to us what we do to others. These are the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
