 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE RESULT AND MANIFESTATION<br />
OF THE INFILLING AND OUTPOURING<br />
OF THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 13:52; Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16; 1 Cor. 12:7-8, 10; Gal. 5:16, 25; Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:22-23; Acts 2:4; 10:45-46; 19:6; 1 Cor. 12:9-10; Acts 4:8, 31; 13:9</h1>
<p>The two aspects of the filling of the Spirit have been a perplexing and troubling matter among Christians for many years. Even among the Brethren, who knew the Bible quite well, this matter was not as clear as it is to us today. We need to be clear about the difference between the infilling of the essential Spirit and the outpouring of the economical Spirit (see <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy,</em> chapters seven through ten). It would also be helpful to learn to sing or speak a hymn such as #271 in <em>Hymns.</em></p>
<p>The New Testament clearly reveals that with the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God there is the essential aspect for life, existence, and living, and the economical aspect for working, power, and authority. The one Spirit has these two aspects. Nearly all the basic truths in the Bible have two aspects. With the Triune God there is the aspect of three and the aspect of one. It is wrong to realize God only in the aspect of three without also realizing Him in the aspect of one. To emphasize only the aspect of the three Persons can lead to tritheism, the concept of three Gods. Actually, the Bible tells us that God is Triune&mdash;with Him there is the aspect of three and there is the aspect of one.</p>
<p>With the Spirit there are the two aspects of essence and economy. The Lord Jesus was conceived with and by the Spirit, and He was born of the Spirit (Matt. 1:18, 20). From the time of His conception, the Spirit was within Him. However, at the age of thirty when He came out to accomplish His ministry, He was baptized, and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him as a dove (Matt. 3:16). Actually, even before the Spirit descended upon Him economically, the Spirit was already within Him essentially. These are not two Spirits, but one Spirit in two aspects. Cerinthus, the ancient heretic, mistakenly taught that Jesus and Christ were two persons. According to his teaching, the descending Spirit was Christ. This Christ remained with Jesus for three and a half years until the crucifixion, at which time He left Jesus. This was a great heresy. The Triune God has been consummated to be the one unique Spirit, and with this Spirit are the essential and the economical aspects. The essential aspect refers to His substance, His very essence. This Spirit in His essence is for life, for existence, and for living. The economical aspect refers to God&rsquo;s operation, God&rsquo;s economy, and God&rsquo;s work. The essential aspect is inward and the economical aspect is outward. We must be clear about this. Otherwise, we will be confused when we read the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ESSENTIALLY, IN THE ASPECT OF INFILLING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Filled with Joy</h2>
<p>If we are filled with the Spirit essentially, we will be filled with joy (Acts 13:52). Joy is the very essence of the Spirit because the essential Spirit is the Spirit of joy. Acts 13:52 tells us that when the disciples were filled with the Spirit essentially, they were filled with joy. Joy cannot be separated from the Spirit. Joy is the essence of the inner Spirit and is one of the attributes of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking the Word of Praise,<br />
of Teaching, and of Exhortation</h2>
<p>Speaking the word of praise, of teaching, and of exhortation is also the result and manifestation of the infilling of the Spirit (Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16). According to Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3, when a saint properly and adequately speaks a word of praise or gives a word of teaching or a word of exhortation in a meeting, he bears the sign of the inward infilling. When one can speak the word of praise to God, the word of teaching to others, or the word of exhortation to the saints, his speaking is a strong manifestation of the infilling of the essential Spirit.</p>
