   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE TWELVE THE MAN ON THE THRONE Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1:26-28; Exo 24:10; Gen 9:12-15; Rev 4:2-3; 21:19a; 22:1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that in the Christian life and in the church life we need a clear sky with a throne in it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To have a clear sky means that we have no clouds or darkness between us and the Lord, and to have the throne means that we are under the ruling of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all need to have a life with a clear sky and the throne above the clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we will go on to consider the One sitting on the throne Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE ONE ON THE THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF A MAN</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 26b says, Upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we are told that the One on the throne looks like a man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is absolutely different from the human concept and also different from the religious concept, including the concept widely held in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mainly, our concept is that the One on the throne is the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Have you ever thought that the Lord on the throne is not only the mighty God but is also a man?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Oh, the One who sits on the throne is a man!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, verse 28 speaks of the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The One on the throne looks like a man, yet with Him there is the appearance of the glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christians realize, of course, that the Lord Jesus was a man when He was on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They recognize the fact that from the manger in Bethlehem to the time He was on the cross at Golgotha He was a man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all have this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, many believers in Christ have not considered that the Lord who is on the throne today is still a man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is a man there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the One on the throne, the Lord is still a man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although He is the almighty God, on the throne He looks like a man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, Matthew 19:28 tells us that in the restoration, that is, in the coming kingdom age, the Son of Man will be sitting on the throne of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How precious it is that the One sitting on the throne in Ezekiel 1:26 has the appearance of a man!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This verse speaks not of the almighty God but of One who has the likeness as the appearance of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is at least a twofold significance to the fact that the One sitting on the throne here has the appearance of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, there is surely a connection between Ezekiel 1:26 and Genesis 1:26, which says that God created man in His own image and according to His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second, in the incarnation God Himself became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Having the nature of man, He lived, died, resurrected, and ascended as a man, and now in heaven He is still the Son of Man John 6:62; Acts 7:56 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Bible there is a mysterious thought concerning the relationship between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God s desire is to become the same as man is and to make man the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that God s intention is to mingle Himself with man and thereby make Himself like man and make man like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus is the God-man; He is the complete God and the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may also say that He is the Man-God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The One whom we worship today is the Man-God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, to be a man of God, as Moses was Deut 33:1; Josh 14:6; Psa 90, title , is to be a God-man, a man who is mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is a delight to God that all His chosen and redeemed people would be God-men.</S>
