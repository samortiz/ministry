<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. His Arrows Being Sharp<br>in the Heart of His Enemies</H2><P>Psalm 45:5 goes on to say that the King's arrows are sharp and that the peoples fall under Him. His arrows are in the heart of His enemies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. PRAISING THE KING IN HIS KINGDOM</H2><P>In verses 6 and 7 the psalmist praises the King in His kingdom. We have pointed out that the kingdom is the issue of the victory. Hence, before one can be a king, he must first be a victor. According to the ancient custom, the person who was victorious over the enemies became the king.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. As God His Throne Being Forever and Ever</H2><P>As God Christ's throne is forever and ever (v. 6a; Heb. 1:8a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Scepter of His Kingdom Being Upright</H2><P>"The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom" (Psa. 45:6b). The scepter signifies authority. The authority of many of today's high officials is not upright, but Christ's authority is altogether upright.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Loving Righteousness and Hating Wickedness</H2><P>As the King Christ has loved righteousness and hated wickedness (v. 7a; Heb. 1:9a). The more righteous we are, the more authority we have. However, the more we are involved with wickedness, the more we lose our authority.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. God, His God, Having Anointed Him<br>with the Oil of Gladness above His Companions</H2><P>Psalm 45:7b continues, "Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You/With the oil of gladness above Your companions." The oil of gladness signifies the Spirit of God, and the companions signify the believers of Christ. God the Father has anointed Christ with the Holy Spirit above all His companions, above all His believers. This indicates that Christ's authority and kingdom are altogether a spiritual matter. He has been anointed for the purpose of the kingdom. Christ's authority, throne, scepter, and everything related to the kingdom are under the anointing of the Spirit and therefore are spiritual.</P>
