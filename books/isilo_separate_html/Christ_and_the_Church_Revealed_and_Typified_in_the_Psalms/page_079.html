Arise, O Lord, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.&#8221; This is figurative of the recovery of the church life. The ark was separated from the tabernacle, which signifies Christ separated from the church life. Christ was with the church, but Christ has been separated from the church. This is the time when we must all say, &#8220;Lord, arise; return into Your resting place, the local churches.&#8221;<p>Verse 13: &#8220;For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.&#8221; Zion, which represents the local churches, is the choice of God, the desire of God. This word in verse 13 is the word of the Psalmist, but when we continue into verse 14, we see that it is also the word of the Lord Himself: &#8220;This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.&#8221; While the Psalmist was speaking in verse 13, the Lord suddenly intervened to speak Himself in verse 14. David had said, &#8220;For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.&#8221; Then the Lord immediately continued, &#8220;This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.&#8221; This is the wonderful way in which the Psalms were written.<p>The Lord Himself spoke further concerning Zion, &#8220;I will enrich her food supplies: I will satisfy her needy ones with bread&#8221; (v. 15). This word exactly fits our present situation. When we come into the local churches, we sense that here we have an abundant food supply. We are enriched. We are the needy ones, yet we have found bread. Are you still hungry? If you come into the local churches, you will be satisfied. Hallelujah, there is a place today where the hungry and needy ones may be fed and fully satisfied!<p>Here in Zion the Lord not only satisfies us with food, but also supplies us with clothing: &#8220;I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy&#8221; (v. 16). This salvation is not just a salvation from hell, but a salvation to the uttermost, a salvation of life. &#8220;Much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life&#8221; (Rom. 5:10). The Lord today is still clothing us with this wonderful life-salvation of His. He is satisfying us with the bread, and He is clothing us with the salvation of life. Day by day we are being saved. What then shall we do? We can do nought else but shout aloud for joy. We have a rich supply of food and glorious clothing. Hallelujah!<p>The Lord continues: &#8220;There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed&#8221; (v. 17). We not only have food and clothing, but also a horn, the figure of strength, power and victory. Furthermore, we have a lamp; we are not in darkness. And there is yet more: &#8220;His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish&#8221; (v. 18). The word &#8220;flourish&#8221; here may be translated &#8220;shine.&#8221; &#8220;Upon himself shall his crown shine.&#8221; Many times in the church life I have the sense of a shining crown upon me. I have rich food, I have glorious clothing, I have a horn, a lamp, and a shining crown. Then what about the enemies? The Lord clothes us with salvation, but He clothes the enemies with shame.<p>All this occurs in the house and in the city. The house is God&#8217;s choice, God&#8217;s desire, and God&#8217;s satisfaction. In the house God satisfies us and clothes us; so we have both satisfaction and beautification. In the local churches we have the horn, the lamp, and the crown; and here we see the enemies put to shame day by day. It is really good!<p>Therefore, as typified in this Psalm, there is so much in the local churches: the desire and choice of God, the rest and satisfaction of God, the Christ (the ark) of God&#8217;s strength, the throne of the Anointed (Christ), the rich food supply, the clothing of the priests, the worship and joyful shout of the saints, the horn, the lamp, the crown of God&#8217;s Anointed (Christ), and the defeat and shame of the enemies. Here Christ, the house, and the city are joined together.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_078.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_080.html">Next</a> </body></html>
