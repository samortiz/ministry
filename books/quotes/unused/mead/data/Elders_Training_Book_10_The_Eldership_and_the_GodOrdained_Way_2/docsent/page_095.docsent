   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Whether or not this can be worked out depends upon our endeavoring.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We cannot just make an announcement in the meeting, encouraging others to go.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We ourselves have to go.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should start by ourselves and then get a companion to labor with us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After half a year, we can bring forth four new ones who will labor in the same way that we are.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For the destiny of the church in our locality, this is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have wasted too much of our time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must make a budget to be very economical in the way that we spend our time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to redeem our time by praying for our acquaintances and relatives, writing them letters, and sending them booklets.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then we can make appointments to go see them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we labor, we need to learn with an honest and sincere heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to learn how to talk to people and how to gain them within a short period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we endeavor like this, we can bring at least two persons to the Lord yearly as remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may baptize more than five, but out of the five, two will remain in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Keep this in mind you must practice this yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I beg you to forget about having preachers and preaching meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That does not work so well.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Just practice visiting people one by one personally and directly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then after a short time, maybe two or three weeks, other saints will follow you to be your companions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then you will have a start of the practice of fruit bearing in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You must spend your time on the right persons in the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to gain a valuable result, you must labor.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not trust in preachers with large preaching meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That will waste your time and delay others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You yourself must have a start in the practice of fruit bearing in such a strict way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every week you should spend two to three hours to contact individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You should carry this out as a business.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then you will see the results.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I hope and pray for this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe that the Lord will eventually work this out, making each one of His lovers a winner of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must go to contact people one by one by yourself directly through planning.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You do not necessarily need to go out to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have found that going out to knock on doors is good, but it does not work that definitely.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must take a way so that we can bear fruit in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Just plan how to contact your acquaintances.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every week you should spend two to three hours on the gospel in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not send others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You must make a vow with the Lord that you would plan, schedule your time, and find a way to contact your acquaintances directly, at least once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you take any other way, the result will not be that definite.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The definite result only comes out of your plan and out of your schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Otherwise, you will waste your time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You do not need to announce anything to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the saints in the church remain the way they are, do not blame or condemn them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, go along with the church, and help it to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But you yourself need to labor in a definite way to gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>New ones will then be brought into the church life through you, and everyone will see this.</S>
