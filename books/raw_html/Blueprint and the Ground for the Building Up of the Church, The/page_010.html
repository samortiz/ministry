         <h2 class="head2">The Altar</h2>
<p>The building service first includes the work of the gospel, as indicated by the altar (Exo. 27:1-8). The altar typifies the cross of Christ. On the cross He accomplished redemption for us. The gospel needs to spread and be preached far and wide. The altar in the tabernacle was five cubits square (v. 1) and was enlarged in the temple to be twenty cubits square (2 Chron. 4:1). Thus, the gospel must be widely spread.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Laver and the Hangings</h2>
<p>The next item of service is related to the laver (Exo. 30:17-21), which denotes the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s dealings with us. These dealings remove all our uncleanness and dross by the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s shining, purifying, and purging. Third, the hangings for the outer court of the tabernacle (27:9-19) are produced. This causes our walk to be separated from the world. Worldly people are numb concerning sin and are defiled in their walk. Through the redemption accomplished on the cross and the dealing of the Holy Spirit, we are made clean and separated from the world in our conduct, living, and work. We preach the gospel of the vicarious death of Christ on the cross and of our co-death with Christ. We also preach the shining, purifying, and purging of the Holy Spirit. At the same time, we preach a life and walk that are separated from the people of the world and worthy of our calling and the grace that we have received. This is the work that we do.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ark</h2>
<p>Our work should also cause others to know the inner life. We should bring the saints to know Christ within them and to know how God in His Son can be our life and our treasure within. The Ark, which typifies Christ, was in the Holy of Holies (25:10-22). Today Christ lives in us. Within the Ark were the commandments of God. The commandments of God being within the Ark indicates that God is in Christ. The commandments within the Ark signify the revealed God, the manifested God, and the expressed God, because the commandments are the expression and revelation of God. We should not regard the commandments as something negative. On the contrary, the significance of the Ten Commandments is very deep and spiritual. The commandments are the explanation of God, telling us what God is.</p>
<p>The Ten Commandments are an explanation of God. The fact that the Ten Commandments were placed inside the Ark indicates that the explanation of God is in Christ. The Ark was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold, indicating that Christ has both divinity and humanity. His humanity is signified by acacia wood; however, what is expressed from Him is divinity, as signified by the gold that overlays the acacia wood. The frame of the Ark is wood, but the expression is pure gold. The frame and framework of the Lord Jesus is humanity, but divinity is manifested in Him. One of the many items related to the Ark is the expiation cover. We need to have a clear understanding of the many items not only for ourselves but also for us to bring others to know these items in their experience.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Table of the Bread of the Presence,<br />
the Golden Lampstand, and the Incense Altar</h2>
<p>Furthermore, we need to know the Holy Place. In the record of Exodus, following the Ark is the table of the bread of the Presence, which is also wood overlaid with gold (vv. 23-25). The table of the bread of the Presence indicates that Christ, who dwells within us with both His divinity and humanity, is our life supply. The Lord Jesus has both divinity and humanity. His humanity is the framework to express His divinity. This One who dwells in us is the table of the bread of the Presence. His being in us as the life supply has not only the aspect of humanity but also the aspect of divinity. Furthermore, He is our light, as indicated by the golden lampstand (vv. 31-40). The golden lampstand emphasizes divinity, because God is light. In the Holy Place there is also the incense altar (30:1-10), which indicates that Christ is the Intercessor who causes us to be acceptable to God.</p>
<p>These are the items that we should preach: the altar, the laver, the hangings, the Ark, the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar. Saying that we must preach these things does not mean that we have not done such a work in the past but that we have been inadequate. We do not necessarily need to explain the types, but we should preach the redemption of the cross, the shining and renewing of the Holy Spirit, and the Lord&rsquo;s holiness and righteousness saturating our living. In addition, we should speak more concerning the glorious Christ and His riches becoming our inner life and life supply. We need to learn to receive His supply, live by this supply, and stand before God, enjoying Him in the light. In this way our inner being will be bright, full of God&rsquo;s light. Under His shining, we will have the incense altar and be acceptable to God. Our preaching should have the New Testament as its basis and be confirmed by our experience.</p>

  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
