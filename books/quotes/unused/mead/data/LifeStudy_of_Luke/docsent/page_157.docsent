   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE FIFTY-THREE THE DEATH OF THE MAN-SAVIOR 3 Scripture Reading: Luke 23:26-56 THE MAN-SAVIOR S ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen in the foregoing message that the Man-Savior was put to death as our Substitute, as our Redeemer, by God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we need to see that the Lord Jesus died an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His death on the cross was not merely vicarious; it was also all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because the Man-Savior is an all-inclusive Person, on the cross He died an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us now go on to consider different aspects of the Lord s all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lamb of God</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the record of the entire New Testament, when the Man-Savior died on the cross, He died as seven items.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, He died as the Lamb of God to deal with sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John 1:29 says, Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here the world denotes mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From 1 Corinthians 15:3, 1 Peter 2:24, and Hebrews 9:28 we see that as the Lamb of God the Lord Jesus died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, according to 2 Corinthians 5:21 and Hebrews 9:26, His death dealt with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, both sin and sins were dealt with by the Lamb of God, who was under God s judgment on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A Man in the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Man-Savior died on the cross, He also died as a man in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the Word which was with God and which is God, He became flesh John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Peter 3:18 tells us that He was put to death in flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a man in the flesh, He had only the likeness, the form, of a fallen man; He did not have the nature of a fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 , but He did not have the actual nature of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the Man-Savior died as a man in the flesh, His death dealt with the fallen flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Praise the Lord that sin, sins, and the fallen flesh have been dealt with by the death of the Man-Savior!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A Man in the Old Creation</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus also died as a man in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the reason Romans 6:6 says that our old man was crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because the Lord died on the cross as a man in the old creation, our old man was dealt with through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Serpent</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It may come as a great surprise to hear that the Man-Savior died on the cross even as the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life John 3:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here the Lord Jesus applies to Himself the type of the brass serpent lifted up by Moses in the wilderness Num 21:4-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No doubt, the Lord Jesus was crucified as a serpent in form in order to deal with Satan, the Devil, the old serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As fallen human beings, we all have been bitten by this serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do you know when we were bitten?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We were bitten in the Garden of Eden when Adam was bitten by the serpent and poisoned by him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, it was necessary for our Savior to be crucified as the serpent in form in order to deal with the old serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was through being crucified as the serpent that the Lord Jesus crushed the head of the old serpent, the Devil Gen 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way, He judged the ruler of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Concerning this, John 12:31 says, Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By His death on the cross, the Man-Savior destroyed the Devil, who had the power of death Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, as the One who died as a serpent under God s judgment, the Man-Savior dealt with the Devil and with his world, the satanic system.</S>
