   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN THE SYMPTOMS OF OBSESSION AND CAUSES FOR OBSESSION Scripture Reading: Eph 4:18a; 2 Cor 10:3-5; John 3:19-21; 7:17; 5:19, 40-43; 2 Thes 2:10-11; Obad.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>3; 1 John 1:8</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Darkness is something general, while light is something very definite.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We cannot lock out darkness, but we can consciously allow light to come in. Foolishness, uncertainty, doubt, and confusion are the normal state of man's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before we were saved, we did not see salvation, and when others preached the gospel, we tried to argue with them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After we were saved, we became ashamed of the way we opposed others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is easy to be confused, but it is hard to make people clear about salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Worldly people think that they are wise most of the time and rarely foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, the truth is the opposite those who have no knowledge of salvation are rarely wise and foolish most of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE SYMPTOMS OF OBSESSION</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The main characteristic of obsession is self-deception.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is easy to deal with those who deceive others, but it is not easy to deal with those who deceive themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A man is self-deceived when his thoughts are darkened by Satan; he thinks that he is clever and that everything he does is right.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because of his own pride, he turns more and more to his own decisions until he subconsciously becomes fully obsessed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is possible for any believer to become obsessed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once a person becomes careless and deviates a little, he is obsessed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lies and fabricated testimonies are highways to obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all should be careful with our words.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some believers are not accurate with their words; they often exaggerate, inflate, overstate, and add things at random.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, they believe their own fabricated words.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These ones are obsessed with their words!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Others can be obsessed by indulging in self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They may not be sick physically, yet they always feel uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They pamper their own bodies and indulge in self-pity or self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When their heart beats a little faster, they think they are having a heart attack.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When they cough a little, they think they have tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are obsessed with sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE CAUSES FOR OBSESSION</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 3:19 says, "And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One cause for obsession is a love of darkness rather than light.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I know of a brother who does not pray with his natural voice; he prays with an unnatural tone of voice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a kind of obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>An obsessed person is proud and self-deceiving.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Obadiah 3 says, "The arrogance of your heart has beguiled you.../Who says in his heart,/Who will bring me down to the ground?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One characteristic of obsession is arrogance, pride, and self-deception.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, arrogance, pride, and self-deception can also become causes for obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only a humble person can remove the arrogance that is in him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Mr. Hoste once met a theological professor in his travels who refused to accept the truth of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a kind of obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Another cause for obsession is the rejection of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before we accepted the Lord, we considered ourselves to be wonderful persons.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After we believed in the Lord, we no longer considered ourselves in this way because God's light has entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The same should be true with all spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need light, and we must never be presumptuous.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we were saved, we had many questions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet when God's light shined in us, all of our questions disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In our spiritual pursuit many questions may arise, and we still need God's light to shine on us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not right for a Christian to be in darkness constantly, saying that he does not know or that he is not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have the light of life within us, but we need His light to enlighten us all the time so that we will not fall into self-deception or obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May the Lord deliver us from falsehood and all forms of self-deception.</S>
