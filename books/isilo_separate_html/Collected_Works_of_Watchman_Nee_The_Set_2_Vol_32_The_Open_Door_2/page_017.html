Over forty of us escaped that morning to the mountains. Soon the thatched hut we squatted in was burned, and we had to move to a higher mountain. Two weeks later our lives were endangered again. The brothers and about twenty neighboring families, sixty-seven in all, began sojourning in more than twenty different places. We passed six counties: Lin-An, Fen-Shui, Sin-Deng, Tung-Lu, Jien-Deh, and arrived at Lan-Si. We wandered for one hundred thirty-eight days. Although we suffered all kinds of hardships, we did not lack in food, clothing, or shelter for a single day! (Either brothers in the Lord or outsiders supplied us.) We cannot help but thank the Lord for His great power and grace! Brother Wang Fu-tang was hit by a bullet in the heart. He was able to crawl along for seven Chinese miles and was later moved by his family to Shan-Si-Kou in Sin-Deng. At that time he gave a wonderful testimony for the Lord, saying, "When I was hit, I looked around and could find no friend or relative beside me. My vision blacked out, and I fell on the ground several times. As I crawled for a mile, blood was streaming out of me. I only said, `Lord Jesus, save me. I am satisfied to see Your face.' Then the blood stopped." He has since died, leaving behind his wife and six children. What a tragedy! My nephew Yu Deh-hwa is twenty years old. Since he was taken captive, we do not know whether he is still alive or dead. Please pray for them so that the parents, wife, and orphans of these two families may be comforted. Praise the Lord that He has brought me through this journey to teach me many lessons. I was once short in faith but have now learned something. I was once lacking in endurance, but now I know a little of what endurance means. I thank the Lord the most that, during this national tragedy, I was able to preach the gospel of His grace and was able to go to places where messengers of the gospel had not gone before. I am a most wicked, disobedient, and weak member. God has been gracious to me even though I have doubted Him and slighted Him. When I became helpless, I had to give up myself and trust in Him solely. Hallelujah! The Lord's grace is made perfect in our weaknesses. Peace to you in the Lord!</p><p>An uncomely member in the Lord,<br />Yu Yien-chuan, May 22<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(We published the situation of Brother Yu Yien-chuan and others in Issue No. 2. Fortunately, they are now in Lan-Si. God has cared for them. May He continue to grace them. By the time we proofread this issue, Brother Yu's family will have moved to Hunan&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Chuanchow, Fukien Province</h2><p>Dear Mr. Ke-san:</p><p>Yesterday Brother Kwang-rong (not Brother Kwang-rong in Shanghai) came to Chuanchow with his family; they are on their way to Amoy. Brother Tsi-cheng and his family are also going to Tung-An and Kulangsu. Together with their families there is a total of twelve people with twenty to thirty pieces of luggage. Cars are few and overcrowded; therefore, the journey is impossible for man. It is difficult enough for two to travel. With twelve persons and twenty to thirty pieces of luggage, it is impossible. When I went with them to the station at seven this morning, however, the Lord miraculously arranged for a truck to take them to Tung-An. From there they will be transferred to Ji-Mei. What a wonderful, sovereign arrangement of the Lord! We can truly say that He is our God. No one is responsible in the church in Chuanchow. Please be exercised about our condition, and pray for us. Greetings in the Lord.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Yang Shi-chao, April 19<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
