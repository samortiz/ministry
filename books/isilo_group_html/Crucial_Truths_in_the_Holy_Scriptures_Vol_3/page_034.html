<p>We also must discern the different people in the Bible. We cannot apply the word that was spoken to the Jews to the Gentiles or to the church. We also cannot apply words spoken to the Gentiles or to the church to the Jews. In the Bible there are three kinds of people: Jews, Greeks, or Gentiles, and the church (1 Cor. 10:32). Genesis 1:1 through 11:9 (from the creation of Adam to the calling of Abraham) speaks of all humanity. Genesis 11:10 to Malachi 4:6 speaks of the Jews. During this time the church was a hidden mystery (Eph. 3:9-10, 4-5); consequently, only Gentiles are mentioned in addition to the Jews. The four Gospels are a transition from the Jews to the church. Even though the Jews are referenced in the four Gospels, the teachings in the four Gospels mainly concern the believers in the church because the church would shortly be manifested (Matt. 16:18; 18:17). The church is especially emphasized from Acts 1:1 to the end of Revelation 3. During this time the Jewish nation is temporarily set aside, even though God pays attention to Jews and Gentiles as individuals. Jews, Gentiles, and the church are considered together from Revelation 4:1 to the end of chapter 19.</p>
