   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BURDEN OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is a difference between the burden of the spirit and the weight of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The weight of the spirit is from Satan, and its purpose is to cause believers to suffer; Satan uses the weight to suppress them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The burden of the spirit, however, is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Its purpose is to make known His will and secure the believers' cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The weight of the spirit has no other purpose except to suppress.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As such, it is useless and fruitless.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The burden of the spirit is a burden from God, and its goal is to cause men to work, intercede, and preach for God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such a burden is purposeful, reasonable, and profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Believers must differentiate between the burden in their spirit and the weight in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Satan does not give any burden to the believers; he only surrounds the believers' spirit and oppresses the believers with the weight.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Satan's weight causes the believers' spirit to be bound and their minds to stop functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A person who bears a burden only has to bear the burden itself; but a person who is oppressed is bound in his whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once the power of darkness comes to a believer, he loses his freedom immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, a burden from God is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No matter how heavy God's burden is, it will never be so heavy that a person cannot pray.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The freedom of prayer will never be lost under any kind of burden.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the weight imposed by the enemy takes away the believers' freedom in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In fact, except for some wrestling and withstanding prayers, this weight cannot be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's burden is removed once we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But this is not true with the weight from the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moreover, the weight of the spirit creeps in secretly, while the burden in the spirit is the result of the Holy Spirit's work in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The weight of the spirit is painful and suppresses the believers' life; the burden in the spirit is joyful because it cooperates with God cf.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Matt 11:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of course, the flesh does not feel joyful about the spirit's burden.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, this burden is also painful if one does not meet its demands.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All real work begins first with a burden in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of course, when we do not have a burden in the spirit, there is the need to exercise the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When God wants us to do something, say something, or pray for something, He first gives us a burden in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we know the laws of the spirit, we will not rashly continue on with the work in our hands, allowing the burden to become heavier and heavier.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps when we allow the matter to go on for a long time, the sense for the burden may be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should drop everything and study the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After we understand the meaning of the burden, we should walk according to what we know.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When everything is accomplished, the burden will be gone from us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ordinarily, a believer's spirit must be free and unsuppressed before it can receive burdens from God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only a free spirit can sense the move of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A spirit that has been filled with weight is no longer keen in its intuition and cannot be a good vessel anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many times a believer receives a burden from God, yet he cannot carry out the requirements of the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a result his spirit suffers for many days from the burden, and he is not able to receive any fresh burden from God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, it is very important to find out the meaning of a burden in prayer by the Holy Spirit and through the exercise of the mind.</S>
