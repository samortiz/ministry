<p>Because Jesus was a man with God in Him and one with Him, He was a mystery, even to His disciples. They knew He was human, for they had seen Him eat and also weep. But although He was a man, He did marvelous things, things which no man was able to do. Hence, the disciples must have wondered about Him, asking themselves who He was. One day He asked them, “Who do you say that I am?” (Matt. 16:15). As the One with divinity and humanity, He is a wonderful person; He is altogether a mystery. Our God today is such a God.<p>When Moses received from God the word of warning that was to be given to the children of Israel, he did not know God as the One who had been processed. At that time God was only the perfect God; He had not yet been completed. But the God we know today is different from the God Moses knew. This certainly does not mean that there are two Gods. No, there is one God, but He is in two stages. Moses knew God at the stage when He was only God without being a man. However, we worship God not only as God but also as the God-man. There is a Man in heaven, and this Man is the very God. This is our God, the God of the Christians.<p>Some Christians may not realize that their God is the God-man who has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. After He became incarnate, He lived on earth as the God-man, as God in a man, for thirty-three and a half years. He lived in a carpenter’s home in the despised town of Nazareth. He worked as a carpenter Himself, and in history some have even referred to Him as the Carpenter of Nazareth. He was a carpenter, but He was also the very God. It is almost unimaginable that God was in a man doing the work of carpentry.<p>For thirty-three and a half years the Lord Jesus lived on earth as a wonderful man who was the expression of God. Having passed through the process of human living, He passed through the process of death. He was buried in the tomb, and He entered into Hades, where He remained for a period of time. All this was part of the process of death.<p>After passing through the process of death, the Lord Jesus entered into resurrection where He was released not only in His divinity but also with His humanity. Therefore, in His resurrected being there is not only divinity but also humanity. Everything of the natural state was brought into resurrection. Although no one can understand this fully or explain it adequately, it is clearly revealed in the Bible.<p>As the resurrected One, the Lord Jesus ascended into the heavens, to the highest peak in the universe, and He is there today as a person who is God with humanity (Acts 7:55).<p>As such a God with humanity, He is “condensed” as the all-inclusive, compound, indwelling, life-giving, consummated Spirit. This Spirit is the consummated, processed Triune God. Because He is condensed, it is easy for Him to impart Himself into our spirit. Now He is one with us, and we are one with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). Who, then, are we? We are the enlargement of the wonderful Christ who is the embodiment of God. This enlargement is God’s dwelling, God’s expression, and God’s eternal manifestation.
