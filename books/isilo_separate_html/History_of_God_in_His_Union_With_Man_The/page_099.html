Living a Rejoicing Life</H2><P>Leviticus reveals that we need to live a rejoicing life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Weekly Sabbath</H2><P>The weekly Sabbath (Lev. 23:1-3) was the principal denotation of all the annual feasts. All the annual feasts were a Sabbath, which was for God's redeemed people to rest with God and with one another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Monthly New Moon Feast</H2><P>The monthly new moon feast (Num. 10:10; 28:11-15) signifies that we can experience a new beginning in Christ as our joy and enjoyment with light in darkness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3.

The Feast of the Firstfruits</H2><P>The Feast of the Firstfruits (Lev. 23:9-14) typifies the resurrected Christ (1 Cor. 15:20) for our enjoyment as a feast in His resurrection.

The Feast of Pentecost&#151;of the Fiftieth Day</H2><P>The Feast of Pentecost (Lev. 23:15-21) typifies the enjoyment of the outpouring of the Spirit for the formation of the church in two sections, the Jewish and the Gentile, typified by the two loaves offered to God on that day (v. 17).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_098.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_100.html">Next</a> </body></html>
