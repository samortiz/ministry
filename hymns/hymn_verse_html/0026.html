<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12577' href='#ref_12577'>1 Tim 1:16</a></span> But because of this I was shown mercy, that in me, the foremost, Jesus Christ might display all His long-suffering for a pattern to those who are to believe on Him unto eternal life.<br><b>fn 1 </b>Saul of Tarsus, the foremost among sinners, became a pattern to sinners, showing that sinners can be visited by God's mercy and saved by the Lord's grace.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12578' href='#ref_12578'>Matt 9:13</a></span> But go and learn what this means, I desire mercy and not sacrifice, for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.<br><b>fn 2 </b>Mercy is part of the grace that man receives from God. (See note 16<sup>2</sup> in Heb. 4.) But self-righteous men do not like to receive mercy or grace from God; they prefer to give something to God. This is contrary to God's way in His economy. Just as God desires to show mercy to pitiful sinners, so He wants us to show mercy in love to others (Micah 6:6-8; Mark 12:33).<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_11660' href='#ref_11660'>Lam 3:22-23</a></span> It is Jehovah's lovingkindness that we are not consumed, For His compassions do not fail; They are new every morning; Great is Your faithfulness.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12580' href='#ref_12580'>Rom 15:9</a></span> And that the Gentiles should glorify God for His mercy, as it is written, Therefore I will extol You among the Gentiles, and I will sing praise to Your name.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12579' href='#ref_12579'>Rom 9:21</a></span> Or does not the potter have authority over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor?<br><b>fn 1 </b>This indicates that God chose us that we might be vessels of honor to contain Him. God created man as a vessel to contain Him, and out of the many vessels He chose us to contain Him, the God of honor, that we might be vessels of honor. Finally, He makes known His glory upon us, the vessels, that we might become vessels of His glory (v. 23). All this is out of His mercy and according to His mercy; it cannot be obtained by our efforts. For this reason we must worship Him, and we must worship Him for His mercy!<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12581' href='#ref_12581'>Heb 4:16</a></span> Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help.<br><b>fn 2 par 1 </b>Both God's mercy and God's grace are the expression of His love. When we are in a pitiful condition, first God's mercy reaches us and brings us into a situation in which He is able to favor us with His grace. Luke 15:20-24 tells us that when the father saw the prodigal son returning, he had compassion on him. That was mercy, which expressed the father's love. Then the father clothed him with the best robe and fed him with the fattened calf. That was grace, which again manifested the father's love. God's mercy reaches farther and bridges the gap between us and God's grace.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12582' href='#ref_12582'>Gen 43:14</a></span> And may the All-sufficient God grant you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am to be bereaved of my children, I shall be bereaved.<br><b>fn 2 </b>Or, compassion. While he was being dealt with in the last stage for his maturity, Jacob did not struggle but absolutely submitted to God's sovereignty in his circumstances. He no longer trusted in his own skill and ability; rather, he trusted in the mercy of his all-sufficient God. This shows that he had been fully transformed for maturity.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
