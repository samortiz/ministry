<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(51)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 2, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER B. H.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. When I was young I went with an elderly brother to a church to listen to sermons. The more I listened, the more I became interested. Eventually, I believed in the Lord. I did not know that much about the gospel, yet I knew that something came into me that would never go away. In 1934 I came to the local church and sensed an atmosphere that was full of joy and mutual love. I thought that if this is how it was on earth, it would be even greater when we are in heaven. I attended a meeting by Brother Witness Lee and learned more about my salvation. I began to have a turn. I loved to read books published by the Shanghai Gospel Book Room, and I built up for myself a firm foundation in the truth this way. Later, I began to doubt my own work. I could not see any worth to my work, and it became a burden to me. Although I spent much time searching through the Bible and reference books, it was hard for me to find material for my Sunday morning sermon. I felt dry. When I saw that others had the utterance but I did not, I felt that God had abandoned me. Based on these experiences, it is God's mercy that I could attend this training.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>From your speaking I can tell that you are a clever, logical, and articulate person. However, you have to realize that in the spiritual pathway, we do not receive a word for the sake of meeting the need of the audience, but for meeting our own need. A man can receive general help from God, or he can receive specific help from Him. A doctor can prescribe medicine to you that will add to your nutrition and energy. This is ordinary help. However, if you have a tumor on your finger, you need a specific cure. This is something special. From your testimony I can see that you have received some general help, but little specific help. A man can have a great deal of spiritual appreciation, but little spiritual reality. If he only appreciates, he has probably only touched something in his understanding. You must be enlightened by God to deal with specific issues. If God's light is strong enough, it will kill your problems. Only after your problems have been identified in a specific way, will you find a specific treatment. In Romans 7 Paul did not refer to all ten commandments. Rather, he pointed to the tenth commandment only, the commandment against covetousness, and he dealt with it specifically. Jacob's naughtiness and Peter's boldness were their specific problems. Superficially you do not seem to have any problem before God. In the spiritual pathway, however, we have to ask the Lord to show us our specific problems, and we have to deal with them. Everyone has a peculiar problem, and it is not enough for a person to just continue in his appreciation while never allowing his problems to be touched. Once God works on us and exposes our basic problem, we will be open to His dealings. These dealings will bring in deliverance. Many have said that they appreciate this and that by coming to Kuling. But none of that will do us any good if our particular problem is not identified and dealt with.</p><p>Suppose a man is a robber. We can say that he is a sinner. Suppose another person is a liar. We can say that he is a sinner as well. But these descriptions are too general. If a man is a robber, we should say that he is a robber. If a man is a liar, we should say that he is a liar. This points out what kind of person he is in a specific way; it does not just describe him as a sinner in a general way. I have to name specific sins before I can deal with them in a specific way. While your mind is not very strong, it is still quite strong. You are not that earnest in your seeking. There is more of an element of appreciation in you. Once your need becomes more apparent, you will need specific dealings. General dealings are like window-shopping; your stomach is still hungry after such a trip. You still have to go and find food. Since you feel dry, you should prostrate yourself. Once you realize that you are incapable, you should set your eyes on the Lord. You should not stop at the point of merely appreciating spiritual things with your mind. You cannot fill your hunger by drawing bread on a piece of paper; you still have to eat real bread. Man will gain something only when God's word is formed in him. If you do not have specific problems to deal with, you will not have specific supplies. No matter how beautiful a painter paints an apple, it will never prompt you to eat it. It is wrong to come to the mountain just to appreciate what you hear. If this is the case, you are only a spectator; you are a third party. We need a strong desire to find God's light. Once we have such light, we will be delivered from our problems; we will be brought into His grace, and everything will be fine. Once you experience specific dealings, your pathway will become straight, and the Lord will use you.</p>
