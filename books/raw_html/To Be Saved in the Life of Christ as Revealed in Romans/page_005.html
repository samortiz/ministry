	<h2 class=head2>Through Our Cooperation by Presenting Ourselves as Slaves to Righteousness</h2><p>This dispositional sanctification by the indwelling Spirit takes place through our cooperation by presenting ourselves as slaves to righteousness (Rom. 6:18). In order to be sanctified, we must be righteous. God can never sanctify anyone who is unrighteous. God sanctifies only the redeemed and justified ones; therefore, first we must be redeemed and justified in order to be righteous. Then we are able to be sanctified. Sanctification is based upon righteousness. Thus, if we want to be sanctified dispositionally, we must present ourselves as slaves to righteousness.<h2 class=head2>Through Our Cooperation by Presenting our Members as Slaves to Righteousness</h2><p>We are dispositionally sanctified through our cooperation by presenting our members as slaves to righteousness (Rom. 6:19b). In order to participate in gambling, we must first give our members, our hands, to play the game. But if we have presented our hands as slaves to righteousness, we cannot gamble, because it is not righteous. We need to present each one of our members, not just ourselves as a whole, as slaves to righteousness.<p>When we present our members as slaves to righteousness, we are able to overcome many things. Many of the saints cannot overcome the practice of “window-shopping’’ at the department stores. Often, not having any extra money in the bank saves some from shopping. Although they have very little money in the bank, they still would go window-shopping. Apparently, window-shopping is not unrighteous. But because many items within the department stores are sinful and worldly, window-shopping is actually not righteous. As we walk through the department stores, many items attract us and cause us to present our eyes to these unrighteous things. In order to be sanctified, we need to pray, “Lord, I present my eyes as slaves to righteousness.’’ Then as we present our eyes as slaves to righteousness, the indwelling Spirit prevails to sanctify our eyes. In Romans 6 Paul is very detailed. He not only tells us to present ourselves as a whole, but also tells us to present every member of our body to righteousness. We need to present our whole being, our entire body, and each member of our body, not only to God as the divine person but also to righteousness. As we present our members to righteousness, we are righteous. As a result, God can come in to sanctify us in our disposition. If we present ourselves and our members as slaves to righteousness, the issue is dispositional sanctification (Rom. 6:22).<p>We must present ourselves and our members as slaves to righteousness. This righteousness is Christ Himself. To present ourselves and our members to righteousness means to present ourselves and our members to Christ as righteousness. In the book of Romans, grace (5:17, 21), righteousness (5:17, 21; 6:16, 18-20), and sanctification all are Christ. To present ourselves to righteousness is to present ourselves to the all-inclusive Christ. He is our righteousness, and He is the foundation, the base, for our being sanctified. Without Christ as a base in life, we cannot be sanctified in our disposition.
