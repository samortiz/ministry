   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO REASONS FOR NOT BEING BROKEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why do so many people remain unchanged after being dealt with for years?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Others have a strong will, strong emotions, or a strong mind, yet the Lord can still break them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are two main reasons that many people are not broken in spite of the passing of years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, these ones are living in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They do not see God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is working and breaking, yet they do not know that God is doing the work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are short of light, and they are not living in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They only see men, thinking that men are opposing them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Or they only see the environment, complaining that it is too harsh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They put all the blame on the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>May the Lord grant us the revelation to see God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May we kneel down and say, "This is You.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is You.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I accept it."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At a minimum we have to know whose hand is dealing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At a minimum we have to know that hand and see that it is not the world, our family, or the brothers and sisters in the church who are dealing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to see God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is the One who is dealing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to learn from Madame Guyon, who would kiss such a hand and treasure such a hand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must have this light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to accept and believe everything that the Lord has done.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He can never be wrong in what He does.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Second, a person is not broken because he loves himself too much.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Self-love is a great obstacle to breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to ask God to remove all self-love from us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When God plucks this self-love from us, we have to worship Him, saying, "Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If this is Your hand, I accept it from my heart."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to remember that all misunderstandings, complaints, and dissatisfactions arise from only one thing secret self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because we love ourselves secretly, we try to save ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many times problems arise because we try to save ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who know the Lord go to the cross without taking the vinegar mingled with gall!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many go to the cross reluctantly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They try to taste the vinegar mingled with gall in an attempt to relieve their feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who say, "The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?", will not take a cup that is filled with vinegar mingled with gall.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They only take one cup, not both cups.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These ones do not have any self-love in them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Self-love is the root of our problem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May the Lord speak within us today, and may we pray, "My God!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I now see that everything comes from You.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>My experiences of the past five, ten, or twenty years have all come from You.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All of these things were done with only one purpose in mind that Your life would be expressed through me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have been foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I did not see this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through self-love I have done many things to save myself, and I have wasted much of Your time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today I see Your hand, and I willingly consecrate myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I commit myself to Your hand once again."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>EXPECTING WOUNDS</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No person expresses more charm than one who has passed through such a breaking process.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A stubborn and self-loving person becomes charming after he is broken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Consider Jacob in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He wrestled with his brother from the time they were in their mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was a naughty, cunning, and conniving person.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet he went through many sufferings throughout his lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In his youth he ran away from home and was cheated by Laban for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His beloved wife Rachel died on the way home, and his cherished son Joseph was sold.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many years later Benjamin was detained in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Jacob was dealt with by God again and again, and he met with numerous misfortunes.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was smitten by God time after time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Jacob's history is a history of God's smiting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After repeated dealings by God, he changed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>During his final years, he became a truly transparent person.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>How dignified he was in Egypt when he stood before Pharaoh and spoke to him!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At his deathbed he worshipped God leaning on his staff.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How beautiful this picture is!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How clear his blessing to his children and grandchildren was!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In reading the last part of his history, we cannot help but bow down and worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Here was a matured person, one who knew God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After being dealt with for decades, Jacob's outward man was broken.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In his old age we see a beautiful picture.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All of us have something of Jacob in us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Perhaps more than a little!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hopefully the Lord will find a way through us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May our outer man be broken to such an extent that the inner man can be released and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is precious, and this is the way of the servants of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We can only serve when we have reached this point, and we can only lead others to the Lord and to the knowledge of God when we have reached this point.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Nothing else will work.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Doctrines and theology will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Mere Bible knowledge will not profit us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The only thing that is useful is for God to come out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When our outer man is smitten, dealt with, and humbled by all kinds of misfortune, the scars and wounds that are left behind will be the very places from which the spirit flows out from within.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I am afraid that some brothers and sisters are too whole; they have never suffered any dealings and have never changed in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>May the Lord be merciful to us and set a straight course before us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>May we see that this is the only way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>May we see that all of the dealings that we have received from the Lord during the past ten or twenty years are for achieving this one goal.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Therefore, we should not despise the Lord's work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>May the Lord truly show us the meaning of the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Unless the outer man is broken, everything we have is in the mind and in the realm of knowledge and is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>May the Lord grant us a thorough dealing.</S>
