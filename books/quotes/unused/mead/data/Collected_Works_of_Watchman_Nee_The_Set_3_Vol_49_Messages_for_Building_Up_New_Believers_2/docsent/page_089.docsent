   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. BEING POLITE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One also must exercise politeness in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is repugnant for anyone to be impolite to others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You should treat everyone politely, no matter who he or she may be.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No matter how familiar you are with a friend, you should never give up your manners.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As soon as you give them up, you will lose him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No matter how close you are to others, you will lose them the moment you give up your manners.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1 Corinthians 13 Paul told us that love does not behave unbecomingly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Love does not allow anyone to give up his manners.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Please remember that problems at home often arise because of small matters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is often at home that a person behaves with unbecoming manners.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Most people think that they can throw away their manners because their wife or husband is so familiar to them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Please remember that the joy and pleasure of human relationships have much to do with manners.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As soon as you throw away proper manners, the ugly side of human nature will surface.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No matter how familiar people are with one another, they must maintain proper manners between them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A brother put it aptly once when he said that manners are like the lubricating oil in a machine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The machine will run smoothly only with the lubricating oil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When two persons are together and manners are lacking, friction will arise and uncomfortable feelings will breed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A. Words</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the home, we have to learn to always say, "Thank you" and "I am sorry."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should take care of polite words such as thank you, may I, I am sorry, and please.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you do not know how to use these words, you cannot even make friends, let alone succeed at home.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christians must remember that love does not behave unbecomingly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You must learn to say, "I am sorry," "Thank you," and "May I" at home.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Learn to speak polite words in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>B. Dress</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the family not only must our words be proper and polite, but even the way we dress has to be proper and tidy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everyone wants to dress properly in front of their friends.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But one should dress properly in his family as well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You must dress neatly and be proper with your clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Love does not behave unbecomingly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not be loose through familiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once you become familiar, you become loose, and it is easy to act impolitely.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Familiarity breeds disrespect and contempt.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Husbands and wives are already very familiar with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If propriety is absent, more familiarity will breed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, be proper in the way you dress yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not save your sloppy dress for wearing at home.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>C. Conduct</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One must also be proper in his conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever one serves something, it is best to serve it on a plate and to offer it to others with both hands.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If he has only one hand to spare, he should still be proper in his attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When he passes a knife to others, he should avoid pointing the sharp end at others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When he passes a pair of scissors to others, he should avoid giving the others the pointed end. When he serves others something, he should present it properly and not throw it at them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to pay particular attention to these little gestures around the house.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The difference between throwing something at others and handing it to them is only three seconds.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But what a great difference it makes!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, learn to have manners.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I cannot say that I have known many families, but I cannot say that I have known few either.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When a person is discreet at home, his family will have less problems.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have observed that when a husband and wife are polite to each other, there is more peace and less noise from the plates and chopsticks.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Where manners are wanting and things are thrown around, the family is full of friction.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a husband and wife are polite to each other at home, they will at least be able to maintain a peaceful family.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I believe that if many wives treated their friends the way they behaved in their family, no one would want to come to their houses.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I also believe that if many husbands treated their colleagues the way they behaved at home, none of their colleagues would want to work with them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I want to tell the brothers that their wives have been very tolerant with them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They have tolerated what no colleagues would tolerate.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I also want to tell the wives that their husbands have been very tolerant with them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If they treated their best friends the same way, their friends would desert them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Being impolite is an expression of crudeness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No Christian may be crude.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A person who has learned the proper lessons will never be an impolite person.</S>
