   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Building Up Character</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first thing the deacons should pay attention to is to be dealt with by God in their very person; they have to build up a proper character.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How much have you, the person, been dealt with in the hand of God?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not a matter of finishing a job or of getting things done.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You have to be dealt with and trained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is more important to be properly trained by God than to get things done and finished.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Deacons everywhere often fail to realize this point: The person is more important than the work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Often the work is completed but the person is damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It would be wonderful if both the work and the person were preserved, but if you cannot preserve both, it is better to sacrifice the work than the person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You must always remember that your service is for building up your character.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God does not care as much for the success of the work as He does for the training and dealing we receive from Him in the process of doing the work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His ultimate goal is to succeed not only in the work but also in the perfecting of a group of people through doing this work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A young church often has deacons and elders who do not know what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes things are done, but the character of the persons is not built up, and God is not fully satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I hope that the church in Hong Kong will mature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I hope it will not only get some work done but also perfect a group of people with the proper character.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, you must be built up as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A doctor may start in his profession as a junior physician but will later mature to become a renowned doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His very look will give people the impression of a mature professional.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even a stranger can tell that he is a medical doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>While he is skillful in healing his patients, being successful in his work, more importantly, he has developed the character of a physician in his very being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Exercising to Find the Spiritual Way</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Deacons should not adopt any worldly views in their work; rather, they should have spiritual insight.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In handling of practical affairs, they should look for the spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may be making a chair.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The work is physical, but you should have spiritual insight in your work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some people manage international enterprises, but they do not know God at all.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In managing church affairs, our aim is to know God through the process of our training.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The goal is to touch God and to grow in our spiritual insight.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, the church may assign you to take care of transportation for visitors.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Your view may be absolutely worldly, viewing it as a social function.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The assignment may be carried out properly, but there is no spiritual value in the work and no spiritual exercise in the process.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Transportation is not a spiritual work, but we should make others sense something spiritual, heavenly, and sweet in our transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Personally, I feel that this is a crucial test.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are required not only to exercise our wisdom and ability; we are also tested as to how strong our fellowship and communion are with God and how thorough and intimate our prayer is before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is a place for our wisdom and our method, but the greatest test involves whether or not we live before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not put all the things we are doing before the Lord, the things we do will carry the flavor of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we do everything in the presence of the Lord, our actions will be heavenly, and we will bear a heavenly taste.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to charge all the brothers and sisters to live before the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to carry our burden to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must acquire some experience of intimate and sweet fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should be like David, who sat before the Lord and who fellowshipped with Him in an intimate way 2 Sam 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before we are about to do anything, we should sit in our room and talk with God face to face about it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can present the matter to Him and ask, "Is it right for me to do this?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Should I do it?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we do this, we will receive God's revelation, and we will be clear whether or not we are acting according to His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God will show us if we are too much in one area or not enough in another area.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we can do this, we will touch God's heart even in a small thing like hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should never give people the impression that the church is just a social club, a charitable organization, or a social gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As soon as others touch the church they should sense something heavenly and touch its heavenly nature.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The YMCA has hostels; it treats its guests quite well.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But the church should convey a feeling that heaven is here.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It should draw a line between what is worldly and what is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The difference lies in whether or not the person doing the work is living in the heavenly and spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we fellowship with God and through such fellowship offer our ability and power to God, spontaneously the work we do will bear the glow and taste of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We will not toss the matter back and forth between human hands but will inquire of God as to how the matter should be handled.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we develop this habit, we will know God's will as soon as we put our hand to a work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Spontaneously, we will not work according to our disposition but according to God's disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We work for the purpose of building up our character in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is for the purpose of establishing and maintaining our spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Consider the example of cleaning the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the first day of January, I saw the brothers expressing their love for the church in coming to clean the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But what is the use of such work if all we accomplish is cleaning?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Does not a family or a company make their place spotless when they have their annual cleanup?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If the brothers and sisters, however, pray and fellowship before they clean, this will make a difference in the spiritual flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Not only will the meeting hall be clean, but the brothers and sisters will wash each others' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The same can be said of leading men to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we are short in spiritual stature, the quality of our work will be poor even if we save eight hundred or a thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>No white parents give birth to yellow babies; rather, it is "like father, like son."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In order to train people of quality and spiritual weight, we ourselves must go through training and learn our lessons first.</S>
