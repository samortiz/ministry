   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To cut the word straight is like a carpenter cutting a piece of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A skilled carpenter can cut the wood in the exact shape of the design.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we interpret the Word, we need to unfold it in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. The Experiences of Life</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to practice prophesying, we not only need to learn the truths, but also need to have the experiences of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our prophesying should be enriched with much truth and many experiences of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We would like to point out twenty-two items of the experiences of life which we need to learn.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of Repentance and Confession of Sins</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In addition to this, we must have the experience of repentance and confession of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Though we have been saved and regenerated, we may never have made a thorough confession of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1935 Brother Nee came to my town, Chefoo, and stayed in my home for over one month.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He caused us to aspire and desire to learn how to live a victorious life by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One morning I went to the meeting hall to have a time with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While in the hall, I knelt down and began to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I had been saved ten years earlier in 1925, and I made a confession at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the confession I made in 1935 was much more thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It took me more than two hours to make this confession of all my failures and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That confession was like a thorough shower, washing away every bit of dirt within me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all need the experience of repenting and confessing our sins before God.</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Justification is God's application of Christ's redemption upon us to make us righteous in Christ, to justify us.</S>
