Some have gone to Hong Kong. Some have gone to the countryside. There are a little more than ten people left here. We have stopped all meetings except for the table meeting on the Lord's Day because of the difficulty in transportation. In the past few weeks the brothers and sisters all agreed to resume the Thursday prayer meeting. Even though there are not many people, we are very much in one accord. We used to borrow a brother's house for all the meetings. Last Thursday Brother Shuan suggested that we borrow another house for preaching the gospel and for meetings. We are still praying. If the Lord is willing, He will do it. Please greet Sister Lee and the sisters living with her. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister, Du Ai-jen<br />March 22</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Sister Ro-chen in the Lord:</p><p>There have not been many patients in the hospital recently because of the turmoil. I am not busy at work. I have received God's grace and am physically stronger every day. Thank you for your prayers in love. I often remember you before the Lord. I believe the Lord hears prayer and will give you grace. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister, Liang-yi<br />February 19<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Since the start of the war, we feel we must love the brothers and sisters with the Lord's love. Although our strength is limited, we will not fail God's word on brotherly love if we do our best. We cannot shut our eyes or excuse ourselves from the distress of our brothers and sisters. If we do this, how can we glorify God? I am wiring a small amount of money. Please accept it for the use of the brothers and sisters in need. Our locality has been blessed by the Lord, but we are really lonely. Please pray for us and for the church. Greet the brothers and sisters in Hankow and in all the localities for me.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Yun Fung-zhan<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Hankow</h2><p>I received letters from Brothers Yu Dao-shen and Chu Loh-yuan from Chui-Jia-Juang, Lin-Zi, Shantung. They said, "The meetings in Lin-Zi continue as usual" (March 3).</p><p>Brother Chou You-sheng has found a job in the Hankow Central Savings Association. He was recommended by Brother Timothy Chou (March 11).</p><p>Sister Shang Yee-rong is clear about the Lord's calling and has decided to remain in Hankow. There are now twenty people living in the Gospel Court. All are in the Lord's grace and are getting along fine. Mr. and Mrs. Chang Jing-yu have left Hankow for Szechuan (March 15).</p><p>Two sisters arrived from Nan-Shu-Jou today. One is Miss Yuan Jing-hwa. The other is Sister Wang who wants to go to Siang-Ya Hospital in Ch'ang-sha. Sister Yuan will probably not go any place else. She will settle in Hankow. There are flights on the Hankow-Ch'eng-tu route every day. One can arrive in one day and make a complete trip in two. There is a flight to K'un-ming every three days. The round trip can be made in six days. There is no airport in Kweichow, so the trip must be made through Chungking. It takes more time. The Hankow-Yunnan airline flies every Wednesday and Saturday from Hankow and every Monday and Thursday from K'un-ming (March 18).</p><p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:20, Sister Wu Deh-shin and her elderly mother, Sister Kao, Brother and Sister Pan Hwei-sheng, and Brother Wang Ching-shan were in a group of nine people who took the Hankow-Canton train to Hong Kong. From Hong Kong Sister Wu will return to Tientsin. Brother Wang Ching-shan will go from Tientsin back to Tsinan. Brother and Sister Pan will return to Hwei-An County in Amoy which is their ancestral home. Sister Kao will return to Foochow (March 24).</p><p>Yesterday morning Brother Chu An-kuang brought seven students of the Yih County Agriculture Reform College from Yan-Cheng to Hankow. We have provided them temporary lodging at the orphanage. Each person has to pay X dollars a month for room and board. Brother Tsung Kung and his family of seven have also moved into the orphanage. They pay the orphanage X dollars in room and board every month. We really need to pray for their future and ask the Lord to open a way for them. Sister Liu Su-fang's illness has been healed by God, and she has already returned to Hankow (March 28).</p><p>(The preceding portions are all excerpts from Brother Lan Tsi-yi's letters&mdash;Editor.)</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_108.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_110.html">Next</a> </body></html>
