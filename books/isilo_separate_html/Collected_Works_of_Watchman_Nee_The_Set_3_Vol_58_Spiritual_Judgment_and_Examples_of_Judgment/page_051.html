Y.</h2><p>In the past I was an agnostic, believing in nothing at all. One day I asked myself, "Should I reject everything unreasonably? Is Jesus God?" Once in my distress I called on the name of the Lord Jesus and vented my sadness. Immediately I felt the peace. I was later baptized with little knowledge of what I was doing. At that time I still did not know the meaning of salvation. In spite of this, I began to deal with the sin of lying. However, the more I tried to deal with it, the more I lied. At the same time, my health was deteriorating. I consulted the doctor, who told me that I had tuberculosis and would soon die unless it was properly treated. While I was in the hospital, a voice came and told me that I was healed and that I would completely recuperate in three months. Shortly thereafter I was indeed healed. During those three months I put on over thirty pounds. Later a sister preached the gospel to me, and I was clearly saved. Upon reading some publications by the Shanghai Gospel Book Room, I became clearer about the truth. I often failed in minor sins. One day a thought of quitting everything to serve the Lord came to me. I was not certain about this and inquired of the Lord about three matters concerning this thought. All three matters of my prayers were answered. I often tried to deal with my temper and my tongue, but was never successful. It seems that my temper would go away for a while and then come back again. I struggled but still could not overcome. This brought me to tears many times. I became aware of my own evil. Once when someone spoke about my parents, I became furious. The Lord disciplined me, and I was able to submit myself to Him. Coming to this meeting is a "first time" school experience for me; it is not a "make-up" lesson as it is for some others. The evening meetings are very suitable for me, but I cannot comprehend very much of the morning messages.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Sister Ji has many minor sins that she is trying to deal with, such as temper, tongue, lying, etc. She said that her temper would go away and then come back again and that she was not able to overcome it. I believe this is according to the Lord's counsel. Every one of us has our own characteristics and our own special sins. Our special sins represent our very person. The kind of dealings we need are all different because that which represents our self varies. If temper is our special sin, we have to deal with it. After dealing with it, the other problems associated with us will be dealt with easily. In addition to all the common sins that most people have, each of us has a special sin. Experiencing grace means that we experience grace in that special area. For example, in Romans 7 Paul did not break all the Ten Commandments. He only broke the tenth commandment, the commandment against coveting. In Greek coveting denotes a kind of inward, lustful craving. All other commandments are outward. Only the tenth commandment is inward; it is related to one's motive. Paul did not have any problem with the other nine commandments. Coveting may be too strong a word. Every time Paul tried to shake off his desire or craving, he found this lust still clinging to him. This was a special sin to Paul before he believed in the Lord. It seems that if Paul could have dealt with this one sin, he could have dealt with all other sins. Consider again the example of the young ruler in Luke 18. He could do nothing about his riches. He did not covet others' possessions; he was merely attached to his own riches. This was his special sin. He did not seem to have any other problem. If he could have solved this problem, he could have solved all of his other problems. Everyone has his own "trademark," his own special sin. Once this special sin is dealt with, he is free from sins.</p><p>There are thousands of sins, but each person has one or two special kinds of sins that belong to him alone. Once these special sins are dealt with, the whole matter of sin is settled in that person. Many people are bound or hung up by just one kind of sin. The Bible speaks of one special case&mdash;Jacob. He was a greedy man who would only do things that would profit him. As long as something profited him, he would do everything he could to gain it. When he was born, he held on to his brother's ankle while still in his mother's womb. He was fighting to come out first. In his wrestling with God, it appeared as if God could not prevail against him. God just touched the hollow of his thigh; He did not dislocate all the joints of his body. Once Jacob's thigh was dealt with, his legs became crippled. Jacob's legs represented his very being. God dealt with his strongest part and stripped him of his strength. Every one of us has our own special traits before the Lord. God will identify these traits and deal with them. It is a great thing to know that God is dealing with our special traits. If we can identify the strong areas in our life, we have identified our problem spots. The day we identify these spots is a great day. Everyone should be able to find his own special weakness, his root ailment, his personal typical weakness, the sickness that represents his very being. Only after he finds it will he find healing.</p><p>When we go through dealings, we first have to find the areas in which God is dealing with us. Many people do not know in what area God is dealing with them. As a result, they suffer in vain. There are many kinds of sins, and their ramifications are all different. But with Paul there was only one sin&mdash;lust or craving. The self can be manifested in a thousand different ways, but in the case of the young man in Luke, it was simply the love of his own money. With Jacob it was simply a matter of selfishness. Everyone has a powerful self or a particular sin of his own. If a man does not know where his problem lies, he is far from the day of deliverance. The fundamental problem that I speak about here refers to the special sin that a person possesses, such as an unbridled tongue, self-exaltation, a craving to be the first, etc. When such a person appears, we could say, "Unbridled-tongue or Self-exaltation or Craving-for-the-first is here." These special sins represent the very persons themselves. The Lord can pressure us through our environment in such a way that our special sin, or the two or three particular sins, becomes fully exposed.</p><p>Those who are under the discipline of the Holy Spirit are not necessarily more sinful than others. God deals with a person by concentrating on one or two of his particular sins. When a person is saved, the light of the gospel points to the many sins that he has committed; these are common, ordinary sins. After a man is freed from the general sins, the Lord will point out his special sins to him. This does not mean that he has no other sins. Rather, it means that when he overcomes these basic sins, his other sins no longer will have a swaying power over him. You may say that your basic sin is temper. But to me, it may not be your temper. Temper is only a symptom. The real cause of your sickness can be pride, self-centeredness, subjectivity, self-love, self-confidence, or self-righteousness. Temper is like a fever; it is merely a symptom, not the sickness itself. If we can find out the cause of the sickness and allow God to deal with it, the sickness will be gone. You are clever and articulate, but the Lord wants to point out your underlying problem. Jacob's leg did not need to be completely broken. He only needed one of the tendons of his thigh touched. Then all of his other tendons became as good as dead. Once the Lord breaks our special trait, everything else will be broken. God deals with our circumstances by pointing His finger to the particular spots. Miscellaneous dealings only increase your pride; they do not deal with the fundamental sin. If God can deal with your sin, your special sin, the sin that best represents you, everything else will be over with for you. You will have a way to go on, and you will be able to lead others on. Had the young ruler given up all his riches, he would have been finished as a person, because his money was his very life. Yet this also would have saved him. We have to ask the Lord to show us where our strong point is, what our fundamental sin is, and in what area He is dealing with us. If not, our problem will become the problem of our lifetime. Once that problem is dealt with, all other problems will be settled.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> </body></html>
