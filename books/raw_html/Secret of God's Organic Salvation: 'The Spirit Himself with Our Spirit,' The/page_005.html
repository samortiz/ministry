<h2 class="head2">B. The Sinners Born Anew</h2><p>John 3:3 and 5 tell us that regeneration is to be born anew. The Spirit convicts sinners that they may be born anew of water (the water of baptism signifying death) and of the Spirit (who has sanctified the sinners from among others and who is the reality of resurrection) in their spirit enlivened by Christ in resurrection. The water of baptism indicates that, if we would be regenerated, we must admit that we are good only to be put on the cross with Christ and buried. This means that we are finished and that our past, our history, is gone. Because the Spirit who sanctifies us is the reality of resurrection, when we have Him, we have resurrection. It is resurrection that regenerates us.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Through the Resurrection of Christ</h2><p>Regeneration is through the resurrection of Christ that He may impart the divine life into the lost sinners as the authority for them to be the children of God, begotten of God as His species (1 Pet. 1:3; John 1:12-13). When Christ was resurrected, all His believers, chosen and given to Him by God, were included in Him. Hence, they were resurrected with Him (Eph. 2:6) and regenerated through Him that they may have the eternal life as the authority for them to be children of God as His species. Through regeneration we, who are human, have become God-men; we have become God&rsquo;s kind.</p><h2 class="head2">D. That Which Is Born of the Spirit</h2><p>John 3:6b says, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; <i>The Spirit</i> is the Spirit of God, and <i>spirit</i> is the spirit of a sinner born anew.</p><h2 class="head2">E. A Great Washing</h2><p>Such a regeneration, a new birth, is a great washing, purging the regenerated believer from the oldness of his old creation and reconditioning, remaking, remodeling, our old being in life (Titus 3:5; cf. Matt. 19:28). The Greek word for <i>regeneration</i> in Titus 3:5 is different from that for <i>regenerated</i> in 1 Peter 1:23. The only other place this word is used is in Matthew 19:28, where it is used for the restoration in the millennium. In Titus 3:5 it refers to a change from one state to another. Being born again is the commencing of this change. The washing of regeneration begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit as the process of God&rsquo;s new creation, a process that makes us a new man. It is a kind of reconditioning, remaking, or remodeling, with life.</p><p>No matter how good we may be in ourselves, we are still an old creation. Only regeneration can wash away the oldness of this old creation. When we were regenerated, born anew, born of God, of the death water, we became new, and now regeneration is washing away all the oldness from our being as an old creation.</p><h2 class="head2">F. To Drink of the Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>To be regenerated is to drink the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13) as the living water. First Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body...and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; The Pentecostal people talk much about the baptism of the Spirit but say little, if anything, about drinking the Spirit. To be baptized in water is one thing, but to drink the water is another thing. If we do not drink water, no water can get into us. We should not only be baptized in the Spirit but also drink the Spirit. God&rsquo;s way is to baptize us and then give us to drink. We need to drink the life-giving Spirit as the living water.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Living Water Given to the Believer</h2><p>The Lord Jesus gives living water to the believer regenerated by Him (John 4:10; 7:37). When we were regenerated, He gave us water.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The River of Water of Life</h2><p>The life-giving Spirit as the living water is the Spirit flowing as the river of water of life from the throne of the Triune God (Rev. 22:1, 17; 21:6). Actually, the flow of the Triune God is the living water which constitutes the river.</p><h2 class="head3">3. A Spring Gushing Up into Eternal Life</h2><p>The living water which the Lord Jesus gives to a believer regenerated by Him becomes a spring of water gushing up into eternal life (John 4:14). We need to know the difference between the fountain and the spring. The fountain is the source. When water comes out of the fountain, the water becomes the spring. God is the fountain, the Spirit of Jesus is the spring, and we, the believers, are the ones in whom the spring is gushing up. All this is included in regeneration, because to be regenerated is to drink the life-giving Spirit.</p>
