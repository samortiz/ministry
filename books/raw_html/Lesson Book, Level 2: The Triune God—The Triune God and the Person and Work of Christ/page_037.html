Crucifixion was the cruelest and most shameful way to die in those days. Yet we should not consider the Lord's death as a sad and tragic event. His death was the greatest and most wonderful death in the entire universe. In fact, the cross was the goal of Christ's incarnation and human living. On one hand the Lord was crucified by men, but on the other hand He went to the cross willingly in order to accomplish God's eternal purpose (John 10:15; Heb. 12:2). The cross was where He accomplished all His work of redemption so that man might be brought back to God.</P><P>You probably know that Christ was crucified for our sins. That is wonderful, but His death accomplished much more than that. In order to see this, we will take the next two lessons to look at five things that the Lord was when He died on the cross. The Bible tells us that He died as the Lamb of God, the brass serpent, the last Adam, the peacemaker, and the grain of wheat.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE LAMB OF GOD</H2><P>In John 1:29 when John the Baptist saw Jesus, he proclaimed to everyone: "Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!" When man fell from God, God righteously had to require man to pay for those sins by the shedding of blood (by giving his life). But because of His love, God told the people they could substitute lambs and other cattle as sacrifices for their sins. By doing that, the people were spared from God's judgment.</P><P>Those Old Testament sacrifices were types (symbols) of Christ. God required those sacrificial lambs to be without spot or blemish (Exo. 12:5). We saw in Lesson Fifteen that He was indeed without spot or blemish. Christ came as the real Lamb of God. Before, the people had to offer the sacrifices over and over again. Their sins were not actually taken away; they were merely covered up (Heb. 10:11). But behold the Lamb of God who takes away our sins! Jesus offered Himself once for all (Heb. 9:28; 10:10, 12) for the forgiveness of all (Matt. 26:28). Because we have committed many sins, God requires the shedding of our blood. But Christ shed His blood for us. By believing in the Lord Jesus, we are completely forgiven of our sins and are freed from God's penalty of death!</P><P>God's intention is that we walk in holiness, but we still sin. Sinning can frustrate our fellowship with the Lord, but Christ's death as the Lamb of God fully takes care of this problem. "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9). God is absolutely righteous. Because Christ already died for us, He must instantly forgive us when we confess our sins. Afterward, we should not feel guilty. If we do, that is the Devil's lie. We should tell him, "Devil, you are a liar. I am cleansed by the Lamb's blood. I can fully enjoy the Lord!" This is how we can enjoy Christ's death as the Lamb of God.</P>
