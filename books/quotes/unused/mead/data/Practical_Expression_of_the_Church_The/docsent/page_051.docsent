   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRINCIPLE OF INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to coordinate adequately with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the New Testament dispensation, the Lord needs the human coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we do not render any coordination to the Lord, the Lord cannot do anything, for in the New Testament dispensation there is the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The principle of incarnation is that in everything God is mingled with man, and man is mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man must cooperate with God before the Lord can work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I believe the Lord has been waiting long, even for nearly twenty centuries, for a proper coordination from man!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do you not believe that the Holy Spirit is desirous of having a group of people singing on the streets?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do you think that the Holy Spirit is happy when so many Christians are dumb all the time?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I do believe that the Lord desires Christians singing on the streets as they come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And I believe for centuries He has had this desire, but it has never occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Simply because the human coordination is lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the Lord needed a kind of angelic coordination, this would have been done long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The angels would be so quick to afford an adequate coordination to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But we are so slow, so dull, so sloppy, and so influenced by formal religion that we think that it might not be so nice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only a "bunch of fools" would sing on the streets as they come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must learn to cooperate with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To do this, we must learn to walk in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word "walk" in the Greek language means to do things, to say things, to behave and to have our being, including all the matters of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must walk in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that we must have our being in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must continually behave in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even when we talk to our wife, we must talk in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must not only pray in the meetings in the spirit, but even talk with our wives in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then our spirit will be so exercised and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Any part of the physical body needs proper exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even our mentality, psychologically speaking, needs exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those with a doctor's degree have exercised their minds for many years; therefore, they are so keen in their minds.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But now we need the exercise of the spirit so that our spirit will be strengthened and made strong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do have a spirit; so we must exercise and use it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then not only will our spirit be made strong, but we will be so accustomed to using it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then whatever we do or say will be done or said from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What we need is not to wait for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, but to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Holy Spirit is waiting for us to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is similar to opening a window: when we do it, immediately a draft comes in. If we close the windows and doors and kneel down to pray for a draft, we are utterly foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Lord, I am calling on Thee for the draft; I am waiting for You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I cannot do anything, Lord, unless You give the draft."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is an illustration of the wrong teaching in today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have seen people waiting for thirty years, yet no draft has come in.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The current of the draft is there, but He is waiting for the open windows.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must render the draft adequate coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we simply open all the windows, Hallelujah, the draft comes in!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we exercise our spirit, the Holy Spirit will immediately move; He is waiting within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>So we must use and exercise our spirit all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I believe that this point is clear, but we need much practice.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes saints will ask how to overcome their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Formerly, I told them a certain way, but today I simply tell them to exercise the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you are going to lose your temper, you must exercise your spirit to lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everyone knows that if they will just exercise their spirit, they will not lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That is the way to overcome our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are going to overcome our temper, we must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must even exercise our spirit to laugh or to weep.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All the time we need to practice this one matter of exercising our spirit that it may be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This will prepare us to coordinate with the Holy Spirit.</S>
