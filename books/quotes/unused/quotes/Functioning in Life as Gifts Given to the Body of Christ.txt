The Bible tells us clearly that the church is the Body of Christ with many members, and all the members must function

Sometimes in a Lord's table meeting when all the experienced ones pray, there is the sense that the situation is too old
Mothers know that for children to be naughty is one thing, but for them to do things in the wrong way is another thing; that is not naughty

Our body has to be offered, released, and set free from so many occupations, and our soul, our being, has to be transformed
Our body has to be offered, our soul has to be transformed, and our spirit has to be burning by contacting the Lord
If we are short in any of the above matters related to the body, soul, and spirit, then we cannot function adequately
Someone may say that he has given up his business and is serving the Lord with his full time; thus, his body is released
Someone else may say, 'I am an experienced business man with a lot of knowledge of how to do things, manage, and organize'
If our body is offered, our soul is being transformed, and our spirit is also burning, then we will be able to function
According to this capacity of grace the Lord will give us a certain function as a gift and we ourselves will become a gift given to the Body
We will be filled with grace, and out of this grace and based upon this grace, a certain function will be given to us as a gift
The mothers are occupied by their children, the housewives are occupied by their homes, and the brothers are occupied by their business

Grace will come in to fill us, and from this grace and according to this grace, certain functions will be given to us as gifts
We have to dress ourselves neatly and properly, but we, especially the sisters, should not be preoccupied with our dress
We should care for our dress and use our money and energy only to the extent of being proper and neat, and no more
Sisters, if you love the Lord and if you mean business with the Lord, simply dress yourselves to a proper and neat extent
We should dress ourselves properly, care for our home properly, raise our children properly, and do our business properly
We must always keep a limit, do these things only up to a certain extent, and not be tempted by the enemy to go further
We must keep ourselves within a limit in order to set ourselves free from any kind of occupation or preoccupation

The gifts are the members, the members are produced through regeneration, and regeneration implies all of the above matters
Before we were regenerated, that is, before we were saved, we were sinful, dead, and under the captivity of Satan
How could we get rid of all these negative things, on the one hand, and on the other hand, have the Triune God in us as our life?
Now the effectiveness of His death and the power of His resurrection are all included in an all-inclusive dose
After the Lord's ascension but before our regeneration, Christ still had not received us as gifts in a practical sense

We must realize that now we are members of the Body; we are not a natural man, a person living on this earth merely for this earth
In this case, we need to do something to help this younger brother by having some fellowship about the meetings
We may have a time to pray with him: 'Lord, help us tonight that we may have something with which to express You'
Before we come to the meeting, we can talk with the young brother and help him to know how to choose a hymn and do various things
