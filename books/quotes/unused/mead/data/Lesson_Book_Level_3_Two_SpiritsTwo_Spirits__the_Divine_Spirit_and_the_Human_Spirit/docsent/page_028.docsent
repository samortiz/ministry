   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lesson Eight THE SPIRIT'S WORK IN THE BELIEVERS 2 SANCTIFICATION Scripture Reading 2 Thes 2:13; 1 Pet 1:1-2; Rom 6:19; 8:2, 10;</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 20:22; 1 Thes 5:23; John 6:63; 17:17.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Outline Sanctification The two aspects of sanctification Before justification After justification Positional sanctification Dispositional sanctification Sanctification by the Word and the Spirit Text I. SANCTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sanctification is the process by which something is made holy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many people would say that this means that we should not sin and that we should stay away from evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That, however, is only a small part of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's eternal purpose is to work Himself into us that He may be thoroughly mingled with us and expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When God is born into us, He begins this mingling process.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But this is only the start!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There must be the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we have the birth, but not the growth, we could never enjoy the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is born into our spirit, which is the very center of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then His desire is to spread from our spirit to transform all the parts of the soul, and eventually to transfigure our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By this process our whole being will be saturated and permeated with the essence of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the real holiness and the real sanctification: to be completely mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second Thessalonians 2:13 says, "God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit is sanctifying the believers, separating them entirely for God's eternal purpose; from the day we first heard the gospel the sanctifying Spirit sanctifies us by dispensing the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE TWO ASPECTS OF SANCTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sanctification of the Spirit is of two aspects: the sanctification of the Spirit before justification, the first aspect, and the sanctification of the Spirit after justification, the second aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With the second aspect of the Spirit's sanctification there are two sides the positional side and the dispositional side.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After God justifies us and regenerates us, immediately the sanctifying Spirit continues His separating work upon us and within us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First, the sanctifying Spirit separates us positionally from things that are common and worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This positional sanctification is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Simultaneously, the sanctifying Spirit also begins to sanctify us dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that the Spirit is sanctifying our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the subjective side of the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The subjective sanctification is what we mean by the work of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Subjective sanctification involves the transformation of our disposition and our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, this transformation of our disposition is the dispositional sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
