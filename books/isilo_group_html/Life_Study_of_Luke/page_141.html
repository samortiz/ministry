During the present period of time, which is the church age, faithful Christians will suffer persecution. In verse 12 the Lord says, &ldquo;But before all these things they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, leading you away before kings and governors for the sake of My name.&rdquo; Here the pronoun &ldquo;you&rdquo; refers to the disciples as faithful believers in Christ. The &ldquo;synagogues&rdquo; indicate persecution in the Jewish land, and &ldquo;kings and governors&rdquo; point to persecution in Gentile lands. In verse 13 the Lord says that this persecution will turn out to the disciples for a testimony.</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord Giving the Disciples Utterance</h2><p>In verses 14 and 15 the Lord continues, &ldquo;Settle it therefore in your hearts not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves; for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all those opposing you will not be able to resist or refute.&rdquo; Here the Lord says that our hearts should be settled and should not be in suspense. Neither should we prepare beforehand to defend ourselves. Whenever we are about to suffer persecution, we should not consider beforehand what we shall say. Instead, we should trust in the Lord, for He will give us a mouth and wisdom.</p><p>It is significant that in verse 15 the Lord says, &ldquo;I will give you a mouth and wisdom,&rdquo; whereas 12:12 says, &ldquo;the Holy Spirit will teach you in the same hour what should be said.&rdquo; Furthermore, Matthew 10:20 says, &ldquo;For you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you.&rdquo; According to the record in Mark 13:11, the Lord said, &ldquo;It is not you who are speaking, but the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; These verses indicate that the Father, the Spirit, and the Son, the Man-Savior, are one. When the Father gives utterance, this means that the Spirit and the Son give utterance.</p><h2 class="head2">Hated by All because of His Name</h2><p>In Luke 21:16 and 17 the Lord goes on to say, &ldquo;And you will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death; and you will be hated by all because of My name.&rdquo; Here we see that even family members will cause others in the family to be put to death because of their faithfulness to the Lord Jesus. The Lord&rsquo;s word here is a fulfillment of His word in 12:52 and 53: &ldquo;From now on there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against the mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.&rdquo; Throughout the centuries many families have been divided during times of persecution.</p><h2 class="head2">By Endurance Possessing Our Souls</h2><p>In 21:18 the Lord says, &ldquo;And a hair of your head shall by no means perish.&rdquo; This indicates that nothing of the faithful ones will perish. Therefore, their person certainly will not perish.</p><p>Verse 19 says, &ldquo;By your endurance you will possess your souls.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;possess&rdquo; here may also be translated &ldquo;acquire.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s word here means that the faithful believers in Christ will preserve, save, possess, their souls. Although they may be persecuted and suffer in both body and soul, that suffering will be a salvation to their souls in the coming age. In the next age, when the kingdom comes, their souls will be saved to enjoy the coming jubilee, and they will share in the joy of the Lord.</p><p>In Matthew 25 the Lord says to the faithful ones, &ldquo;Enter into the joy of your Lord&rdquo; (vv. 21, 23). This is the invitation to participate in the Lord&rsquo;s joy. Entering into the joy of the Lord will primarily be an enjoyment in our souls. The unfaithful ones, however, will lose their souls during the coming age. This means that they will lose the enjoyment of the Lord&rsquo;s joy in the millennial kingdom. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s word about possessing our souls by our endurance is related to the enjoyment of the jubilee in the coming age of the kingdom.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GREAT TRIBULATION AND HIS COMING</h2><p>Luke 21:20-27 refers to the great tribulation and the Lord&rsquo;s coming. How long the period of time will be for verses 8 through 19 no one knows. But the prophecy in verses 20 through 27 will be fulfilled in the last three and a half years of this age, the time of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), the second half of the last week prophesied in Daniel 9:27. This period of time will begin with the setting up of Antichrist&rsquo;s image (the idol) in the temple (Matt. 24:15) and will end with Christ&rsquo;s open coming (Luke 21:27).</p><p>Verse 20 says, &ldquo;But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that her desolation has drawn near.&rdquo; This does not refer to the time in A.D. 70 when the Roman armies, led by Titus, surrounded Jerusalem and destroyed it. Verse 20 refers to something that will take place in the future. Antichrist will bring his army to Jerusalem, and the city will be surrounded by this army. Some Bible teachers have not been clear concerning the difference between the surrounding of Jerusalem by armies in A.D. 70 and the surrounding of the city by the army of Antichrist at some time in the future.</p><p>The Lord says that when we see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, we know that her desolation has drawn near. Then those in Judea should flee to the mountains, those in the midst of Jerusalem should get out, and those in the country should not enter into the city (v. 21). All those who remain in Jerusalem will be involved in her suffering.</p><p>Verses 22 and 23 say, &ldquo;Because these are days of vengeance, that all the things which have been written may be fulfilled. Woe to those that are pregnant and to those nursing their babies in those days; for there will be great distress upon the land and wrath to this people.&rdquo; The &ldquo;land&rdquo; here does not refer to the entire earth; instead, it refers to the land of Palestine, to the holy land. The &ldquo;people&rdquo; in verse 23 denotes the Jewish people. The Jewish land and the Jewish people will suffer under the hand of Antichrist. According to verse 24, &ldquo;they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive to all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled by the nations until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.&rdquo;</p><p>Verses 25 through 27 say, &ldquo;And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and upon the earth anguish of nations in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the billows, men fainting from fear and expectation of what is coming upon the inhabited earth; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.&rdquo; These supernatural calamities in heaven will follow the great tribulation at the close of this age. This will differ from the fourth trumpet (Rev. 8:12), which will occur very close to the great tribulation.</p><p>Verse 27 speaks of the Man-Savior&rsquo;s open coming. This is the open aspect of His second coming.</p><p>The Lord&rsquo;s word in Luke 21:20-27 refers to the great tribulation, the destruction of Jerusalem by Antichrist, and to the coming back of the Man-Savior. In the following message we shall consider the Lord&rsquo;s word concerning the disciples&rsquo; redemption and the overcomers&rsquo; rapture.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_140.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_142.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Luke &nbsp; pg 141</div><br></body></html>
