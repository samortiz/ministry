   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST IN GENESIS 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us consider what Christ is in the first chapter of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, there is the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit of God in Genesis 1:2 is the Spirit of Christ, who is Christ Himself Rom 8:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Spirit came, He brought the Word of God, and the Word of God is Christ Himself John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then there is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is also Christ Himself John 1:4; 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit, the Word, and the light are all Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the second day there was the firmament, the dividing element.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the cross, the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Where the cross is, there is always the dividing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At Calvary, on the day of the Lord's crucifixion, the cross was in the middle dividing the saved one from the perishing one Luke 23:32-33, 39-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever we receive Christ and His cross, there is always a dividing element within us to divide the things above, the heavenly things, from the things underneath, the earthly things Col 3:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then, as we have pointed out, on the third day was the land.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The good land of Canaan is the all-inclusive type of Christ Josh 14:1; Col 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's bringing the people of Israel into this land is a type of His saving us from the world and bringing us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is the land in which we walk, that is, in which we live, act, behave, and have our being Col 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is also typified by the trees.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Genesis 2:9 the tree of life is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Exodus 15:23-25 we see another tree.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One day, when the children of Israel came to Marah, they could not drink of the bitter waters there.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jehovah told Moses to cast a tree into the waters, and the waters were made sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That tree is also a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Song of Songs 2:3, the apple tree, which some think is a sort of orange tree, is also a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ezekiel 34:29 mentions "a plant of renown."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This famous plant is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Isaiah 11:1 says that "a twig will come forth from the stem of Jesse,/And a branch from his roots will bear fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both the twig and the branch signify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then in John 15 the Lord told us that He is the vine tree vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>1, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is the reality of the trees.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the fourth day we see the sun as a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is the Sun of righteousness Mal 4:2 with the church, His Body, as the moon reflecting His light and all His members as stars cf.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Gen 37:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then on the fifth day were the fish and the birds.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is typified by a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Leviticus we are told that sometimes the burnt offerings had to be offered with turtledoves or young pigeons 1:14 , which are types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moreover, Christ is also signified by a fish.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In John 6 the Lord fed five thousand people with five barley loaves and two fish vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>1-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The barley loaves are of the vegetable life and signify Christ as the generating life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Fish are of the animal life and signify Christ as the redeeming life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, the living creatures in the water also typify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the sixth day were the beasts, the cattle, and the creeping things on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Revelation 5:5 tells us that Christ is the Lion of the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is also the Lamb John 1:29; 1 Pet 1:19; Rev 22:1, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The creeping things, with the serpent as the leading one, represent the enemy of Christ, but even Christ Himself came in the form of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>John 3:14 says, "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Christ was crucified on the cross, He was in the form of the serpent but was without the serpent's poison.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually, there was the man Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first Adam was a figure of the last Adam, who is Christ 1 Cor 15:45; Rom 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Moreover, Adam as the first man was a figure of Christ as the second man 1 Cor 15:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This gives us a hint concerning how many items in Genesis 1 refer to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The central thought of God is that Christ will be the expression of God through His church, shining all the time in life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Adam was a prefigure, a type, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ is the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Adam had the image of God Gen 1:26 , and 2 Corinthians 4:4 says that Christ is the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ as the image of God is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Furthermore, all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Christ Matt 28:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Genesis 1 is related to Psalm 8 and Hebrews 2.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Psalm 8 the psalmist referred to Genesis 1, and in Hebrews 2 the apostle spoke the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The man in these portions of the Word points to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ is the very man with the image of God and with the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He expresses God and represents God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is everything.</S>
