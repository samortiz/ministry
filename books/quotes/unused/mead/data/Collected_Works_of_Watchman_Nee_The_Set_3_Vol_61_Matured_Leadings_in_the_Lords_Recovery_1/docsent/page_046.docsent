   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WHOLE CHURCH RISING UP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we hand over our all and waste ourselves on the gospel, succeeding generations will have a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our gospel is not an isolated call of individual voices but a concerted work in which we all consecrate ourselves to coordinate and pray together in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do this, all the problems will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Otherwise, the first question that comes to mind will be, "What will be my remuneration?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the future, I hope that we will ask instead, "How will this job give me an opportunity for the gospel?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I hope that we will all consecrate ourselves for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this matter we cannot be sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The whole church has to come solemnly and seriously to God and ask for His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We confess that in the past we have not paid enough attention to the lost souls.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are so exercised in planning and managing worldly affairs, how can we be so sloppy in preaching the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the past too many people have cared only for enjoying the benefit of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the coming days I hope that many will want to share this benefit with others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the last century only missionaries were involved in the gospel preaching in China.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During the last fifty years, we saw the need and effectiveness of the church preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No matter how much we tried, however, only a minority of the saints were involved; the rest did not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today we need everyone to give up everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all need to separate ourselves for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do this, we will see the whole church rising up to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There will not be just three or five individual preachers; the whole church will be preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The gospel will spread throughout China.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No sacrifice is in vain as long as we can gain men's souls.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The entire world cannot match the value of one human soul Matt 16:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the future the selection of all our occupations has to revolve around the gospel and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As long as something is good for the gospel, it is worth paying any price for.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Miss Hann was a nurse supervisor, but she decided to move to Yi-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Liu is an internist, but he also moved to Yi-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Humanly speaking, Yi-Yang is a wasteland for good nurses and doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But it is not a waste at all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our going is different.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A good nurse and a good doctor care for the gospel and for souls.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What good does it do if you heal a person's body but allow his soul to go the way of destruction?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are not asking you to hand over your possessions as the first thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are asking you to first hand over your future, your job, and your work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you hand yourselves over, you are not handing yourselves over to me; I cannot bear that responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You are handing yourselves over for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Perhaps ten or twenty years from now, the responsible brothers will tell you to leave Hong Kong to go to another place for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You have to say, "Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since the whole church has this feeling, I am willing to go.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If other children of God call me to go to another place, I am willing to go there as well."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church must live before God and know His will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It has to pray about many things and wait on God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church cannot be sloppy; it has to trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You should give yourself to Hong Kong first, and then you can give yourself to other places.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One day you will be able to send men to the mainland.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The entire Southeast Asia lies before you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God has a free way in Shanghai already.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He will also have a free way in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hangchow handed itself over, and Yi-Yang was brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If Hong Kong hands itself over, I do not know what will be brought forth in Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Presently, the immediate need is for a big meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not think that as long as we can meet in two sessions on the Lord's Day, we have solved all the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God's blessing is related to our capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we have a meeting hall that will hold a thousand people, we have to believe that God will send us the people; they will fill up the hall.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Perhaps after you gain this first meeting hall, five other or nine other halls will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once we hand ourselves over, we will see God's great blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Perhaps we still do not realize how great a hindrance we are to the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When God's grace and mercy break out, blessings will flow everywhere in the church, and all the problems will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In order for the whole church to rise up to serve, we have to cut off the wasted hours in our occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we hold back anything, the church's prayer will not be effective, and souls will not be added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we are desperate, God will have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do not be afraid of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whatever the price may be, we have to charge forward.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Please forgive me for saying what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I hope this word will not hurt anyone's feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You have to come together to pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May the Lord give all of us no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May He not let us go easily.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>May none of us go on carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>May all of us be very clear about what we are doing; that is, may we know the reason we are doing what we are doing and to what extent we should do it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>May God encourage us to give all that we are and all that we have to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I believe one day the church will reach the standard of the first apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then the day of the Lord will be near.</S>
