   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Lord Taking the Way of Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is something I would like all of us to see: In this end time, God is doing a work of recovery; He is taking the way of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe God is leading all of His children up to this position in this last age.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here is one segment of the pathway of the church that is waiting for a fundamental recovery the universal priesthood of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As long as a person is one of God's people, he should be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are priests today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the kingdom to come, there also will be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God wants to secure His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He wants all of His people to be His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE SERVICE OF THE PRIESTS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As soon as you become a Christian, you become a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you want to be a Christian, you have to be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not expect anyone to be a priest for you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You have to be a priest yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is no intermediary class among us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No one will attend to spiritual affairs for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No one will work for us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Among us we must not have another class of people called workers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A. The Need for the Whole Church to Serve</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If God is merciful to us, all the brothers and sisters will spontaneously be working, preaching the gospel, and serving the Lord together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more universal the priesthood is, the more visible the church will be.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once the priesthood becomes non-universal, we have failed and our pathway has been corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>B. God Honoring Us by Allowing Us to Serve Him</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are poor, weak, blind, and crippled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For the Lord to accept persons such as ourselves to be priests is an honor to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Old Testament, such people could not be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All who were disabled, lame, or blemished could not be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, today the base, the unclean, the blind, and the disabled have all been called by God to be priests!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have said this before: We should gladly give ourselves to His service even if it means crawling to His feet to beg for service.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should be happy to kneel down to beg for this honor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am happy to crawl on my knees and plead with the Lord, "Lord, I want to serve You.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I gladly offer myself to Your service.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You honor me by allowing me to come to You."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be a priest is to draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be a priest is to have no distance between us and God; it is to be able to enter in directly and to wait for no one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be a priest means that we can touch God ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>C. God's Kingdom Realized</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Everyone Serves</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If one day all the brothers and sisters in all the churches rise up to serve, the kingdom of God will come among us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It will be a kingdom of priests; all the people will be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I look forward to the day when all idols are removed from among us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before the Lord, we should pay whatever price it takes to achieve this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Levites paid the price; they were faithful in setting aside their personal affection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only such people can have a share in the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>D. The Basis of the Priesthood</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's Acceptance</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to fully understand the priesthood, we need to understand the way God dealt with the priests in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is a great matter for God to allow a person to draw near to Him without being smitten.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only the priests could eat the showbread, serve at the altar, and enter the holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only they could offer the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Others died when they entered the holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God's acceptance is the basis of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since God has accepted us, should we not enter in today?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Formerly, anyone would die if he dared to enter in. But today God says, "You can come!" How strange it is if we still feel reluctant to come.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>E. God's Mercy Enabling Us</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>to Serve in Grace</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need the Lord to open our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is grace in its highest form for a person to be given the privilege to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who really know God will say, "The grace that allows me to serve God is greater than the grace which brought me to salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The dog under the table can eat the crumbs underneath the table, but it cannot serve at the table.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To be saved by grace is relatively simple, but not everyone can serve by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today in the church, everyone who is saved by grace can also serve.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is foolish not to consider this to be a great grace.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>F. Rejecting the Principle</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>of Having an Intermediary Class</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today's Christianity acknowledges the presence of an intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christianity as we see it today even divides God's priests and God's people into two classes.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We look forward to the day when there is no more hierarchy among us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There may be one or two persons in the church who have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But the principle does not change.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Today it is fashionable in Christianity to compromise principles.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In principle, today's Christianity has fallen and has taken the way of the Israelites the people and the priests have become two.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>May we not fall into such a system!</S>
