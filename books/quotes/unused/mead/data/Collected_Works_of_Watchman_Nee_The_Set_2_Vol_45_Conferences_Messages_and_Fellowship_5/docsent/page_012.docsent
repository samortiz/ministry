   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE A TALK WITH THOSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHO ARE ABOUT TO BE BAPTIZED Date: 1940</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Unrecorded</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's children are those who are joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The result of God's salvation is to join men to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a man is not joined to Christ, salvation counts for nothing, and the Christian life means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Redemption has its basis in Christ's union with man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The most important concept in the Bible is that of union.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This union has nothing to do with understanding some doctrines; it has to do with the revelation of the reality of our union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a Christian sees this, he will spontaneously become a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If he does not see this, he is dead and has no involvement with Christ in life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>IN ADAM</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The matter of union is revealed throughout the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Genesis Adam and Eve sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible says that all have sinned through one man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It does not matter how we have conducted ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Adam sinned, all of his descendants sinned as well.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The veil to the Holy of Holies was embroidered with four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These four living creatures signify the whole creation, while the veil signifies the body of Christ Heb 10:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This tells us that the whole creation was joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When His body was broken Matt 27:51; Heb 10:20 , the whole creation went through God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He accomplished redemption for the whole creation Heb 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Leviticus tells us that the offerer had to lay his hand on the offering before it was offered up as a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was a sign of the union of the offering with the offerer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Joshua 4 the Israelites took twelve stones from the river Jordan when they crossed over.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We find reference to the matter of union everywhere in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Union is a very basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the New Testament, 1 Corinthians 15 speaks of the first man and the second man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first man is Adam, and the second man is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The second man is the last man; after Him, there is no third man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a fact in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In His eyes there are only two men Adam and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A person is either in Christ or in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Consider the insects.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One little insect soon propagates itself into dozens of insects.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are identical to the one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not kill the one little insect at the beginning, it will propagate itself into a big colony.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Adam was the first "insect."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who came after him are the descendants of Adam; they are the same as he.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When a man is born, his parents give him a name, which is his given name.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His family name never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His family name is the same as that of his ancestors.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everyone derives his heritage from his ancestors; everyone inherits his life from his ancestors.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All the descendants of Adam have inherited the Adamic life of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since every descendant of Adam has inherited his sinful life, what must God do to save man?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He does not save us individually one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He does not deal with us as individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, He has put us all into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All He had to do was to deal with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God caused Christ to bear our sins, die for us, and resurrect for us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In dealing with Christ, God dealt with us all.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is a pregnant sister from Changchow who once lived in Kulangsu.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Later, her child was born in Changchow.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Has the baby ever been to Kulangsu?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Of course he has.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He was in Kulangsu when he was in his mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Adam and Christ are both originators; we are in either one or the other.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Before we were saved, we were in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All of Adam's experiences were our experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After we are saved, we were put into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All of Christ's accomplishments have become our experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the way God deals with us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>OF GOD WE ARE IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some may ask, "How can we be in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He was crucified two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At that time I was not even born.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How can I be in Christ and be crucified with Him?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We can consider the following illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When I was a child, my aunt once gave me a ten-dollar bill, and I put it into the pocket of my long gown.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When I sent the gown to the cleaner, I forgot to take the money out.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>By the time I discovered it, the money was ruined from being washed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The one who washed the gown did not have any intention to wash my money, but it was washed when the gown was washed because it was inside the gown.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Consider this hymnbook.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Suppose I slip a piece of paper into this hymnbook and mail it to Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Where will the piece of paper be?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Is it possible for the book to go to Nanking and for the paper to remain here?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>No. Although I am sending the hymnbook to Nanking, the paper will arrive when the book arrives, because the paper is inside the book.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If I throw the hymnbook into the river, the paper will be thrown into the river as well.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If I snatch the book out of the water, the paper will be snatched out of the water also.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The experience of the hymnbook will be the experience of the paper, because the paper is in the book.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If I, Watchman Nee, can put a piece of paper into a book, is God not able to put all of us into Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is something very easy for Him to do.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He has put us all into Christ 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Hence, whatever God has done in Christ has been done in us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When Christ was judged by God, we were all judged as well.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When Christ died, we died as well.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>All the experiences of Christ have become our experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This shows us that union is the underlying principle of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Our redemption is based on our union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We receive all the benefits of salvation by being in Christ and joined to Him.</S>
