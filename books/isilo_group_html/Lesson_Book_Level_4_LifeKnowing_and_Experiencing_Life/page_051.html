THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SIN AND THE WORLD</h2><p>The contamination of sin and of the world differ. [The contamination of sin is savage, rough and ugly, while the contamination of the world is cultured and refined, often appearing beautiful in the sight of man. The contamination of sin is like a splash of mud or black ink on a white shirt. But the contamination of the world is like a colorful pattern printed on the white shirt.] [The world appears better than sin, but when related to purity, both are contaminating and require dealing. The damage caused by sin and the world upon man differ greatly: sin contaminates man, whereas the world both contaminates and possesses man. It is far more serious for man&#8217;s life to be possessed by the world than to be contaminated by sin.]<p>[Sin is the primitive, superficial, and initial step of the fall. The world is the final, serious and last step of the fall. Many people stress only victory over sin, but the Bible stresses even more the overcoming of the world (1 John 5:4). We need even more to overcome the world. If we desire to grow in life and be gained by the Lord, we must make an effort to deal with the world that enslaves us.]<h2 class=head1>II. THE FORMATION OF THE WORLD</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Man&#8217;s Need</h2><p>The Bible [divides man&#8217;s needs into three main categories: provision, protection, and pleasure. In order to maintain his existence, he needs not only the various provisions, such as clothing, food, etc., but also a means of defense to protect himself from being hurt and a form of amusement for his happiness. Therefore, the entire need for human living is included in these three all-embracing categories.<p>Prior to the fall, God was responsible for providing for these three needs of man. First, before man was created, God had made provision for all necessities of human life. When Adam was in the garden of Eden, various kinds of fruit and vegetables, water, air, sunshine, and a place for shelter were provided.<p>Second, protection or defense was also God&#8217;s responsibility in the beginning. Today, man needs self-protection and self-defense, but in the beginning God Himself was his defense and protection. When man is under God&#8217;s care, he can escape any attack or danger.<p>Third, pleasure was also God&#8217;s responsibility. Some people think that amusement is sinful, but this concept is wrong. Happiness is essential to human life and is found in amusement. &#8220;And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food&#8217;&#8217; (Gen. 2:9). All the trees in the garden of Eden not only bore fruit for food, but were also pleasing and enjoyable to the eye, making one happy. God not only prepared this happy environment; at the same time He Himself was the joy of man. If man has God as his enjoyment, then man&#8217;s joy is fulfilled.<p>In the beginning these three great needs-supply, defense and amusement-were planned and prepared for by God.]<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 4: Life-Knowing and Experiencing Life &nbsp; pg 51</div><br></body></html>
