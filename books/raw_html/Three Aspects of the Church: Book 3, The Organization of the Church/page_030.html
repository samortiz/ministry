	 <h2 class="head2">Not Being Unified in Finance</h2>
<p>The Lord has truly been merciful to us regarding the matter of finances, and by His mercy our finances are not organizationally unified. No one can tell us how much is received in offerings each month from all the churches. We also have no way to find out how much a particular brother receives. The general practice in Christianity is to unify and centralize the finances and then distribute them to others. Thus, people know exactly how much a certain mission or work receives each year. Although we may see a monthly financial report from a church, we have no way of knowing the amount enclosed in the envelopes that are designated for individuals and the amount given directly to the needy saints. This is proper. There is no unification or human control, and everything is under the authority of the Holy Spirit. This should be the principle of how we handle matters in the churches.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Having a Central Church or Person</h2>
<p>Why should people be sent out from Taiwan? This concept carries the flavor of unification. Why are people not sent to Taiwan from Hong Kong and other places? The brothers in Taipei should be able to write a letter to the brothers in Hong Kong, saying, &ldquo;We need some of you to come here.&rdquo; We must not have the concept of a central church. Initially, we did not have this concept; however, it is possible that a kind of mixture has been brought into the church, that is, the concept that a certain local church is the center.</p>
<p>In principle, no local church is the center, and no person is the center. Our unique center is Christ our Head. All the churches should fellowship with and supply one another mutually, but we should guard against any suggestion that bears the flavor of unification. It is not fitting even to give people the impression that we might be unified. If any person or local church among us gives people the wrong impression, leading them to believe that he or the church where he meets is the center that controls everything, this is absolutely wrong. Everyone and every local church must be rescued from such an error.</p>
<p>The church does not have any center on the earth. If it had a center, it would be the heavenly Jerusalem (Heb. 12:22). On the earth the church does not have any center. Moreover, no man is the center of the church. If such a person rose up, God would surely remove him. This kind of thought, view, and concept must be eradicated completely from among us.</p>
<p>The church is different from a worldly organization. In worldly organizations there is unification. Each organization is three-dimensional, having different levels, some higher and some lower. However, the churches are completely flat, that is, on the same level. Every locality is on the same level, and every region is on the same level. The work in the Gentile region was not under the work in the Jewish region. Neither was Paul under Peter or Apollos under Paul. Although Peter was the leading apostle in the Jewish region, James took the lead in the church in Jerusalem. Although Paul was the leading apostle in the Gentile region, Apollos was not always under Paul.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there is order among the members of the Body. However, the order in the Body is limited to the members. There is no order among the churches. In this matter we have to be very careful. If we fall into unification, we will deviate. Once there is unification in regard to finance or the move in the work, the church has deviated. The natural man likes unification. When all the churches are unified and all have the same practices, it is easier to accomplish things. Nevertheless, this is not a proper condition. It is an erroneous condition.</p>
<p>The light in the Bible is very clear in regard to the administration of a local church being one. It is also very clear in regard to the work in a region being one, but there is no ground for a universal unification. For example, the administration of the local church in Taipei should be one. If it is not one, there will surely be chaos. It is the same in regard to the church in Tainan. Its administration should also be one. Moreover, if there is a group of co-workers serving the Lord together in a certain region, it is proper for the work in that region to be one. In other words, administrative oneness is permissible on a small scale but not on a large scale. There is absolutely no worldwide unification. We should never suppose that all the churches should practice the same things that the church in Taipei practices. If a brother who is an elder in the church in Taipei goes to Hualien, he should not assume that he will be an elder there. This is a wrong concept.</p>
