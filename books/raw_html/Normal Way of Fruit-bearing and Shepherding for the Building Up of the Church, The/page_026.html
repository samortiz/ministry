 <h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS<br />
IN OUR CHURCH LIFE AND SERVICE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Making Demands on Others<br />
or Judging Them Superficially, but Knowing Them according to Their Deeper Condition</h2>
<p>We often expect that others will change according to our concept and standard. Rather, we should always go along with others; then there will be no problems. If two brothers live together, one may like to rise early, but the other may rise up later. In this case, the one who rises earlier should sacrifice his way. Then one day the second brother may begin to rise even earlier than the first one. This illustrates that to contend about the right way is not necessary. On the day of resurrection two disciples were going down to Emmaus. When the Lord Jesus joined them, He did not say, &ldquo;You are going the wrong way. This bothers Me, and I cannot go along with you unless you turn around. Since you are My disciples, you should go along with Me.&rdquo; In terms of right or wrong, those two disciples were wrong. However, the Lord Jesus did not say anything about it. Instead, as they were going down, He went down also (Luke 24:13-15). Then He acted as one who did not know anything, asking, &ldquo;What are these words which you are exchanging with one another while you are walking?&rdquo; (v. 17). One rebuked the Lord Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Do You alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem and not know the things which have taken place in it in these days?&rdquo; (v. 18). To be sure, Jesus knew much better than they did. If we were the Lord Jesus, we might have said, &ldquo;Do you not know who I am? I am that person whom you are talking about.&rdquo; Instead, the Lord Jesus simply went along with them to a certain place, and when they arrived, they stopped to eat. The Bible does not tell us how, but at that time their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him. Then the Lord disappeared, and the disciples rose up and returned to Jerusalem (vv. 28-33).</p>
<p>This account of the Lord Jesus in Luke 24 illustrates that we should not make demands on others. The brother who likes to rise early should simply go along with the one who sleeps longer. If the first brother is not already a sloppy person, then sleeping longer for the sake of the other brother will not make him sloppy. Instead, his sleeping later will be for a proper reason. Then there will be no arguing between the brothers. Shallow persons see things only according to their appearance and endlessly fight over them. We should not see things in a shallow, childish way and consider whether someone is right or wrong. Perhaps we are wrong, and perhaps someone else&rsquo;s way is better than ours. We should be patient for a while and wait to see the real situation. To criticize people is to judge them, but who are we to judge? How do we know that we are right and others are wrong? To judge quickly is superficial, and to say absolutely yes or no is childish. What is right or wrong does not depend upon what is on the surface; it depends upon what is deeper. We must learn to know people according to their deeper condition. If we do this, then by the Lord&rsquo;s grace there will be no problems among us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Having a Definite Way in the Service<br />
but Going On by Prayer and Fellowship</h2>
<p>In the church service we do not always need a definite decision about matters. In many matters we may not know what the right decision is. In almost all the Lord&rsquo;s work concerning the church affairs, we are like Abraham. When he was called, he went out, not knowing where he was going (Heb. 11:8). He did not have a definite decision. Rather, what he had was the Lord&rsquo;s presence step by step. If we go on step by step without a definite decision but with a praying spirit and a spirit of depending one upon another, the Lord will lead us. This is the best way to go. It is not good always to have a definite way in our service. It is better not to have a way. Then we will pray more, seek the Lord, depend on the Lord, and fellowship with one another.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Insisting That Others Remain<br />
Where They Are Assigned in the Service</h2>
<p>If someone feels that it is better to serve in a different area than where he is first assigned, it is better to let him make the change. After he makes this move, he will better appreciate where he should be. No one should have too strong an assurance that his feeling is right. Perhaps to move to another service group is right. Only the Lord knows, and even if we do know, we should still not insist that we are right. Eventually, the brother will learn the proper lesson, and if he was wrong, he will come back. It is better to be spontaneous and not insist on anything. Then we will not cause problems. If we insist that the brother remain where he was assigned in order to learn a lesson, it may be we who need to learn a lesson. We should never insist in this way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Participating in Any Negative Talk</h2>
<p>We should never participate in criticism, complaining, or arguing. To receive such negative talk is to be a &ldquo;trash can.&rdquo; If others criticize or speak in this way, we should excuse ourselves in a nice way. The more we allow ourselves to be involved with complaining, arguing, or vindicating, the more we are contaminated and receive the poison of death. We should stay away from this kind of talk. Then the next time people come to us, they will come without this kind of criticism. They will simply come to fellowship and pray. This is the proper way to shepherd one another.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Making Proposals,<br />
but Accepting Others&rsquo; Proposals<br />
in Order for Everyone to Learn the Lessons</h2>
<p>Our basic need is to learn how to be the priests built up in oneness. The way we do this depends on our spirit. We must have a spirit of not dissenting and not showing that we are smarter than others. Then we must also try not to propose other ways to do things. To propose other ways always sets up a bad example for others. In the church life, the best way is not to propose anything. If the &ldquo;steering wheel&rdquo; is under our hand, others should listen to us, but if it is in someone else&rsquo;s hand, we should not try to drive.</p>
<p>If someone genuinely asks us for a proposal and he truly needs it, and if to make a proposal does not set up an example of dissension, it may be the right time to do something. Whether or not to propose something depends on the situation and on our spirit. However, if someone else is taking the lead, we should listen to him. In this case, even if our proposal is better than his, it is better not to say anything in order to keep the standard of oneness. As long as we keep the oneness, we will save much time and be saved from many things, but if we lose the oneness, we will suffer loss in many ways. We may gain something in one way, but we will lose in many other ways. In general, therefore, it is better not to propose anything. Then we will gain and not lose. Still, if someone does propose something, we should go along with it. In this way everyone will learn. If we never do what someone proposes, he may not learn the lessons, and we ourselves may not learn anything either. When the real nature of the proposal comes out, everyone will learn something.</p>
