   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-ONE THE BELIEVERS THEIR PRESENT 55</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider two further aspects of the believers' experience of the dispensing of the divine Trinity: fighting the good fight and running the course of the race. e. Fighting the Good Fight</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2 Timothy 4:7a Paul says, "I have fought the good fight."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This good fight is against Satan and his kingdom of darkness for the interest of God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1 Timothy 6:12 Paul refers to this fight as "the good fight of the faith," that is, a fight for the contents of the complete gospel according to God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1 By Receiving the Apostle's Charge</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The believers fight the good fight by receiving the apostle's charge.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Timothy 1:18 says, "This charge I commit to you, child Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that in them you might war the good warfare."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to consider Paul's use of the word "charge" here in the context of the chapter as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The charge in verse 18 covers the main points presented in the previous seventeen verses.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the positive side, the main point of these verses is God's dispensation; on the negative side, it is the differing teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, the charge given by the apostle to his spiritual son concerns the dispensation of God positively and the differing teachings negatively.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because of different teachings, the church had already become degraded, and a deviation from the faith had taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul charged Timothy to fight against this deviation from the faith, that is, to fight the good fight for the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 18 Paul says that he committed the charge to Timothy "according to the prophecies previously made" concerning him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It may be that some prophetic intimations were made concerning Timothy when he was admitted into the ministry Acts 16:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul charged Timothy to war the good warfare in the prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means in the sphere, support, and confirmation of the prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul told Timothy that in the prophecies previously made he "might war the good warfare."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To war the good warfare is to war against the differing teachings of the dissenters and to carry out God's dispensation 1 Tim 1:4 according to the apostle's ministry concerning the gospel of grace and eternal life for the glory of the blessed God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>11-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand, Timothy was to war against the differing teachings of the dissenters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the other hand, he was to carry out God's dispensation according to the apostle's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we wish to carry out God's dispensation, we must not do it according to the teachings of traditional Christianity nor according to systematic theology but according to the apostle's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All true apostles teach and preach the same thing, even the one thing God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The focus of our preaching and teaching is Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To teach and preach God's economy concerning Christ and the church is to war a good warfare.</S>
