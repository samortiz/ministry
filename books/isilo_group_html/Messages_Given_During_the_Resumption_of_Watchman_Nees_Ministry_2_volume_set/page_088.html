What I will speak to you tonight will not be related to anything spoken before or afterwards. The first thing I would like to speak to you is that every redeemed person is part of a holy priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5). Here in 1 Peter it does not say a clean priesthood, but a holy priesthood. To be holy means to be separated, to be set apart.</P><P>Second, the spiritual sacrifice mentioned in Romans 12 refers to our bodies. The first thing that the priests have to offer is their bodies. Such a sacrifice is reasonable. Not only is it a reasonable sacrifice, but it is one that makes you feel comfortable. The life that a person receives from his mother's womb, the first life, has its needs. When a person eats, drinks, or exercises, he feels happy. In the same way, the life that a person receives at regeneration, the second life, also has its definite needs. It needs to serve the Lord. If a person has to mop the floor, the mopping nevertheless makes him feel happy within. Even if he is to clean the toilet, he would do it happily. Any service that would make a person feel happy is definitely a reasonable service.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING OF THE SERVICE</H2><P>Among all the spiritual things that the Holy Spirit has led us to know, do we know this one particular thing&#151;the service? We have been taught concerning how to save souls and how to help others to be delivered from sins. But do we know what is the meaning of service?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Priestly in Nature</H2><P>The service in the church is not prophetic in nature, but priestly in nature. If the service in the church is prophetic in nature, then all the brothers and sisters would have to be prophets. In the Old Testament, the service of the priests consisted of putting forth the showbread, lighting and dressing the lamps, burning the incense, and slaughtering the bulls and goats for others. Today's service in the church consists of living before God, speaking for Him, and ministering unto Him in the many small and miscellaneous affairs. In the denominations, only the pastor gives the message. The janitors are only the menial laborers. But the service in the church is composed of the speakers, plus the piano players, plus the janitors, plus the window cleaners, and so forth. Our work today is to bring in the church service. The church service is not prophetic in nature, but priestly in nature. The speaking occupies only a small portion of the work, and the speaker is but one of the members.</P><P>The service of the priests included the emptying out of the animal refuse. In principle, it includes cooking for others, doing the laundry, and so forth. All these are the work of the priests. The priestly services have to do with miscellaneous works.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Consecrating Oneself to Be a Living Sacrifice<br>for the Satisfaction of Both God and Man</H2><P>To offer up sacrifices is to offer up food for God. What is God's food? God needs to eat and to drink; He has His food in this universe. In every age, God desires to gain some men who would consecrate themselves to Him. If no one would consecrate himself to God, God would be hungry. If no one would pour Himself out to God, God would be thirsty and unsatisfied. Many revival meetings use Romans 12:1 to exhort people to offer up themselves, and at the end of the exhortation they would add the words, "Be a preacher!" But after a person has become a preacher, God may be even more hungry and thirsty. Only sacrifices satisfy God. The demand within us is God's demand; our inner man represents God. When we serve God, we are satisfying God. What is the meaning of a living sacrifice? A sacrifice should be one that is dead, but a living sacrifice means sacrifices that are offered up to do some works. While you serve and work, your spirit will become enlivened through your working.</P><P>Our service to the Lord is expressed in the smallest matters. The Lord asked Peter to fish. This was a small matter, but the principle involved is the same, and that is to satisfy man. The Lord turned the water into wine and fed the five thousand with loaves, both of which are small matters. The goal of these works is not to satisfy the physical life, but to satisfy man's spirit. If a man is hungry, he can eat later. Even if he does not eat, it is still all right. The question is not one of outward eating, but one of the Lord's being satisfied and man's being satisfied through the small matters. This is the principle of service. In itself, service is a small matter, but it satisfies both God and man.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_087.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_089.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 88</div><br></body></html>
