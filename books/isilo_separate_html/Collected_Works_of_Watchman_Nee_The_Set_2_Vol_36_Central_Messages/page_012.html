God has put His very own being, with all that His nature possesses, into Christ, His Son, and through the Son, He has given everything to us. When God gives us Christ, He gives us everything related to Himself and His nature. Through His death on the cross, Christ completed in His flesh all the steps that were necessary for us to receive God and all that His nature possesses. Through resurrection, He has passed  into the Spirit, and through ascension, He has descended in the Holy Spirit into all those who have believed and received Him.</p><p>God in Christ has accomplished everything concerning our salvation, and in the Holy Spirit, He has wrought these things into us. Everything concerning God and His nature is in Christ, and everything has come into us through the Holy Spirit. God is in Christ, Christ is in the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is in us. When we receive the Holy Spirit, we receive Christ, and when we receive Christ, we receive everything concerning God and His nature. Since we are joined to Christ in the Spirit, everything that Christ has experienced and attained, such as death, resurrection, ascension, and entrance into glory, is our experience and attainment. Hence, everything concerning God and His nature and all of Christ's experiences and attainments have become ours! God's salvation has given us all this! We have received everything that God will give to us and has done for us. We do not need anything more. The question before us now is whether or not we realize what we have received. May we follow the apostle Paul to have such a prayer for revelation!</p><p>Witness Lee</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
