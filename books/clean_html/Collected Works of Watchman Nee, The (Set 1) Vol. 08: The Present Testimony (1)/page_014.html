<H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN OPEN LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 3</H2><P>Our heart is full of a sense of gratitude as we send out another issue of The Present Testimony. Although it is not a great work of any kind, it is a testimony for Jesus. In the matter of serving Him, nothing is too small or unworthy of our labor. It is quite amazing to consider how men like us could serve Him. Grace saves us, and it is also grace that gives us the privilege of serving the Lord.</P><P>Presently, we are still in a time of waiting. God is still examining our living so that the sacrifice of the burnt offering will not have any blemish. We enjoy proclaiming the grace and mercy of God, but toleration of any unrighteousness was never the intention of God's grace and mercy. When we put our past living and work in God's light, how ugly and detestable our flesh is! Although we would rather avoid it, we must not be afraid of knowing the self too thoroughly. God has many words to speak; our duty is to listen quietly.</P><P>Sister Lee and Sister Wang, two sisters in our midst, are still in the area of Amoy, working in the name of the Lord among the sisters. We thank the Lord that He has used them. Although the meetings have not been great or widely publicized, God has been using them to perfect His daughters and to simultaneously release many who were bound by evil spirits. One brother said in a letter, "Thank the Lord, who through His sent ones at this time is releasing quite a few." Certainly, only the truth can set people free. Since they have not yet returned, those who are bearing the responsibility before the Lord to pray should continue to do so.</P><P>Finally, concerning the publication of The Present Testimony, in these few months we have really seen the hand of the Lord, confirming that our move has been of Him. Letters of testimony from various places have increased our strength quite much. Our hope is that we may be an up-to-date testimony for God in these end times. We are deeply thankful for all the help from God's faithful stewards. Although this is a heavy burden (in the first month 2,000 were printed and in the second month 2,500), as yet there has been no hardship. If God's grace has been trustworthy in the past, then in the future also it will not fail. May God bless you all!</P><P>One with you always,<br>Watchman Nee<br>June 1928</P>
