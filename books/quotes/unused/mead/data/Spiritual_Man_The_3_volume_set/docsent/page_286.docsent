   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A MIND FILLED WITH THE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God said, "I will impart My laws into their mind" Heb 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to read the Scripture more and memorize the Scripture more so that we do not have to search the Bible in times of urgent need.</S>

   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we need light for our walk, we will remember a word in the Scripture immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many believers do not like to read the Bible with their mind; they just like to flip through the Bible arbitrarily after praying and take whatever they find as being from God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They do not realize that this is very unreliable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If our mind is filled with the Word of God, the Holy Spirit will enlighten our mind in an instant through the intuition and cause us to recall an appropriate verse which will show us what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not need any man to tell us not to steal because we know that this is in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This word is already in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we can be one with the Bible in this way in other matters, we will know God's will in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A CALL FOR A PURIFIED MIND</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Believers should continually ask God to purify their mind and keep it fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should ask God to wash out all our bad thoughts and vain imaginations toward God so that what we believe will be fully in accordance with the eternal will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should ask God not only to make us think about Him, but also to make us think about Him in the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should ask God not to let any thought issue from our evil nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If there is any such thought, we should ask that God's light shine upon it and terminate it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should ask God to keep us from coming up with any special doctrines according to our old concepts, which would divide the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We also should ask God to keep us from accepting, through the mind, any special teachings that would separate us from the other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should ask God to cause us to have the same mind as others, waiting patiently in any matter that we have not arrived at a oneness of mind with others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should ask God to keep us from using the new life to sustain a wrong thought or teachings that proceed from such thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should ask God to help us die not only to our evil nature, but also to our evil thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should ask God not to allow our thoughts to be the cause of division in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should ask God to keep us from being deceived again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should ask God to cause all of His children to live by Him so that they will no longer be scattered, damaging one another and wandering about, and so that they will all have the same mind as well as the same life.</S>
