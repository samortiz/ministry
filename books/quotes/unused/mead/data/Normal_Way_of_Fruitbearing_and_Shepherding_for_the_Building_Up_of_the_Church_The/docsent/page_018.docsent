   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEALING WITH OUR NATURAL DISPOSITION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BECOME FLEXIBLE IN CARING FOR PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must all be tested by the church life, by fruit-bearing, and by lamb-feeding because these are the three matters that kill our natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church life is a killing, not of the good things but mostly of our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Likewise, fruit-bearing and lamb-feeding are a killing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All these are killing knives for our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Passing through these three tests causes us to become right, because after passing through them we become persons who have dealt with our natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then we will be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To care for little children requires much flexibility.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Any mother who is not flexible should not expect to have good children.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Her children will all be damaged by her inflexibility.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To bear fruit among our in-laws, cousins, and schoolmates requires us to be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not speak of inconvenience or say that we do not have time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether we have time depends on our desire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may illustrate this by the need to answer correspondence.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the early years of my work, I would often apologize for not answering people sooner, telling them that I had been too busy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, something within condemned me, saying, It is not because you were too busy; it is because you did not have the desire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everyone is busy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even a sister with no husband, children, job, or school can stay busy every day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She can tell people she does not have the time for this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is absolutely due to our dispositional inflexibility.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are not flexible, we cannot bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to bear fruit, we need to be flexible, available at any time, and never claiming to be too busy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should always have time to talk to people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we wait until we have time to help people to be saved, we may wait forever.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have all been cheated in this regard.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have said, This week I am very busy; let me see how next week will be, but the next week we are busier and have even more things to do.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the following week is worse, and we are never free.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Being busy or available is a matter of our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we first need a thorough dealing with the Lord, and then we need to become available, flexible, and fully dealt with in our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>RECOMMENDING JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>AS THE ATTRACTING ONE TO PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once we have had a thorough dealing with the Lord and have become flexible, we need something in our daily living that attracts and convinces people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The disciples mentioned in John 1 were brought to the Lord by being attracted to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First, John the Baptist said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! v. 29 . Later he recommended Jesus by saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>32-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jesus is the Lamb to take away the sin of the world, and He is the One with the dove to baptize people so that they may receive God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These are the two attracting factors of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Spirit of God always works through these two attracting features.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Immediately after this attraction through recommendation, two of John s disciples followed Jesus vv.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>35-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first was Andrew, and the second should be John, the writer of this Gospel, although he was humble and did not mention himself by name.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These two stayed with Jesus that day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At that time, because they were impressed, Andrew went to his brother Simon and brought him to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When He saw Simon, the Lord changed his name to Peter, which means a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then three disciples were there with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After this, the Lord Jesus went on a little farther, and He met Philip, who was of the same city as Andrew and Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>39-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In actuality, this is inaccurate, since Jesus was born not of Joseph but of Mary, and not in Nazareth but in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was a kind of wrong doctrine that caused Nathanael to ask, Can anything good be from Nazareth? v. 46a . Sometimes we are like Philip, giving wrong information about Christ and even about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, Philip was wise not to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If he had argued, he no doubt would have lost Nathanael.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, he learned from the Lord Jesus, who had told the disciples, Come, and you will see v. 39 . To see is much better than to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, Philip told Nathanael, Come and see v. 46b . Nathanael came, he saw Jesus, and he was seen by Jesus vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>47-48 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this way all five disciples were caught by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By this we can see that Jesus is the attracting One.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now this Jesus must be lived out in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In our daily living there should be One who is attractive and convincing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even if we give people the wrong information, we can still learn to say, Come and see.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have something better than a correct teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I have One for you to see.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to attract people in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many of us think that if we pray and have a proper daily living, those whom we bring to the Lord will be caught right away.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we had only John 1, we may think that Peter, Andrew, and the others immediately followed the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, this is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we read the New Testament carefully, we will see that the Lord Jesus went a second time purposely to catch the disciples Matt 4:18-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Peter, Andrew, John, Philip, and Nathanael were all from Galilee, but Jesus first contact with them, in John 1, took place in Bethany on the east side of the Jordan, far to the south of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In His first contact with Peter, Andrew, and John, Jesus did not call them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Rather, they all went back to Galilee to work at their jobs Peter and Andrew to fishing and John to mending nets with his brother James.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This was their old situation and old life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This indicates that even the Lord Jesus did not call people in a quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>By this time they may have forgotten the Lord, but the Lord never forgets anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He knows where they are.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>No one came to report to the Lord, Jesus, do You remember those men you met at Bethany?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They are all fishing and mending.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Go to call them!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Rather, the Lord Jesus already knew that they were there.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In Matthew 4 we again see the attraction of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>According to John 1, Jesus was the attracting One as the Lamb of God and the One with the dove, but Matthew 4:16 says, The people sitting in darkness have seen a great light; and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, to them light has risen.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>While walking on the seashore of Galilee, Jesus from Nazareth was a great, shining attraction.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In this way Jesus went to the four brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>His shining attracted them, and they immediately followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS THE ATTRACTING FACTOR</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>TO GAIN PEOPLE IN A NORMAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Jesus calling of the disciples was not something miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We should not believe in a miraculous way.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Instead, we need to have a proper living with the Lord and contact people as the Lord leads.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Then people will be attracted to the Lord to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Not everyone will be fully attracted at the first contact.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Many will need another contact, and some may need many contacts.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Andrew, Peter, and John were called only on their second contact, but some of the early disciples may have been caught by the Lord only after several contacts.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The principle is that we should not expect people to be caught by the Lord immediately in a miraculous way.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We should not care about how quickly they will be caught.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We simply need to have a proper, daily Christian life and the experiences of Christ as the attracting factor.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Because we have experienced Christ as the Lamb of God taking away our sins, the Baptizer with the dove, and the great light shining over us, we have Christ in His many aspects as the great attraction.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This will attract people not to ourselves but to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Still, this does not mean that everyone who is attracted will be caught right away.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In many cases it will take time for people to be gained.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We must all go to the Lord to have a thorough dealing concerning our Christian life and our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>How much we can attract people depends upon how much experience we have of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Therefore, fruit-bearing should be a practical part of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If we are all built up in this regard, we will spontaneously bear fruit each year.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Whether we bear one fruit or several in one year, we will all be fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The leading brothers should help the saints to be built up in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We all need to be built up in this kind of Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We should not take the situation in Christianity as our standard; it is absolutely abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Some never preach the gospel, and some preach in a foolish way, dreaming that something miraculous will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The proper way to bear fruit is to realize that we need a daily living as the branches of the vine, absorbing all the riches of the fatness, the life-juice, of the vine, the rich life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Then spontaneously we will have an overflow of the divine life, which will result in fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Every fruit will come from the overflow of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Then the church will grow not only in life but also in numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This is not a kind of movement or organization.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>It is the growth and spread of Christ as our inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Christ grows in us, and He spreads out from us and through us to others.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>This is the proper way to have fruit-bearing in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>This requires much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We must all pray: Lord, day and night grant me a proper, recovered Christian life so that I may constantly enjoy the riches of Your divine life to bring forth fruit by the overflow of Your rich life.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Then we need to fellowship with one another and learn the lesson to be flexible toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>In this way, none of our relatives, neighbors, schoolmates, colleagues, or friends will be neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>They will all be cared for by us.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Whether or not they have been predestinated is up to the Lord s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>We do not know this.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Nevertheless, they will all be cared for by our fruit-bearing life.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>We will bear fruit among all the persons we know year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>This is altogether the way the church will grow, not as a movement or so-called revival but by our proper, daily, fruit-bearing living.</S>
