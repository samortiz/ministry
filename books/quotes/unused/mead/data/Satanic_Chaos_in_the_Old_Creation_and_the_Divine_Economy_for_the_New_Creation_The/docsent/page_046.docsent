   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We have seen in the previous chapter that there are four races in the eyes of God the Adamic race, the Abrahamic race according to the flesh, the Abrahamic race according to the Spirit, and the overcoming race.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today we are near the end of a period of six thousand years since the creation of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The age of the race of Adam lasted two thousand years up to the time of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Adamic race, the first figure was Adam and the last main figure was Nimrod, who built up Assyria with Nineveh as its capital and Babylon with Babel as its capital.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Babel was the end of the age of the Adamic race.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then God selected Abraham out of the idolatrous people of Chaldea, the site of ancient Babylon Gen 15:7; Acts 7:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The age changed from the race of Adam to the race of Abraham according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This age also lasted two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first figure of this age was Abraham and the last main figure was John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John the Baptist was a person in a time of transition from the Old Testament age to the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Old Testament strongly prophesied concerning him Isa 40:3; Mal 3:1; 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He should be considered as both the last one of the age of the race of Abraham according to the flesh and the first one of the age of the race of Abraham according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Abraham was called by God, God told him that his seed would be as the dust of the earth Gen 13:16 and as the stars of heaven 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This meant that God would give Abraham two kinds of descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The descendants of Abraham according to the flesh are as the dust of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These descendants are countless since there is no way to count the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Abraham's other descendants are as the stars of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These are his spiritual descendants, the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Galatians 6:16 Paul refers to the spiritual descendants of Abraham in a collective way as the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the real Israel Rom 9:6b; 2:28-29; Phil 3:3 , including all the Gentile and Jewish believers in Christ, who are the true sons of Abraham Gal 3:7, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From the divine viewpoint, the Adamic race occupied two thousand years of history and the Abrahamic race according to the flesh also occupied two thousand years of history.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The spiritual descendants of Abraham as the spiritual, heavenly Israel have now occupied almost two thousand years also.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, God's economy has been among the human race for three periods of time two thousand years for the race of Adam, two thousand years for the race of Abraham physically, and about two thousand years for the descendants of Abraham spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the history of mankind from the divine view.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No secular historian would tell us that human history is divided into these three periods of time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, human history will enter into another age.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That will be the age of the millennium, the kingdom of one thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The main thing in the approximately six thousand years of human history is the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because we are near the end of this six thousand year period of time, we are at the threshold of the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's economy has passed through almost six thousand years of human history.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During this period of time, God's enemy, Satan, has done all that he can to frustrate the carrying out of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The book of Job shows us that along with the divine economy, there is also the satanic chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Job 1:6 says, "Then one day, when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, Satan also came among them."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Satan was permitted to enter into God's dwelling place in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Job then goes on to tell us about Jehovah's conversation with Satan vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>9-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Satan was given the permission to touch all of Job's things, except his life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This shows that God does have an adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This adversary always comes alongside His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Where the economy of God is, there is also the satanic chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The divine economy and the satanic chaos can be seen from the first chapter of Genesis to the last chapter of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When God created the heavens and the earth, the angels were stirred up to sing and shout for joy Gen 1:1; Job 38:4-7 , but right away Satan rebelled against God, bringing in chaos Isa 14:12-15; Gen 1:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This story of the divine economy and the satanic chaos has been going on and on throughout the history of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The New Testament opens with Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God becoming incarnated to be a God-man John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What a wonderful thing the incarnation of the Triune God was!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But immediately after His incarnation, there was the satanic chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Herod sought to kill Christ in His infancy Matt 2:1-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even in the new heaven and new earth, there will still be signs of the satanic chaos and the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The big sign, the unique sign, of God's economy will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Outside the city is a "trash can" which is called the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The lake of fire is a strong sign of all the chaos from generation to generation throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For eternity there will be two things a city of water and a lake of fire, signifying God's economy and Satan's chaos.</S>
