It may surprise you, but this ending begins with the book of Acts and continues right through the book of Revelation!
Though the completing writing was done by Paul, damage came in, and there was therefore the need of John's ministry to repair the damage
In Acts the first book of the ending of the Bible the church comes into existence and in the final book Revelation the New Jerusalem appears
If we take a bird's-eye view of the books from Acts to Revelation, we shall find that the church and the New Jerusalem stand out the most
There in the Jordan River, right after He was baptized, God anointed Him with the heavenly oil, that is, the Spirit
Two or three months after the election, there is an inaugural ceremony, when he is inducted into office and officially begins his duties
He is the same Christ, but our enjoyment of Him differs according to our knowledge, appreciation, and experience of His different aspects
From now on you must look away from the manger and away from the carpenter's home and see Christ on the throne in the heavens!
If your appreciation of Him is linked to the throne, this will uplift the experience you have of Him in your spirit
On the day of Pentecost Peter said, 'God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ'
He has passed through the manger, the River Jordan, and the cross, and is now enthroned in the heavens as the Christ
When Peter said He is Lord of all in the house of Cornelius he meant that He was Lord of all peoplesboth Jews and Gentilesand of all things
The Greek word translated here as Prince is used only four times in the New Testament and always in reference to Christ
It has been translated a number of different ways in various versions, because there is no precise English equivalent to the Greek
Christ in ascension is the Captain of our salvation, leading us into glory where He has already entered as the Pioneer
To be our source of faith and to lead us in the pathway of faith are functions of the office into which He has been inaugurated!
He has taken office as the origin and the Originator, the Ruler, the Author, the Leader, the Captain, the Pioneer, and the Forerunner!
Although the title Savior is applied to Christ in His earthly ministry , He was not officially the Savior until His ascension
Christ appears before God on our behalf, praying for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God's eternal purpose
In Hebrews 8:2 Christ is called 'a Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man'
It is common to call Jesus the King of kings, but to call Him the Ruler of kings is to say that He is far above the earthly rulers
When Christ was raised from among the dead, God 'subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church'
Do not weep one of the elders told him the Lion of the tribe of Judah the Root of David has overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals
From Revelation 4 and 5 we learn that when Christ ascended, He went directly to the throne at the center of the universe
The four living creatures, the twenty-four elders, myriads of angels, and all other creatures are wide awake, alert, observing
How marvelous it is to be in the light and to see this heavenly view which is hidden from the eyes of most Christians!
Afterwards there would be about one hundred thirty saints going on a trip to visit the churches in the Far East, including Manila
Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
The Lord's charge to the disciples to preach the gospel was a reflection of the authority He had been given both in heaven and on earth
We were all attending college at the same time, seriously pursuing the knowledge of science, politics, and economics
From our research we came to know what Christianity was, and the Lord opened our eyes to see some light in His Word
Our only burden was for this people, but we did realize that what the Lord had shown us would one day be brought to the Western world
Some day, we believed, the circulation in the Body which had begun from the West would flow back with something from the East
He arranged international events so that we had to come to the United States, even though this was far from my intention
The financial needs would be supplied by some quite wealthy brothers in the northeast of China, which is Manchuria
My dreams for the Three Norths Corporation vanished, though there were some seventy saints who did migrate to inner Mongolia
Even atheistic countries, like Russia and China, use this calendar, thus implying that they are under Christ's sovereign ruling
One day in Tsingtao, a former German concession and a beautiful modern seaport, over seven hundred were baptized
You were born in the right country, the right town, the right family, and at the right time He brought you to Himself
When Stephen was stoned to death, Jesus was standing at the right hand of God , watching over and caring for His members
Some of you will go to Austria, some to Greece, and some to Israel with the heavenly ministry of the ascended Christ!
In the Far East there are churches in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia
When Christ ascended to the heavens, He gave gifts-apostles, prophets, evangelists, and teachers and shepherds
These gifts perfect the saints, so that in every local church the members are edified, equipped, and qualified to function
While we are meeting here, receiving what is ministered out of Him, He is ministering there, taking care of all the members of the churches
On the other hand as the Head of the Body He is ministering to edify equip and qualify His members so that they in turn may perfect others
He has been directing the affairs of all the nations for the spreading of the gospel and the gathering in of God's people
He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints'
Saul must also have thought on the Lord's words, 'Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do'
Rather than tell him what to do directly the Lord would send Ananias a small disciple to restore Sauls sight and make His will known to him
Perhaps a year or two later, the Lord simply sent him out with the other eleven, and from that point on he and they were apostles
We know nothing of this little disciple prior to this occasion, but the Head knew him and told Saul he would come
Saul straightway preached Christ in the synagogues, thus arousing the opposition of the Jews, who finally plotted to kill him
Another member, Barnabas, came into the picture, recounting to the apostles how Saul had been genuinely converted
Barnabas brought him to Antioch, where they stayed for a year, meeting with the church and teaching the people
Ephesians 4:8 tells us, 'Wherefore He says, Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men'
In His ascension Christ exercised His headship to direct His Body, having one member do one part and another member fulfill another part
Such an operation is not of Christ's move as Ruler; this is a work under His headship, bringing His whole Body into a fine functioning
You must realize that, for this to take place, the Head in the heavens must exercise His headship toward many members in His Body
Pentecostalism is a movement, not the fine work in life that the Head exercises to touch His members one by one in detail after detail
You have gone to the Lord and praised Him for bringing you out of darkness, for touching your heart, and for enlightening you
Whatever part of the Body we are, we shall receive a supply from the Head in order that we may function to minister life to the Body
All this activity is part of Christ's heavenly ministry, causing all His members to grow and function that His Body may be built up
The activity of the physical body under the direction of the head corresponds to the heavenly ministry of Christ as Head
The references in the Epistles, in contrast, illustrate the growth and function in life, rather than a move in life
What is revealed in Ephesians and Colossians is not a move for the gospel, but the growth and function of the Body
For people to be brought to the Lord requires a move in life; for the Body to be built up, the growth and function in life is needed
The move in life to bring people to the Lord is outward, but the growth in life for the building of the Body is inward
Suppose Philip at that time had been away loving the world, Ananias had fallen into sin, and Peter had gone back to Galilee to go fishing
When He said to Philip, 'Go near, and join thyself to this chariot' , Philip ran there and heard the eunuch reading Isaiah
As it was, Peter, just before the men arrived, was also praying when the heavenly television transmission came to him!
Words are inadequate to convey what is meant by this growing up into Him, but perhaps some examples may help us to grasp the thought
You may be willing to grow into the Lord in everything else, but in the matter of your marriage you would retain yourself
In your prayer earlier you were corresponding to Him, but now your desire to go shopping has annulled that corresponding
Sometimes it is in the big things that we find it hard to grow into the Lord; many times, however, it is in the small things
Whether the matter is big or small, if we do not grow into Him in that thing, our corresponding to Him is arrested
He also wants our response that we may grow up into Him so that something of Him may come forth to supply and build up the Body
Millions of people have been brought to the Lord, but because they have so little growth in life, there is very little building
It is my burden that regarding this aspect of the Lords move in the heavens there may be a finer deeper correspondence to Him on our part
The first set of seven Epistles deals with three main points: Christ living in us, the all-inclusive Christ, and the church
In actuality, it is more accurate to say that its message is that God has transferred us out of Adam and into Christ
Through our parents we were born in Adam, but when we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were transferred out of the first man and into Christ
With such a vast Christ to be enjoyed, Paul 'determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified'
As we look unto Him and reflect Him, we are being transformed into His image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit
Paul warned the Galatian believers that if they tried to keep the law, they would be brought to nought from Christ
If they turned back to these they would be deprived of all profit from Christ and so separated or severed from Him making Him void of effect
He is all-inclusive, He is the reality of all positive things , He is now our life , and He is all and in all in the new man
You may be approached by some who will ask you what the meaning is of the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls
Of caring for Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit, the divine life, and the church, they talk about the seventh day
It is only when you hold the Head that you are kept from such distractions and can correspond to the ministry of Christ in the heavens
The reason so few Christians correspond to Christ's heavenly ministry is that they have been distracted from holding the Head
When Christ offered Himself on the cross to God for us, He was a priest, offering on the earth in the outer court
In the Old Testament the high priest Aaron could sympathize with the people but many times he could not help them because he was not divine
The priesthood of Christ is 'not according to the law of a fleshy commandment, but according to the power of an indestructible life'
It is Christ Jesus Who died, but rather Who was raised, Who is even at the right hand of God, Who also intercedes for us'
If we had time, we could hear testimony after testimony of how the help has come, not so much from the outside as from within
He is the Son of God the Son of Man the Captain of our salvation the Apostle sent from God to us and the real Joshua bringing us into rest
One day, perhaps while you were far away on a mountaintop, the thought came to you, Why not go back to the church?
After picturing for us our High Priest caring for us in our weaknesses, the writer of Hebrews then exhorts us to come to the throne of grace
If we stay here a while, we shall have the sense that something from the throne of grace flows into us, through us, and out of us
Though none of this can be seen with our physical eyes, our spirit senses that something is going on in the Holy of Holies for us
He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, seeing He is always living to intercede for them'
Our High Priest, in contrast, is 'holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens'
Rather than the weak men who served as high priests under the law, our High Priest is a 'Son, Who is perfected forever'
In Hebrews 7 through 10 Christ is presented in a threefold way: as High Priest, as Minister, and as Executor of the new testament
While Christ is carrying on His priestly work, He is also executing the new testament and simultaneously ministering its contents to us
After the fall God came again to speak to him, this time promising that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent
In modern terms it is a will, a written legal statement for the distribution of the enactor's property upon his death
The entire Bible is actually God's testament; its two parts are even called the Old Testament and the New Testament
If we get others to talk to us, we may be able to induce them to promise us something they had no intention of promising
As long as they are quiet, we cannot ensnare them; but when they speak, we may be able to get a commitment from them
In this covenant some things are yet to be done, and some have been accomplished already and have been bequeathed to us
Because of His death, the promise has been consummated, the covenant has been established, and the testament has been enacted
We have, then, four stages in God's speaking to man: His speaking, His promising, His covenant-making, and His testament-executing
By the execution of the new testament by the heavenly Christ, He is making all the items listed therein real to us
Or in a third case, the heir may be too weak to lay claim to his inheritance, even though he is mature and wise
In all these cases, someone is needed to help the intended heir gain possession of what has been bequeathed to him
As the Executor of the new covenant, He is still ministering to strengthen, comfort, supply, sustain, and even bear you
There is the exercise of His rulership, the exercise of His headship, the priesthood, and the execution of God's will and testament
Now that everything has been accomplished through Christ's death, it is a testament or will, with every item of its content bequeathed to us
By this means He dealt with our sins, overcame Satan, terminated the whole old creation, and solved all the problems
The book of Hebrews tells us that Christ is High Priest, not according to the order of Aaron, but according to the order of Melchisedec
Now that this has been accomplished, Christ in resurrection is the heavenly High Priest, according to the order of Melchisedec
Christ is now doing in the heavenlies what Melchisedec did for Abraham: He serves us with a life supply for our need
The true tabernacle is the heavenly Holy of Holies, where Jesus has entered within the veil as our High Priest
We need this Executor to interrupt our begging prayers and remind us, 'Why are you praying in such a pitiful way?
When we were in Christianity, we may have heard about Daniel's seventy weeks, the ten horns, and the four beasts
As the Lord in the heavens, He is the electricity in the power plant; as the Spirit in our spirit, He is the electricity in this building
There is a continual transmission between the heavens and our spirit, so that whatever transpires there is immediately applied here
Doctrinally, we have no satisfactory explanation for this twofold reality; from our experience, however, we do have the confirmation
He is also the Mediator, transmitting what you need from God the Father, who is the source, into your spirit to supply and support you
We have been sustained preserved and supplied by His interceding His executing the testament and His ministering to us what we have needed
In the ancient time the high priest took care of the lampstand, seeing that all the lamps were trimmed so they would keep shining brightly
The leading ones in the churches are likened to stars, shining in the heavens during the darkness of the night
He it is who is now holding 'the seven stars in His right hand' and walking 'in the midst of the seven golden lampstands'
The scene changes from Christs tending of the lampstands to a door opened in heaven and we are shown what must take place after these things
Christ is presented as the redeeming Lamb who is the Victor, qualified to take up the new testament, open it, and execute it
The new testament in the Epistles of Paul is mainly for our enjoyment of the riches of Christ which have been bequeathed to us
In this testament are also the matters of God's dealing with different peoples and even with the heavens and the earth
The Jews, the heathen nations, and Christendom will all be dealt with, and God's kingdom ushered in on this earth
In chapter seven Christ as God's Angel controls the whole universe, directing the other angels to carry out God's judgment upon the earth
After thoroughly judging this evil religion, He will overcome Satan and establish the millennial kingdom on earth
Even now Christ is ministering in the heavens, and Paul's completing ministry is being carried out here among us
The completing ministry, then, is to bring forth the Body so that the Head can carry out God's administration on earth
From this point on this allinclusive Spirit would spread from within our spirit into our soul that it might be saturated with the Triune God
With these three ministries the Bible is consummated, and the new heaven and earth with the New Jerusalem are brought in
