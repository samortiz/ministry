   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WOMAN, LIVING AN INDEPENDENT LIFE,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BECOMING A REAL MALE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a woman lives an independent life, she becomes a real male.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today a great many women have become males.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the main reason for the many separations and divorces.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>ONLY THE REAL FEMALE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>BEING USEFUL TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whether we are sisters or brothers, we all need to be females and live by the only life that is useful to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to be females we need to depend upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The tree of life in Genesis 2 signifies dependence, and the tree of knowledge signifies independence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Life always makes us dependent, whereas knowledge always makes us independent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, before you teach a child something, he depends on you concerning that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But as soon as he learns that particular thing, he becomes proud and independent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Life, on the contrary, makes us dependent on God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God desires that we choose life instead of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that He wants us to choose dependence rather than independence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To live an independent life means to live by the tree of knowledge, but to live a dependent life means to live by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Living by the tree of life is actually living by the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The vine in John 15 is an excellent illustration of the dependent life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 15:5 says, I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the branches of the vine are dependent upon the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To abide in the vine is to be dependent upon the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, as far as abiding is concerned, there can be no independence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only do the worldly people live an independent life, but many Christians also live a life that is independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this reason, the vast majority of Christians have become useless to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we must learn that, whether we are males or females, we must live a life in constant dependence on God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No matter how long we have been with the Lord, we still must depend upon Him for life today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, we cannot graduate from eating, drinking, and breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How foolish for a person to say that because he has been breathing for seventy years he no longer needs to breathe!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With life, there is no graduation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God s strategy is to put us in a position where we must depend upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to pray, Lord, apart from You, I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I must abide in You and take You as my life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Daily I need to eat the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lord, I want to live a female life, a life that always depends on You.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the kind of life God can use for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the age of forty, Moses lived an independent male life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Acting independently of God, he exercised his natural strength to smite an Egyptian.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moses was truly an independent male.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, during the forty years Moses was set aside, God taught him that He would not use his male life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not an easy matter to train a male to live a female life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nevertheless, in the second forty years of his life, Moses learned to be a female.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>During his third forty years, from the age of eighty to the age of one hundred twenty, Moses lived the life of a female.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only in one instance, when he struck the rock the second time, was he independent of God Num 20:7-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because Moses acted as a male on that occasion, he offended the Lord and thus was denied the privilege of entering into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Readers of the Bible usually regard Moses as the leader of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moses, however, did not have this concept about himself; he never assumed a position as the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the children of Israel rebelled against him, he considered it rebellion against God, not against himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Moses simply went to the Lord and presented the problems to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In doing so, Moses honored the Lord as the head, as the unique male.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This indicates that Moses was living a female life, a life of dependence on God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The female life is seen not only in chapters one and two of Exodus, but also throughout the following chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have pointed out that Moses was trained to live a female life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Moreover, all the warriors were living a female life of dependence on God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you have not learned to be a female, you will not be able to fight for the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God uses only female warriors.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that if you are living an independent male life, you are useless as far as spiritual warfare is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I wish to emphasize the point that to be a male is to be independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For example, a husband may deal with his wife in a way that is independent of God, and a wife may deal with her husband in the same manner.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This means that both the husband and wife may be males in the negative sense.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But we should not be such males, those who are independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should be females, those who depend upon God and do nothing apart from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In all that we say or do we should depend on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If this is our situation, then we are true females living a dependent life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The history of the church reveals that whenever there is such a female life, God is able to do something for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Take Martin Luther as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He was a man who learned to depend on God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>No doubt, Luther was born with a strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Nevertheless, he learned to depend on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He did not live and act as a strong male, but as a dependent female.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Apostle Paul also was such a female.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>His writings bear witness to this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As a female, Paul did not do anything in a way that was independent of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>His work, his behavior, and his actions issued from a life of dependence on God.</S>
