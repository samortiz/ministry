   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A GOD-MAN, NOT A GOOD MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I was a young man, I did everything quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I spoke quickly, and I walked quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When you are a quick person it is much easier for you to lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I wanted to do something quickly and another person was going slowly, I became irritated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then I got saved when I was nineteen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My sister returned home from a seminary where she was studying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She loved the Lord and wanted to go on with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She told me that she saw many "spiritual" Christians in her seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She related to me that these Christians did everything slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They walked slowly, they opened up the Bible slowly, and they talked slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After hearing that testimony, I desired to be a slow person, and I began to hate my quickness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then I began to imitate the persons who were so slow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I tried to pick up my Bible slowly, walk slowly, and even read the Bible slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But eventually my quickness came out again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I found out that I was not a slow person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For me to try to be a slow person was like a monkey trying to imitate a man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, the monkey will return back to being a monkey.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then I was taught by many Christian teachers that I should be patient, humble, and kind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was taught that I should be very virtuous.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually I discovered that I could not love, I could not be humble, nor could I be patient, kind, holy, or righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I became very disappointed and struggled for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One day I saw that man can never be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only God can be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no possibility for a piece of black iron to be gold.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I saw that what God wanted was to enter into me to be my contents, to be my holiness, to be my "gold."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I saw and realized this I became greatly excited.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I wanted to tell everyone that I had God in me, that God was my contents.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is my life, my holiness, my love, my slowness, and my everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am a vessel, a container, to contain God and to be filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I used to tell people that I wanted to be a good man, but I could not make it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But today I can testify that I am not a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not be a good man, but be a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you want to be a good man, be sure that you will be a bad man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not try in yourself to love others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more you try to love others, the more you will eventually hate others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you try to be humble, you will be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may even have the inward attitude "Don't you know that I am so humble?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is pride.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You are proud of your humility.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have to forget about being a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the garden of Eden there were two trees the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Evil always goes with good.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hatred goes with love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Pride goes with humility.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not what God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God wants life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God does not want you to be a good man, but God wants you to be a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You may be a "good man," but you can never be an expression of God if you are merely a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God made man in His own image for the purpose of expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we become a God-man who is filled with God, we express God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A God-man is an expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Such a God-man, expressing God, is God's representative.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He represents God and he has God's authority over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God created man in His own image to express Him, and God gave His dominion to man that man may reign for Him Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not a good man but a God-man who expresses God and represents God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God's image is for us to express God, and God's dominion is for us to represent God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have God Himself in our spirit, and we can be filled with God and full of God to express Him and represent Him as a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the dispensing of God Himself into us according to the divine economy.</S>
