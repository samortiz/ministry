One is of life, and the other is a matter of politics. Life comes from within; one acts genuinely according to what is within him. Politics is intentional and artificial. A Christian should walk by life and not by politics. I wish to mention one brother. I hope I am not criticizing him. I can only say that I have never met any person who is as obnoxious about his flesh as he is. I have told him many times that his trust in his eloquence and power and the results of his work were nothing but an expression of himself. These things were not of God, and God was not pleased with them. He might be wiser, more eloquent, and more powerful than others, but none of these things could be employed in God's work. I spoke to him frankly, and he did not reject me. He said, "Brother Nee, I agree that my virtues such as eloquence, wisdom, and power are corrupt. You are right." He fully agreed with my words. He said the same thing from the first year I met him until the third year. Every time I spoke to him, he accepted my words patiently, humbly, and willingly. But he was only being political; it was not life. Politics is artificial; it does not come from within.</p><p>How do I know that he was being political and not in life? If something is political, there will be bleating and lowing. Once you hear bleating, lowing, and the sound of Agag, you know that it is politics and not life. Saul said that he had kept God's word. If he had, there would not have been any bleating or lowing sound. If it is something political, one will have to control the sound and muzzle the bleating and lowing when it is time to be quiet. If you hear any bleating or lowing, you can be sure that something political is being carried on. If the flesh can still plead for mercy, it means that one only has an intentional performance; it is not life, and it is not a genuine dealing of the flesh.</p><p>In spiritual matters, a man can only deceive himself; he cannot deceive others. You can only cheat yourself; you cannot cheat anyone else. Neither God nor the brothers, the sisters, or the world can be deceived by you. Even Satan will not be deceived by you. A man can only cheat himself. Saul might have thought that no one heard the bleating and lowing. Actually, the whole world heard it. Yet he still thought that he had kept the sound from everyone. The brother that I just mentioned did not need anyone to point out his flesh. While he was speaking, his flesh spontaneously was exposed. One can never hide the sound of the sheep, oxen, and Agag from the ears of others. Although a man may not say anything outwardly, the inward sound will expose him. Sometimes when you tell others to deal with their flesh, natural wisdom, eloquence, and power, they may think in their hearts that they are not that bad. They may not say it with their mouth, but they cannot hide what is in their heart. There is a big difference between a person who has been judged and one who has never been judged. If a person has not been genuinely dealt with in his flesh, he may pretend outwardly that he has been dealt with, but the sheep and oxen which he has spared will inform others that his performance is not real. In spiritual matters, nothing can be hidden from God. The sheep and oxen will expose what is in man. This was Saul's history.</p><h2 class="head1">GOOD INTENTIONS CANNOT REPLACE GOD'S WILL</h2><p>In verse 15, Saul told Samuel the reason he had spared the best of the sheep and the oxen. He wanted to offer them to the Lord. This shows how we are prone to spare good things for God in the hope that we can please Him. It is a good intention to spare good things to offer to God. But good intentions can become a substitute for God's will. Whatever God says must be done. Today we have to deal with this matter once and for all. We have to see that good intentions can never be compared with God's will. God's will does not need man's hand to adjust it. He knows what He wants and what He likes. His commandment speaks of His heart. We should not try to change His desire by our good heart.</p><p>I have a brother who works for me in my house. He is a very good cook. I have told others that he is a bad servant and a terrible employee. Why do I say this? I say this because this brother thinks he knows more than I do. He thinks he knows my stomach better than I do. Once I asked him to cook noodles. I waited for a long time, but he still did not come. Later, I found that he was cooking porridge instead. I wanted noodles, but he was preparing porridge. He thought that porridge was better for me than noodles. Since he had cooked it, I had no choice but to eat it. Man can compromise a little, but our God will not compromise. If I am the master and I want noodles, I should only be served noodles. If I say noodles, I mean noodles. This brother loves me and cares for me, but he is only qualified to be my master. He is not qualified to be my servant. He has his own ideas, and he thinks that his ideas are better than mine. He does not work according to my instructions. Hence, we have to see that our good heart can never replace or amend God's commandment. We should never think that we can be God's counselors. He is the Lord, and we are but the slaves who take orders from Him obediently. We should not try to do anything for God out of our good heart. Such good hearts often contradict God's commandments, because they are nothing but an indication of the existence of the flesh.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
