Mrs. Penn-Lewis felt that there was no need of actual water in a baptism because as long as a person experienced the Holy Spirit, he was truly baptized. It was the same with the Lord\u2019s table.

One morning we asked him to have a time of fellowship with about a hundred co-workers. In this time of fellowship Brother Austin-Sparks told us that whereas on his first visit he was determined not to touch some of our practices that he considered unscriptural, on this visit he intended to speak concerning them. For instance, Brother Austin-Sparks said that there was not a proper order in our Lord\u2019s table meeting. I believe that he held this concept because he himself conducted the Lord\u2019s table meeting at Honor Oak in an exceedingly formal way under his detailed direction from beginning to end. He also said that it was unscriptural for the brothers who were in the military service to put on their uniform cap before leaving the meeting hall. At that time we had many brothers among us who were in the military. They came to the meetings dressed in military uniforms. After the meetings they would put [174] on their caps and fellowship with the brothers and sisters in the meeting hall. When Brother Austin-Sparks saw this, he began to criticize. Then one brother said to Brother Austin-Sparks, \u201cAccording to the Chinese tradition, a soldier does not take off his cap when he is standing up, whether or not he is inside a building. These brothers remove their caps when they sit down for the church meetings in accordance with the biblical teaching that man should keep his head uncovered when he prays to God or speaks for Him, but when an announcement is made that the meeting is dismissed, they put their caps back on.\u201d When Brother Austin-Sparks heard this, immediately his countenance changed. He asked, \u201cDo you keep the tradition or the Bible?\u201d When I heard this, I realized that he was wrong. While we were not disobeying the Bible, he was following Western tradition. As a result of much contact with Westerners since my youth, I knew that according to their tradition, men should take off their hats inside any building. The Bible says that when a man prays or prophesies, he should not cover his head (1 Cor. 11:4, 7), but it does not say that a man cannot put on his hat inside a building. To take off the hat inside a building is a Western tradition. It was wrong for Brother Austin-Sparks to impose upon us a tradition that Western unbelievers keep. Before that day I had a very high respect for him, but from that day onward I reconsidered my respect for him and lost my confidence in him. When I read his books, I thought that he was very spiritual, for he wrote concerning the principles of resurrection and of the mystical Body of Christ. However, I could not but wonder how a person who is in resurrection and knows the principles of the Body could still live according to and insist on his cultural traditions. I realized that it is one thing to write books on spiritual principles and another thing to live by them.

However, I discouraged the brother from asking such a question, [175] telling him that it would cause problems and damage the sweet fellowship between Brother Austin-Sparks and us, and that we should simply receive the benefit of the ministry of the word that the Lord granted him. Despite my warning, in the meeting this brother asked Brother Austin-Sparks, \u201cIf in Taipei there are five assemblies that meet in the Lord\u2019s name, which of these assemblies are right, and which are wrong, or are they all wrong?\u201d Brother Austin-Sparks told him that none is right and none is wrong; everything is relative to the measure of Christ.

I pointed out that perhaps no one among us had a greater measure of Christ than Madame Guyon, from whom many Christians through the centuries have received help regarding the inner life. However, she remained in the Roman Catholic Church. Therefore, even though she had a great measure of Christ, we cannot say that she was right concerning the church. I also said that although Dr. F. B. Meyer\u2014a renowned Bible teacher whom Brother Austin-Sparks highly commended and from whom we had received some help\u2014undoubtedly had some measure of Christ, he did not stand on the proper ground of the church, because he stayed in the denominations, that is, in organized Christianity, which Brother Austin-Sparks himself often condemned in his messages. This also demonstrates that we cannot say that just because Dr. Meyer had a considerable measure of Christ, he was right concerning the church.

But let each man take heed how he builds upon it. For another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\u201d The word ground that we use in reference to the church does not carry the denotation of a foundation; rather, it bears the denotation of a site, the piece of land on which the foundation of a building is laid. All organizations in traditional Christianity, including the Roman Catholic Church and various Protestant denominations, may claim that Christ is their foundation, but they are divided from one another because they [181] build upon different grounds. The Catholic Church claims to be built on Christ as its foundation, but this building is on a particular ground, the ground of Roman Catholicism. The Presbyterian Church also claims to be built upon Christ as the foundation, but this building is upon the ground of the presbytery. Practically speaking, what divides these Christian groups from one another is not their foundation but their ground, their standing. They need to realize that the only genuine ground of the church is the ground of oneness, the ground of locality, and that all believers must gather together on this unique ground of the church in order to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ.

Consequently, they would not be able to realize the reality of the Body of Christ in which the believers as members are blended, tempered, and coordinated with one another. In order for these Christians to keep the oneness of the Body, they need to stand on the proper ground of the church, that is, the ground of locality. This is because only the ground of locality is the genuine ground of oneness; all other grounds are divisive.

When he spoke concerning Christ, the meeting hall was crowded, and the audience was responsive. But when he spoke concerning the church, the number of people decreased. This caused him to feel that it was not profitable for him to speak on the church. He felt that he needed to speak mainly concerning things that people wanted to hear. It is regrettable that even though only ten years have passed since he went to be with the Lord in 1971, his work at Honor Oak is virtually terminated.

In 1955 Brother T. Austin-Sparks was invited for the first time to come to Taiwan. In 1957 he came for the second time. During the second time he raised a crucial issue. He thought that the way we were taking was good in every matter except one. The one thing that he considered to be seriously wrong and absolutely intolerable was the ground of the church. In other words, it was the practice of the church. While he was alive, he was the only one on the whole earth who could echo what we saw concerning spiritual life principles. He echoed what we saw, and we responded to what he saw. At that time the rejection he faced in the West was more severe than the rejection we faced in the East. In the entire Western world he was the only one who saw the principles of life, and he was the only one who spoke on the deeper truths of life. Almost no one accepted his teaching. In the East we also spoke on these deep matters. Hence, on the side of life principles, we held the same view, but on the side of church practice and church ground, we could not fellowship with each other. At that time we saw that the church ground cannot be separated from church practice. Without the ground there can be no practice. In order to have the practice, there must be the ground. However, he did not agree with the matter of the church ground, and he did not agree with that kind of church practice.

At that time he called together a special fellowship meeting and reported to us in detail his fellowship with Brother Austin-Sparks in London. At the end he said that in almost every aspect they were in harmony with each other and echoed each other. The only exception was the practice of the church, which they could not get through in their fellowship. Brother Nee was somewhat sympathetic regarding the matter. He felt that in England the Brethren had spoiled the matter of church practice for more than a hundred years. Because of this, most seekers of the Lord were unwilling to speak concerning the subject. Brother Nee sympathized [56] with their frustrations and spoke to us in this way, but he also pointed out that this was exactly where the problem between Brother T. Austin-Sparks and us lay.

After his visit he wrote three letters\u2014one to Manila, one to Hong Kong, and one to Taipei\u2014highly promoting him.

Then I told them that for many years we had learned a certain thing before the Lord: In knowing a person we should not look at the big matters but at the small matters. It is not very easy for a person to expose his flaws in the big things; the problems are always with the small things. Brother Austin-Sparks published a bimonthly magazine called A Witness and a Testimony. In the January 1955 issue there was a column acknowledging the Christmas cards that he had received from readers. His magazine was altogether on spiritual subjects, yet there was such an acknowledgment. This was a small point. By the Lord\u2019s leading, we had completely dropped the celebration of Christmas, but Brother Austin-Sparks, whom we had always respected so much, published an acknowledgment thanking his readers for Christmas cards. From this small matter I could tell that there must still be some distance between him and us.

Since the brothers had felt that the small differences did not matter and that they needed spiritual help, how could I insist on not inviting him? I then suggested that if we were to invite him, it would be better not to bring up the subject of church practice, because Brother Nee had discussed this matter in detail with him already and had not been able to get through. The two Brothers Chang agreed and said, \u201cWe will receive only the spiritual help from him.\u201d I then drafted the letter in English myself.

After visiting for about a month, one morning we asked him to have a time of fellowship with our hundred or more co-workers.

We need to realize that if one\u2019s vision is not clear, he can be very [58] spiritual, but he can become quite confused in certain matters.

It was he who was following the Western tradition and not we who were disobeying the Bible. The Bible says that when a man prays or teaches, he should not cover his head (1 Cor. 11:4, 7), but it does not say that a man cannot put on his cap inside a building.

God ordained that the children of Israel would be taken captive in Babylon for seventy years, after which they would return to their homeland and would rebuild the temple upon its original foundation. Suppose a very influential prophet would rise up at that time and tell the people that it did not matter whether or not one returned to Jerusalem. Suppose he would say, \u2018See? Daniel is such a spiritual person, but he did not return to Jerusalem. Therefore, it does not matter whether or not one returns, as long as he is spiritual.\u2019 I would ask all of you here if this is right or wrong.\u201d Brother Austin-Sparks was an intelligent man. He knew that I was reacting to his word concerning the spiritual measure. I explained further: \u201cDaniel had the greatest spiritual measure of his time; in today\u2019s terms we would say that his measure of Christ was the highest. The reason that he did not return was that the time had not come for him to go. Around the time the Israelites were returning, he died. He could not go while he was living, yet his heart was toward Jerusalem. He knelt down three times a day and prayed with an open window toward Jerusalem. During his time with us here, at least a few times our Brother Austin-Sparks has highly [61] recommended Dr. F. B. Meyer. I have read Dr. Meyer\u2019s books and have received some help from him. But all of us know that Brother Meyer is still in the denominations, that is, in the so-called \u2018organized Christianity\u2019 that our Brother Austin-Sparks condemns in his messages.

If we invite him and have arguments regarding these matters, it will be a great loss. It will be a loss for us and also a loss for him.

During this period he released the messages that were published in The Normal Christian Life. While in England he spent considerable time fellowshipping with Brother T. Austin-Sparks. After returning to China, Brother Nee [144] called a special meeting concerning his fellowship with T. Austin-Sparks in London. Brother Nee indicated that he and Brother T. Austin-Sparks had received help from each other. When we heard Brother Nee\u2019s fellowship, we asked him to invite T. Austin-Sparks to visit us. Brother Nee answered by telling us that the time was not right. The reason for this was that although Brother T. Austin-Sparks had some revelation concerning the inner life, he did not see the truth concerning the practicality of the church life. According to Brother Nee, even though he tried to convince T. Austin-Sparks of the biblical basis for the practice of the church life, Brother T. Austin-Sparks did not receive his ministry on this subject. In 1949 we were sent from mainland China to start the work in Taiwan. From 1949 to 1954 the Lord did a marvelous work there. We were in one accord, and there was no dissension among us. At that time a brother who had contacted T. Austin-Sparks wrote a letter to Taipei, highly promoting T. Austin-Sparks and indicating that T. Austin-Sparks had a burden to come to the Far East. In 1955 two of the leading brothers in Taiwan showed me the letter and expressed their desire to invite him. I responded that we had to be careful, telling them that because Brother T. Austin-Sparks did not agree with us concerning the practice of the church life, a visit from him would cause problems. I also pointed out to them that we, by the Lord\u2019s leading, had completely rejected the celebration of Christmas, yet in a recent issue of Brother T. Austin-Sparks\u2019s magazine, The Witness and the Testimony, he wrote a column expressing his thanks to those who sent him Christmas cards. I said that although this might seem insignificant, we know a person not merely through the big points but also through the small points. When the brothers heard this, they agreed to set aside their desire to invite Brother T. Austin-Sparks. However, two weeks later, the two brothers again expressed their feeling to invite him. At that time I went along with them, but I also charged them to ask him to speak only concerning spiritual matters. At our invitation he came to Taiwan in 1955. Because he ministered Christ and restricted his speaking to spiritual things, his first visit was wonderful.

Austin-Sparks returned to Taiwan. During this visit he touched some of our practices. In a time of fellowship with some of the co-workers, he said that there was not a proper order in our Lord\u2019s table meeting. I believe that he held this concept [145] because he himself conducted the Lord\u2019s table at Honor Oak in an exceedingly formal way. Brother T. Austin-Sparks also said that it is unscriptural for the brothers who were in the military service to put on their uniform cap before leaving the meeting hall. At that time we had many brothers among us who were in the military. They came to the meetings dressed in military uniforms. After the meetings they would put on their caps and have fellowship with the brothers and sisters in the meeting hall. When T. Austin-Sparks asked about this, a brother replied, \u201cAccording to the Chinese tradition, a soldier does not take off his cap when he is standing up, whether or not he is inside a building. These brothers remove their caps when they sit down for the church meetings in accordance with the biblical teaching that man should keep his head uncovered when he prays or speaks for God, but when an announcement is made that the meeting is dismissed, they put their caps back on.\u201d Upon hearing this, Brother T. Austin-Sparks asked, \u201cAre you here to honor the Bible or keep your tradition?\u201d I realized, however, that his criticism was not valid. The Bible says that when a man prays or prophesies, he should not cover his head (1 Cor. 11:4, 7), but it does not say that a man cannot put on his cap inside a building. Taking off the cap inside a building is a Western tradition. We were not disobeying the Bible; rather, T. Austin Sparks was following Western tradition and seeking to impose it upon us.

Austin-Sparks\u2019s reply was that none is right and none is wrong; everything is relative to the measure of Christ. According to him, concerning the church, those with a greater measure of Christ are more right, those with a smaller measure of Christ are less right, and those without any measure of Christ are not right. Because I was the translator, I initially thought that I should avoid becoming involved in this discussion. Eventually, however, I realized that I had to say something in order to resolve this issue. I responded that although Christ is the element, the reality, and the center of the church, it is wrong to think that the extent to which a believer is right concerning the church depends on his measure of Christ. I pointed out that perhaps no one among us had a greater measure of Christ than Madame Guyon did, yet she remained [146] in the Roman Catholic Church. Therefore, although she had a great measure of Christ, we cannot say that she was right concerning the church. No matter how spiritual a believer may be, his spiritual stature does not determine the extent to which he is right concerning the church.

However, those who took the way earlier cannot measure those who come after them according to the standard of their age because such a measurement would be short. The Lord has never stopped with any one person but has advanced on to another. Mrs. Penn-Lewis could measure Andrew Murray, who was before her, in regard to identification with Christ\u2019s death, which was recovered through her. However, she could not use what was recovered through her to measure T. Austin-Sparks, who came after her, because the Lord advanced further to recover the matter of resurrection through Brother Austin-Sparks. Likewise, while Brother Austin-Sparks can go back to measure Mrs. Penn-Lewis, he cannot measure those who come after him. We sense that after God recovered the truth of resurrection, He did a further work of recovery among us; that is, He showed us the matter of the ground of the church.

However, today some people cannot stand it when others pray aloud simultaneously. Neither can they tolerate it when people say Amen too frequently. A certain chapel in America set apart a section and called it the \u201camen corner.\u201d When someone prayed, those sitting in the amen corner would say Amen together. Most of those in the congregation did not like to lift up their voice with one accord to say Amen, but at least some of them practiced this together.

The church in Corinth was initially one, but the believers in Corinth became divided. Those who were for Paul became a Pauline sect.

Initially, there was only one church in Corinth\u2014the church in Corinth. The city of Corinth was the ground of the church in Corinth. After they were divided, there were some of Paul, some of Apollos, some of Cephas, and some of Christ. They lost the local ground.

Brother Nee first broke bread with the Brethren assemblies and then attended the bread-breaking meeting with Brother T. Austin-Sparks. The closed Brethren considered this to be a serious sin. As a result, they had to deal with Brother Nee concerning this matter, but we do not know how Brother Nee handled it. In any case, the two parties maintained temporary peace.

Because of these thoughts, I agreed to invite him. However, now I must admit that I was negligent before the Lord in this matter. At that time we were all very busy, and I did not go to the Lord to pray quietly about this matter, nor did I kneel down to pray with the two Brothers Chang about it.

My absence disappointed him. The conference began in London, then it went to Denmark, and finally to Scotland. Only twenty-five to twenty-nine people attended the meeting in Scotland, which was a meeting of co-workers from various places. It was not a gathering of all the saints. America, Europe, India, and other places in the world that know something of the way that the Lord is taking were represented in the international conference. But there was no one from the Chinese-speaking areas of Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. This disappointed Brother Austin-Sparks because he wanted some believers from these areas to attend the conference.

He also said that if we see the way that the Lord is taking and the work that He is doing, the churches and the work will be the same. In his letter to me Brother Austin-Sparks did not write about the result of the meetings, but he clearly said that very few among the brothers have a large capacity. The brother who labored with me in the past wrote that Brother Austin-Sparks spoke of Taiwan numerous times during the conference. He hoped that the co-workers from some places, particularly from India, would pay more attention to the work in Taiwan.

The book refuted this statement and asked whether a person could be saved without entering into the Body. The influence of these statements in Christianity is serious. The book concluded that the teaching from Honor Oak is heresy, because a person who is saved has the life of Christ and is therefore a member of Christ. It also asks whether anyone can say that a saved person has not entered into the church or the Body, and concludes that anyone who teaches this teaches heresy. Christianity in the West has reached the point of absolute hostility toward Brother Austin-Sparks and Honor Oak, regardless of how congenial he is in his attitude and how cautious he is in his speaking and his work.

First of all, we need to know life. We may be familiar with the word life, but we should not treat life as a term. Next, we need to know the church, and then we need to know the kingdom. These three items are comprehensive. Life is the most comprehensive; it includes the knowledge and the experience of life. We should also have a thorough understanding of the two aspects of the church. We should know the ground and the way of the church and the content and the reality of the church. In addition, we need to know the truth and the reality of the kingdom.

In practice the church exists in a locality, but in nature the church is universal (1 Cor. 1:2). The greatest problem between us and Brother T. Austin-Sparks is the difference in our views concerning the church. His view and light concerning spirituality have greatly benefited seekers on earth. The East should have fellowship with the West concerning spirituality. However, his two visits to Taiwan in the past few years have troubled and grieved me. Prior to these visits, I did not have much of an impression concerning him. In 1933 Brother Watchman Nee spoke highly of him to me, telling me that there was hardly anyone in church history who was as spiritual as Brother T. Austin-Sparks. Brother Nee translated some of his writings into Chinese, and the saints highly esteemed them. In 1933 I dropped my job in order to serve the Lord full time. Later, when I went to Shanghai, Brother Nee gave me Bible expositions by J. N. Darby and Henry Alford as a gift. At that time I also read Brother T. Austin-Sparks\u2019s book entitled The Release of the Lord, which speaks of Christ, the cross, and resurrection. In 1938 Brother Nee was invited to England a second time. When he returned to China, a brother asked him why we had not invited T. Austin-Sparks to China. Brother Nee did not give an explanation; he said only that it was not the right time. He told me that Brother T. Austin-Sparks\u2019s view of spiritual matters matched, and might exceed, ours, but his view of the practice of the church differed from ours. Once, as Brother Nee and I were walking, we spoke concerning the ground of the church. Brother Nee told me that in our work in the East we had a clear understanding concerning the matter of the church, whereas in the [474] West the truth concerning the church had been so thoroughly damaged by the British Brethren that even T. Austin-Sparks was not clear concerning the ground of the church; hence, in the West there were problems concerning the practice of the church.

Austin-Sparks went to New York. When Brother Stephen Kaung met him, he considered him to be a spiritual giant. Brother Kaung wrote three separate letters to the churches in Hong Kong, Manila, and Taipei. In these letters he stated that T. Austin-Sparks had a burden to visit the East. In 1955, after we received Brother Kaung\u2019s letter concerning this matter, many brothers among us felt that we should consider inviting him. Brother Chang Yu-lan asked me why I did not invite Brother T. Austin-Sparks to Taipei. I told Brother Chang that we needed to consider this matter carefully because in the January 1955 issue of his magazine entitled A Witness and a Testimony, he thanked people for sending him Christmas cards. Although this seemed to be a trivial matter, it bothered me. However, after more consideration, I thought that since he was a spiritual person who had served the Lord for many years, he would pay attention only to spirituality and would not touch the ground of the church if he visited the churches in Taiwan. Thus, I wrote to him and invited him to come to Taiwan. When he came to Taiwan for the first time in 1955, we honored him as an elderly brother, and he touched matters only concerning spirituality. When he came for the second time in 1957, however, problems arose among the churches in Taiwan because of his speaking. In a session of fellowship with him, two brothers from Taiwan told him that there can be only one church in one locality. He responded, stating that whether a church on earth is right or wrong is relative; that is, a church that possesses a greater measure of Christ is more right, whereas a church that possesses a lesser measure of Christ is less right. He believed that the two brothers\u2019 view concerning the local ground of the church showed that they were narrow. On the following morning he criticized them from the podium, saying that they had made Christ small, limiting Him to only a locality. This troubled the brothers. We had given him warm hospitality, yet he reciprocated by criticizing us. One day I said to him that even though we received his ministry concerning spirituality, there was a difference between him and us. He asked me how we were different from him. I told him that we were different from him with respect to our view of the ground of the church. He then [475] said to me that he considered the meeting at Honor Oak as the church but that he did not call that meeting the church because he did not want to promote the matter of the church. I then tried to comfort him by telling him that although we differed in our view of the ground and practice of the church, I hoped we would maintain our fellowship.

First, those who meet at Honor Oak are not in one accord. T. Austin-Sparks said that since the people there do not accept him as the spiritual authority, he was compelled to go elsewhere. He also said that people in the East are easy to change, while those in the West are not. However, when I was a guest at Honor Oak, some brothers there placed the blame for the problems among them entirely on him. I did not respond much to these brothers because whatever I said would be used by them as a reason to rebel against him and thus cause him to suffer loss. At another time I pointed out to those who meet at Honor Oak that the believers are the Urim and the Thummim and that we need to know God\u2019s will through them (Exo. 28:30). When the saints at Honor Oak heard this, some complained that Brother T. Austin-Sparks led primarily according to his own ideas and neglected the feeling of the saints.

Through the years we have not only focused on life, the knowledge of Christ, and fellowship with the Lord but also emphasized the truth concerning the church. Truth and life must be balanced in our Christian life and church life. Regrettably, some believers stress only spiritual experiences while neglecting the truth. If we had only the Holy Spirit and not the Bible, how would we practice the church life today? In the November 1958 issue of A Witness and a Testimony, T. Austin-Sparks stated that \u201call talk about \u2018forming New Testament churches\u2019 is nonsense.\u201d He emphasized only spirituality but neglected the practicality of the church life; this imbalance resulted in loss. Regarding the practices in the church, such as baptism and meetings, we must not make decisions according to our personal feeling; we must carry out these practices according to the truth in the Bible. If we do not take the truth in the Bible as the basis of teachings and practices in the church, there will be confusion in the church. In the Old Testament God led the children of Israel by the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire, signifying that the children of God need the leading of the Spirit (typified by the pillar of cloud) and the light in the truth (typified by the pillar of fire) (Exo. 13:21-22; 1 Cor. 10:1-2; Psa. 119:105). In principle, all the services in coordination in the church must be according to the truth in the Bible. Instead of emphasizing spirituality alone, we should be balanced in our emphasis on life, truth, [477] spirituality, and the gospel. Church history shows that spiritual people can benefit the church; however, if they stress only spirituality at the expense of other crucial matters, they may cause damage to the church. Today our practice of the church must be based upon the truth and stand on the proper ground. Moreover, the elders and deacons need to coordinate and function together in harmony.

T. Austin-Sparks in England was a brother who made an outstanding spiritual contribution in the twentieth century. We were good friends. Brother Nee visited him in 1938 for over a year and returned in September 1939. When Brother Nee came back to Shanghai, he held special meetings specifically to speak on the Body of Christ. At that time four or five of us co-workers were working back and forth along the Jiao-Ji Railway. Brother Nee sent us a telegram inviting us to come to him, so we went. After we arrived in Shanghai, he told us that Brother T. Austin-Sparks was the one who could fellowship with us the most concerning spiritual matters, but concerning the practice of the local church, he and we had no way to fellowship. Nevertheless, Brother Nee still tried to maintain the fellowship with Brother Austin-Sparks. In 1955 a few co-workers and I, representing Taipei, Hong Kong, and the Philippines, wrote a letter to invite Brother Austin-Sparks to come for a visit. He came very happily at the invitation, and when he returned, he said that he had never met a better audience than the one in Taiwan. Therefore, he also invited me to go to England.

In some evenings when there were no meetings, the leading ones from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Denmark would gather together. One evening a brother asked, \u201cBrother Austin-Sparks, here in Taipei there are five Christian groups, all claiming that they are non-denominational but are a genuine Christian church. Which one of the five is right?\u201d Brother Austin-Sparks was ready for this question [134] and said, \u201cNone of them is absolutely right, but they are all relatively right. Whoever has a greater measure of the stature of Christ is more right, and whoever has a smaller measure of the stature of Christ is less right.\u201d I was the translator, and this answer shocked me. Earlier, I had urged the brothers not to bring up this kind of question, because it would surely cause dispute. That night, however, one brother suddenly brought it up. Seeing that no one responded, I felt that I had to respond, or I would have let down the brothers in Taipei. I opened my mouth and gave an example: \u201cWe have a very good friend in England, Dr. F. B. Meyer. His books are very good, but he did not leave the denominations. Can we say that his denomination is right?\u201d Brother Austin-Sparks did not answer. I said further, \u201cWe all know that from the Reformation until now, the most spiritual person in the last three hundred years was Madame Guyon. She and Fenelon, Lawrence, Thomas \u00e0 Kempis and others were all very spiritual. Perhaps the Christ whom we have today is no greater than theirs. Yet they were still in Catholicism. Madame Guyon\u2019s autobiography even says that she went in front of the statue of Mary to meditate. When we translated her autobiography, we did not translate that portion for fear that people would imitate it. Can we say that the place where she was is right?\u201d In this way everyone\u2019s mouth was shut, and I did not say much more.

However, the practice of the church is a different matter. Later, Brother Austin-Sparks invited me to England in 1958. I went for no reason other than to sit down with him to discuss this matter. I was there for four weeks, during which time I went to his private retreat in Scotland and talked with him two to three times a day for a week. Eventually, he knew that he could not change me, and I knew that I could not change him.

If a person is helped by you to know the Body of Christ and asks you, \u2018Should I remain in the denominations?\u2019 you need to give him an answer.\u201d This exhortation was very difficult, and he could not answer it. His son-in-law, Angus Kinnear, a doctor, collected the messages released by Brother Nee during his visit to Europe from 1938 to 1939 and compiled them into the book The Normal Christian Life, which concerns Christ as life. This book is well compiled, and its source material also is good; thus, it has been well received [135] by Christians all over the world. But Brother Kinnear did not approve of the practice of the church, and he claimed that Brother Nee\u2019s messages on the practice of the church were all given before 1948, and that after that time his views changed, and he no longer spoke those kinds of messages. For this reason I was forced to publish the book in Chinese called Further Talks on the Church Life, which includes messages given by Brother Nee that were all spoken from 1948 through 1951. Because I included the messages from Brother Nee\u2019s later years, Angus Kinnear knew that I was responding to him. I certainly have the assurance that the truths we preach concerning the practice of the church are scriptural and that Brother Nee\u2019s view concerning this never changed. "}]}
