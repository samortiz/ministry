[2]  Volume 57 of The Collected Works is comprised of two sections containing messages and fellowship given by Watchman Nee upon the resumption of his ministry in late 1947 and early 1948.
[3]  Section One is comprised of notes from private fellowship between Brother Nee and Brother Weigh in Foochow during September of 1947.
[4]  His main burdens in these messages included the way of recovery that the church takes on earth today, the recovery of the Body life, the coordination of the co-workers, ministry and authority, the relationship between the local churches and the work, release from the bondage of money, the way to preach the gospel, and the way to arrive at the universal priestly service.
[5]  By the mercy of God, the church in Shanghai experienced a great revival in 1947.
[6]  When news spread to other places, the churches in the provinces of Fukien and Kwangtung, together with the church in Hong Kong, invited me to visit.
[7]  At the same time co-workers from northern and southern China, together with co-workers from the West, decided to come together in Shanghai the following year for a co-workers' conference and to share the Lord's grace one with another.
[8]  What impressed me the most and rendered me the greatest help concerned the following eight points: 1 the knowledge and realization of the Body of Christ, 2 the knowledge and denial of the self, 3 the knowledge of and submission to the authority in the Body of Christ, 4 the knowledge and acceptance by the co-workers of the "line of Jerusalem,'' 5 the service and coordination of the whole Body of Christ, 6 the need and practice of handing over oneself with all one has, 7 the leading and coordination among the co-workers, and 8 the importance of the Holy Spirit in the service in the Body of Christ.
[9]  SEPTEMBER 1947 CHAPTER ONE THE MERCY OF GOD Date: September 5, 1947
[10]  When we read Romans 9, we have to pay attention both to its principle and to its application.
[11]  CHAPTER TWO ON NOT BEING STUMBLED Date: September 7, 1947, Lord's Day morning
[12]  The first stanza of hymn #144 in Hymns says,
[13]  The passage we just read records how men were stumbled by the Lord.
[14]  John the Baptist must have been extremely puzzled by Christ.
[15]  Why would Christ not do something spectacular for him, such as healing the blind and the lame?
[16]  John the Baptist had given strong testimony for Jesus, declaring that Christ is the Lamb of God and that He comes to take away the sin of the world John 1:29 .
[17]  Later, he declared, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" v. 36 . When Christ was baptized, John saw the Holy Spirit descending upon Him v. 32 . However, in Matthew 11:1-19 John was stumbled by the work of Christ.
[18]  APRIL MAY 1948 CHAPTER THREE THE WAY OF OUR SERVICE TODAY
[19]  If you consider the church life of the first century, the absolute consecration seen in Acts 2 and 4, the keeping of the apostles' teaching, and the perfecting of the saints unto the fullness of the Body of Christ in Ephesians 4, and compare such conditions with the condition of the church today, there is undoubtedly a vast difference between the two pictures.
[20]  God's work today is the recovery of the testimony of the Body.
[21]  This Body testimony is not a doctrine, but a reality.
[22]  In this Body there is the perfecting ministry Eph 4:12 and there is spiritual authority.
[23]  The Body is not a doctrine, but a spiritual fact.
[24]  If a spiritual matter is recovered, and it is real, it will surely be felt by others.
[25]  AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE MINISTRY Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 10, 1948, 9:00 a.m.
[26]  Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai CONCERNING THE TRUTH Not Arranging the Sequence of Truth
[27]  We often sacrifice God's word on account of our personal experiences.
[28]  Because our individual experiences are partial and fragmentary, we do not have a complete, overall view of God's word.
[29]  CONCERNING THE PRACTICE Finding the Ones to Submit To
[30]  After we have such a realization, we come to the second step.
[31]  The first step has to do with God's word.
[32]  In the Body the first thing we have to learn is to find those whom we have to submit ourselves to.
[33]  The body is the most beautiful thing there is on earth.
[34]  Yet the body can also become the most ugly thing on earth.
[35]  While we are learning to submit to the ministry, we are submitting to God.
[36]  Of all the authorities that God has established on this earth, ninety-nine percent of them, that is, the overwhelming majority of them, are deputy authorities.
[37]  The Bible says that we have to submit to our husband and our rulers, and the younger ones have to submit to the older ones.
[38]  THE WAY OF THE WORK TODAY Going On with the Lord
[39]  What we considered as life yesterday may be death today.
[40]  We must go on, and we must not stop at past experiences.
[41]  God is raising up the testimony of the local church today in the midst of desolation to answer His call in an age of desolation and to recover the church out of its desolation through the testimony of the local church.
[42]  CHAPTER FIVE THE WAY OF THE CHURCH Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 11, 1948, Lord's Day afternoon
[43]  Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT The Tabernacle and the Temple
[44]  The way of the church on earth can be seen from the history of the tabernacle in the Old Testament.
[45]  The visible church today is the tabernacle; it is already in ruins.
[46]  At the time of Paul the church was already falling into desolation.
[47]  Paul said in the book of Philippians that "all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus'' 2:21 .
[48]  THE WAY FOR OUR WORK TODAY Realizing the Limitation of an Individual
[49]  God has His specific demands; He wants man to learn coordination.
[50]  God not only requires that man be delivered from sin, the world, and the flesh; He also asks that man be delivered from his individualism.
[51]  With regard to the knowledge of the Body of Christ, man's problem lies in the fact that from the first day he has been taught the wrong things.
[52]  Since the Reformation, man has thought that he can be a Christian individually, that he can be sanctified individually, justified individually, and work and serve God individually.
[53]  A minister cannot speak in a loose way, nor can he demand that others submit to him all the time without himself being first dealt with by the Lord.
[54]  God will never entrust His authority to such people.
[55]  Receiving the laying on of hands means accepting the judgment of the church.
[56]  It means that we are willing to submit to the authority that God has put upon a person.
[57]  The gospel spread from Jerusalem to Samaria, and then to the ends of the earth.
[58]  At the same time, it would be equally wrong if all the believers were to remain in Jerusalem, because the intention of the Lord was that the gospel would be preached to the ends of the earth.
[59]  CHAPTER SIX GOD'S WORK OF RECOVERY 1 Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 12, 1948, 6:30 a.m.
[60]  Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai THE BEGINNING OF THE RECOVERY
[61]  THE DEFICIENCY OF THE REFORMATION The Recovery of Faith
[62]  In addition, there was the recovery of the inner life.
[63]  Madame Guyon, Father Fenelon, and others brought in a recovery of the spiritual condition.
[64]  They practiced denying their self, joining themselves with God to oppose their self, giving no excuse to the self, and not asking God to spare His hand on them.
[65]  In addition to Robert Pearsall Smith, there were others like Evan Hopkins of England and Theodore Monod of France.
[66]  These ones, together with Smith in America, formed the so-called Keswick movement.
[67]  Consecration is not simply a kind of exchange, in which we offer to God all that we have and all that we are, and we take back from Him what He has and what He is.
[68]  THE RECOVERY OF THE REALITY OF THE KINGDOM The Welsh Revival
[69]  Let us go on to one more subject, the kingdom.
[70]  The kingdom is a common subject, but to merely discuss the term kingdom is useless.
[71]  The question is whether or not the kingdom as the very thing itself has been realized.
[72]  OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Messages concerning the Body of Christ
[73]  About 1930 Brother T. Austin-Sparks went on further to see the Body.
[74]  From that time on, he continued to speak on the Body.
[75]  With each step that the Lord has taken in His recovery, the content of His recovery has become richer and richer.
[76]  There may be other items of recovery, but as far as we know, when we reach the recovery of the coordination of the Body and the manifestation of authority, we have reached the final recovery.
[77]  If we do not have any spiritual reality, Catholicism will indeed come in. But if spiritual reality is with us, we will realize that no matter how good our personal judgments may be, they can never be compared to the judgments of those with spiritual discernment in the Body.
[78]  Today we have to learn to submit to God's authority.
[79]  In any kind of human institution, we see rebellion and insubordination.
[80]  We have to see that the whole problem rests with us today.
[81]  We have to realize how great our responsibility is.
[82]  Because of our unfaithfulness, we dare not preach the complete gospel to the sinners.
[83]  We must be transformed before we can preach a transforming gospel.
[84]  There are certain things concerning consecration that are difficult to speak about.
[85]  According to the Bible, there is no such thing as an unconsecrated saved one.
[86]  Everyone who is saved is consecrated to the Lord.
[87]  Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai SEEING THE BODY LIFE The Holy Spirit Being
[88]  When the eyes see, it is actually not the eyes that are seeing but the head that sees.
[89]  We must see the Body life before we can consider the question of the church in Antioch.
[90]  For this reason we must have some make-up lessons, before we discuss the question of Antioch.
[91]  However, if there is only approval by vote, planning, and resolutions in our work, instead of the reality of the Holy Spirit, we have nothing more than central organization; it will be Roman Catholicism.
[92]  Catholics say that there is only one church, that their priests are the only kind of people who can understand the Bible, and that their church is the only true church.
[93]  The starting point of the work in Antioch was the sending forth of two or three men.
[94]  However, if workers are sent out by the work, the question of organization may come in. During our gathering this time, brothers from different localities have come on their own accord.
[95]  Today we cannot make the truth concerning the local churches a method.
[96]  If we make it a method, it will become very dead indeed.
[97]  There is a big difference between a proper salvation and an improper salvation.
[98]  One woman can give birth to a twelve-ounce baby, whereas another can give birth to a twelve-pound baby.
[99]  The church should bear the responsibility in its ministry to help the new ones have a good beginning.
[100]  There is a great difference between the way taken by those who have a proper beginning and those who do not.
[101]  We must be a certain kind of person before we can produce that kind of person.
[102]  I see clearly that with our present condition, we need a second salvation.
[103]  Today, if a man wants to hand himself over willingly, he has to do it; and if he does not want to hand himself over, he nevertheless has to do it.
[104]  AND COMMENTS Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 13, 1948, evening
[105]  Brother Watchman Nee: In tonight's meeting we would like the co-workers to give their own testimonies.
[106]  AND THE RECOVERY OF AUTHORITY Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 14, 1948, morning
[107]  Brother Nee: In the past there were many things that we could not say or do, because we were not open to one another.
[108]  When over twenty brothers recently handed themselves over to us, I told them that now I was not afraid even to take off my hat to ask for money from others.
[109]  Specifically, every brother and sister must understand the need of authority in the local churches.
[110]  Romans 12 speaks of ministries, and Ephesians 4 speaks of the ministry.
[111]  There is indeed the need for the recovery of authority.
[112]  There is only one mouth in the human body.
[113]  In the matter of preaching the gospel, we have to recover the kind of preaching that is done by the whole church.
[114]  We do not need to invite people with big advertisements.
[115]  Rather, we should ask all the brothers and sisters to invite people individually.
[116]  Our work today is one in which we perfect others to do the work themselves.
[117]  If one day the whole church rises up to do everything by itself, with the whole church preaching the gospel and the whole church edifying each other, that will be the day when the world will see the church doing a new thing on earth.
[118]  Brother Chang Yu-zhi: What is the relationship between submitting to the authority in the Body and personal submission before God?
[119]  The Catholic Church thinks that all of God's leadings come through the church and that a man cannot come to God directly, but must come to Him through the church.
[120]  The book of Acts is a book on the leading concerning the way in the service.
[121]  Only this book tells us the way the Holy Spirit led men in their works.
[122]  We have to ask God to do one thing today: If a person rejects the leading in the Body, he will be deprived of all leadings.
[123]  The Lord's leading in the work is manifested in the Body.
[124]  If we pay our attention to our individual ways, we will miss God's leading.
[125]  There is a strong relationship between a person's spiritual journey and the leading of the Holy Spirit.
[126]  There is a need for the leading of the Body because an individual's spiritual journey can be shortened with the leading of the Body.
[127]  If a brother is left to himself, he may stumble for ten years before he can come up with something.
[128]  Brother Witness Lee: What is the difference and relationship between the coordination in the Body, the coordination among the co-workers, and the coordination among the brothers and sisters?
[129]  Is coordination merely a matter of following the ministers, or is there something else?
[130]  Brother Nee: For all the time that the church has been on this earth, God never asks man to direct the church.
[131]  God never asks a few more advanced ones to direct a church.
[132]  The Loss and the Recovery of the Priesthood God Securing the Place of Rest through the Priests
[133]  They may do many other works, but none of those works can be considered true service.
[134]  What the churches are practicing today in all the localities is a big failure.
[135]  AND THE PRINCIPLE OF JERUSALEM Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 17, 1948, 3:00 p.m.
[136]  Today men are not natural enough before God; they want to be "improved'' earthen vessels.
[137]  But it does not matter how much an earthen vessel is improved, because improvement produces only one result, that of drawing others' attention to oneself.
[138]  Natural naivety and spiritual simplicity are two different things.
[139]  The more a person knows the Lord, the simpler he is.
[140]  A fleshly person does not have much within him, and what he has outwardly is more than what he has inwardly.
[141]  If we are clear about the principle just mentioned, there will be no problem with the practice.
[142]  If the co-workers will first drop their personal works and come together in Jerusalem, the Lord will have a way.
[143]  The principle of the work is not to replace others, but to work along with three or five others.
[144]  If we want to see the work in Shanghai built up, we have to put all the brothers and sisters here into function.
[145]  THE BODY AND ITS MEMBERS Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 17, 1948
[146]  What does it mean to say that the truth is absolute?
[147]  First Timothy speaks of the pillar of the truth 3:15 .
[148]  If you can take the truth as the unique standard and if you have the courage to say that since the Lord has done such and such a thing, you admit that you are wrong, new light will come, and a new way will be opened to you.
[149]  BETWEEN THE BODY AND THE MEMBERS The Starting Point Being the Body
[150]  Brother Tang: What is the relationship between the members and the Body?
[151]  We need to give a report concerning the work.
[152]  For many days, we have been waiting before the Lord, inquiring of Him as to the way to go on in the work.
[153]  We think that we first have to concentrate our efforts together to maintain the testimonies along the coastal provinces.
[154]  Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai THE BODY IN 1 CORINTHIANS 12 One Body, One Spirit
[155]  Brother Nee: First Corinthians 12 is a brilliant portion of the Scriptures that reveals the relationship between the Holy Spirit and the Body.
[156]  We think that we are first the members and then become a Body after we are joined together at baptism.
[157]  If you like to be a member, you are a member.
[158]  THE WAY OF THE CHURCH AND THE WAY OF THE WORK Taking the Jerusalem Line
[159]  Brother Witness Lee: What is the difference between the way of the church and the way of the co-workers?
[160]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN MONEY AND OCCUPATIONS Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 19, 1948, 6:30 a.m.
[161]  Speakers: Watchman Nee and Witness Lee THE SOLID CONSECRATION
[162]  We believe that many of the critical issues in consecration have to do with God.
[163]  Today I wish to point out to you the relationship between all things and money, and the relationship between all things and God.
[164]  Satan tries to gain all things, but he cannot gain every item of all the things.
[165]  In church history the Moravian church was the group that had the strongest mission.
[166]  We cannot engage ourselves in occupations that do not increase the value of goods.
[167]  Those occupations that do not increase the value of goods make a poor testimony before God and even before Satan.
[168]  Brother Lee: Since the end of 1942, I saw clearly that unless the problem with money is solved, there is no way for the gospel of God to go out effectively.
[169]  We have to see today that we are not our own and that our possessions are also not our own.
[170]  Some people should consecrate themselves for the gospel, whereas others should offer up themselves in their occupations.
[171]  Outwardly, you may be managing your own business, but in reality and spiritually, you are doing everything for the church.
[172]  If you ask what we should do if some decide to take back their consecration when they hear this kind of word, I would say that we are not afraid of anyone taking back his consecration.
[173]  What we want is first you, and then yours.
[174]  I am a priest, and I live for God.
[175]  AND THE ADVANCE OF THE CHURCH Church Conference Date: April 19, 1948, Friday, evening
[176]  Brother Witness Lee: First I would like to explain the nature of this meeting.
[177]  The purpose of this meeting is to share with the majority of the brothers and sisters the things that we, the co-workers, have been discussing for the last few days.
[178]  Brother Watchman Nee: We have to ask first of all if the church has taken a different stand with respect to its service to the Lord.
[179]  The condition at the beginning was very different from what it is today.
[180]  We cannot live on earth as if the church has never been degraded.
[181]  After the recovery already mentioned, God raised up another group of people, men like J. N. Darby and so forth.
[182]  They saw something concerning the heavenly vision, the removal of the flesh, and so forth.
[183]  We can say that there has never been a time when the church was as clear and as rich as it is today.
[184]  In the Old Testament there are two types: one is the tabernacle, and the other is the temple.
[185]  Many people can speak on the tabernacle; there are at least one hundred books on this subject.
[186]  AND SERVING GOD Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 20, 1948, 6:30 a.m.
[187]  With some kinds of money, it is all right to make it as a businessman, but not all right to make it as a friend.
[188]  These are things that we can have no part in. In short, we can only deal with this matter by taking care of the principles; we cannot deal with it in detail.
[189]  In choosing our occupations we should take the broadest possible way, and we should avoid dangerous bridges as much as possible, because with these bridges there is always the danger of falling, and the fall can be quite serious.
[190]  I think I have to say a few words to the brothers who are holding jobs.
[191]  Among those with whom I have been having fellowship, the matter I am about to share has been quite clear.
[192]  At the beginning I told the brothers that if one day I, Watchman Nee, had to go into business, it would be to the shame of all the brothers who are in business.
[193]  For many years, God's blessings have been among us; they have never left us.
[194]  We are not "watching the sky from the well,'' looking at the outside from our small circles.
[195]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN FELLOWSHIP AND EXHORTATIONS Co-workers' Meeting Date: Wednesday, April 21, 1948, 6:30 a.m.
[196]  Nature: Testimonies and questions by the co-workers, and exhortations by Watchman Nee INDIVIDUALS HANDING OVER
[197]  Watchman Nee: Brother Chu once said, "If I hand something over to the Body, I do not have to take care of it any longer.
[198]  If you hand yourself over, everything becomes the Lord's. If you make money, it is God who is making the money; and if you lose money, it is God who is losing the money.
[199]  REQUIREMENTS OF A WORKER A Proper and Pure Spirit
[200]  One brother asked: When is it the time to say, "Speak, O Jehovah; for Your servant is listening'' 1 Sam 3:9 ?
[201]  Watchman Nee: In the past the brothers in all the localities gave the co-workers many headaches.
[202]  The brothers in those localities went ahead and acknowledged such ones as co-workers, and they received such ones as co-workers on our behalf.
[203]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE SERVICE OF THE WHOLE BODY Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 24, 1948
[204]  Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai ALL REDEEMED ONES NEEDING TO SERVE GOD
[205]  Presently, among God's children there seems to be a common phenomenon that only a certain group of people are serving.
[206]  However, God's Word says that everyone who belongs to God is a servant of God.
[207]  for the Church to Be a Kingdom of Priests
[208]  At the end of the New Testament, when John was about to die in A.D. 95, he said that we have been made "a kingdom, priests to His God and Father'' Rev 1:6 . God's intention toward the church today is for every believer to be a priest.
[209]  Last year I asked a student at Chiao-Tung University how he would feel if someone were to slap him on his right cheek.
[210]  If someone slapped your right cheek, you would be angry when you went home.
[211]  SERVING GOD BEING THE HIGHEST GLORY God Honoring Us
[212]  When I was in England I heard of a brother by the name of C. A. Coates.
[213]  Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai TAKING CARE OF ONE'S STANDING
[214]  When we work in different local churches, what are the things that we should take care of?
[215]  LEARNING TO LISTEN TO OTHERS Listening to Others Being a Basic
[216]  The third matter is a serious demand on the workers today.
[217]  Not only do we have to hear what they are saying; we have to be able to understand what they are saying.
[218]  The fifth point concerns the appointment of responsible brothers.
[219]  Paul asked Timothy to appoint elders, but he did not ask Mark, Silas, Luke, or Demas to appoint elders.
[220]  Chang Kwang-yung: Sometimes after I deliver a message, I feel hungry, and good food is placed before me.
[221]  CHAPTER TWENTY THE WHOLE BODY SERVING Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 26, 1948, evening
[222]  Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai GOD'S SALVATION AND DEMANDS BEING
[223]  First Corinthians 12 and Romans 12 show us that in God's arrangement or plan, there is no such thing as a pastor monopolizing the service of the whole Body.
[224]  What we see in the Bible is the whole Body being a priesthood.
[225]  Concerning the perfecting of the new believers, we also have to do it as a Body.
[226]  In serving the Lord, the brothers and sisters have to learn to be obedient and to take the cross on the one hand.
[227]  In order to recover the work of the church, there must also be the recovery of the authority of the church.
[228]  After the brothers and sisters are trained, they can be sent out.
[229]  The apostles are the ones who should remain in Jerusalem.
[230]  In reading the Bible many people think that the twelve disciples were supposed to go to the ends of the earth.
[231]  At the same time, money takes hold of all things.
[232]  Witness Lee: How does a person know what kind of ministry he has?
[233]  Watchman Nee: It is better that he does not know.
[234]  Whether or not one has a ministry is up to the Head to know; it is not up to you to know.
[235]  This is the reason we have to accept the judgment of the whole Body.
[236]  Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai THE EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY IN THE BODY Being Restricted in Our Speaking
[237]  Learning Not to Be the Head Submitting to the Authority of the Head,
[238]  The head manifests itself as the head by its ideas and proposals.
[239]  The meaning of submitting to the authority of the Head is that one does not need to make many proposals and will not have many ideas of his own.
[240]  Only after we become a person who has no interest in interfering with others' affairs can we be the authority; only then can we bear responsibility before God, and only then can we manage the affairs of the brothers and sisters.
[241]  There Paul said that he did not have a commandment from the Lord.
[242]  Yet up to a certain point, he said that he thought he had the Spirit of God v. 40 . Paul said that he gave the brothers his own opinion.
[243]  It was as if he was saying that he had followed the Lord for twelve years, and that according to him the matter should be taken care of in such and such a way.
[244]  A piece of glass may hold a little bit of water, but it can never hold the equivalent of a cup of water.
[245]  Every Christian has received some grace, but individual Christians are not the whole.
[246]  Even if they receive much grace, they can only be considered big pieces of glass.
[247]  In the Old Testament, when Rachel left Laban, she took her images with her, and she was condemned Gen 31:32 .
[248]  Christians have to deal with mammon in the same way that they deal with idols.
[249]  TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE BODY First Finding Out the Deputy Authority
[250]  Witness Lee: How can one see the authority of the Body?
[251]  When we go to work in the secular world, we should first ask who the boss is.
[252]  If we do not get this question settled, we will not be able to do a proper job, not to mention the possibility of being punished.
[253]  TO BROTHER K. H. WEIGH Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 29, 1948
[254]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE BROKENNESS AND MINISTRY Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 30, 1948, Friday, 6:30 p.m.
[255]  Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai CONCERNING THE ONE TALENT IN THE BIBLE
[256]  Chi Yung-tung: What does the one talent in the Bible Matt 25:15 refer to?
[257]  Today the church fails because the one-talented ones have failed.
[258]  If all the one-talented ones rise up, the church will be manifested, and others will see what the Body is.
[259]  A clever man, who is capable of thinking and scheming, is not very useful in spiritual things.
[260]  You may speak something with a smile, or you may speak the same thing with tears.
[261]  Every spiritual thing is received by men who are balanced and who are just right in everything.
[262]  We can neither be too much nor too little.
[263]  Those who are over-zealous in their pursuit will not receive anything.
[264]  When we ask, we have to ask in a proper measure; we cannot ask for nothing, and we cannot ask for too much.
[265]  Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai PUTTING THE JERUSALEM PRINCIPLE INTO PRACTICE
[266]  It is a little too early for the co-workers to take the way of Antioch today.
[267]  The principle of Antioch that we practiced before begins from Acts 13.
[268]  In practice we have omitted chapters one through twelve; we have skipped the line of Jerusalem.
[269]  Although we cannot say that we are absolutely clear today, when the few responsible brothers came together, we felt that we should begin our work from the coastal regions.
[270]  We have to say something about the training in Foochow.
[271]  Our work in the past had certain problems; we did not produce "standard'' Christians.
[272]  We expect to see the whole church rising up to preach the gospel and all the brothers and sisters serving God together, rather than three or five people serving by themselves.
[273]  The works that the church has to do include: first, the preaching of the gospel, which should not just be the responsibility of those who are giving the messages; second, there is the gospel visitation, which is conducted in the homes; third, there is the visitation of the new believers; fourth, there is the perfecting of the new believers; and fifth, there is the care for the poor.
[274]  These few brothers should not just be responsible for the preaching itself but should be responsible for mobilizing others to preach the gospel.
[275]  Whether or not our work can be successful depends not only on how well the responsible brothers are serving, but on how much the other brothers and sisters are serving.
[276]  If a person does not do his job, you cannot let him go; you have to compel him to work.
[277]  If you want to spend all your money and do not want it to become a hindrance to you, the way is very simple; all you have to do is catch the time of a church revival and go to the Lord and offer up all you have.
[278]  We need to make some announcements concerning the arrangement of personnel.
[279]  First, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the gospel work...Second, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the gospel visitation work...Third, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the new believers' meetings...Fourth, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the visitation of the new believers.
[280]  For the brothers who are holding jobs and the students who are still in school, we ask that they would not drop their present occupation.
[281]  If we preach the gospel well and if all the brothers and sisters are coordinated together, our homes, our occupations, and our money will all be for the gospel.
[282]  CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN REPORT ON THE WORK 2 Co-workers' Meeting Date: May 2, 1948, Lord's Day, 3:00 p.m.
[283]  THE FUTURE OF THE CO-WORKERS Understanding the Meaning
[284]  If you make ten million dollars a month, and you need all ten million, you do not have to offer a cent. If you make only eight million, the church will gladly give up two million to make up enough to meet your need.
[285]  Among us, some want to serve the Lord, but there is no place where they can receive any training.
[286]  Presently, the brothers in all the places can surely learn something in their own church regarding how to take care of affairs and how to participate in the work.
[287]  I have a few words to say about the co-workers.
[288]  The basic need in the work is to know people.
[289]  CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT A PRAYER FOR THE GOSPEL Church Prayer Meeting Date: May 4, 1948, 7:00 p.m.
[290]  Watchman Nee: Lord, ten years ago the Japanese occupied Shanghai.
[291]  At that time we did not have the freedom to preach the gospel, and we prayed that if You would have mercy on us and give us another opportunity, we would surely preach the gospel properly.
[292]  WHO ARE ENGAGED IN BUSINESS Church Conference Date: May 6, 1948, Thursday, 7:00 p.m.
[293]  STILL A HANDFUL Anxious one, why hold that handful?
[294]  A TALK TO THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN BUSINESS
[295]  AND WHO HAVE HANDED THEMSELVES OVER Not Being Unequally Yoked
[296]  Tonight we have something to say to the brothers who are engaged in business and who have handed themselves over.
[297]  We have gathered together you brothers who have handed yourselves over in order to have some fellowship with you.
[298]  Watchman Nee: According to statistics compiled by evangelists around the world, the more money a person puts into the gospel work, the more people there are who will be baptized.
[299]  They calculated that on an average a person has to spend one thousand U.S. dollars on a person before he can be saved.
[300]  Although I cannot say that of one thousand people saved among us, every one of them counts, I can say that at least nine hundred ninety-nine of them count.
[301]  Editor's Note: Testimonies were given by all the brothers and sisters who had handed over themselves.
[302]  THE MEANING AND THE SPHERE OF THE CHURCH The Two Aspects of the Church
[303]  Watchman Nee: There are two meanings to the word church.
[304]  The first is the universal church, and the second is the local church.
[305]  If Nanking develops a problem with Shanghai, that is, if the church in Nanking is at odds with the church in Shanghai, you can only say that they are maintaining a local testimony; they have not maintained God's testimony on earth.
[306]  Since you are the church, you have the authority.
[307]  As long as an individual believer is one with the general church, he can have authority also, and he can even be the authority.
[308]  Here we can see a unique fact of oneness: An individual can have the authority of the church, two or three can have the authority of the church, and the whole church can also have the authority of the church.
[309]  If I am one who has been disciplined by the Holy Spirit and one who has learned the lesson of fellowship, and if I am one who rejects not only the self but all individualism, and if I am one who has been dealt with in all these areas, then I will surely be one with the church.
[310]  No matter how large a number we have, when this number is compared with the whole, it is worth nothing.
[311]  The question is whether or not we are the same as all the other children of God.
[312]  If we are, we can say that we are the church.
[313]  If not, even if we have sixteen hundred people, we cannot say that we are the church.
[314]  IDENTIFICATION WITH THE CHURCH Submission to the Discipline of the Holy Spirit
[315]  Yu Cheng-hwa: Is this identification the result of the work of the Holy Spirit?
[316]  Why do we not say that we should be identified with the Head, but rather that we should be identified with the Body?
[317]  For example, if the feeling within me is different from yours, we will not be the same no matter how much we try to talk things over with one another.
