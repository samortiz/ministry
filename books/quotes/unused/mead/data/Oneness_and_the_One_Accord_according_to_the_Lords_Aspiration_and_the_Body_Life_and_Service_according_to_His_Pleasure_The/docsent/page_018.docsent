   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We have seen that the living in the Body is for the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we have to see that the service in the Body is for the ministering of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Superficially speaking, one cannot find one clear phrase in the whole New Testament that mentions the service in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But if we put together the portions in the Scripture concerning service, we can see a clear picture of the Body service.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The term service implies a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Mainly it denotes ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the original language, ministry and service are the same word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can say that ministry is service and service is ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the same time, service includes work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>SERVING IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all know that we do not live for our living, but for our work, that is, for the accomplishment of something.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is more important than our living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, without our living, we cannot work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to live properly before we can work diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The two are related to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I hope that from now on you would have the deep impression that the Christian living is corporate and of the Body; it is not individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The reason for this is that we are all members in the Body of Christ and cannot be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a member is separated from the Body, it will dry up and will be unrelated to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It will then have nothing to do with all the riches in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, all of our living must be in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, even our service, work, and move must be in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Serving, working, and moving in the Body mean not being independent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whatever you are doing for the Lord, whether it is the preaching of the gospel, the feeding of the lambs, the perfecting of people in the group meetings, or the prophesying in the district meetings, you must remember that you are not doing it alone, but are doing it in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you work, it is Christ working; it is also the Body of Christ working.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Seeing such a thing encourages us very much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It also puts us very much on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to be careful about our speaking and actions, for we are the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This feeling for the Body is very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is what is usually known as one's frame of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The frame of mind is one's perception of things and is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When there is the proper and thorough perception of matters, the frame of mind is normal; otherwise, the frame of mind is not normal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the frame of mind becomes very abnormal, there is mental illness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Strictly speaking, we Christians are somewhat "mentally ill'' in regards to the matter of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not have an adequate understanding of the Body of Christ, our frame of mind is not proper, and we will not be able to have the common recognition of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, we must understand that our being Christians is fully a communal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to seek after spirituality, we must be in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Also, in order to serve the Lord, we must not be detached from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once we are detached, we are through.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The difference between the new way and the old way lies here.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The old way did not make it necessary for us to be attached to other members.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was individualistic and not of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is contrary to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The principle of the Bible is that everyone has to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All must not only preach but also preach corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We become a team in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everyone functions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the same time, there is coordination, and no one is independent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The old way has one great drawback, which is that in it the organic function of all the members was killed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only a few capable ones were left there working.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nothing of the Body was seen.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, in the new way every saint is able to serve organically, and every member is attached to the Body to receive the life supply in the Body and to coordinate and function together.</S>
