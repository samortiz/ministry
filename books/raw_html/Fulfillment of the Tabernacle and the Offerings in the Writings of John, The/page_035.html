<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SERPENT AND THE BRIDE</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 3:9-16, 22-36</h1><p>The title of this message is “The Serpent and the Bride.” It may seem strange to put these two matters together. How can the serpent go together with the bride? What does such a title mean? This title is absolutely not related to anything religious or ethical. It is very common, of course, to speak of a bridegroom and a bride. But who would link together the serpent and the bride? Nevertheless, chapter three of John speaks of both the serpent and the bride. We all know that in this chapter we have Nicodemus, the matter of regeneration by the Spirit, and the “golden” verse, John 3:16. However, I wonder how many Christians have paid adequate attention to the words “serpent” and “bride” found in verses 14 and 29.<h2 class=head1>THE BRASS SERPENT</h2><p>John 3:14 says, “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.” The Lord seemed to be saying to Nicodemus, “You are a teacher of Israel, and surely you must have taught the story in Numbers 21. According to that chapter, the children of Israel were bitten by serpents. The serpentine nature got into them. In the sight of God, they all became serpentine. As they were dying from the poison of the serpent, they cried out to Moses, and he prayed to God for them. God told Moses to make a serpent of brass and lift it up upon a pole.” In the Old Testament, to be lifted up in such a way denotes judgment by God and before God. Hence, for the brass serpent to be lifted up on a pole indicates that it was judged by God. We know from Numbers 21:9 that “it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.”<p>The brass serpent was the same as a real serpent in form but not in nature. It had the form of a serpent, but it did not have the poisonous nature of a serpent. The brass serpent was a substitute for all the children of Israel who had been bitten by the fiery serpents and who had become serpentine. Therefore, all the children of Israel were judged by God when their substitute, the brass serpent, was lifted up on the pole and judged by Him. Furthermore, as we have pointed out, whoever looked upon that brass serpent was made alive. The Bible does not say that the children of Israel were healed by looking at the brass serpent; it says that they were made alive. In the sight of God, they were not sick; they were dead. This was the reason they became alive by looking at the uplifted brass serpent.<p>In 3:14 the Lord pointed out to Nicodemus, an elderly religionist who taught the Bible to God’s people, that as the brass serpent was lifted up in the wilderness for the children of Israel who had been bitten by the serpent, so He, the Son of Man, would be lifted up in order that every one who believes in Him may have eternal life. Verse 15 is the completion of verse 14: “That every one who believes in Him may have eternal life.” The word “that” at the beginning of verse 14 indicates that the result of the Lord’s being lifted up as the Son of Man is eternal life for every one who believes. Verse 16 begins with the word “for.” This indicates that 3:16 is an explanation of verses 14 and 15. It explains the fact that, in the sight of God, the Lord Jesus was lifted up as our Substitute to bear God’s judgment for us so that we may look at Him and receive eternal life. Because in Adam we were bitten by the old serpent, we were dead. But now through Christ as the brass serpent lifted up on the cross, we may receive eternal life, the life of God.
