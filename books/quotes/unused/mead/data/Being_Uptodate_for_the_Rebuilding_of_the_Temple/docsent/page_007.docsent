   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MOTIVATING THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHO ARE TEACHERS AND MEDICAL PERSONNEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO DO THE WORK OF GAINING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whom should we motivate?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to motivate all the teachers in the whole province.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have around three thousand teachers working in kindergartens, elementary schools, junior high schools, high schools, and colleges.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This situation has much potential.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If these three thousand teachers were all motivated, what kind of an effect would they produce in the schools?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fifteen thousand high school and junior high school students who came to the last gospel meeting were brought mostly by their teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some teachers brought a hundred students while some brought fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the other hand, we also have close to one hundred fifty medical personnel, including doctors, nurses, and technicians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They have not taken any action for quite a while and have reserved quite a bit of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If this strength were motivated, it would be a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So we have to motivate the teachers to gain their students and the medical staff to gain their patients.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This would be very worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the past two years of training we have had seven to eight hundred people each term, and they all had a goal and a method to go door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yesterday I received a cable from Ghana, Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The saints there went out to knock on doors for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There were 140 saints who went out for four hours each day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In three days 1,300 were saved, and 545 were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our past two years of door-knocking in Taipei, we also have had many sweet stories.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The saints spoke The Mystery of Human Life to the taxi drivers while commuting from Hall One to Hall Three, and some were saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The number of taxi drivers who were baptized as a result of our preaching may have exceeded 500.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There were brothers and sisters everywhere in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many of them had stopped meeting for a long time, but through our door-knocking and contact they were brought back.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we surely must dig this gold mine of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE YOUNG PEOPLE OVERCOMING THE EVIL ONE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The passage in 1 John 2 is very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It has several features.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Concerning the fathers, it says that they know Him who is from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Concerning the young children, it says that they know the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These two groups are quite simple.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But regarding the middle category of the young men, it says that they overcame the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God has a goal on the earth, which is to defeat His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here the Bible does not mention the name Satan ; instead, it mentions his nature and what he does, saying that he is the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Greek the phrase evil one is a particular, emphatic phrase denoting that he is absolutely evil and is contagious and influential.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Greek there are several words that mean evil, but the word used here is the severest one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It implies that after this evil one infects others, he causes them to do evil things as well.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After this evil infects others, it does not cause them to die immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, it attacks people inwardly, causing them to become insane, to turn bad, and to be unable to live at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, it is truly evil.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE LOVE OF GOD BEING THE MOTIVATION</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Lord s prayer the Lord says, And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one Matt 6:13a .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some translations render the phrase the evil one as the evil, but actually, the evil here refers to the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The evil one is God s enemy, who is evil and fierce.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God s goal is to have the young men deal with His enemy so that His purpose will be attained.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The source of this motivation is God s love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First John 2:15 says regarding anyone who loves the world that love for the Father is not in him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a good translation, but it is not a literal translation of the original expression.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The literal translation of this verse is the love of the Father is not in him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The phrase love of the Father implies that the Father s love is within us, causing us to love the Father, that is, to love God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Father s love, or God s love, in man is the motivation, the source of love.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The power with which the young men overcome Satan is God s love, which also causes them to love God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Actually, it is not we who love God but something in us called God s love.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Satan is evil, whereas God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Evil infects people, causing them to not have peace and to do bad things that affect others and causes them to not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the contrary, God s love within us is a motivating power that gives us rest and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Here we can see a contrast.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the one hand there is Satan, and on the other hand there is God s love, and both are active.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the New Testament we see that while evil is very active, love is also very active.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Love is our motivation, giving us patience and endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Mothers love their children and even give up their lives because of love.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A newspaper once reported a plane crash in which only a child survived because his mother had embraced him during the disaster in order to protect him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is love.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God loves us; He is love.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God s love is in us and operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The result of this operation is that we love God and man.</S>
