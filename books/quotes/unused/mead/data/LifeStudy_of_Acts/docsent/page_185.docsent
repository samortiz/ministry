   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Initiated into the Identification</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>with the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 12 and 13 continue, And a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well attested by all the Jews dwelling there, came to me, and standing by said to me, Saul, brother, receive your sight!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And in that very hour I looked up at him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We know from 9:11-17 that the Lord sent Ananias, one member of His Body, to Paul so that he might be initiated into the identification with His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This must have impressed him with the importance of the Body of Christ and helped him realize that a believer needs the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to 22:14-16 Ananias said to Paul, The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear the voice of His mouth; for you will be a witness to Him unto all men of the things which you have seen and heard.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And now, why do you delay?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rise up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His is significant here.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It points particularly to the name of the One whom Paul hated and persecuted v. 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Greek word translated calling on is epikaleo.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This word is composed of epi, upon, and kaleo, call by name; that is, to call out audibly, even loudly, as Stephen did in 7:59-60.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Calling on the Lord s name in 22:16 was a means for Paul to wash away his sins in arresting so many of the believers who called on the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the believers knew that he considered calling on the Lord s name a sign of those he should arrest 9:14, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now he had turned unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to wash away his sins in persecuting and arresting the Lord s callers, not only before God but also before all the believers, Ananias charged him to do the same calling, which he had condemned, at his baptism, a public confession of the Lord whom he had persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sent to the Gentiles</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 22:17 and 18 Paul goes on to say, And it came about that when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I came into a trance, and I saw Him saying to me, Hurry, and go quickly out of Jerusalem, because they will not accept your testimony concerning Me. The Greek word rendered trance is ekstasis, and may be translated ecstasy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This Greek word means being put out of its place; hence, it refers to a state in which a man passes out of himself and from which he comes to himself 12:11 , as in a dream, but without sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It differs from a vision, in which definite objects are visible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 22:19 and 20 Paul said to the Lord, Lord, they know that I was imprisoning and beating in every synagogue those who believe on You, and when the blood of Your witness Stephen was being shed, I myself also was standing by and consenting and keeping the garments of those who did away with him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, the Lord said to him, Go, for I will send you to Gentiles afar off v. 21 . We are told the people listened to him up to this word v. 22 . But hearing the word Gentiles, they began to shout, Away with such a man from the earth, for it is not fitting for him to live! v. 22 . Actually, the word Gentiles uttered by Paul in verse 21 is related to the matter of the dispensational transfer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As soon as he spoke this word, it seems that a whirlwind came to stir up the people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They were provoked by this word and were not willing to listen any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Acts 22 Paul was somewhat cautious in presenting his experience on the way to Damascus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet he could not avoid relating a particular aspect of the truth the Lord s word to go to the Gentiles afar off.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since the Lord had told him this, how could he not testify of it to the people?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They, however, did not have the ears to hear such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The principle is the same among many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Just as the Jews in Acts 22 did not want to hear anything about the Gentiles, so these Christians do not want to hear us speak concerning the denominations, the church, the church ground, and Christ being the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From experience we know that if we talk to certain believers about these matters, they will be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BOUND BY THE ROMANS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Acts 22:23 and 24 say, And as they were crying out and throwing off their garments and throwing dust in the air, the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, saying that he should be examined by scourging in order that he might ascertain for what cause they were shouting against him so.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But as they stretched out Paul with the thongs, he said to a centurion standing by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned? v. 25 . Here we see Paul s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He utilized his Roman citizenship to save himself from suffering persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In these chapters in Acts we see that the Lord s sovereign hand surely was with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In His sovereignty, wisdom, and goodness the Lord rescued Paul and protected him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In chapter twenty-one Paul was forced into a very difficult situation, and he had no way to be released from it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord, however, raised up the environment through which Paul was rescued from that situation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, Paul was then in danger of being killed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the Lord intervened through the Roman commander to protect Paul from the Jews who wanted to kill him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As we shall see, after Paul was placed in Roman custody, the Jews formed a plot and put themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now there were more than forty who formed this conspiracy 23:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, the son of Paul s sister heard of the ambush and reported it to Paul 23:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul then called one of the centurions and told him to bring the young man to the commander.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the commander heard of the plot, he said to two of the centurions, Prepare two hundred soldiers that they may go as far as Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen by the third hour of the night, and mounts to stand by to put Paul on that they may bring him safely to Felix the governor 23:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may be surprised that so many soldiers, horsemen, and spearmen were involved in transferring Paul from Jerusalem to Caesarea.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The commander may have ordered this because of the large number of Jews involved in the uproar against Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The point we are making concerning this is that here we see the Lord s sovereign protection of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Caesarea Paul was kept in custody for two years.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>During these years he was safely guarded, protected from the plotting Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This became a golden time for Paul to consider his future.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In particular, it was a time for him to consider the matters he would later put into writing in such books as Hebrews, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sovereignly the Lord prepared an environment to safeguard Paul and to prepare him to carry out his writing ministry to complete his ministry and to complete the New Testament revelation.</S>
