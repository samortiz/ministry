Spirit and Soul and Body</H2><P>[Secondly, we have 1 Thessalonians 5:23. We must open to the Word and read it. Don't listen to any man's opinion. Don't listen to any man's word. Come back to the Word of God and read it: "And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." This verse clearly mentions that we have three parts&#151;the spirit and the soul and the body. Two conjunctions connect three things. There is no ground to say that the spirit is the soul.]</P><P>[In Genesis 2:7 "the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." Even from this verse it is clear that man has three parts. God firstly used the dust to form a physical body for man. Then He used breath to form man's spirit. The breath of life got into man and became his spirit. The spirit of man is mentioned in Proverbs 20:27. Spirit and breath in Hebrew are the same word. This indicates that the breath breathed into man became the human spirit. When these two parts, the body and spirit, came together, they produced the third part, a living soul.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Joints and Marrow</H2><P>[Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart." The word divides the spirit from the soul just as the sword divides the marrow from the joints which are the bones. The marrow is not the same as the bones. The marrow is something within the bones, the joints. In the same principle the spirit is something within the soul. It is easy for people to see the bones. But it is not so easy for people to realize what the marrow is. You have to break the bones to get to the marrow. In like manner, the spirit is under the covering of the soul, but it is absolutely different from the soul.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Trichotomy and Dichotomy</H2><P>[It is the clear teaching of Scripture that man is tripartite (1 Thes. 5:23). Nonetheless, there are two schools of theology which have arisen on this subject. One believes, as the Bible teaches, that man is a trichotomy; that is, he is made up of spirit, soul, and body. The other school maintains that man is a dichotomy; that is, he has an outer part, the body, and an inner part, the spirit or soul. In this latter school spirit, soul, and heart are considered synonyms.] We all must give up the human teaching of dichotomy and come back to the Word of God. </P><P>Let us now go on to see the parts of man and their condition at creation, after the fall, and in salvation. This will help us to understand the position of our soul in relation to our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE PARTS OF MAN</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. At Creation</H2><P>[At creation, man as a soul had two organs: the outward organ of his body and the inward organ of his spirit. Man's body as the outward organ was created to contact the physical world. Man's spirit as the inward organ was purposed to contact the spiritual world. Our physical body was made with dust, but our spirit was made with the breath of life. Therefore, it is not physical, but spiritual. The human life is not in the body or the spirit, but in the soul, for the soul is the person. Therefore, at creation, man with his soul was a soul, a human being, who had two organs: his body and his spirit.]</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> </body></html>
