All these wonderful, mysterious, excellent, abstract, and intangible things are in us, but we cannot show them to others
God, Christ, the Spirit, and life are all embodied in the word of God in the Bible, which is solid and tangible
Whenever we come to the Bible, even before we open it, we have a sensation that we have come into the presence of God
Whenever we come to the Bible, however, we sense that we are immersed in the presence of God because the word is the embodiment of God
John 5:12 clearly says, 'He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life'
The birds are much more liberated than we are, but they do not have the divine life, the eternal life, which is Christ Himself
A mistaken, damaging concept has crept into the Lord's recovery that life is the condition of being released by shouting and jumping
If this were true, spectators at sporting events would have more life than we do, for they jump, shout, and are fully released
We may not be shouting or jumping, but as long as we have Christ, even if we are sleeping, we are full of life
These two natures are divinity and humanity and these two facts are His allinclusive allaccomplishing death and His excellent resurrection
Christ who is the divine eternal life is an eternal infinite person composed not only of God and man but also of His death and resurrection
If we receive Him, we receive God, the highest humanity, Christ's all-inclusive, all-accomplishing death, and His resurrection
By receiving Christ, we receive divinity, humanity, a positive, life-releasing death, and a germinating resurrection
We may not love the Lord, and we may even dislike the Lord because we feel that He has not answered our prayers
The Bible is not an ordinary piece of literature like a newspaper or a magazine; rather, it is the word of God
Every morning we need to be refreshed spiritually by coming to the Bible and thereby coming into God's presence and God's breathing
After a time of deep breathing, it is difficult to remember the details of our first breath or of our second breath
Because young children sometimes refuse to eat, their mothers must encourage them and, if necessary, force them to eat
If we make this a legality and build up this good habit, after a month we will see a positive difference in our Christian life
We should not merely receive this word as a doctrine; rather, we should make a commitment before the Lord to practice this
If we love the Lord and desire to glorify the Lord and live as a testimony for Him, the only way to do so is to daily come to the Word
Now that we have seen that we need to come to the Word daily, we need to go on to see the way to come to the Word
The first way is the way of being nourished, which is to spend at least ten minutes to read the Word and five minutes in prayer
In our times of coming to the Word in the way of being nourished, we should not pray for our relatives, our friends, or any situation
If the Lord leads us to the Gospel of John, we should read and pray-read a few verses from John every morning, beginning with John 1:1
By rising fifteen minutes earlier, we can spend time in the word of our heavenly Father and thereby absorb all His unspeakable riches
Spending fifteen minutes in the Word in the way of being nourished each morning is to have our spiritual breakfast
The mothers of children who refuse to eat their breakfast may discipline them in order to encourage them to come and eat
Many dear saints have been disciplined by the Holy Spirit for remaining in bed too long and not spending time in the Word
Every morning we need to spend at least ten to fifteen minutes in the Word, but thirty to forty minutes is better
We know that this is not true because when we receive a phone call, we always have time to talk, sometimes for almost an hour
We should not allow our time on the phone to replace our time in the Word, even if our conversations are about spiritual matters
The way of being nourished and the way of reading are the common ways in which all the believers should come to the Word
When we come to the Bible in the reading way, we should not read in a random order or according to our preference
If we try to understand the Bible in a natural way, our effort will be a great frustration and a great disappointment
We sometimes do not understand a verse the first time we read it, but when we read the same verse again later, we understand it
Rather than trying to understand everything, we simply need to be faithful to continue reading and understand spontaneously
Because the Lord's recovery is spreading and the number of churches is increasing, there is a need for more elders
Before we begin to study the Bible, we first need to pray to seek the Lord's leading concerning which book we should study
To come to the Bible in the way of studying is not mainly for us to receive nourishment or simply to read, but to study in a thorough way
If we can teach others, we will be able to shepherd and will be qualified and constituted to be a proper leader in the church life
A plant will not grow if certain regulations of the plant life, such as a supply of light and water, are not fulfilled
If all the saints in a locality do this, the church in that locality will have a great revival after only half a year
God's economy is a dispensing work to dispense Christ into our very being, making Christ our life and even our person
Newspapers, textbooks, novels, and other such writings can never be the Spirit, but the word in the Bible is the Spirit
It is through the word, which is the Spirit, and through the Spirit, who is the word, that we contact Christ and remain in Christ
Christ as the divine electricity is mysterious yet real and powerful and He is brought into our being by two wiresthe Spirit and the word
Because Christ is transmitted into us through the word in the Bible and the Spirit we Christians must daily come to the Bible and the Spirit
In the word of God, which is our spiritual food, there are the same two kinds of elements-killing elements and nourishing elements
Some may point out that in the Bible there are many items, such as the heavens, the earth, animals, plants, human beings, and history
In all these different items in the Bible, there are actually only two main elements-a killing element and a nourishing element
The word crosses out our temper, our ambition, our natural life, our pride, our hatred, and even our hating self
The young brothers sometimes experience jealousy, not only in school life and family life but also in the church life
If the elders mention one young brother's name in a meeting, other young brothers may immediately become jealous
Although there is a killing power in the food we eat, this killing power is completely digested and depleted after several hours
Paul says, 'The word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God'
The only thing that works is for the young brothers to come to the Word every morning to pray-read a few verses
Every morning when we pray-read a portion of the Word, we receive a killing element and a nourishing element at the same time
There are many stories in the four Gospels, but either Christ, His death, or His resurrection is in every story
Whatever portion of the Bible we read, something always kills us, and something always supplies us with the riches of Christ
Whenever we read or study the Bible, if we do not receive Christ, His death, and His resurrection, our reading or our studying is vain
Regardless of the kind of food we eat, we always need to receive a killing element and a nourishing element from our food
As fallen, old, and corrupted people, we daily need a killing element, and this element, this antibiotic, is found in the Word
God's Spirit today is a compound Spirit, compounded with the same elements that are the constituents of the word of God in the Bible
The Spirit of God in the New Testament age is no longer only the Spirit of God; He is also the Spirit of Jesus Christ
The compound ointment was the holy anointing oil that was used to anoint the tabernacle, all its furniture and utensils, and the priests
John used the word anointing in reference to the Spirit of God who has been compounded with Christs humanity His death and His resurrection
When Christ resurrected, His death, His resurrection, and His being were all compounded into the Spirit of God
The word and the Spirit are the two means by which Christ, His death, and His resurrection are transmitted into our being
We cannot grow if we do not come to the Word, just as a child cannot grow physically if he or she does not eat
In this way we will have the two 'wires' for the spiritual transmission of Christ with His death and resurrection into our being
Some may define the Lord's recovery as the recovery of the genuine oneness, but genuine oneness is simply Christ Himself
Others may define the Lord's recovery as the recovery of the proper church life, but the proper church life also is Christ
God's eternal purpose and His economy is to work Christ into His chosen people so that they may become the Body of Christ
Just as we cannot say that a person's head is not the person, neither can we say that a person's body is not the person
Some may say that in order to be accurate, we must say that a finger is only a part of the person, not the person
Like Paul, we should have the boldness to say this because Christ lives in us and is being formed in us until our being becomes Christ
Our daily living reveals that we are not entirely Christ; rather, we are partially a Christ-man and partially the old man
In it he described church boards discussing ways to work for the Lord and preach the gospel yet not giving Christ a place in their decisions
There are many doctrines concerning Christ and many activities for the work of Christ, but Christ Himself is missing
Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all'
Because Christ, as everything in the church, has been lost and missed in Christianity, the Lord has come in to recover this crucial matter
The way to preach the gospel is not by any kind of activity but by a daily life of living Christ, growing Christ, and producing Christ
Approximately twenty-five years ago a group of young people came from the United States to Taiwan to preach the gospel by playing basketball
A large number of Taiwanese young people were attracted to see the Americans play basketball, and perhaps a few were brought to Christ
Eventually, they may decide that they need to have a band or an orchestra in order to attract a group of young people to hear the gospel
When the next Saturday comes, they may once again preach the gospel by using music to attract some young people
If we all lived this way and brought one person to Christ per year, we would have a hundred percent increase every year
Through the testimony of our daily living many of our relatives friends neighbors classmates and colleagues will eventually turn to the Lord
If someone speaks to us in this way, we need to be clear that this person is sent not by God but by God's enemy
If we care only for Christ, we will rise up early in the morning to contact the Lord and prepare to meet with His church
Attending sporting events may not be sinful, but our experience tells us that we do not receive more of Christ by going to sporting events
We need to go only where we can receive more of Christ, and we need to take only the way by which we will receive more of Christ
Some also told them not to be religious by always coming to the Lord's Day morning meeting, but others told them that they needed to come
When we contact Christ, live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ, Christ surely will not lead us to a theater, a bar, or a dancing club
If a brother is weak, he may occasionally slip into a theater to see a movie, but he should not promote this activity
If we would like to have some saints meet in our home, and if we have the assurance that Christ is in this, we should simply do it
In a meeting that we have insisted on according our taste, our conscience will tell us that our enjoyment of Christ is not pure
If some brothers feel to meet in their homes, we should not oppose them, but neither should they impose or promote their kind of meeting
If we care for the proper singing from our spirit, even if our voices are off key, our singing is still precious to the Lord
In the Lord's recovery we do not have any concepts, ways, activities, or organizations; instead, all we have is Christ
We must keep only Christ so that we may come together to have the church life as a living testimony of Jesus shining in this dark society
He was caught not by an outward power but by an inward revelation, for Paul said that it pleased God to reveal His Son in him
Colossians also reveals that Christ is the body of all the shadows, the reality of every positive thing in the universe
Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all'
There is even a popular gospel hymn that says, 'Into my heart, into my heart, / Come into my heart, Lord Jesus'
Our spirit may be likened to the living room in a home, and our heart may be likened to the bedroom, the inner chamber
When an intimate acquaintance comes to stay for several days, we will show him to a bedroom and tell him to feel at home
Christ is spreading from our spirit in the center of our being to the surrounding parts of our mind, emotion, and will
When Christ has spread into all our inward parts, He will be settled in our heart, having made His home in our heart
It is easy to understand the phrase walk in Christ, but we need to see what it is experientially to walk in Christ
It is not easy to define what it is to walk in Christ experientially because Christ is mysterious and abstract
We need only to see that Christ is the lifegiving Spirit that the lifegiving Spirit is now in our spirit and that these two spirits are one
Some say that it is better to stay home to sleep on the Lord's Day morning; they call this 'having a solid time'
If we walk in the mingled spirit, we will spontaneously know whether to stay home to sleep or to go to the meeting
To go to the meetings legally or to not go to the meetings legally are different ways, but neither way is according to life
Christ is holiness, righteousness, humility, love, kindness, patience, endurance, long-suffering, and faithfulness
Christ is the way to pray, the way to preach the gospel, and the way to do everything in our daily Christian life
Christ is the all-inclusive One who includes both God and man, yet we can walk in Him, for He is now the Spirit in our spirit
The Bible does not say that a certain kind of music is the way to preach the gospel; the Bible says to walk in Christ
Eventually, the sovereign Lord will cause something to happen in the circumstances of one of our acquaintances
Not only in preaching the gospel but also in everything in the church life we do not have a way; we have only Christ
The humility that we learn will become our pride because we will think that we are more humble than those around us
We can walk in Christ by contacting Him, spending time in the Word, praying, pray-reading, and worshipping Him
When others come to us with a question or a problem, this may be a temptation from Satan, just as he tempted Eve in the garden of Eden
If we walk in Christ, we will eventually be rooted in Him for growth in life and built up in Him for God's building
The young people may not say much in the meetings, but their talk outside the meetings shows that they are full of concepts
In our daily life our marriage life our family life our school life and especially our church life the solution to every problem is Christ
The biblical word economy refers to a dispensing administration, an administration that dispenses something into people
The word economy is the anglicized form of the Greek word oikonomia, which denotes an administration or stewardship to dispense something
Christ the Head is the manifestation of God in the flesh therefore the church His Body also must be the manifestation of God in the flesh
Corinthians 14:24-25 says that when the church is meeting properly, if an unbeliever enters, he will say, 'Indeed God is among you'
Many unbelievers do not understand this mystery, but often when people come into a meeting, they realize that God is there
In the Lord's recovery our church life, our daily life, and our family life is simply God coming in and God going out all day
Paul charged Timothy to remain in Ephesus with the sole purpose of charging certain ones not to teach different things
We should not teach different things, such as how long our hair should be or whether or not we should go to certain places
We should answer this new one by saying, 'In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul says that we should not teach things that are different from God's economy
We need to learn to make God's economy our daily talk, applying all the messages we hear and read to our daily life
The kind of pictures we hang in our bedroom may indicate whether or not we care for godliness in our private life
Rather, we need to see that whatever we do, whatever we are, and whatever we wear should give others an impression of godliness
We must exercise our spirit to reject such talk, which does not bear any impression of God being manifested in our flesh
If we choose the hairstyle of a movie star, when others see us, they will be impressed with the movie star, not with God
If we choose a worldly hairstyle, we will not have any impact on the barber if we try to preach the gospel to him
The brother's testimony opens up a way for him to say a few words concerning the Lord Jesus and gives impact to what he says
Godliness would not allow us to touch unclean things; rather, godliness will separate us from all ungodly things
We need to exercise our bodies for the sake of our health, but we should not do this in the realm of making a show
Even when no one sees us, we need to exercise ourselves unto godliness when reading the Bible, for it is the word of our heavenly Father
We need to exercise our bodies, but we should exercise ourselves unto godliness even as we are exercising our bodies
By being restrained, accurate, and in fear of God when passing on church news, we can show care for the edification of others
We need to learn the lesson to exercise ourselves unto godliness in everything, but especially in the words we speak to others
We first need to study the content of the message; then the Spirit will bring us into the experience of the message
We need to be bathed in all the terms and healthy teachings in the Lord's recovery by making them the topic of our daily conversations
We should be able to explain that all the words in the Bible either cross us out with Christ's death or enliven us with His resurrection
The word is our spiritual food that contains all the elements needed to kill the germs in our body and to supply us with life and strength
As we fellowship concerning these matters, the Holy Spirit will work to bring us into the depths of all these truths
We need to fellowship concerning these matters until we fully enter into them and they are wrought into our being
A missionary in China once preached the gospel to his cook, explaining that all people are sinners and need salvation
The missionary wisely did not argue with the cook but instead began to talk about a fine horse that the missionary owned
Regardless of how much we believers may declare that we have been liberated, there is always a living law within us
A young brother may lie to his mother, telling her that he is going to the library when he is actually going to a movie theater
By telling two lies, both of which will be judged by God, this young brother has shown that he is bound by movies
After being saved, however, something within will bother him both about going to a movie and about lying to his mother
If we have only a little pride within us, although no one may perceive it, the law within will condemn our pride
Those who misuse Romans 614 as a justification to live lawlessly say that as New Testament believers we should not be under any commandments
My mother often worried about her second daughter, my sister, who was teaching hundreds of miles away in another province
Romans 12:2a says, 'Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind'
Timothy 2:22 says, 'Flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart'
In everything we are under the commandments of the New Testament, the new law, which is the law of Christ and the law of freedom
Genuine, true freedom is not lawlessness but the new law, which releases us from the bondage of all kinds of wrongdoings and sinfulness
We need to spend time in the Word every day, for the word in the Bible embodies God, Christ, the Spirit, and life
If we see this, we will drop all concepts, ways, activities, and organization and simply cleave to Christ in everything
We need to review all these matters, fellowship concerning them, and practice them until they are wrought into our being
A baby does not know the words bitter or sweet, but he will always swallow something sweet and spit out something bitter
The baby is living, and in his life is a law that regulates him, causing him to swallow the sweet and spit out the bitter
Answer: Second Timothy 1:7 concerns our human spirit, and 4:22 concerns Christ as the life-giving Spirit being with our spirit
The real experience of the Christian life is entirely related to these two spirits-our spirit and Christ as the life-giving Spirit
Our spirit indwelt by Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the basic principle of every experience of the Christian life
We need only to take care of remaining in our spirit, going along with our spirit, and always returning to our spirit
The context of these verses shows that Paul was speaking in reference to the different ways of eating and practice held by Jews and Gentiles
The 'all things' that Paul spoke of becoming were related to different ways of eating and living, not to worldly, defiling activities
In order to raise our children to love the Lord and to come to the church meetings regularly, we must be a proper person
Parents must exercise their wisdom to discern whether or not to charge their children to come to the church meetings
The more they charge their children to come to the meetings, the more they offend their children, causing a strong reaction
If our children are in a certain condition, it may be better not to charge them to come the meetings until their condition improves
As parents, our duty is to be proper persons and to exercise wisdom to discern when and how to speak to our children
Answer: Because of the current of the age, it is very difficult for parents to forbid their children to watch television and movies
Parents need to exercise their wisdom to restrict which television shows or movies to allow their children to see
We also need to teach our children the reasons for these restrictions so that they will understand our decisions as they grow older
We should spend at least two hours every evening doing nothing but being with our children, talking to them, or teaching them something
Question: Some young brothers and sisters who leave home to study end up staying in dormitories with unbelievers
Answer: It is difficult to know whether it is better to keep our children at home or send them to school in another city
If we do not adequately educate and inoculate our children, it will not matter much if they stay at home while studying
A fifteen year old's spiritual health depends on how much education and inoculation he received in his first fourteen years
If parents do not properly prepare their children, it will not help much to suddenly consider where they should go to school
