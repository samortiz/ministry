   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Root of David</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As the fulfillment of Isaiah 11:10, Christ in Revelation 5:5 is called the Root of David.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This title He is also the Root of David s father Jesse, Isa 11:1 signifies that Christ is the source of David.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, as his forefather in the flesh, David called Him the Lord Matt 22:42-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we shall see, Christ in His humanity was a descendant of David and was born of David.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But Revelation 5:5 says that Christ is the Root of David, meaning that David grows out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible also says that Christ is the Branch of David Jer 23:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, Christ is both the root and the branch.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Isaiah 11:1 and 10 we see that Christ is also a branch and a root of Jesse.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have seen that Christ is both the Root of David and a descendant of David.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the sight of God David was the unique person in the Old Testament who fought the battle and gained authority, fighting the battle for God and gaining His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fact that Christ is the Root of David means that He is greater than David.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the reason He holds the key of David Rev 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whatever David was and whatever he had and did were altogether out of this root.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, as the Root of David Christ is more powerful and victorious than David and has God s authority in full.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Seed of David</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is not only the Root of David but also the seed of David.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 2 Samuel 7:12 and 13 is a prophecy regarding Christ as the seed of David: I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He shall build a house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fulfillment of this prophecy is found in Romans 1:3: Concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This verse speaks of Christ s humanity, His human nature, saying that He was born out of the seed of David according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ, therefore, is both the source of David and the issue of David.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, David came out of Him; on the other hand, He came out of David.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this we see the all-inclusiveness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God Whose Throne Is Forever and Ever</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>and the Scepter of Whose Kingdom Is Uprightness,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>and the One Whose God Has Anointed Him</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>with the Oil of Exultant Joy above His Partners</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Psalm 45:6 we have the following prophecy concerning Christ: Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Hebrews 1:8 this word is applied to Christ, the Son: As to the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This reveals that Christ, the Son, is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, He has an eternal throne, and the authority, the scepter of His kingdom, is a right scepter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This refers to Christ s reigning in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is God Himself, and He will be the King in the millennium reigning over the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Psalm 45:7 goes on to prophesy further of Christ: Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fulfillment of this prophecy is in Hebrews 1:9.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Righteousness represents what is related to God, and lawlessness represents what is related to Satan, the wicked one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For Christ to love righteousness and hate lawlessness means that He loves the things related to God and hates the things related to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ loves God and hates Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because Christ loves righteousness and hates lawlessness, God, even His God, has anointed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Hebrews 1:8 and 9 O God Your God refer to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since the Son is God Himself, He is God; therefore, verse 8 says, O God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since the Son is also a man, God is His God; therefore, verse 9 says, Your God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ, the very God, has been anointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is the One whose God has anointed Him with the oil of exultant joy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to Hebrews 1:9, God has anointed Christ with the oil of exultant joy above Christ s partners.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This verse does not mean that Christ s partners are not anointed; rather, it means that they are anointed under Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are Christ s anointed partners.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is anointed above us, and we are anointed under Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is the anointed One, and we are the anointed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In God s economy Christ is God s appointed One to accomplish God s plan, and we are Christ s partners in the divine interest.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He was anointed by God, and we share with Him in this anointing for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are partners of Christ, sharing with Him the spiritual anointing, even as the members of the Body share the Spirit with the Head.</S>
