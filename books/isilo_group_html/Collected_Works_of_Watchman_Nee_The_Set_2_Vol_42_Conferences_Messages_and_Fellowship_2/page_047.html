However, He did not do anything in us to accomplish His salvation; everything was done in Christ. Christ has accomplished everything for us. The only way for man to be saved is to be in Christ. We do not need to ask God to do anything in us. As long as we are in Christ, everything that Christ has accomplished will be realized in us. This is God's way of salvation. Let me ask a question: How did we enter into Christ? It is God who has put us into Christ. Strictly speaking, we must come out of Adam before we can get into Christ. For example, I must get out of this room before I can go into the next room. We must have an exit before we can have an entry. First, we get out of Adam, and then we get into Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">GETTING INTO ADAM THROUGH BIRTH<br />AND GETTING OUT OF ADAM THROUGH DEATH</h2><p>In order to know how to get out of Adam, we must first know how we got into Adam. John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh." Who are the ones who are in the flesh? They are those who are born of the flesh. As soon as we were born, we were in Adam. The life which we inherited from our parents is an Adamic life. After so many generations, the human life is still the Adamic life. Since we entered Adam through birth, how do we get out of Adam? Suppose I entered this room facing the east. In order to go out, I only need to turn around and walk toward the west. Since we entered Adam through birth, we have no other exit except through death. Once we die, we terminate our standing in Adam. Thank God that He has delivered us out of Adam by bringing us through death.</p><h2 class="head1">DEATH BEING THE ONLY WAY TO GET OUT OF ADAM</h2><p>In Adam we can do nothing but sin. Death is the grand deliverance by which we are delivered from the bondage of sin. A man may be bound by many things, but everything is over as soon as he dies. The same principle applies in the spiritual realm. Romans 6:7 says, "For he who has died is justified from sin." After a man has died, he can no longer sin; consequently, he is free from sin. A dead man is one whose thoughts, will, temper, and evil deeds are dead. There was a man in Australia who was sentenced to death. He committed such serious crimes that the judge handed down one hundred and eighty verdicts of death against him. However, he only needed to die once. Then he could sin no more. A man can be a drug addict, robber, murderer, or hardened criminal, but everything is over as soon as he dies. He will no longer sin. The biblical principle is the same. Once a Christian dies, everything is over with him.</p><p>The way we enter Adam is through birth, and the way we exit Adam is through death. Once we die, we are delivered from Adam's sins. We have the way now. But how can we take this way? We are born into Adam and have become a part of him. Today if we want to get out of Adam, we have to die. Once we die, we will be delivered from Adam. But how can we die? How can we be freed from Adam? The way to salvation is death, the way to victory is death, and the way to be freed from Adam is also death. The question today is, how can we die? How can we back up this "car" to its original place? Can we die by ourselves? No. There is no way for us to die by ourselves. The way of death has been prepared by God. When we believe in Him, we die in Christ and are freed from Adam. Hallelujah! How wonderful it is to be in Christ! When we are in Christ, we die.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 42: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (2) &nbsp; pg 47</div><br></body></html>
