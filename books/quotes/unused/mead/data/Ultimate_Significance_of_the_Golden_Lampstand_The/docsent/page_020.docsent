   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Church Being the Place for God s Transfusion</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Here I would like to use a new phrase: The church is the place where God transfuses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Have you ever heard such a phrase?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every time we meet together, we allow God to transfuse Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Previously many of us were in Christianity, in the old denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We dressed up properly to go to church every Sunday morning, and near the end of the service, the offering plate would be passed and we would put money in it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Can we say from our conscience that God s transfusing was there?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not know what was transmitted there, but it was definitely not the place where God was transfusing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, when we come to the church meetings, we feel that we are sitting before the Lord and that His eyes are looking at us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we obey Him, we feel that He is lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we disobey Him, He is still lovely, but we are a little ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may say, O Lord, in the past week I disobeyed You.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, forgive me and wash me with Your precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all have had such an experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the transfusion and infusion of the Lord s inner being into us for our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Transformation is not a change caused by a shining light; rather, it is the transfusing of the Lord s lovable person into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After such an experience, we may return home with tears, saying, O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Have mercy on me this week.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I don t want to sin against You again.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I want to please You.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, we still do not know Him enough.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our heart is right, but we are wrong because we do not know that we cannot please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are like a centipede which can only crawl on the ground but wants to fly in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is as if we are saying, O Lord, I was crawling on the ground last week; not once did I fly in the air to please You.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I really sinned against You.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Starting from this week I don t want to crawl on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I want to fly in the air with You.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, after such a prayer at the beginning of the week, we may start crawling on the ground the same night and continue for the whole week.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then on the following Lord s Day when we come to the meeting, the seven eyes of God may say, Here you are again!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>, and we may repeat our prayer of confession.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the Lord may say, Do not cry!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I do not blame you at all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You are a centipede, so I have no intention that you would fly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you not know that I am the flying life?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sometimes, however, the Lord does not say anything; He just transfuses.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This transfusion goes on week by week until the centipede begins to fly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This will amaze our family; they will not know what has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They will not be able to describe it, but they will sense that there is something wonderful in us and that we have had a great change.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such an experience is the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The seven eyes are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must not forget that the seven eyes are on the lampstand, and the lampstand is in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are not in the Holy Place, we do not have the lampstand, and without the lampstand, we cannot have the seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Holy Place is the church, and the lampstand is also the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To receive the transfusion of the seven eyes we must be in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To be in the church is not merely a matter of listening to messages or giving messages.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These are small matters.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some elderly sisters can testify that many times after coming to the meetings, they cannot remember anything that was said.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, they do remember that when they go to the meetings, something touches them and enters into them, although they cannot explain it clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They feel that it is so good to go to the meetings, and it is a loss not to go.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That is why after going to a meeting on the Lord s Day, they still go on the following Tuesday, and they make it a rule to go again on Thursday.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although they cannot remember clearly what is said, they feel so good within.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the characteristic of the churches in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are some who say that the church has a way of capturing people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After coming to meet with us and listening to two messages, they say, people are glued, and they go to the meeting hall every day.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The old ones go, and the young ones also go; the men go, and the women also go; they go on the Lord s Day and also on Tuesday; they go in the morning and also in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Someone once asked me what our secret is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The secret is the seven lamps of fire and the seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whether or not we are the church does not depend on outward organization; it depends on whether there are the seven eyes among us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These seven eyes are not only for shining on us but also for transfusing God Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even if one is a highly educated and intelligent university professor, this does not mean that he has the proper understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In 1947 there was a revival in the church in Shanghai, where there was a university professor who loved me very much.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He said, Brother Lee, I would feel good just to accompany you and help you carry your Bible bag.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Nevertheless, the problem was that even though he was a professor in a medical school and had listened to all my messages, he understood nearly nothing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In contrast, I have seen some sisters in Shanghai who were quite elderly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They could not speak Mandarin properly or read the Bible smoothly, but when they listened to my messages, they understood every single one.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the characteristic of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The church is not those with degrees or those with big minds.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The church is a group of people who have experienced God s transfusion.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God is able to transfuse Himself into them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I can truly testify for those elderly sisters in Shanghai that they were clear within.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God could transfuse His being into them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The effectiveness of our work lies here.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we use our mind to speak mere knowledge, although we can make a professor understand us, there is no transfusion of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The secret of our work does not lie in how many good messages we have given.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Rather, it hinges on how much God has been transfused into others after each meeting or message.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is what makes a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Some people are very eloquent, and when they give a sermon, it is like music, but in the end there is no transfusion of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We thank and praise Him that the seven lamps are the seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today the Lamb has seven eyes, not seven lamps; likewise, the stone has seven eyes, not seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The eyes are here gazing at us to transfuse God into us.</S>
