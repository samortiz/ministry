<h1 class=series>THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE THREE</h1><h1 class=title>HOW TO START YOUR VITAL GROUP</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 9:16-27; Rom. 1:14-15</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>By fellowshipping with your companion through desperate prayers for the Lord’s blessing.</li><li>To start from the first step of the God-ordained way—to get sinners saved to make them the members of the Body of Christ.</li><li>To review all of your acquaintances—relatives, neighbors, friends, schoolmates, and colleagues—and make a list of them.</li><li>To pray over the name list and seek the Lord’s leading concerning who should be the first for you to take care of.</li><li>To also keep yourself open to the Lord for His leading to visit people other than your acquaintances.</li><li>The way to visit, contact, and gain the gospel candidates:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To visit them by appointment continuously.</li>	<li>To invite them to your dinner regularly.</li>	<li>To write them concerning their salvation periodically.</li>	<li>To mail them gospel tracts and spiritual booklets all the time.</li>	<li>To pray concerning the spiritual welfare of certain definite ones for your whole life.</li>	<li>Whatever way you take, you should do it persistently with patience and endurance and do not expect to have a quick reaping.</li>	<li>Learn how to use biblical verses and tracts.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>In this series of messages, I am not burdened to speak doctrinally. I have already released many messages concerning the God-ordained way with the vital groups, so I am now burdened to speak something that will help us be brought into the actual practice of the vital groups. We may have the terms God-ordained way and vital groups, but do we really walk in the way ordained by God? Are we really vital? We do not want mere terminology but the actual experience of being vital persons in the God-ordained way.<p>In these days I feel that we are short of prayer. When we come together, we should have the burden to pray much. If we had the spirit of prayer and the burden of prayer, nothing would be able to stop us. We should pray, “Lord, we hate these three enemies. We hate deadness, lukewarmness, and barrenness.” We may be in the recovery, but we are dead, lukewarm, and barren. I would like to hear us pray, “Lord, give me the burden to bear fruit. Give me the utterance and the boldness in speaking for You.” We need this kind of desperate prayer.
