[1]  The Key to the Success of the New Way
[2]  OF THE NEW WAY THE EFFECT OF THE NEW WAY
[3]  In October of 1984, the church in Taipei began to change the system, and there was a scene of newness replacing the old, particularly regarding the method of our work, the church meetings, and the service.
[4]  Then after another half year, in order to meet the need, we officially began the Full-time Training and the practice of going out to knock on doors, bringing people to be saved, and baptizing them.
[5]  We can summarize the need in the home meetings in four crucial points, which we need to pay close attention to.
[6]  When we go to the homes of the newly baptized ones to lead the home meetings, whether in singing, praying, reading the Bible, or fellowshipping, we cannot use the old method.
[7]  Initially, when we go to help the new ones in a home meeting, we will at most fellowship with them and demonstrate to them in the meeting how to pray, sing the hymns, and read the Scriptures, but we must allow them to do these on their own as much as possible.
[8]  THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW WAY THE STUDY FOR THE FURTHERANCE OF THE NEW WAY
[9]  Door-knocking and home meetings are an example of this; no matter how we carry them out, our doing may still be in the old way because we have been in the old way for too long.
[10]  EXAMPLES OF STRIVING FOR PREACHING THE GOSPEL THROUGH DOOR-KNOCKING
[11]  If we agree with this way and do not oppose it, then the full-timers should go door-knocking two to three hours every day.
[12]  In two and a half hours someone can knock on the doors of fifteen homes, and in six days he can knock on ninety homes.
[13]  If someone goes out the first week and there is no son of peace, and on the second, third, and even sixth week there still is none, he may go to the Lord desperately and say, Lord, I give up.
[14]  The principles of attending a home meeting are first that we must make a resolution, and second that we must know that our going to the home meetings is not to lead the new ones but to teach them.
[15]  When we go to their home meetings and teach them these six or seven basic actions, we can tell them that this meeting is like a ball game, and we are simply the coaches who coach them how to play.
[16]  John 15:16 says, You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you.
[17]  Many people do not understand why, after the Lord says that we should bear fruit and that our fruit should remain, He immediately says that whatever we ask the Father in His name, the Father may give us.
[18]  We may have much doctrine and knowledge of the Bible, but if we do not know that Christ is the Spirit, those doctrines are not related to us in a real way, and we have no taste for them.
[19]  At that time, when we finished the life-study of the New Testament, we decided to go to Taiwan to research the reasons for this.
[20]  At this time the Lord is opening our eyes to show us a line that we have neglected, which is to go Matt 28:19 and to meet from house to house Acts 2:46; 5:42 .
[21]  Only when we are with the Lord and live with the Lord can we bear fruit with Him.
[22]  In the past we pursued to be spiritual, holy, and victorious, and many times we seemed to be quite spiritual, holy, and victorious, yet we did not bear fruit.
[23]  As some saints have testified, if we go out to knock on doors but do not see anyone saved, this is a sign, an indication, that we have a problem either with God or with man.
[24]  If we confess our sins, the next time we go door-knocking, we will have fruit immediately.
[25]  When we two He and we, we and He become one, our going out will be His going out.
[26]  It is not we who go door-knocking, but Jesus Christ who abides in us goes door-knocking in order to seek and to save that which is lost.
[27]  I hope that we all would see that in order to be truly spiritual, holy, and victorious, we must abide in the Lord and also let Him abide in us.
[28]  If we do not bear fruit, this proves that we have not been abiding in the Lord and that there are some problems in our organic union with Him.
[29]  Similarly, if we do not abide in the Lord, although outwardly we may still go to the meetings and keep ourselves from sin, we are insulated within and cut off from the Lord.
[30]  Building and perfecting the home meetings are the key to the success of the practice of the new way.
[31]  The following are some important points that can help us build up and perfect the home meetings.
[32]  For instance, when we are about to lose our temper, or when we have already lost our temper, then we are certain that we have not been in spirit and that our actions were not out from the spirit.
[33]  However, when we who serve the Lord pray and then not do all the things that we sense are not of the spirit, what remains is all of the spirit.
[34]  Never correct them on the spot, because this will quench their spirit and ordinances will then come in. If a point comes when they do not do anything, we may then lead them a little by asking, Should we read some verses now? Then we can ask them where we should read.
[35]  In the first home meeting, we should talk about our need to meet.
[36]  We need to learn to use Life Lessons, but not in a rigid way.
[37]  It is not necessary for us to read one lesson every time we meet.
[38]  When we go to the home meetings, we will always encounter the practical problems of the new ones, which we cannot ignore.
[39]  THE HOME MEETINGS BEING JOINED TO THE LORD AS ONE SPIRIT
[40]  When we go to perfect a home meeting, the real power lies in our being joined to the Lord as one spirit.
[41]  Whether or not we are joined to the Lord as one spirit is spontaneously revealed in our living in several ways.
[42]  First, we must be people who always pray and fellowship with the Lord.
[43]  Often when we have too many things to pray for, they become a distraction to our being joined to the Lord.
[44]  According to the New Testament, to pray unceasingly means that we are always joined to the Lord and that we keep contacting the Lord in our inner being.
[45]  How useful we are in the Lord s hand and the kind of home meeting we can produce all depend on the extent, the degree, and the condition of our joining to the Lord.
[46]  Second, we must be proficient in the word of the Lord.
[47]  Not only should we understand it, but we also need to enter into it.
[48]  Then when we go to perfect a home meeting, the element of the Lord s word will come out whenever we open our mouth.
[49]  When we go to someone s home to perfect the meeting there, we need to have this kind of morale by which others can see that we belong to Jesus, that for us to live is Jesus, and that all we think and everything within us is nothing but Jesus.
[50]  The three foregoing matters are for our fanning people into flame, causing them to be burning in spirit.
[51]  When we go to perfect a home meeting, although we should not be rigid, neither should we be playful.
[52]  When we are alone in our room, whether or not we have self-control may not be apparent, but when we are in someone s living room, we should behave in a soberminded way.
[53]  Every Lord s Day our coming together is to have a declaration, a remembrance, a display in the universe, and at the same time we remind ourselves that we love Him, we consider Him, and we are waiting for His coming back.
[54]  CHAPTER SIX KEYS TO PERFECTING THE HOME MEETINGS GIVING OURSELVES TO OTHERS
[55]  When we knock on doors, particularly to care for and perfect the home meetings, our greatest need is to give two things to others: first, ourselves and second, life and truth.
[56]  In other words, it is to give ourselves and the Lord to others.
[57]  In Matthew 20, when the Lord s disciples were reasoning as to which of them was greatest, the Lord told them not to reason in that way; rather, they should learn to serve.
[58]  When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He denied Himself in all aspects and at all times.
[59]  Therefore, when we go to perfect home meetings, we must be ones who deny ourselves.
[60]  Although for many years in the church we have been taught that our being must be broken and that our self, whether good or bad, must be dealt with, this teaching is still useless to brothers like this.
[61]  Each time we go to a home meeting, we must have the definite goal of supplying truth and life to others.
[62]  On the one hand, we need to encourage the new ones to ask questions in the home meetings, while on the other hand, we should not expect to deal too much with their problems.
[63]  This is not to say that we will not solve their problems but that we should not intend to solve their problems.
[64]  Every time we go to perfect a home meeting, we must have a definite goal: to give a particular spiritual truth to others and to supply life to them.
[65]  However, while we are working, we cannot refuse to accommodate them, but neither should we be too accommodating.
[66]  If we do not accommodate them, we will kill them, but if we do accommodate them, there must be a limit to how much we are prepared to do.
[67]  We want them to see that we break the bread not because we have been admitted into a religion or that we follow a religious ceremony, but that breaking the bread will help them to have a turning point in their life and become ones who love the Lord and desire Him.
[68]  CHAPTER SEVEN LEADING PEOPLE TO KNOW THE CHURCH THE MEETINGS IN THE NEW WAY
[69]  The New Testament reveals to us that the Lord s universal church is manifested locality by locality, and in every locality the church s meetings are mostly in the homes of the saints.
[70]  Hence, the home is the basic unit of the church life.
[71]  Undoubtedly, the church s meetings include big meetings and medium-sized meetings, but the basic meeting place is the home.
[72]  It is hard to determine at what time Peter arrived at that house, but it is likely that it was late at night v. 6 . This shows us that the church meeting at that time was not similar to today s religious worship, which is almost always in the same place on definite dates and at set times.
[73]  We have taken the new way to gain many new ones, but if we cannot raise every one properly, we will owe something to the Lord, and we will also lose our credibility.
[74]  If we look at Catholicism carefully and go to their masses, we will understand the real situation there, and if we go to the Vatican, we will understand the Bible s prophecies in Revelation, which say that one day the Lord will burn up all those things.
[75]  THE NEED OF THE NEW ONES TO KNOW THE CHURCH
[76]  When we go out to perfect the home meetings, we need to be aware of the needs of the new ones.
[77]  Since we do not want them to be infected, we have preferred to slow down, not mentioning the church too soon and not letting them know about the church too quickly.
[78]  However, when we go out to preach, we must speak in a way that is easy to understand, just as a mother becomes a good doctor who makes important nutrients and medicines into something very convenient and easy to take in. As far as we know, there are already one hundred fifty homes among us beginning to have the Lord s table meeting.
[79]  In principle, once we begin to have the Lord s table meetings, we should speak to the saints concerning the church, letting the ones who break the bread know what the church is.
[80]  Second, Ephesians 1:23 tells us that the church is the Body of Christ.
[81]  We have to let them know that the church is the called-out assembly of God; the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ as His expression; the church is the house of God, which holds all that God is as the reality; and at the same time the church is the manifestation of God in the flesh.
[82]  THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH The Universal Aspect
[83]  In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus speaks of the church, referring to its universal aspect; the Lord will build His church on this rock, the revelation Peter received concerning Christ as the Son of the living God.
[84]  We can go to home meetings during the week, district meetings on the Lord s Day, and if we are willing, we can also go to the meetings in the meeting hall.
[85]  CHAPTER EIGHT LEADING PEOPLE TO KNOW THE TRUTH CONCERNING SECTS
[86]  When the new way reaches a critical point, it will come to a peak, which is the home meetings.
[87]  The way to lead the home meetings, perfect the home meetings, and go on in the home meetings is altogether critical to the success of the new way.
[88]  Going door-knocking, visiting people, leading people to believe in the Lord and be saved, and baptizing them are only the basic matters.
[89]  Today the Bible is in our hands, but I am afraid that the way to use it still remains a big question.
[90]  When we go to lead and perfect a home meeting, we may not even know what kind of truth materials we have and how to use them.
[91]  Moreover, we all have a heart to take the leading of the new way and go out to perfect the home meetings, but we find that the way to speak in a home meeting is a very difficult lesson to master.
[92]  Whenever we fellowship in a home meeting, we must release our spirit every time we open our mouth.
[93]  Second, before we go to lead a home meeting, we should have adequate prayer so that we will be bold in the release of the spirit.
[94]  What is a sect, and what constitutes a sect?
[95]  The Baptist Church not only requires people to be baptized, but they also emphasize that people must be baptized in their church and in their water and that other baptisms do not count.
[96]  CHAPTER NINE BEING A WITNESS TO BEAR FRUIT THE LIFE SUPPLY FOR THE NEW BELIEVERS
[97]  According to our study and observation, we feel that we still need to prepare a set of materials for the perfecting of the home meetings.
[98]  On the one hand, a person who serves the Lord should have outward activities and work, but on the other hand, he should never forget that all work must come from the inner life.
[99]  Therefore, we must work for God and bear fruit, while on the other hand, we must be witnesses of the Lord s life.
[100]  In Acts 1, the disciples who personally observed the Lord s death and resurrection immediately became witnesses of the Lord.
[101]  By this we see that the Lord Jesus wanted the disciples to go out not to do a work but to be a certain kind of person.
[102]  In the matter of being the Lord s witnesses, we often like to say, We need to witness for the Lord.
[103]  As witnesses of the Lord, we often think that we need to give a good testimony for Him, testifying to people how lovely, real, reliable, and powerful our Savior is.
[104]  If we pay too much attention to the number of people and to the outward activities in the church life, I am afraid that we will all become athletes who know only how to run a race; that is, that we will have only physical activities without functioning in spirit.
[105]  We need to exercise to be joined to the Lord as one spirit and pray all the time, O Lord, I have no way to impart life into others, but this is what You can do and should do.
[106]  According to our observation, there is the danger that when we go door-knocking to lead people to salvation and baptize them, what we do may become mechanical.
[107]  This may be due to the fact that our spirit is not strong enough and that we do not want to exercise our spirit.
[108]  Due to the training that we have received in the past, we have become very experienced in door-knocking and baptizing people, even to the extent that our wealth of experience has become a mechanical method.
[109]  The result is that there is not much life and spirit in what we do.
[110]  I believe that many of us have the feeling that when we go door-knocking and baptize people, our way is sometimes too careless.
[111]  In the same way, when we go to knock on doors, baptize others, or perfect the home meetings, we should follow the principle that we fellowship immediately whenever we discover a difficulty.
[112]  There are many aspects that we should pay attention to in perfecting the home meetings.
[113]  Of these, the most important ones the ones which enable people to be perfected in life, which supply life and cause people to grow in life are the Spirit and the word.
[114]  Although we have paid much attention to these two aspects in the past, we are human and are still in our flesh, our natural feelings, and our natural thoughts.
[115]  Even if we have been serving the Lord with our full time for a long time, our practice related to the Spirit and the word is still lacking.
[116]  Over the years, we have seen the danger brought about by opinions in various localities.
[117]  For this reason we have held several trainings to present again the truth of the divine revelation.
[118]  What we are doing today is presenting, to those who seek the Lord out of a pure heart, the things that we have learned, the things that we have come to know, and the things that the Lord has commissioned us with, as well as the revelation and vision that we have received from His word.
[119]  THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND THE WORD OF GOD
[120]  In the past we presented thirty items concerning the training of our character.
[121]  However, when we go out to minister life to others, the source of supply does not depend on our perfect physique, our trained and non-barbaric soul, or even the condition of our human spirit.
[122]  If we are those who are filled with the Spirit of the Lord and the word of the Lord, then when we go out to contact people, what we speak to them will be the word, but when this word is received into them, it will become spirit and life.
[123]  In order to perfect the home meetings, we should first learn to teach people how to sing hymns.
[124]  When we go to the home meetings, the first thing we should do is to teach the attendants to sing those hymns.
[125]  In all our service we need to learn to have no opinions.
[126]  Those who like to talk a lot and have many opinions often do not work much.
[127]  We also need to train our character in our daily life.
[128]  We not only seek the constant filling of the Holy Spirit, but we also need to have a good training of our character.
[129]  This kind of condition is not appropriate, and this tells us that we do not have a good character.
[130]  Currently we have about seven thousand new ones under our care, and there are still about ten thousand new ones whom we are not able to care for, mainly because we do not have enough people to take care of them.
[131]  AND THE USE OF LIFE LESSONS 2 SOME FELLOWSHIP REGARDING HYMNS
[132]  Furthermore, we should also know the time when Christ was crucified.
[133]  Since Life Lessons and the home meetings are closely related, we need to have a basic knowledge of Life Lessons.
[134]  Then the last two volumes cover the full salvation which God has prepared in Christ for us who have believed into Him, the riches which we have obtained in Christ, the experience which we should have in Christ, the things which we should accomplish in Christ, and the goal which we should attain in Christ.
[135]  Rejecting the Old Way of Knowledge and Emphasizing the New Way of Life
[136]  Therefore, when we read the Bible, we read with our eyes, then comprehend with our mind, and then receive what we read with our spirit.
[137]  Therefore, when we read a verse like Genesis 1:1, we read first with our eyes, we understand the text with our mind, and then we receive and assimilate these words with our spirit.
[138]  A FEW MATTERS CONCERNING THE HOME MEETINGS The Bread-breaking Meeting
[139]  We need to fellowship about a few matters related to the home meetings.
[140]  We all know that the home meetings are the most important item of our present practice.
[141]  We all must learn to exercise our spirit to touch people s condition and observe all the situations so that we can make the correct decisions concerning them.
[142]  For example, after leading the home meeting in a certain home for three to five times, or even ten to twenty times, we should set up a Lord s table meeting for them.
[143]  If we do not first observe their situation, we should not make a decision concerning the Lord s table meeting.
[144]  We should lead them to the point where we can sense that the inner condition of the few saved ones in this home is stable before the Lord.
[145]  If there are ten to twenty saints in a home meeting, we may sometimes bring them to attend the Lord s table meeting at the meeting hall on the Lord s Day morning.
[146]  AND THE USE OF LIFE LESSONS 4 BEING SPECIFIC IN USING LIFE LESSONS
[147]  Home meetings are the emphasis of the new way in the Lord s recovery, and the most important thing for the home meetings is knowing how to use Life Lessons.
[148]  Our problem is that when we use Life Lessons, we add too many of our own words.
[149]  For this reason, it is often a help not to bring our Bibles, hymnals, and tracts with us when we go to the home meetings.
[150]  It is because when we bring the Bible with us, we are tempted to use some verses which are not necessary for the lesson, and eventually we are distracted from the main theme.
[151]  The chapter we read may be about calling upon the name of the Lord, but we will be tempted to read Genesis 1 about God s creation.
[152]  Whether or not we serve full-time in the future, as long as we serve the Lord, we need to do two things.
[153]  The first is to go door-knocking by using The Mystery of Human Life, and the second is to have home meetings by using Life Lessons.
[154]  HAVING A LONG-TERM VIEW IN TAKING THE NEW WAY
[155]  He spoke in the Gospel of Luke that He sends us out in the midst of the wolves, but among the wolves there are sons of peace who are pre-chosen by God 10:3-6 .
[156]  However, we need to be well prepared that some sons of peace may not remain to be sons of peace for their whole life.
[157]  We need to remember that no one can frustrate the Lord s way, but we also should not expect that this way will proceed smoothly without difficulty.
[158]  The home meetings are the life-pulse of the church life and the key to the success of the new way.
[159]  Therefore, we have to apply our full strength to the home meetings.
[160]  When we go to a home meeting, we must be living persons with a living spirit.
[161]  If we go, we will certainly give others an impression of emptiness and deadness, and this is what we must not do.
[162]  When we go to the home meetings, we must be vital and go with our spirit.
[163]  If we do not go with our spirit, we should not eat or sleep until our spirit is ready.
[164]  If all of us still meet according to this old way, we too may eventually give up the meetings because we do not have the spirit and life.
[165]  The most important thing to learn for the home meetings is how to use Life Lessons.
[166]  One of the characteristics of the four volumes of Life Lessons is that all the titles of the lessons are printed on the cover so readers will understand what the book is about at a single glance.
[167]  From this table of contents we can quickly see that the first volume is for helping the newly baptized ones to know that they are saved all the way to their knowing the church.
[168]  The first volume talks about knowing that you are saved, having the life of the Lord, knowing the church, and living a life in the church.
[169]  When we go to a home meeting, we must learn to detect the atmosphere.
[170]  In other words, we have to find out the real situation of the new ones and how much they have grown in life.
[171]  AND THE USE OF LIFE LESSONS 6 THE CENTRAL LINE OF THOUGHT
[172]  Volume one begins with Knowing that You are Saved and The Need of Your Whole Family to Be Saved, and continues with Clearance of the Old Living, Prayer, Reading the Bible, and five kinds of knowing: Knowing the True God, Knowing Christ, Knowing the Holy Spirit, Knowing the Cross of Christ, and Knowing the Church.
[173]  From now on, the way the church should take is to knock on doors, lead people to be baptized, and set up home meetings.
[174]  Therefore, we must work out the estimated number by the Lord s grace until there are nine hundred sixty thousand brothers and sisters living the Christian life in Taipei.
[175]  What we expect is that after one and a half years, after we have gone through all the forty-eight lessons of the four volumes of Life Lessons, the new ones we lead will become what we are, and the number of saints will double.
[176]  At this stage when we go to labor on the home meetings, we must pay attention to the situation of the family and understand how many meetings they are able to have.
[177]  Generally speaking, there should be a meeting once a week in a home, but this is not enough for the long run.
[178]  We need to adjust the meetings according to the actual situation, and we should consider which meeting should be added the Lord s table meeting, prayer meeting, fellowship meeting, or truth meeting.
[179]  Before coming to the meeting hall, we need to prepare them and let them know that in the home meeting we all function and speak freely according to the Spirit, and we should do the same when we attend the meeting in the meeting hall.
[180]  When we are transferred into Christ, we are then Joined to Christ, Abiding in Christ, Experiencing Christ, expressing Christ, and Taking Christ as Everything lessons twenty-five through twenty-nine .
[181]  After that, we are One Spirit with the Lord, Living in the Fellowship of Life, Obeying the Sense of Life, Obeying the Teaching of the Anointing, and Walking according to Spirit lessons thirty through thirty-four .
[182]  When we are transferred into Christ to live a life that is sanctified, spiritual, overcoming, and one spirit with the Lord, we will eagerly await the Lord s coming and will be raptured to meet Him and be with Him joyfully.
[183]  Although these matters are deep, some who are desirous to pursue the Lord may have the heart to understand, and they may raise an endless stream of questions.
[184]  Then he will receive an impression of the new covenant and know that the Lord Jesus is the Mediator of the new covenant and that He is now in the heavens doing one thing, that is, executing the new covenant upon those who believe in Him.
[185]  If they do not let us go, we should be happy for their pursuing heart, and we should read again to get into the words with them.
