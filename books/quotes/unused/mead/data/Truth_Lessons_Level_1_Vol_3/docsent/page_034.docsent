   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As the Anointing Ointment</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit is also the anointing ointment in the believers to anoint them 2 Cor 1:21; Heb 1:9b; 1 John 2:20, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit is not dormant in the believers; rather, He is always in motion and active.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His moving, His action, is a kind of anointing to add more of the elements of the Triune God into them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more this anointing ointment anoints them, the more the divine elements increase in them and the more the Triune God is united with them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit s adding the divine elements into them by anointing them is like someone s painting a piece of furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If he continues to paint, eventually that piece of furniture will be completely saturated with the paint, and the entire piece of furniture will bear the color of the paint.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is also in this way that the Spirit s anointing causes the Triune God to be mingled with the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Triune God Himself is both the Painter and the paint; the believers are like pieces of furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It pleases God to be mingled with them that they may be filled with His elements.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, He has become the Spirit to be the anointing ointment continually anointing them until they are filled with His elements.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When paint is applied to furniture, there is no interaction between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, when the Spirit as the anointing is added into the believers, He is mingled with them as one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The compound Spirit as the anointing is typified by the holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The holy anointing ointment was made by mingling four spices with a hin of olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This blending made the oil into a fragrant ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Olive oil signifies the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Flowing myrrh smells sweet but tastes bitter, and in the Bible it is used mostly for burial.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, it signifies the precious death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Cinnamon has a distinctive flavor and is used as a spice in cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Calamus is a reed which grows out of a marsh or muddy place and shoots high into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, calamus signifies the precious resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Cassia was used in ancient times as a repellent to drive away insects and snakes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Cassia thus signifies the power of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These four spices compounded with a hin of olive oil became the holy anointing ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the compounded ointment there were a hin of olive oil and four spices.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Bible the number one signifies the unique God, and the number four signifies the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the holy anointing ointment signifies the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first and the fourth of the spices were each of five hundred shekels.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Five hundred signifies full responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The second and third of the spices were each of two hundred fifty shekels.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, with the four spices there were three complete units of five hundred shekels.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These three complete units signify the Triune God, and the middle unit divided in half signifies that the Second of the Godhead was split through death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The entire picture signifies that the Triune God has passed through death and that in resurrection He is mingled with humanity to bear the full responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today the Spirit, who is typified by the holy anointing ointment, is the Triune God processed to become the all-inclusive compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this Spirit we can see divinity, humanity, the death of Christ, the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ s death, the resurrection of Christ, and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now this all-inclusive compound Spirit is anointing us with all His riches as the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As a Seal</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit is also the seal in the believers 2 Cor 1:22a; Eph 1:13; 4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A seal is a mark.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The believers being sealed with the Spirit means that God has put the Spirit into them as a seal to mark them out, indicating that they are God s possession.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, a seal has an image.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the believers are sealed with the Spirit, they bear the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, they are like God and they express God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Spirit as the seal comes into the believers once for all, but the sealing of the Spirit is a continuing process.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The believers have been sealed with the Spirit unto the redemption of God s acquired possession Eph 1:14 , that is, the redemption, the transfiguration, of the believers body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Spirit s sealing is His continual moving within the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It begins in their spirit and it spreads into their mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Eventually even their body will be sealed, saturated, with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus their entire being will be sealed with the Spirit and completely joined to the Spirit as one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As the Pledge</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Spirit is also the pledge in the believers 2 Cor 1:22b; 5:5b; Eph 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In God s economy the believers are an inheritance to God, and God is an inheritance to them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For the believers to be God s inheritance, they need the sealing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Moreover, because God is their inheritance, they also need the pledging of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Greek word for pledge also means foretaste, guarantee, token payment guaranteeing the full payment, a part payment in advance.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Spirit as the pledge of the believers inheritance is not only a guarantee, guaranteeing that God and all that belongs to God are their eternal portion, their inheritance, but He is also a foretaste of what they will inherit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In ancient times, the Greek word for pledge was used in the purchase of land.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The seller gave the buyer a sample of the soil from the land being purchased.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This indicates that the Spirit is the sample of what we shall inherit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Spirit as the anointing in the believers imparts God s elements into them; as the sealing He forms the divine elements into an impression that the believers may express God s image; and as the pledging He gives them a foretaste as a sample and guarantee of the full taste of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>These three matters the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging are actually three aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>First the believers are anointed, then they are sealed, and then they have the pledge as a guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hence, they can be completely mingled with the Triune God and be one with Him.</S>
