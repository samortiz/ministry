Do not think that we can get by loosely when we are defiled by the dirt on our way through the world. The Lord said that if our feet are not washed, we will have no part with Him. This means His fellowship with us today will be terminated. His fellowship with us in the future kingdom will also be lost. How important are the daily cleansings. We must allow the Lord to wash our feet every day. We have to come back every day to be recovered and to get the application of the power of Christ's redemption. We do not need the blood of the Lord Jesus to wash us again before God. The Lord's work before God has been finished once and for all. But we can experience the washing many times. The blood of His Son washes our sins again and again continuously. Therefore, we must have our feet washed every day. We have to take care of the cleanliness of our feet every day.</P><P>Peter was like we are. He always went to extremes. He went to one end at one time and then to the other end at another time. At one moment he said that the Lord would never wash his feet. Then when he heard the Lord say that he would have no part with Him if there were no foot-washing, he asked that his head and his hands be washed as well. The Lord Jesus showed him that this other extreme is wrong also. The Lord said that he who is bathed has no need except to wash his feet. No one can repent and believe in the Lord twice. No one can be regenerated twice. No one can receive the Savior twice. Once you come to the Lord Jesus and accept Him as Savior, that is enough. Perhaps you doubt for a few days. Perhaps you think that when you accepted Him as Savior the last time, you did not do a good enough job, and perhaps you begin to doubt after a few days; you want to accept Him again. But the Lord said that there is no need. The head does not need to be washed again, and the hands do not need to be washed again. The Lord Jesus said that those who have taken a bath only need to have their feet washed in order to be wholly clean. We only need one bath for the whole body. Although we touch the world and dirty our feet often, this does not affect the cleanliness of our whole body. There needs to be only one bath for the whole body. The bath cannot be repeated. Hallelujah! Even if you walk in the mud and your feet become black, it will not affect the cleanliness of your whole body. Your body does not need to be cleansed again. Once you have received the Lord Jesus as the Savior, your body is cleansed. From then on, you do not need to wash your body again. When a man is cleansed once, he is cleansed forever. No one can deny this. One's feet can get dirty, and he can be cut off from the fellowship of the Lord. He can have no share in the kingdom, but the whole body is still clean. All those who are bathed need to wash only their feet, and they will be fully clean. What we are doing day by day is looking back at our Savior. The Lord Jesus has done an eternal work. Day by day as we live on earth, we need to keep only our feet clean and free from dirt. If we pick up some dirt by accident, we can still receive a daily washing, so that we can enjoy uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord and reign with Him tomorrow. This is our way. May the Lord keep our feet clean day after day, so that we can glorify His name here on earth.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_279.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Gospel of God, The (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 280</div><br></body></html>
