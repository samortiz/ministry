   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. According to the Commandments</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Teachings of Men</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Colossians 2:22 says, "According to the commandments and teachings of men."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All ordinances and commandments related to asceticism are instituted and taught by men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They come from the human mind and are altogether of men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They have nothing to do with the church and nothing to do with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Men think that they cannot eat this, and that they must not touch that, but these are all teachings and commandments of men, not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul spoke a very serious word here.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He showed us that these commandments and teachings are of man, not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are man's concept of an ideal life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are merely human concepts, consisting of nothing but idealistic ordinances that have nothing to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is strange that the world loves asceticism so much.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since all men need food, man thinks that those who deny it must be very noble: "While everyone is under the influence of material things, this person seems to be free from everything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He does not even have any use for material things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How great he is!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But we have to realize that asceticism is a natural religion; it is not Christianity, which comes from revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Natural religion involves the teachings and commandments of men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These teachings are wholly from men; they have no enlightenment or revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are man's reaction to lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Man knows that lust is filthy, and his response to it is asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such teachings are of men; they are natural and not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>E. Perishing When Used</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What does Paul say concerning the effectiveness of asceticism?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"Regarding things which are all to perish when used."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Asceticism is pleasant to the ear; it appears to be a wonderful philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But all you have to do is try it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is like a car which does not break down at home but breaks down every time it is on the road.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is also like a dress which looks good in the show window but tears in different places as soon as a person puts it on.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You can try it out and see for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No one can control his lusts with asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more you try to suppress yourself, the more your suppression exposes the busy activities within you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more a man tries to escape, the more his fear of unchecked cravings is confirmed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A man can be so fearful that he dares not say anything or talk about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have met a few of these so-called venerated men.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I can testify that even though they carefully avoid many things, their words betray their helplessness with their lust.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They keep fleeing and hiding.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more they flee, the more their flight exposes their deep-seated apprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many people flee to the wilderness or lock themselves up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They try to shun the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The power of the world is too great for them, and they can only run to the mountains and hide themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet the world follows them to the wilderness and to the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As long as they have not overcome the world within, they can never escape it by outwardly running away from it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul used a very special phrase here: Which are all to perish when used.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They have no way to free themselves from their lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As soon as their lust catches up with them, they fall prey to it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They set up numerous rules to restrain themselves from touching, eating, handling, and seeing many things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They want to flee, to separate themselves, to leave the things of the world behind, and to break the chain of their own lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet those things are still present with them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more a person fears, the more his bondage to the things he fears is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>F. Giving Men a Reputation of Wisdom</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul says clearly in verse 23, "Such things indeed have a reputation of wisdom."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All ascetics and those who promote asceticism have a reputation of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They seek to have a name of wisdom in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Their arguments appear logical and wise, and people may be misled to think that these men are indeed men of wisdom.</S>
