<p>God crucified and terminated us in Christ. When Christ was on the cross suffering God&rsquo;s judgment, we were judged in Him. In other words, God&rsquo;s judgment on Christ was also His judgment on us because He bore our sins in His body on the tree (1 Pet. 2:24). When Christ died on the cross under God&rsquo;s judgment, we were included in Him. He died, and we also died in Him. The most obvious type concerning this is the ark in the Old Testament (Gen. 6:14-21), which carried eight people in Noah&rsquo;s household through the water of death. The ark is a type of Christ, and Noah and his family typify all the believers who were redeemed in Christ. When the ark passed through the water of death, everything inside the ark also passed through the death water. Similarly, because we were in Christ, we experienced death together with Him. When Christ died, we died in Him. In Christ, God terminated us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Death Being the Most Wonderful Way<br />
of Salvation</h2>
<p>Death is God&rsquo;s wonderful way of salvation. Through death God terminated us. For sinners death brings in God&rsquo;s punishment, but for believers death brings in God&rsquo;s salvation in Christ. Apart from Christ, death is a punishment for sinners, but in Christ, death is a salvation for believers. God uses death to save sinners. In His wonderful way of salvation, God terminates everything by death. The experience of Christ is available to whomever allows himself to be terminated by death. Although we often say that God&rsquo;s salvation is a salvation of life, we must realize that this refers to the second aspect of salvation. The first aspect of God&rsquo;s salvation is death, that is, God&rsquo;s termination of us by death. Then after death God enlivens us. Hence, anyone who is not terminated by God cannot enjoy God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>In order for us to have experiences of life and to have the practical living of a Christian, we must see our need for termination and also see that we have been terminated already with Christ on the cross. When we believe into Him and are baptized, we are acknowledging the fact that we have been terminated, that we are those who have been put into death. As such, we can stand on the ground of our death with Christ as the basis for our Christian living and experience. We are dead, and we have been terminated. This is the basis for our living and our experience of life. We are dead in regard to everything, including our relatives, friends, things, and even events. The basis of our living is death; we have died in Christ on the cross. The basis of our dealing with people, things, and events is that we have died. This is the way of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>The Lord said that we should take up the cross and follow Him (Matt. 16:24). This does not refer to suffering, as most people think; rather, it speaks of following the Lord through the death of the cross. By remaining in the death of the cross, we can genuinely forsake everything and follow the Lord. This does not mean that when we forsake everything, we no longer do anything. This is not what forsaking everything means. Forsaking everything means that although we are studying, we are studying in the place of death. Likewise, forsaking everything does not mean that we cease to be a teacher. Rather, we continue to teach, but while we are teaching, we are in the place of death. It is the same with being a parent, child, or spouse. We are dead people studying; we are dead people teaching; we are dead people being parents, being children, and being spouses. In dealing with all persons, things, and events, we are dead to all that we are and all that we have so that Christ can be expressed through us. This is what it means to take up the cross and follow the Lord.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> </body></html>
