   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Rom 12:3-8; 1 Pet 4:10-11 THE NEW TESTAMENT SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE CORPORATE SERVICE OF THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The service of the church is the corporate service of all the saints in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Bible the church refers to both the house of God and the Body of Christ Eph 2:19; 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The house of God is a matter of enjoyment, whereas the Body of Christ is a matter of service.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the house of God every saint should have enjoyment, and in the Body of Christ all the members should carry out their function and serve one another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The New Testament service is not an individualistic service, a service of individuals; rather, it is a corporate service, a service of all the saints Rom 12:3-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not an individual move but a corporate move.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Concerning the saints service to God, the Bible does not give any ground to individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we serve God, we must serve as members one of another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God sees the church on the earth as the Body of Christ, and all the believers are the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, the saints cannot serve God individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every member has a function, and all the members must be coordinated together in order to manifest the beauty of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If some members are not coordinated, they will be separated from the other members and be unable to manifest their function.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If there is only a hand on the table, it will not be able to function and it will also look quite frightening.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the service of God the saints can never act alone, serving as an individual, because we are not individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our service we cannot be individualistic or be separated from the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A member who is detached from the body not only looks ugly, it even frightens people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No matter how great the function of a member is, he is only a member; and no matter how small the function of a member is, he is still a member.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our status will forever be as a member, that is, a member of the Body; as such, we cannot be separated from the Body and exist by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, our service should always be as members one of another; it should be the service of the church, not a service of individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the church all the members are equal, and all are in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>IN SERVING GOD BEING UPON EVERY SAINT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Western missionaries first came to China, they worked as if they were running a school.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Chinese church members were similar to students who merely listened to sermons and donated money.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God, however, does not want His children to serve Him in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God does not want a few men to run the church; rather, He desires that every one of us would serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The responsibility of the church to serve God rests with every saint, not with just a few people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Recently, when I visited a church in southern Taiwan, I was so delighted to see the brothers and sisters serving God corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have seen the same thing in the churches in northern Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather than a few saints doing everything, all the saints are serving corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the saints in the localities are keeping the principle of serving God corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In each locality the saints are rising up to serve God corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>GOD DESIRING TO RECOVER THE SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>OF ALL THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order for God to have a way to go on, all the saints in all the localities must rise up to serve God corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the early days there was the service of the apostles as well as the service of the saints; the apostles were in the midst of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today God has to recover the service of the saints, which is the corporate service of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From the time of Martin Luther until now, the recovery of the church has been moving toward the recovery of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 1943 the saints in the church in Chefoo were willing to migrate to the northwest to serve, and the church made arrangements for this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There were over one hundred people in the first group who went, consisting of tailors, shoemakers, rickshaw drivers, and other saints who were common laborers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Most of them went to the regions of Paotou and Shanpa; now there are four to five hundred saints serving God there.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today there are dozens of places in Suiyuan that have the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This was not the work of a few individuals or preachers; rather, it has come out of the corporate service of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, the service of God is not just a service of a few preachers but a service of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since 1943 God s hand has confirmed this matter of service through migration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Due to the political situation, many saints from mainland China came to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This environment was arranged by God, and it caused the saints to migrate to Taiwan in great numbers and in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>GOD S BLESSING BEING UPON THE SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>OF THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The service of the saints involves more than preaching the gospel, helping people, and perfecting people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even miscellaneous affairs, such as cleaning chairs, sweeping the floor, and preparing meals, are part of the service.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even if there are specific people serving in relation to specific items, there should always be an opening for other saints to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is a spiritual element in every kind of service.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The heart and prayer of the saints for the service will always bring in God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For example, the responsibility to preach the gospel does not rest upon a few brothers who preach or the responsible brothers in the church; it rests upon all the saints because the gospel is a corporate service of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In 1942 there were only about one hundred and thirty brothers in the church in Tsingtao.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After two months of all the saints serving, the number increased to over two hundred; in the second year there were more than six hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This shows the blessing upon the corporate service in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God s work in China is to raise up saints to serve Him and to have the saints rise up corporately to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In order to serve God, we must learn the lessons of being dealt with and being broken.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A person who has learned the lessons in the Holy Place is a person who has learned the lessons in the church, and he is also a person who has learned the lessons in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the service of the church, God does not require us to be efficient; rather, He requires us to be dealt with, to be broken, and to learn to be submissive, being able to be subject to authority and to obey His leading.</S>
