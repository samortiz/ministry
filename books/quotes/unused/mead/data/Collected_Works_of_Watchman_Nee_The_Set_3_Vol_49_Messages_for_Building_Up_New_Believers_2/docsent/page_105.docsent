   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>J. The Matter of Punishment</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Tenth, there is the matter of punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When a child has done something wrong, he or she must be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is wrong not to punish.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Being Afraid of Beating the Children</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The most difficult thing is to punish someone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who are parents must be afraid of beating their children.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They must consider it as serious as beating their own parents.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No children should beat their own parents.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One can be forgiven for beating his own parents, yet he will not be easily forgiven for beating his own children.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must learn to be afraid of beating your own children and must consider it as serious as beating your own parents.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Beating Being Necessary</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, beating them is sometimes necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Proverbs 13:24 says, "He that spareth his rod hateth his son:/but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is Solomon's wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Parents should chastise their children with the rod.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Beating is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Beating Justly</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you beat, however, you must beat justly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not lose your temper, and do not beat in anger.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No one may beat their children in anger.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Something is wrong with you when you are angry.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brothers and sisters, when your children do something wrong, and you beat them in your anger, you should realize that you also should be beaten.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You must calm down first before God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as you are angry, you cannot chastise anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Pointing Out to the Children Their Fault</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some problems must be settled by beating.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But you must show the child what you are beating him for.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you need to beat him, you also need to show him his fault.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You must show him his fault each time you beat him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You must tell him what his fault is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not enough to try to stop his fault by beating him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You have to explain to him that you are beating him because he is wrong in certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Beating Being a Serious Thing</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every time you beat a child, you must not do it in a common way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You must show him that beating is a big thing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The whole family has to know about it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the adults and children have to come together.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The father or the mother has to carry out the beating like a surgeon performing an operation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A doctor does not cut with a knife out of anger; he cuts to remove a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the same way a parent must not punish in anger; he or she must be calm.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Parents must never beat their children in a state of fury.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the one hand, they must point out the fault.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the other hand, they must not be angry in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How should you do it?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have a suggestion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By the time you have a cane in your hand, the child must have committed some very serious wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While you are holding the cane in your hand, you should ask the child's brother to fetch a pail of warm water and his sister to fetch a towel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then you have to show the child what he has done wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You have to tell him that anyone who has done something so serious must be punished severely.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He should not flee from his mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Fleeing from punishment is wrong as well.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A person must be bold to receive punishment if he is bold to commit sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Tell him that he has done something wrong and that you have no choice but to punish him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The beating is for him to realize his wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You may beat him two times or you may beat him three times.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps the child's hand will bruise and bleed from the beating.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You should then ask his brother to soak the bruised hand in the warm water to relieve the blood circulation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Afterward you should wipe the child's hand with the towel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You have to do this ceremoniously.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Show them that there is only love in the family; there is no hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I believe this is the right way to punish.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Today much of the punishment in the family is the result of anger and hatred, not love.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You say that you love your children, but who will believe you?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I will not.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You must let them know where they are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Let them know that their father is not beating them in hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When you beat, do it properly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After you beat them, you should take them to bed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If the offense is too serious, the mother or the father can share two of the child's stripes.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You have to tell the child, "This matter is too serious.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I have to beat you five times.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But I am afraid that you cannot take it if I give you five stripes.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>So your mother will share two of them and your father will share one of them on your behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You yourself must still take the other two stripes."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You have to show him that this is a serious and grave matter.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He will remember not to sin freely for the rest of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is the Lord's discipline; it is not the discipline of your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is the Lord's admonition, not the admonition of your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I do not stand with the temper of any parent.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The temper of the parents will ruin the future of their children.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The parents must learn to have true punishment for their children.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But, at the same time, they must also learn to love.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is the proper way to have a Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>GREAT CHILDREN COMING OUT OF GREAT PARENTS</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Finally, I would say that many men whom God used in this world came from great parents.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Beginning with Timothy, we find numerous men used by God who came from great parents.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>John Wesley was one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Another one was John Newton.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>There are many hymns in our hymnal written by Newton.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>John G. Paton was another one.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He was one of the most famous missionaries in the modern world.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I can think of no other father like his father.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>In his old age Paton still remembered, "Every time I wanted to sin, I remembered my father, who was always praying for me."</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>His family was very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>There was only one bedroom, one kitchen, and another small room.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He said, "I trembled every time my father prayed and sighed in the small room.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He was making petition for our souls.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Even though I am so old now, I can still remember his sighing.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I thank God for giving me such a father.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I cannot sin, because when I sin, I transgress against my heavenly Father as well as my earthly father."</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It is difficult to find a father like Paton's father, and it is difficult to find a son as great as Paton.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I cannot tell you how many strong believers would be raised up in our second generation if all the parents of this generation would be good parents.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I have always wanted to say this: The future of the church depends on the parents.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>When God bestows grace on the church, He needs vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>There is the need for more Timothys to be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>It is true that we can save men from the world, but there is a greater need for raising up people from among Christian families.</S>
