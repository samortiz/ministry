   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO AN OVERVIEW OF FIRST CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; 12:13; 2 Cor 3:6, 17-18; 1 Cor 11:3, 20, 23-25; 12:1; 15:12; 16:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall present an overview, a bird s-eye view, of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we do so, however, let us first consider four verses, two from 1 Corinthians and two from 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Corinthians 15:45b says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 12:13 Paul declares, For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second Corinthians 3:6 says that we are ministers of a new covenant, not of letter, but of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Finally, 2 Corinthians 3:18 says, And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Have you ever thought about the connection between these four verses?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Two verses represent 1 Corinthians, and two, 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, these two books are books of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Each of the four verses quoted above speaks of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that many Christians have not been adequately impressed with these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to 15:45b, Christ, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before you came into the Lord s recovery, did you know that there was a verse in the New Testament telling us that the last Adam, Christ, became a life-giving Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This verse does not say that the last Adam became the Redeemer, the Savior, or the almighty Lord; it tells us that He became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BAPTIZED IN THE SPIRIT TO DRINK THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To some extent, believers today are familiar with Paul s word in 12:13.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some make mention of this verse quite often.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, their emphasis is usually on the word baptized: in one Spirit we have all been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Have you ever heard a message emphasizing the word drink, a message telling you that you have been baptized in the Spirit to drink of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have been baptized to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we should not stop with the word baptize, but go on to realize that we have been baptized to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be baptized is a matter once for all, but to drink is a continual matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even in eternity we shall still drink of the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit so that we could be baptized into this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In what Spirit have we been baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have not been baptized merely in the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, we have been baptized in the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This Spirit of Jesus Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we were not baptized into the life-giving Spirit, how could we be baptized into one Body?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Body is not a matter of power or organization; it is an organism of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have been baptized organically into one Body in the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, not just the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we did not have life and an organic element, how could we be living members of the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To baptize a believer only in water does not involve life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After a person has been immersed in water, he is still a separate individual.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But we have been baptized not only in water, but also in the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The water is a sign of the Spirit in which we are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After a person has been baptized in the life-giving Spirit, he becomes part of the Body in an organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because we have all been baptized in one Spirit, we are organically one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The reason we love all the saints, regardless of race, culture, or nationality, is that we are organically united in life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have an organic element within us, and we are one in the life of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After passing through a process, the Triune God has become such a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In such a Spirit we all have been baptized into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How is it possible for us to be one Body?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can be one Body because we have been baptized in the wonderful life-giving Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have been baptized in this wonderful Spirit in order to drink of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that baptism is not the end; rather, it is just the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We who have been baptized once will drink of the life-giving Spirit for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is a marvelous connection between 12:13 and Revelation 22:1, where we are told that the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This river will flow throughout the entire New Jerusalem so that everyone may drink of the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In eternity the water of life will be our drink.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have been baptized to drink the Spirit, the water of life, for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The book of 1 Corinthians teaches that the last Adam, God incarnate, has become a life-giving Spirit, and that in this Spirit we have all been baptized into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now, as those baptized in the life-giving Spirit, we need to drink the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Day by day, we should drink.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whenever we pray, pray-read, or call, O Lord Jesus, we may drink.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As we fellowship with the saints, we should also drink of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sometimes when I drink of the Spirit, I am beside myself with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hallelujah, we have been baptized into the one Body to drink of the life-giving Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What a marvelous revelation!</S>
