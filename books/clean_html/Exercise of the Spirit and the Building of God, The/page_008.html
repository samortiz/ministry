<h1 class="title">TWO PROVISIONS FROM GOD&mdash;<br />
THE HOLY WORD AND THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1; 4:24; 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6, 17; Col. 3:16-17; Eph. 5:18-19</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S GLORIOUS PLAN</h2>
<p>The Scriptures reveal that God has a glorious plan, which is for man to receive Him as his life and element so that man may be mingled with God as one. Then God and man will become a mutual dwelling place, in which God dwells in man and man dwells in God. This is the eternal desire of God&rsquo;s heart and His eternal plan. In order to accomplish this plan, God has put all that He is in His Son. He now wants man to receive His Son so that man will receive all the fullness of God.</p>
<p>The entire Bible, from the beginning to the end, repeatedly reveals the riches and sweetness of the Son of God, our glorious Lord Jesus Christ. He is God coming to be everything to us. By enjoying all that God is in the Son, we will be constituted with all that God is and blended with God. Consequently, God is mingled with us to become a mutual dwelling place.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO PROVISIONS FROM GOD&mdash;<br />
THE HOLY WORD AND THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In order to touch and experience the Lord, we should know His provisions. Throughout the ages, the saints who love the Lord have treasured two things: the holy Word and the indwelling Holy Spirit. The wealth of a Christian consists of the holy Word and the Holy Spirit. God in His wisdom has provided us with these two items. Anything we treasure apart from the holy Word and the Holy Spirit will one day become a thorn to us. The sweetest blessings that God has given to us are the Bible in our hand and the Spirit within us. These two blessings are available for our enjoyment at any time and in any place.</p>
<p>There is no way for us to know the Lord, touch Him, or draw near to Him apart from the Word and the indwelling Spirit. God is bountifully rich; He is so many items, such as life, power, light, wisdom, and the way. Among the numerous items of what God is, His being the Word and the Spirit (John 1:1; 4:24) are general in that they include all the other items. In the Word God is life, light, wisdom, power, and the way. Likewise, God is life, light, wisdom, power, and the way in the Spirit. All that God is, is included in the Spirit. Therefore, the Word and the Spirit are the totality of all that God is.</p>
<p>All that God is can be summed up in His being the Word and the Spirit. Our knowing, obtaining, and experiencing the Lord depend on His being the holy Word and the Holy Spirit. Our experience of Him as our life, light, power, bread of life, and living water depends, first, on His being the Word and, second, on His being the Spirit.</p>
<p>The holy Word and the Holy Spirit are two great provisions. The Gospel of John says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (1:1). In this verse the Word is with God, and the Word is God. Hence, God is the Word. John also says, &ldquo;God is Spirit&rdquo; (4:24). Chapter 1 says that God is the Word, and chapter 4 says that God is Spirit. In chapter 6 the Word and the Spirit are joined as one: &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (v. 63). The Lord&rsquo;s words are life because they are spirit. In His wisdom, God has provided Himself to us as the Word and the Spirit.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16-17 says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God. And whatever you do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.&rdquo; According to these verses, a person sings to God with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs when he is filled with the word of the Lord. When a believer is filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word, he will praise the Lord.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:18-19 says, &ldquo;Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; These verses say that a person praises the Lord when his spirit is filled with the Holy Spirit. Colossians and Ephesians are sister books and have many similar portions. Both Epistles refer to praising the Lord with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. However, Colossians says that a believer praises when he is filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word, and Ephesians says that a believer praises when his spirit is filled with the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit. This indicates that the Lord&rsquo;s word and His Spirit are inseparable.</p>
