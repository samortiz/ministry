   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Why does God have to give us eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why does He have to give us the gift in His Son?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Most have probably read John 3:16 which says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why did God give His Son to the world?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is because He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why did God give to us eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is also because He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If while we were yet sinners, God loved us to such an extent that He gave us the life of His Son, is it possible that after we become Christians and are weak and short of God's glory that He would reject us?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If God's Son can die for us on the cross while we were yet sinners, can He refuse to love us after we have believed in Him merely because we are a little weak?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If God's love cannot change, then there is no possibility for His grace to change either.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was so willing to give up His only begotten Son to die for our sins, and He had such a great love for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since the time He showed such love to us, has He completely changed?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Does it mean that now that we have become Christians, He has decided to cast us into hell and not love us anymore?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Humanly speaking, if He previously loved us so much that He would die on the cross for us, how could He have such a change today?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How could we be unsaved again?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not only is this impossible according to human reason, but God's Word also says the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John 13:1 says, "Jesus...having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the uttermost."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, there is no change in the love with which God loves men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Inasmuch as His heart was full of love for us when He went to the cross, God is still loving us today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His love has not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His grace has not changed either.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we think that there is the possibility for salvation and eternal life to be lost, then we have to conclude that there is the possibility for God's love to change.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But this is impossible!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the source cannot change, then the outflow will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the life does not change, then the fruit produced cannot change.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must know God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must realize that God cannot claim His Son back.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Romans 8:32 indicates that since God is willing to give us His Son, He cannot claim Him back.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Which do you think is greater: the Son of God or our salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Is the Son of God more precious?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Or is the life that we have received more precious?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because we are fleshly, we think that the Savior is not that important, and that life is more important than the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As long as we have life, everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are not that concerned about the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But in God's eyes, the Savior is more precious.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is more precious than our life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Son of God is more precious than the life that we received.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, Romans 8:32 tells us that if God did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If God is willing to give up His Son for our sins, and if He is willing to give us this very Son freely, would He consider taking eternal life back from us after some consideration?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suppose a brother owes me ten thousand dollars and cannot repay this amount.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If I am a rich man, I may say to him, "You are not able to pay your debt.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But I am gracious.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here is ten thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Take it so that you can pay your debt."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Later, we may ride a tramway to the pier.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The tram fare costs eight cents per person, but he may only have seven cents.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He may say to me, "Can you give me one penny, for I am short one cent."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I not only have many more pennies, but bank notes and other cash as well.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But what if I asked him for the money back and told him that he had to pay back the penny.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Would you not feel strange if I did this?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yesterday I gave him ten thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today I do not let him go for one penny.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You would probably say that I have a high fever and that I am sick.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why would I not care about ten thousand dollars yet be concerned for one penny?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If God has given us His only begotten Son through His great love, would He argue with us about the salvation that we have received?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must remember that the difference between one penny and ten thousand dollars is far less than the difference between life and the Savior, between life and the Lord of life, and between the salvation we received and the only begotten Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since God has given us His only begotten Son, how can He ask for salvation back?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For man to have such a thought shows not only ignorance and a lack of understanding concerning God's grace and love, but sheer unsoundness of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only those who are unclear and unsound in their mind would say such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thank God that He has given us His Son; He will not claim Him back.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Besides His Son, He has also given us many other things such as eternal life and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God has given us His Son and has also given us eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If He cannot reclaim His Son, then neither can He reclaim the eternal life that we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, according to God's grace, it is impossible to lose the salvation and the life that we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is God's clear word to us.</S>
