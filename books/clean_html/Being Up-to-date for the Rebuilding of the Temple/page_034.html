<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO SUPPLY PEOPLE IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>If we want to supply people through our speaking, we must be exercised in three matters. First, we must live in the spirit every moment; second, we must learn to fellowship with the Lord and experience the Lord; and third, we must enjoy the Lord and His word every day. In this way, we will inwardly and spontaneously have the word to supply and nourish others. The change of the system has just started, and what we are fellowshipping with you is a great burden that we must all receive and carry out together. If we can help all the saints to live in the spirit, fellowship with the Lord, enjoy the Lord, and enjoy His word, I believe that everyone will love to meet. Then when we come to the meetings, everyone will have both the Spirit and the word and will be able to supply others at the proper time. Recently in a meeting we saw some full-time serving saints speaking for the Lord one by one. Their speaking was full of content, full of the Spirit, and full of supply. This was very encouraging.</p>
<p>Many people have asked what the new way is all about. Some have answered that the new way is to preach the gospel by door-knocking. Actually, this is not true. We are changing the system and taking the new way not merely for door-knocking. For example, we have already brought thirty thousand people to salvation through door-knocking, but now we need to know how to bring these people on and how to take care of them. These are matters that are also in our study of the practice of the new way. Hence, the new way comprises not only door-knocking but also taking care of the home meetings and small group meetings. Whenever the church carries out an activity, some people like to look on with a critical eye and say vague things. Many people do not realize that the change in system to take the new way requires them to come back to meet in the Body. For them to come back to meet in the Body, they must be spiritual and overcoming.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURAL WAY<br />
TO BUILD UP THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Meeting according to the scriptural way in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not for a minority of saints. Rather, a group of people must bear this burden together. Today on the earth there is at least one group of people in Taipei who speak about the Bible in the meetings. Whether they meet in big meetings or small meetings, they all have the Spirit, the word, and the supply. However, this burden is very heavy. For the saints to attain to this kind of condition in which they are able to meet in life requires them to turn to their spirit, fellowship with the Lord, and exercise to live an overcoming life. This is not an easy matter, and hundreds and thousands of people must practice this in one accord.</p>
<p>Today in Taipei there are around ten thousand people who meet regularly. Also, we have over thirty thousand new ones who were gained through door-knocking. But due to the lack of care, only around ten thousand of these ones are left. How can these twenty thousand people take the lead to gospelize and truthize Taiwan? This question shows us how much manpower we need in order to carry out this move. Hence, we hope that those saints who have passed through three terms of the training will seriously seek the Lord concerning whether they should serve the Lord full-time for the rest of their lives. If you decide to serve full-time, how should you proceed? First, you have to see that you must be one who knows the church and stands on the ground of the church. Second, you must work and serve according to the Bible. The biblical way of serving is to build up the saints and the church.</p>
<p>If we do not meet in the way of prophesying, in other words, if our meetings are not according to the Bible, then they will surely be unable to build up the saints or the church. Perhaps we may be able to bring people to salvation, but we will not be able to build them up because our meetings are not proper. Even though we may bring people to love the Lord, if we do not have the kind of meeting that is according to the Scriptures, we still will have no way to build up the Body of Christ. Today whether or not we can achieve our goal depends on whether or not we see the church, know the ground of the church, and follow the Bible absolutely. We must live out what the Bible says and take the scriptural way, especially when we meet. This requires us to be spiritual, to fellowship with the Lord, and to experience the Lord&rsquo;s Word. Thus, our burden is that wherever we go&mdash;whether to Taipei, Kaohsiung, South America, or even the uttermost part of the earth&mdash;this is what we would work out.</p>
<p>We need to be one with the ministry. The ministry is for building up the saints and building up the church, that is, the Body of Christ. This is the goal that we must see. There are over four hundred saints who want to continue serving full-time. They all have the desire to serve, have seen the church, and stand on the ground of the church. If we are not clear about the ground of the church and do not stand on the ground, we will have no way to talk about the building up of the church. If we want to talk about the church, we must have the vision of the church, and we must stand on the ground of the church. At the same time, in our service we must come back to the Bible, and we must serve according to the Bible. If our service goes against what is in the Bible, our service will not build up the saints and the church.</p>
<p>We need to come back to the Bible and walk according to the Bible. First, we have to meet the Lord&rsquo;s demand for us to live in the spirit every day, to fellowship with the Lord, to pay the price, and to be those who are filled with the Holy Spirit. This is what God wants. Second, we have to begin our work, that is, to do this work. Our work is our living. We live this kind of living because only this kind of living, this kind of work, can build up the Body of Christ, and only when the Body of Christ is built up will the Lord have the way to come back. This requires that we have the vision and that we carry it out practically.</p>
