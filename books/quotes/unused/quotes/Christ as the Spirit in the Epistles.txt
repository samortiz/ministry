From Romans to the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3, the New Testament Epistles reveal that Christ is the life-giving Spirit
Christianity has made a mistake in saying that Christ is Christ, the Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit, and They are separate
In the Greek text of a number of verses in the New Testament, the term the Holy Spirit is literally 'the Spirit the Holy'
The condition, situation, and appearance of Christ before His resurrection was that He was the Son of Man, the seed of David
He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to God
We know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose
Verses 14 through 17 of chapter eight say, 'For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God
We all are sons of men, but we will be designated the sons of God according to the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of life
Now we are the sons of Adam who will be designated the sons of God according to the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of life
Martin Luther said that Romans is a book on justification by faith, but that comes mostly from the portion up to 5:11
God's original and eternal intention is to have this sonship to beget many sons to be a corporate expression of Himself
The death of Christ in the first part of Romans is for redemption, and His life in the second part is for sonship
Sin, self, the world, the flesh, and all negative things are against the sonship, but the life of Christ saves us from all of these
Verse 9 says, 'The Spirit of God dwells in you' and 'have the Spirit of Christ,' and verse 10 says, 'Christ is in you'
Eventually we will be conformed to the image of God, wholly sanctified and transformed to be the sons of God in full
When Christ becomes the first Son among many sons in full, He and all the sons will be a corporate expression of God
We have seen that Christ as the Spirit in Romans is the Spirit of life and the Spirit of the Son for the divine sonship
Corinthians 3:16 and 17 say, 'Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
There is no need of much revelation to say this, since the passage clearly says, 'The Spirit of God dwells in you'
Paul, as a wise master builder, laid a foundation, and others build on it, but we must be careful with what materials we build
Finally, we are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in us, so we must be careful not to destroy the temple, the building
If we read this portion properly, we will understand that the Spirit who dwells within us is not merely for indwelling
Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?
Although these verses speak not of the Body of Christ directly but of our own bodies, verse 15 says that our bodies are members of Christ
Similarly verse 17 tells us that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit just as a wife who is joined to her husband is one body with him
We are the wife who is joined to the Lord as the Husband, and we are the Body of Christ joined to the Head as one spirit
Our being one spirit with the Lord and the Holy Spirit's dwelling in our bodies are both for the building up of the Body of Christ
Again, therefore, the Spirit mentioned in this part of the Word is the Spirit for the building, the Spirit of building
Romans brings us to the point that we are the Body, but it is the following books that tell us how the Body is built up
We should not be frustrated by the old concepts concerning speaking in tongues or other matters in 1 Corinthians
Verse 12 of chapter fourteen says So also you since you are zealous of spirits seek that you may excel for the building up of the church
The word building in 3:9 is a noun in Greek, meaning 'house,' while the word dwells in verse 16 is a verb from the same Greek root
In chapter six the Spirit dwells in us for the purpose of making not only our spirit and soul but even our body the members of Christ
Verse 45 of chapter fifteen says So also it is written The first man Adam became a living soul the last Adam became a lifegiving Spirit
At the end of this book we are told that Christ is the Spirit who gives life, the Spirit of life, as in Romans
Verse 7 of chapter four says But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us
We can be transformed only by tasting and enjoying God, and this Spirit is the foretaste of the full enjoyment of God
Immediately after the creation of man, God presented Himself to man as the tree of life to be his enjoyment in the form of food
He is not only the Word for us to read, understand, and know, but He is the Spirit within us for us to realize, touch, enjoy, and experience
He has become one with us, and we are one with Him, as 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, 'He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit'
Praise Him, He is not only the Word but also the Spirit within us for us to realize, experience, taste, and enjoy
Among his fourteen Epistles, it is only in Romans that Paul introduces Christ as the seed of David designated the Son of God
The main emphasis of this book is the divine sonship, that we, the human beings, sons of Adam, can be transformed to be the sons of God
One day on the Mount of Transfiguration Christ was transfigured from the state of the flesh into another state, the state of glory
At the time of His transfiguration and resurrection, His inner glory was released, permeating and saturating His humanity
Originally, we were not sons of God, but one day God imparted the Spirit of His Son into us to make us the sons of God
When the Spirit of the Son comes into us, He is the Spirit of life to impart the divine life, the very life of God, into us
One day we heard the gospel, and this wonderful Spirit of Christ came into us as the Spirit of life to regenerate us
Now this Spirit is working, moving, and regulating within us for the purpose of sonship, that is, to make sinners the divine sons of God
From that time on, the Spirit of Christ as the Spirit of life works within us as the Spirit of the divine sonship to accomplish the sonship
Verse 12 says For even as the body is one and has many members yet all the members of the body being many are one body so also is the Christ
We have eight items: apostles, prophets, teachers, works of power, healing, helps, administrations, and tongues
Although the church has been degraded, still throughout all the generations there have been, and even today are, all these gifts
A sister who moves to this country from abroad may not know how to apply to school or how to get a job or a home
The Spirit of building is the Spirit of the operation of the gifts, giving different gifts to different members
The members have operations, and all the different operations are for the unique purpose of the building up of the Body of Christ
We do not emphasize the exercise of the miraculous gifts, because this matter has confused the believers very much
As long as the miraculous gifts are practiced in a proper way to help people to realize Christ and know life, we appreciate them
A certain elderly sister close to Brother Watchman Nee was an example of the proper use of the miraculous gifts
Before we consider the Spirit in the book of Galatians, we will review the revelation of the Spirit in 1 and 2 Corinthians
The transforming Spirit in 1 and 2 Corinthians is the transmitting Spirit, transmitting the grace of Christ with the love of God
Some may say the gospel began with the preaching of John the Baptist or the Lord Jesus, or even on the day of Pentecost
The promise of the Spirit is the Spirit of the promise mentioned in Ephesians 1:13, the Spirit whom God promised
God preached the gospel to Abraham by promising him that He would give His Spirit to us as the blessing through faith
In Galatians 31 through 3 Paul asks O foolish Galatians who has bewitched you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed crucified
These verses indicate that the center of the gospel eventually is the Spirit of promise who is bountifully supplied to us
According to verse 3, man became flesh at this time, that is, man fell again, this time from the soul to the flesh
By the time of the fourth fall, however, man gave up the thought of God and took idols as a substitute for God
As fallen men, we were not on the first or second level of the fall but all the way at the fourth level, fallen to the lowest degree
Praise Him, Christ accomplished redemption for us that we might be brought back from the fall and receive the Spirit as our enjoyment
Galatians 4:6 says, 'And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father'!
He is not only the Spirit of life imparting life into us but also the Spirit for our living, the Spirit by whom we live
As the outcome, Christ is revealed in us, lives in us, and is formed in us, and we are an absolutely new creation
To be sealed proves that we are God's, and the Spirit as the pledge, the foretaste, guarantees that God is ours
Verse 18 of chapter two says of the Jewish and Gentile believers, 'For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father'
Now this Spirit has been given as a seal to prove and testify that all the redeemed ones are God's inheritance
The term bountiful supply in Greek is a particular word used in ancient times to denote the leader of the chorus
The supplying Spirit and the serving Spirit is the very Christ who empowers us within, in whom we can do all things
The only explicit mention of the Spirit in Colossians is in 1:8, which speaks of the believers' love in the Spirit
Verse 23 of chapter five says that God Himself will sanctify us wholly in all the three parts of our being-spirit, soul, and body
Thessalonians 2:13 says, 'God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth'
These two books in the New Testament deal thoroughly with sanctification and 'the Spirit the Holy,' the sanctifying Spirit
According to these books, the Holy Spirit within us is 'the Holy,' doing the work of sanctification to work holiness into us
In the book of Hebrews the Spirit is revealed in two main aspects He is the speaking Spirit and He is the Spirit for our taste and enjoyment
Rather, the Bible says that Christ offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit without the limitation of time
Revelation 138 speaks of every one whose name is not written in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world
Revelation 13:8, however, uses a different preposition, saying that the Lamb was slain from the foundation of the world
The last phrase of verse 8 may also be translated, 'Written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain'
It was at the time that Christ as the Lamb was slain for our redemption that our names were put into the Lamb's book of life
As long as a group of people are all honest and faithful, there is no need for keeping a record of their status
Before the fall, everything was proper before God, so there was no need for a record of the names of people according to their status
The eternal Spirit in verse 14 corresponds to eternal redemption, which is in contrast to a temporary redemption
If we need redemption today, Christ's eternal redemption is here, and if tomorrow we need redemption again, it is here again
The redemption accomplished by Christ is eternal, and salvation as the issue of this redemption is also eternal
What the governor of California says applies only to California, and what the governor of New York says applies only to New York
One day Christ came and offered Himself to God, not merely in Jerusalem at a point in time but in the eternal Spirit
James 4:5 says, 'Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain: 'The Spirit, whom He has caused to dwell in us, longs to envy''?
The law in the Old Testament tells us that God is a jealous God , and 2 Corinthians 11:2 also speaks of the jealousy of God
If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you'
While that young sister was being brought to be executed, she was suffering, and the Spirit of glory and of God was resting upon her
Even in the ancient times, the time of the prophets before Christ came, the Spirit of Christ was already working
These verses prove that God is one with us, that God dwells in us and we dwell in God by this anointing Spirit
Jude 20 says, 'But you, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit'
In the Gospel of John, He is in an atmosphere of love and grace, but in Revelation He is in an atmosphere of judgment
In the Gospel of John, words of grace come out of His mouth, but in Revelation the word out of His mouth is a sword to kill and to judge
If our work is of gold, silver, and precious stones, it will not be burned but will rather be proved by the burning
If what we have and do is something of gold, silver, and precious stones, it will be approved through the burning
Whatever will be burned and consumed will go to the lake of fire, and whatever will be approved will come into the city of water
His clothing was like white snow And the hair of His head was like pure wool His throne was flames of fire Its wheels burning fire
Whenever we have something negative something of wood grass and stubble the Spirit immediately becomes the burning Spirit the stream of fire
The gospel is preached even to such a place as Babylon, as implied in these verses by the names Euphrates and Hiddekel
Today in this universe there are two streams, the stream of fire to judge and burn, and the river of water to water and nourish
It is not logical to say that the first time fire is mentioned it is negative, but the second time the same word is used it is positive
He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into His barn but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire
He will search us, burn us, and judge us, and all the wood, grass, and stubble will be burned by His searching
After these four series of judgments, some things will go to the lake of fire, and some will go to the city of water
In the first part of the New Testament Christ is the Word, and in the latter part Christ is the Spirit with many aspects
Christ as the Word is for us to know to read and to understand while Christ as the Spirit is for us to realize enjoy taste and experience
