<h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE CHURCHES</h2><h2 class="head2">Si-Feng County of Fen-Tien</h2><p>Brothers taking pilgrimage in Hankow:</p><p>Recently I read from The Open Door (which I borrowed from others) about the work and the situations in various places. I could not help but thank and praise the Lord! We began to meet in 1935. At that time we only acted according to what we saw to be His commandment. Actually, we did not have the leading of the Holy Spirit, and everything was legal and dead. Yet we were still satisfied in ourselves and thought that we were doing the right thing. But today we have to say how poor and pitiful we were! Thank the Lord that He loves us. Just as He delivered us from death, He is able to deliver us from the letter into the Spirit. From the light in the book Rethinking Our Work (The Normal Christian Church Life), we clearly saw how much we had restricted and limited Him. Therefore, we sing a song of thanksgiving on the one hand, and say, in sorrow, "Lord, there is no goodness within us" on the other hand. We can only say, "Lord, You have graced us and granted mercy to us. You are truly man's perfect Savior!" Greetings in the Lord.</p><p>Your small brothers,<br />Hau Jan-ge, Fu Chung-tsou, Kwan Yu-nong<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Kai-Yuan County of Feng-Tien</h2><p>Dear workers at the Gospel Book Room:</p><p>Peace from the Lord! Through His grace I have read in The Open Door of the work in various places and the situation of the various local churches. I cannot help but prostrate myself before God and exalt His greatness, rejoicing for our brothers and sisters who have received grace. I ask God and beseech Him earnestly with tears that in these quickly passing days He would reveal His Son more deeply in our hearts so that we would realize the cross's way of loss, suffering, and loneliness. This is the God-ordained way for us on earth. After we have suffered these temporary sufferings, we will receive the unfading inheritance that is reserved for us in heaven. Please send us The Open Door according to our subscribed number of copies so that our burden may be increased by knowing of the needs of the co-workers and brothers and sisters in the various places and so that we may enjoy more of the glorious privilege before God's mercy seat. May God bless everything recorded in this magazine, and may the readers receive its help. Peace to you in the Lord. Greet the church of God in Hankow.</p><p>Yours who have received<br />the same heavenly calling in Christ,<br />Wu Tsia-teh,<br />April 21<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tientsin</h2><p>I attended a prayer meeting at 82 Yau-Hwa Lane. I have also met with Brother Hsia and talked with him briefly. He is doing very well. This Lord's Day I will break bread at Yau-Hwa Lane and fellowship with the Lord's children there. I was delayed in going to Peking because of the excellent chance of preaching the gospel, but the most important reason is that I wanted very much to see Brother Witness Lee. He is not in Tientsin, but he will come soon. I have to ask and learn from Brother Witness concerning many principles in the work.</p><p>Yu-shu,<br />May 12, Tientsin</p><p>(This brother is a co-worker of Brother Wang Ming-dao&mdash;Editor.)</p>
