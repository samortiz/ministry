<p>We receive authority as soon as we pass through the gateway of consecration. In Exodus 32 God burned with anger against the children of Israel after they worshipped the golden calf. He wanted to consume them, and He said to Moses, &ldquo;Your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves&rdquo; (v. 7). However, Moses responded, saying, &ldquo;Why does Your anger burn against Your people, whom You brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?&rdquo; (v. 11). With his word Moses confirmed that this matter was God&rsquo;s responsibility. Because Moses was an absolutely consecrated person, he properly turned over all responsibility related to this situation to God.</p>
<p>Few among us can say, &ldquo;My prayers are for the Lord, not for myself.&rdquo; Once there was a brother who had a long-standing health problem related to his stomach, and he often prayed earnestly about his illness. One day I asked him, &ldquo;When you pray for your illness, is it for yourself or for the Lord?&rdquo; Saints, have you consecrated yourselves? Are you for the Lord? Someone may say, &ldquo;I have entrusted everything to the Lord.&rdquo; But merely entrusting things to the Lord is not enough; you need to hand them over to Him. To say that you have entrusted yourself to the Lord is like depositing money in the bank for safekeeping but which you can still withdraw at any time. You may have entrusted everything to the Lord, but the authority to use the things remains in your hands. You should turn all authority over to the Lord; only in this way can the Lord truly bear our responsibilities.</p>
<p>A sister who was working for the Lord in a certain locality lived by faith. One day she received a letter informing her that two classmates would be coming to visit on a certain day. She had no food, and she became quite anxious. She thought, &ldquo;When my classmates come to visit and I have nothing to offer, they will say that my God is false. I cannot allow my guests to go away hungry.&rdquo; She then prayed earnestly for this matter, and her faith was strengthened. She said, &ldquo;Lord, if You are not concerned about being shamed, neither am I. You are the One who takes care of my living. If my classmates come to see me, and I have nothing for them, this is not my concern; it is Your concern.&rdquo; At that very moment, a brother came to visit her and gave her a small box that another person had entrusted to him for her. She opened the box and saw that there were bread, eggs, and other food items. The Lord truly bore her responsibility.</p>
<p>When the Lord and His disciples were in a boat crossing the sea, a great tempest arose. The disciples were afraid and anxious, so they woke up the Lord who was sleeping in the boat, saying, &ldquo;Lord, save us; we are perishing!&rdquo; (Matt. 8:25). Their anxiety showed that they were not standing in the position of consecration. If they were standing in the position of consecration, they might have said to the wind and waves, &ldquo;Waves, beat higher! Wind, blow stronger! The Lord is here. Since He is sleeping at the rear of the boat, we will sleep in the front.&rdquo; We have no need to fear anything when we are standing in the position of consecration.</p>
<p>We need to see that Jesus is Lord. We should have no fear; we need only to hand ourselves over to Him because He is Lord. We need to rejoice and be at peace daily by standing in the place of consecration. We should yield everything that we have to Him and let Him do everything for us. This will not put Him to shame; it will glorify Him. He desires mercy and not sacrifice (9:13). Mercy is what He gives to us, whereas sacrifice is what we give to Him. The Lord does not want us to give Him anything; His only desire is that we enjoy what He gives us. In Luke 14 the Lord spoke of a certain man who was making a great dinner and who sent his slave at the dinner hour to invite some to eat, saying, &ldquo;Come, for all things are now ready&rdquo; (v. 17). We should simply come. When we come, we will enter into His riches.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
