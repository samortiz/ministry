   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE THE HEAVENLY VISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Who art thou, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This question was asked by Saul of Tarsus when his journey to Damascus was interrupted by a light "above the brightness of the sun" 26:13 and by a voice "saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" v. 14 . At the time of this encounter Saul was no heathen, but rather a zealous, religious Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was earnestly following the traditions of his forefathers, who had for generations worshipped God according to the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As he later described himself, he was "above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers" Gal 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"THE SECT OF THE NAZARENES"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Saul's time, something new arose in addition to the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who believed in this new way were referred to by their opposers as "the sect of the Nazarenes" Acts 24:5 , because of Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Saul was enraged at the claims of this "sect" and alarmed at the number of Jews who were being converted to it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was determined to stamp it out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both men and women who held such beliefs were arrested and dragged into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A CONFRONTATION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Saul was en route to Damascus, authorized by the high priest to bring back to Jerusalem any he found who were "of this way," so that they might be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While he was carrying out this self-assumed commission, he was suddenly confronted by that very Nazarene, calling to him by name from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Saul's reply was, "Who art Thou, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Someone who knew his name but whose name Saul did not know visited him from heaven, causing him to fall to the earth, trembling and astonished.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A CHANGE OF VIEW</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To Saul the sky was opened.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Heaven was opened.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The heart of God was opened.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From that time on, Saul began to see something not of or from the earth but from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He referred to this seeing as "the heavenly vision" Acts 26:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What a sharp contrast this was to Saul's previous view of things!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All his zealous concern for the Jews' religion came from beneath, not from above.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He had been brought up "at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God" Acts 22:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet those teachings and traditions were earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Never before had he heard a voice from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>IN PURSUIT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Saul was a seeker of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before the journey to Damascus, his pursuit of Christ was negative.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The heavenly voice asked, "Why persecutest thou me?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Greek word for persecute is the same as that translated "follow after" and "press" in Philippians 3:12 and 14.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It means "pursue."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before his heavenly encounter, Saul pursued Christ in hatred, with the intention of wiping Him out by destroying His followers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Afterwards, though, he said, "I pursue toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus" Phil 3:14, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>. His pursuit of Christ became one of love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>REPENTING</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At what point in Saul's journey to Damascus did he repent?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was when he changed his direction.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His whole mentality was focused in one direction, but when the light shined upon him and he fell to the ground, his course was turned around.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He repented.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>While he still lay on the ground, he called on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Why did he call this One Lord when he did not know who He was?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He realized that One calling him from the heavens must surely be the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Saul, then, firstly repented and then was saved by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord has a way to make us change our direction.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Saul of Tarsus was bold and aggressive, but he fell before the One whom he was pursuing in hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Suppose he had simply gotten up again, determined to continue on his way and disregard the voice from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If he had kept his eyes toward Damascus and refused to look heavenward, surely the Lord would have intervened in an even stronger way to compel him to desist.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However determined we may be to press on in our own conviction, we cannot prevail against this One who speaks from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Deep in my spirit is the prayer that the Lord will keep me from heading toward Damascus against His will.</S>
