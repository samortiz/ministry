Your name is the source of life. We have Your life, and now we have Your word. Thank You that You are the source of the oneness. You are also the element of the oneness. Now we do have the sanctifying word. It sanctifies us all the time to make us all one in You.</P><P>Lord, we do praise You. The Father has loved You and has given You all His glory. And You love us. Oh, how much You love the church! You have given us the Father's name, the Father's life, and the Father's glory, and You have given us the sanctifying holy word. Lord Jesus, we worship You for all this. Tonight, bring us into all the reality of the name of the Father, of the divine life, and of the glory of the Triune God with the sanctifying word that we might be really one.</P><P>Lord, how we praise You that there is oneness among the Triune God. We worship this oneness of the divine Trinity. Oh, what a wonder and what a blessing that the Father loves You, and You love us, and now in turn we love You! Lord Jesus, thank You that there is such a divine love, a mutual love, from the Father to You, from You to us, and now from us to You. We love each other, and we love each other in the Triune God. Thank You, Lord, for the divine name, for the divine life, for the divine word, for the divine glory, and even for the divine love. We do love You; we love You with Your love. We are in Your love. Thank You, Lord Jesus. Here we have the oneness, the oneness of the Triune God.</P><P>Thank You, Lord, that You are still giving. You are the loving Giver, the rich Giver. The Father has given us to You, and You have given to us the Father's name, the Father's word, and even the Father's glory. We are just the receivers. We desire also to be the givers, to give You to one another.</P><P>Lord, we do thank You for this occasion. We believe this is a gathering conducted by You. You have gathered us out of so many occupations into Your name. Do bless this gathering. Lord, we pray for these meetings. Release all Your riches. Do release Yourself by releasing us. Release us in Your Spirit, in Your anointing, in Your presence. We desire to have the fellowship and this release, Lord, that we may release You. O Lord Jesus, we enjoy You. We enjoy Your essence, we enjoy Your element, we enjoy Your presence, and we even enjoy Your countenance; we see You face to face. Lord, we pray that in all these meetings You will touch us. We desire to be touched by You, and we also desire to touch You. Touch us, Lord, and cause us to touch You. Lord, we ask You to feel free to move among us. Feel free to do everything that is on Your heart. We desire to see, to know, and to realize what is on Your heart. We want to see Your pleasure, Your heart's desire.</P><P>For Your sake, Lord, You must rebuke the enemy. He is Your enemy and ours. We hate him. We accuse him before Your throne. Lord, do rebuke him and condemn him. Rebuke him away from Your presence. Rebuke him away from the very oneness of Your Body, away from all the local churches. Lord, even crush him under our feet. Lord, do Your recovery work. Recover all that has been lost.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 10: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (2) &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
