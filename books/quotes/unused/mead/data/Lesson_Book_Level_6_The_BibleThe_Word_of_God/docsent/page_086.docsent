   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>C. The background: A contemporary of Habakkuk and Jeremiah, Zephaniah prophesied in the days of Josiah, king of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During his reign Josiah began to remove the idols but did not do it thoroughly; thus, some idols still remained.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, Zephaniah spoke the word of God, saying, I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarim with the priests; and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops 1:4-5 .</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>D. The central thought: The jealous God 1 rebukes the evil of idolatry, 2 warns of the imminent day of Jehovah, and 3 predicts the blessing of the coming kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>E. The general sketch: Manasseh and Amon, the two most evil kings of Judah, had led the people to worship idols and forsake God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Zephaniah warned Judah that the judgment of the righteous and holy God, although suspended during the years of King Josiah 2 Chron 34:24-28 , would eventually be fully accomplished on Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This judgment was to be executed on two kinds of remnants the remnant of the priests and worshippers of Baal would be utterly destroyed; the remnant of the house of Judah, after being chastened, would be blessed and prosper in the end. Some of the people worshipped both Jehovah and Malchim god of Amon 1:4-5 . God is a jealous God; He will never tolerate compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His promised judgment came in part when Babylon invaded Judah and will come in full in the last day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such chastening is proof of God s love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Like Habakkuk, it ends with a very sweet song.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Though stressing judgment, it is full of promises 3:14-17 .</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A. The writer s , the place, and the time: Haggai, who lived at the same time as Zechariah Ezra 5:1 , spoke for God in the second year of Darius the king.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His name means my feasts or Jehovah s feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This shows how much he longed for an early return to his homeland to restore God s feasts.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>C. The background: During the years when the rebuilding of the holy temple was interrupted, the children of Israel began to build beautiful houses for themselves and gradually forgot the building of the holy temple.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, the enemy s opposition and hindrance steadily increased, and desolation and drought continued to plague the land.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the people of Israel concluded that the time to build the house of Jehovah had not yet come Hag 1:2, 4, 6, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was under such a circumstance that the prophets Haggai and Zechariah rose up to deliver the word of God and encourage the returned Israelites to finish the rebuilding work of God s holy temple.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>E. The general sketch: God reprimanded the people through Haggai, telling them to consider their ways because of the disasters and miseries that had come upon them, and to not let the house lie waste, but to go up to the mountain, bring wood, and build God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>So, Zerubbabel the son of Salathiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of Jehovah their God Hag 1:2 .</S>
