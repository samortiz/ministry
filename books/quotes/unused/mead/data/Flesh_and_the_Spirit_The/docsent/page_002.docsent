   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE A PRACTICAL DEFINITION OF THE FLESH Scripture Reading: Rom 6:6; 7:17-20, 24, 25; 8:3, 6-10; 3:20</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Romans is fully focused on life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This book is mainly of three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first section is on redemption, the second section is on life, and the third section is on building, that is, the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the middle, between redemption and building, is life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Life is the central thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Life may be a term which is familiar to a number of Christians, but not many can define or realize what life really is in their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To talk about life in doctrine is easy, but to say something about life from our experience is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In these messages we have the burden to see what life is in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the section of Romans which is on life, there are two key terms: the flesh and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christians mostly pay attention only to the Holy Spirit, not to our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet we have to realize that in this section our human spirit is more practical to us than the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Two things are the key to the real experience of life: our flesh and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the negative side, we have to know the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the positive side, we have to experience our human spirit, which has been mingled with the divine Spirit Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE FLESH BEING THE CORRUPTED, POLLUTED,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>AND TRANSMUTED BODY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is hard to define what the flesh is in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to see that the flesh is the corrupted, polluted, and transmuted body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Originally, it was the body created by God to contain our human being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our human being is contained in our physical body, and this physical body was created by God in a pure way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But when man fell, Satan in the form of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil got into man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That entrance of Satan into man was his entering into man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and anything that man eats gets into his physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our body, which contains our inner being, was created as a pure, clean, and good vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But one day God's enemy came in to inject himself into man by the way of man's eating.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man ate of the tree of knowledge, and the actuality and reality of that tree got into man's physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At that time some strange, foreign element came into man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man's body was originally pure.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But since Satan injected himself into man, man's body has another element, a foreign element, added to it and it has become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, the flesh has two elements one element created by God and another element, the element that is Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This other element is not just something evil of Satan or by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This element is the evil Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By this we can see that something foreign, something strange, something other than God's creation, got into man's body created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the ethical and moral teachings in human religion and human culture never touch this point because they do not have the revelation concerning man's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Scriptures show that the flesh is our polluted and transmuted body.</S>
