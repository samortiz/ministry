   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>13.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Beginning and Development</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of the Meeting in Ying Pien</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This locality is on the westernmost border of our region.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is joined to Shou Ning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although it used to belong to the China Inland Mission, its roots are somewhat different than the other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A brother from among us, Ts'ai Ch'i, did some edification work among them not long after the denomination had been established.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, they understood the truth more easily than the brothers in the other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, one of the brothers among them, Su Pi Chung, loved the Lord very much and did much for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was very hungry and thirsty in the pursuit of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He read The Christian and other publications from the Gospel Book Room in 1925.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can say that he was a burning star and was instrumental in turning them away from the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later, they were helped by the co-workers; they left the denomination in 1929.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The leaders of the denomination would not let them go.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They often sent workers to them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although the brothers still received the workers, they would not let go of the matters of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the denomination used many methods to try to accommodate them, they stood fast to the end and even debated with them hotly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the end, the brothers discharged the workers boldly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1931 they completely severed their relationship with the denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Later, because too many people were meeting in a very small place, they built a meeting hall in 1932 with a capacity of one hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The condition of the meetings is better and more zealous than before because God manifested His special protection among them last year.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The region had a severe epidemic of dysentery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many Gentiles died from it, but not one person in the Lord died.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was a great wonder to the Gentiles, and many in the believers' families also believed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After this epidemic, the number of Gentiles who believed increased gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now there are twenty-one brothers and sisters in the table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are twenty-eight people who come to hear the message but who do not partake of the table yet.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brothers Su Pi Chung and Su Ting K'ai mainly preach the messages on the Lord's Day and handle the affairs of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are a few older brothers who help sometimes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These elderly brothers are very precious because they are so zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They are like old eagles who have returned to their youth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They can be a pattern to us all in coming to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>14.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Condition of the Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>in Chou Pien and Shih Yang</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These two localities originally belonged to the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They were originally shepherded by the same teacher as Hsiu Hsi Pien and Ying Pien.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the brothers in Ying Pien and Hsiu Hsi Pien left the denomination, the teachers left.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The denomination considered these two localities as a burden and abandoned them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The members of these two localities did not leave the denomination for the sake of the truth but instead followed us after being spit out by the denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, we dare not confess that their meetings are of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are jealousies, strifes, and sins among them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although our brothers go to visit them, they have no way to correct them!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They have no strength to change anything!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The only thing we can do now is let them go on in their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are only two or three people left in one of these two places.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although there are a few more people in the other place, the brothers are not at peace with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Among two flesh brothers, if the elder meets downstairs the meeting place is downstairs , the younger will go upstairs to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the younger is meeting downstairs, the elder will go upstairs to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are like fire and water; they do not mix well with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Oh, this is such a pitiful situation!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>15.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Beginning and Condition</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>of the Meeting in Lien T'ou</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This locality originally belonged to the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is difficult to say when or why they left the denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They probably left at the same time as Yang Ya or a little before that time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They left because Brother Lai from among us worked among them for a little.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Not long after, they left the denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Later, Brother Lai left and no one continued the work there.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The brothers got colder and colder over time, and many sins occurred among them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There was also a brother who had great compassion and who also loved and gave himself for the church, but unfortunately he was too bold and not wise enough.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He did not do things in a measured way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If this brother had had another brother who could have directed him and could have been a helper to him, he would have been a great help to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Unfortunately, he did not receive any edification!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He was not completely clear about the matter of the church and only understood the other truths partially.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, he always acted independently.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>His own locality suffered, and other localities were influenced quite a bit by him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thank the Lord and praise God!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He knows the ignorance of His children and sympathizes with them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This year He prepared a brother, Yang Teh Huei, to go there to teach school on the one hand and to help the church on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When Brother Yang Teh Huei arrived and saw the church in this condition, he was very sad!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Not long after this, Brother Lai came home from Wenchow and passed through this locality.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The two of them discussed how to deal with the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They decided to invite the responsible brothers from a few of the localities in the area to meet with them on July 8 to specifically deal with those who had committed the six kinds of sin mentioned in 1 Corinthians 5:11 and with other matters of the administration of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The sinners in this locality were dealt with as were those in Hsiao Chien, Sung Hsiu Yang, and Chang An.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This individualistic brother was also dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He repented, grieved, shed tears, and confessed his past errors.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>His wife was as sad as he was!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There are now twelve brothers and sisters in the table meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There are more than ten others who come to hear the messages but do not yet take the table.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Brother Yang Teh Huei is mainly responsible for the messages and edification on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Brothers Ho Teng Ch'in and Ho Teng Yung are responsible for the other affairs of the meeting.</S>
