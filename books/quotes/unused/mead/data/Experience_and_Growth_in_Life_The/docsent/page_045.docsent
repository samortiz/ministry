   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO EXPERIENCE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 8 gives us the way to experience the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter there are five critical verses related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 2 speaks of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 10 says that if Christ is in us, our human spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 6 says that the mind set on the spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 11 says that the indwelling Spirit gives life even to our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit is life, our human spirit is life, our mind is life, and even our body is life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Finally, verse 13 says that we need to put to death by the indwelling Spirit the practices of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do this, our entire being will live.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These verses speak on the one hand of the Holy Spirit and on the other hand of our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These two spirits are mingled together as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The dispensing of the Triune God into us makes us life in the three parts of our being: first in our spirit, second in our mind, the main part of our soul, and third in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are becoming persons in life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this way, we are being saved in the life of Christ minute by minute, and we live a life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, the element of resurrection is the newness of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now, after being reconciled to God, we are being saved in such a life, the life that has passed through death and burial and today is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Question: Romans 6:4 says that we have been buried with Christ through baptism into death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then verse 5 says that we shall be in the likeness of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, note 3 of Philippians 3:10 in the Recovery Version says, "With Christ, the sufferings and death came first, followed by the resurrection; with us, the power of His resurrection comes first, then the fellowship of His sufferings and conformity to His death."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In what order do we experience death and resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Answer: In Romans 6 death is first, followed by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to fact, resurrection is based upon death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The facts are our history: first we died with Christ, and then we resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, Philippians 3 is not according to fact but according to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In our experience, resurrection is followed by death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The power of resurrection is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since we have Him within us, we have the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By this power we are enabled to live a life on the path of Christ's death, in the mold of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Question: Often when situations surprise us, there is a reaction of the old man within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How should we deal with that reaction?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Should we simply say "No" to the old man at that time, or must we remain "on the mountaintop" at all times in order to be prepared for every situation?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Answer: The Lord Jesus with His three disciples did not remain on the mountaintop for very long Matt 17:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When they came down from the mountain, they found a case of demon possession vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>14-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must realize that our environment fluctuates all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus is on the mountaintop, and He is also in the valley.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to His presence, there is no difference between the mountain and the valley.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He always remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not care for the environment; we should care only for His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not live according to the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For the unbelievers, the only aspect of their experience is the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We believers, however, live according to the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This requires a daily experience of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have the adequate experience of the Lord every day, we will remain the same when the environment changes.</S>
