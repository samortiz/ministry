   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are definite requirements for receiving the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It does not come by accident or luck.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God has His ways and works according to His principles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God likes certain conditions and does not like others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Esau was very good, but God did not like him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jacob was not good, but God liked him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has His own reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a person does not receive God's blessing, there is a reason for it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do not receive God's blessing, we should not push the responsibility for it onto the situation or environment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is always a reason for not being blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we could be brought to the point in which we wholeheartedly hope for His blessing and wholeheartedly ask Him to show us the reason for not being blessed, God's work would have a great future.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I really hope that we could live on the earth by expecting the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nothing is as important as God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The results of the work are in the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am well aware that we all have our own particular weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God seems to overlook some of these, but He will not tolerate other ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Where these exist His blessing cannot rest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It seems that God does not care about some weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It does not bother Him if you make these mistakes over and over again, but God cares about other weaknesses very much.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we must be very careful about the weaknesses which might cause us to lose God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may be unable to eliminate all our weaknesses, but we must ask God to have mercy on us so that we would be those who are able to receive His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should say to the Lord, "This vessel is weak, but forbid that it should be too shallow or too small to contain Your blessing."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even though we are shallow and small, we are still able to contain His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's blessing and gifts are His work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, we hope God would have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>FIVE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Oh, that blessing might flow from us as it flowed from Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I believe that there will soon be a great turn in the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May the Lord bless us and have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>May we regard blessing as if we were accustomed to receiving it constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not want to frustrate God from blessing us greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The salvation of one thousand people may hinder the salvation of tens of thousands.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Perhaps the salvation of a few score people in one place is a hindrance to the salvation of several thousand others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Each time we receive one blessing, we should expect to receive a second blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must continuously step into greater blessings from God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Each of our co-workers must look to God to do a work among us such as He has never done before.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Immediately before us lies a work that is ten times greater, even one hundred times greater, than that which is behind us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Is it possible that the few people who have been saved and the meeting hall we have built have become the limits of our blessing?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the past the work constantly grew, but now we have tied it up.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our past blessings have become our present frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is very pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Each time we come before God, we must be like we were the first time we came out to work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some have been working for twenty years, yet they seem like those who are new to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some have been working for thirty years, but they seem like they are new in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must set the things of the past aside.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In difficult situations God will do more if our hopes, expectations, and hearts are large.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must never measure God by our capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A few loaves of bread can feed four or five thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the blessing is large, nothing can hinder it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we who serve the Lord truly look for God's blessing when we gather together, the future results will be more than we can ask or think.</S>
