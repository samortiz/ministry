   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The women in the house of Abimelech could not bear children.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why did they bear children again when Abraham prayed and God healed them?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Others could have prayed for this, but Abraham's own wife had never borne a child.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How could he pray for the women in the house of Abimelech?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was indeed a difficult thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in this matter, the root which Abraham had planted in Mesopotamia was dug out by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He realized that for his wife to bear children was something entirely up to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While he was praying for the house of Abimelech, probably he did not have any confidence at all in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His confidence was in God and not in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now Abraham was fully delivered from himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He did not have a son, yet he could pray for others to bear children.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His flesh had truly been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the second test Abraham went through concerning his son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He learned the lesson from this test that God is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although his wife and the women in Abimelech's house were the same and could not bear children, he prayed for the women of Abimelech's house.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He did it because he knew that God is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He knew that power comes from God and not from himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If God wants to do something, He can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With Him nothing is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Abraham had to pay a price to pray for the women of Abimelech's house.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The price was himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What he prayed for was what he himself sought after.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God was asking him to pray for something that he had not had for his whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God was touching him on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, in praying for the women of Abimelech's house, Abraham ceased all activities of his self.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only one who did not think about himself and did not consider himself could have prayed for the women of Abimelech's house on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thank the Lord that God brought Abraham to the point where he could truly look away from himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He could do this because he knew God as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to remember that there are two meanings to the name Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God is our Father, and His relationship with the believers is a father-son relationship; this is very intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is something which many Christians realize at the time of their regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But there is still another lesson we have to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is the Father in the persons of the Trinity; everything is of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the meaning of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is the Father of everything, the Father of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the other meaning of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Abraham learned this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He could pray for the women of Abimelech's house, not because he had clusters of children in his house, but because he saw that God is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through the begetting of Ishmael, Abraham learned to know God as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this incident with Abimelech, he learned to know God as the Father once again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, after this incident, God fulfilled His promise to Abraham and brought forth Isaac.</S>
