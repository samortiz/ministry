   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Paul Being a Tentmaker</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, I want to particularly point out that not only was Paul a tentmaker but Aquila and Priscilla were also tentmakers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Luke was even a physician.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible shows us that after a person has left his occupation, he is no longer called by the same designation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Luke was a physician, and because the Bible still used that designation, he must have continued his occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Peter was a fisherman, but after he gave up his fishing, he was no longer called Peter the fisherman.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matthew was a tax collector, but after he gave up his job as a tax collector, he was no longer called Matthew the tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Luke was a physician.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You can see that if he had completely stopped practicing medicine, the Bible would have called him only Luke, not Luke the physician.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you see this?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Luke was practicing medicine and Paul was making tents.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Aquila and Priscilla also made tents.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we have to look into this matter very carefully to see what it really means.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Acts shows us that Paul, Aquila, and Priscilla were all tentmakers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because their employment was the same, they lived together.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Paul was in Miletus saying farewell to the elders of Ephesus, he told them to behold his two hands.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let me tell you, this is the most poignant portion of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this very reason, I will share with you in a few days that you must touch the spirit in the Bible when you study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Due to making tents, his hands may have been cut in many places, wounded in many parts, and much skin may have been lost.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, at that time when many overseers and brothers were together, he told them to behold his two hands.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those two hands must have had something worth seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those two hands must have had something which made them different from others'.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those two hands had passed through toil and scratches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They had wounds and scars.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul did not say at that point that his two hands had done many things and supplied many people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He first told them to behold his two hands.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Later, he said that they had supplied many people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He first mentioned his two hands.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His hands were different from common, lazy hands, which did no work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, he could tell them to behold his two hands; they were different from those of the average person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Later, when he went to Corinth, he again paid attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He worked with his own hands to supply the needs of his fellow workers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul's Occupation Being an Apostle,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not Tentmaking</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here I hope the brothers and sisters will be able to see what the actual relationship between an apostle's financial source and his occupation is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When you look at Peter with his company and Paul with his company, you can see a straight way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you read the Gospels, you cannot see the straight way there, because they contain only half of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What Paul did in the church was a little different or perhaps more advanced.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here you can see that an apostle must leave his job completely.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please remember that in this matter Paul and Peter were the same; Paul also was a person who left his job completely.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In reading those ten or more chapters in Acts, who would imagine that Paul was a tentmaker?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I read the book of Acts, my impression is that Paul was an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I read the book of Acts, I get no impression that Paul was a tentmaker.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Perhaps those who make tents consider that Paul was a tentmaker.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, I acknowledge that Paul was an apostle, not a tentmaker.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only those who make tents, whose hearts are in tentmaking, who want to make money in tentmaking, who live in tents, and who pay attention to tents, would, according to their views and judgment, consider Paul to be a tentmaker.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But I think that even a very simple believer, a very common believer, would get only one impression while reading Acts, that is, that Paul was an apostle appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You would not get the impression that Paul was an artisan in making tents.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You would not notice that Paul was a tent craftsman.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You would see clearly that he was God's worker.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, as far as the service of an apostle is concerned, one must leave his occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, this refers to a person for whom fishing is an occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The man who needs to leave the occupation of tax collecting is the one for whom tax collecting is an occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The man who needs to leave the craft of tentmaking is the one for whom tentmaking is an occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If tentmaking was an occupation, then this occupation had to be left behind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If it was not left behind, one could not be an apostle, because the service of the apostle would be rather difficult for him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Why does God require people to leave their occupations in order to be an apostle?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is because apostleship is an occupation, and a person cannot have two occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In particular, the occupation of an apostle does not allow a person to take a second job.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul said that we are ambassadors of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we are ambassadors, we have no way to take a second job and no way to have another occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All of our time is for working as an apostle; we have no time to spend on other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, Paul's tentmaking was not an occupation; the tentmaking of Aquila and Priscilla was not an occupation either.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even Luke's being a physician was not an occupation.</S>
