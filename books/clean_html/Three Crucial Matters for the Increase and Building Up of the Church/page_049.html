IN PHILADELPHIA</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 3:1-6, 8, 15-16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCHES SPOKEN OF<br />
IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION</h2>
<p>The seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 can be divided into two groups: the first group consists of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, and Thyatira. Thyatira represents the Roman Catholic Church. The second group consists of Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. The course of the second group began at the time of the Reformation with Martin Luther, which brought in a revival to the church. It continued into the nineteenth century when the church in Philadelphia, a revived church, was raised up. The word <em>philadelphia</em> means &ldquo;brotherly love.&rdquo; The church, however, fell from her revived condition to become the church in Laodicea. It is difficult for us to escape the negative conditions of the last three churches. These churches represent the Protestant denominations, the Brethren assemblies, and us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN SARDIS,<br />
THE CHURCH IN PHILADELPHIA,<br />
AND THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA</h2>
<p>The prominent characteristic of the church in Sardis is that it has a name that it is living but is dead and that none of its works are completed before God (3:1-2). The church in Sardis is dead, and her works before God are not completed. It has a good beginning but no completion. This is the condition of the Protestant churches after the Reformation brought in by Martin Luther. Their beginning seemed to be living, but they were about to die. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;Establish the things which remain, which were about to die.&rdquo; In this short epistle to Sardis the Lord used the words <em>dead</em> and <em>die</em> to indicate that the actual situation of the Protestant churches is one of death.</p>
<p>The church in Philadelphia continues the revival of the Protestant churches and progresses to reach a peak. The characteristic of the church in Philadelphia is that it has a little power and has kept the Lord&rsquo;s word and has not denied His name (v. 8). In other words, the church in Philadelphia highly regards the Lord&rsquo;s word. The Lord knows that none of us have the power to keep His word; nevertheless, He commended Philadelphia for keeping His word and not denying His name, saying, &ldquo;You have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name.&rdquo; According to church history there has never been a church like the Brethren of the nineteenth century with regard to their seriousness, pursuit, and openness toward the Lord&rsquo;s Word. The Brethren opened and interpreted the Bible. Martin Luther released the Bible that the Catholic Church had sealed. However, even though people had the Bible in their hands, they did not understand what they read. Many Bible expositors were raised up among the Brethren to interpret the Bible so that it could be understood. The messages and light they released poured forth like a torrent. In the early days we read their books and received much help from them. However, after a period of time they degraded and became the church in Laodicea.</p>
<p>The characteristic of the church in Laodicea is that it is neither cold nor hot (v. 15). Whereas Sardis is half dead and half living, Laodicea is neither cold nor hot, but the Lord desires that she be zealous (v. 19). The Lord desires us to be like boiling water and burning fire. The Lord&rsquo;s word is very meaningful; on one hand, He wants us to be boiling, and on the other hand, He wants us to be burning.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION AMONG US</h2>
<p>In our present condition we are either Sardis, Philadelphia, or Laodicea. We cannot be the Catholic Church. For a period of time our condition may be that of Philadelphia, but after a short period, we can unconsciously fall into the condition of Sardis or become Laodicea. The condition of Sardis is that she is dead. The fact that she has a name that she is living proves that she has activity and work, but there is no momentum of life in her activity. During the past sixty years the condition in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has matched the peak condition of Philadelphia as well as the condition of Sardis and Laodicea. We have experienced and expressed all three conditions. At times we are Philadelphia, which is living and keeps the Lord&rsquo;s word. At other times we are half dead and half living. And at still other times we are neither cold nor hot. This is visible in how the brothers and sisters regularly attend the meetings even though they are lukewarm.</p>
<p>In 1949 the Lord sent me to Taiwan, and I began the work on August 1. At that time we built a small meeting hall in Taipei that could seat four to five hundred people. I lived in Taipei for many years and held conferences and trainings there; hence, I have a deep relationship with the church in Taipei. We are not in the situation of the first group of churches in Revelation 2 and 3. We cannot be in the church in Ephesus, which is the church at the close of the initial stage, nor in the church in Smyrna, which is the church under persecution, nor in the church in Pergamos, which is the church married to the world, nor in the church in Thyatira, which is the church in apostasy, the Roman Catholic Church. Rather, our condition seems to change from that of one church to another in the second group of churches; our condition is either that of Sardis or Philadelphia or Laodicea. Almost all the brothers and sisters have experienced being half dead and half living, being burning and keeping the Lord&rsquo;s word with a little power, and being lukewarm.</p>
<p>Are we Philadelphia, Sardis, or Laodicea? The characteristic of Sardis is being dead, the characteristic of Laodicea is being lukewarm, and the characteristic of Philadelphia is being living and vital, by keeping the Lord&rsquo;s word with a little power. Are we like this? The brothers and sisters may not have the same feeling concerning our situation, just as everyone has a different reaction to the same weather, with some feeling cold and others feeling hot. Nevertheless, we must ask ourselves, &ldquo;Am I living? Do I speak in the meetings?&rdquo; There are two kinds of people who do not speak: those who are dead and those who are dumb. Do we speak in the big meetings or in the small group meetings? Do we speak as soon as we enter the meeting? Because a living person cannot remain silent, it is difficult for him not to speak in different situations.</p>
<p>The characteristic of the church in Philadelphia is that she keeps the Lord&rsquo;s word to the utmost. Fifty years ago I met such a brother in Shanghai. He was a British sailor. He spoke the Lord&rsquo;s word whenever he opened his mouth; he spoke the Lord&rsquo;s word continuously. It was admirable. He was obviously a brother in the church in Philadelphia, because he knew and kept the Lord&rsquo;s word. The characteristic of Sardis is death, and the characteristic of Laodicea is lukewarmness. A local church may be in the condition of Philadelphia this year, in the condition of Sardis the next year, and in the condition of Laodicea the following year. When a church declines, there is no speaking, and then there is no activity, no work.</p>
<p>A living person must speak and work. Sardis is characterized by death. This means that she neither speaks nor acts. There appears to be no vitality in her speaking and no momentum in her actions. Hence, she has a name that she is living, and yet she is dead. When the sisters are strong and living in prayer, they have the condition of Philadelphia. When the brothers meet the Lord in the morning and touch the throne of grace, they are in the condition of Philadelphia. In the afternoon, however, they may be provoked by their wives and become deflated. Thus, they are Philadelphia in the morning and Sardis in the afternoon. Our condition is not constant. This also applies to the church.</p>
