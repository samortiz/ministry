   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN THE MEETINGS AND AT HOME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we are with the elders or in the meetings, we are in fear and trembling lest we display the clay.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We pray and seek to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But when we go home, how do we treat our wives?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is all too easy to become loose, not to pray and no longer to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our spirit seems to evaporate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If our wife says a word which offends us, we harshly cut her off, telling her she does not know what she is talking about, or that she should mind her own business.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Is this gold, or clay?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is hard for the husbands to be golden in dealing with their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The same holds true for the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the meetings they gird up their loins and exercise to have a strong and living spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They seem to be all spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What happens to the spirit, though, when they get home?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the husband wants to know why she has gotten home so late, the sister is quick to answer that it is not late, why does he say it is late?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The spirit is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If this is the way we are as soon as we get home from the meetings, I suspect that what we display in the meetings is not the genuine spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is a pretense or a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our real spirit cannot evaporate!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is necessary for us always to exercise to stay in spirit and to speak from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many times it is best not to give an answer when our spouse says a critical word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Simply say to the Lord, "I am one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To me to live is You."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Marriage tests whether the gold we have is real or false.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many young people, before they are married, give the appearance of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once they marry, however, it seems as though all the gold is swept away.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whether we are really living by the spirit has to be tested by our home life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our spouse knows best whether we are truly gold or only clay.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If at home there is only clay, how can the church be a lampstand of gold?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need more of God's element to be added to us!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A GOLDEN LAMPSTAND IN REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Revelation, the last book of the Bible, the Spirit is called the seven Spirits Rev 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not to say that there are seven individual Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The meaning is that the Spirit at the end of the age is sevenfold intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is like a lamp with a three-way light bulb.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not need very much light, we can turn the switch just once.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If it is very dark, however, we can turn the switch three times and get the maximum amount of light.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Revelation the Spirit has been intensified not three times, but seven.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church as the golden lampstand shines forth this sevenfold light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When all the clay is gone, and we have been fully transformed into gold, the Spirit of God will shine forth from within and amongst us with a sevenfold brightness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This golden lampstand will then truly express the Triune God and be His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He will have been fully wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only will His life be in us, but His Spirit will saturate our whole being so that every part within us is simply Himself.</S>
