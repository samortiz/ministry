   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX LEADING NEW BELIEVERS TO EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH OF CHRIST 1</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After leading new believers to experience Christ as life, we need to lead them into a deeper experience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should lead them to experience the Holy Spirit and the cross, that is, to experience the Spirit of life and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thirty years ago we were not clear concerning the experience of the Spirit of life and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Based on our study, knowledge, and experience of the truth in the Bible in the last thirty years, this matter has become clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our experience of the Spirit of life and the cross must be simultaneous; we cannot have one without the other.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we live Christ and experience Christ as life, we will see that the Christ whom we experience is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before 1949 we rarely used the phrase the Spirit of life in our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time we saw only the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8:2; we did not see the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In resurrection the Lord became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The terms the Spirit of life and the life-giving Spirit are slightly different in meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The emphasis of the Spirit of life is related to the truth, whereas the emphasis of the life-giving Spirit is related to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We did not see this point until we left mainland China and came to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From the ministry of Brother Nee we see that in order to experience the death and resurrection of Christ, we must experience life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In his latter ministry Brother Nee spoke strongly on this point, saying that without the experience of life, one can never experience the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He said that the fact of our co-death with Christ in Romans 6 can be experienced only in the Spirit of life in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In chapter 6 we have the fact of our co-death with Christ but not the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our co-death with Christ can be experienced only in the Spirit of life in chapter 8.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother Nee s speaking helped me greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through his speaking I was able to see further concerning the life-giving Spirit and to see that this life-giving Spirit is an all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, at that time Brother Nee did not say that the effectiveness of Christ s death is in the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Neither did he say that the Spirit of life contains the element of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In his ministry he did not point out that the Spirit of life is the all-inclusive Spirit, the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE SPIRIT OF GOD BEING PROCESSED</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>TO BECOME THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To compound is to combine several elements so as to form one substance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before the Lord was incarnated, the Spirit of God was simple, containing only one element, divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Lord was incarnated, divinity was mingled with humanity, and humanity was mingled with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, at the conception of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God had a new title the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Previously, the Spirit of God merely possessed divinity, but after incarnation the Lord brought divinity into humanity so that divinity was mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As the One who was conceived of the Holy Spirit in a human virgin and as the God-man who possesses both the divine nature and the human nature, the Lord Jesus lived a human life for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then He went to the cross, passed through death, entered into resurrection, and ascended into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, after the Lord s incarnation, several elements were added to the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These elements include the Lord s human living and His all-inclusive death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His death terminated all of the old creation and released the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord entered into resurrection after His death; hence, the element of resurrection was also added to the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now the Spirit of God has the elements of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John 7:39 says, The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit, as spoken of in this verse, was not yet until Jesus passed through death and was glorified in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This Spirit is the life-giving Spirit spoken of in 1 Corinthians 15:45: The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the last Adam, Christ was incarnated, lived on earth, died, and was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For thirty years we have studied the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Spirit is the compound Spirit and also the all-inclusive Spirit because the elements of divinity, humanity, human living, the all-inclusive death, resurrection, and ascension have been included in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, Philippians 1:19 speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This Spirit can supply whatever we need.</S>
