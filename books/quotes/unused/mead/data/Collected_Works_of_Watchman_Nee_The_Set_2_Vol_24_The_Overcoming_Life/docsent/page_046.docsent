   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE TONE OF VICTORY Scripture Reading: Psa 20:5; 2 Chron 20:1, 3, 12, 15, 17-22, 24, 26-28</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During the past few evenings, we have been considering the way for a Christian to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thank God that many brothers and sisters among us have entered into the experience of the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Last night we saw the way for the overcoming life to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today we will consider another subject, the tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Often a person sings with the right words but the wrong tone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please remember that the overcoming life also has its tone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not enough for the words to be right; the tone must also be right.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today we will consider the meaning of the tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Psalm 20:5 says, "May we shout victoriously in Your salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word "salvation" can be translated as "victory" see margin of ASV , and the words "shout victoriously" can be translated as "rejoice."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no great difference between salvation and victory; they are merely two aspects of the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thank the Lord that many brothers and sisters have passed through the gate of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But after one passes through this experience, he still needs to have the right tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You may not understand what is meant by the right tone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps I can put it another way: Victory has it benchmarks.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How do you know that you have overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When do you know that you have overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You know that you have overcome by Psalm 20:5: "Shout victoriously in Your salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>VICTORY AND BOASTING IN VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I wonder whether you know the difference between victory and boasting in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is victory, and what is boasting in victory?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Victory is something that Christ has done, and boasting in victory is something that we do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Victory is the work of Christ, while boasting in victory is our work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Victory tells us that the work is done and still prevailing, while boasting in victory is a continuous proclamation after the act of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I used to play cricket.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a strenuous game; the ball is heavy, and the hands hurt after hitting the ball for awhile.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One competes for an hour, sweating and striving; he hits the ball through one gate, another gate, and finally through the last gate.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is victory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When a team wins, the other classmates wave their flags and rejoice and shout.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is boasting in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The team wins the victory, but the other classmates boast in the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thank God that victory is accomplished by Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We did not shed any blood for it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet we can boast in His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please remember that after a Christian has overcome, he should continue to exercise his mouth to boast in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A day without a hallelujah is a day without boasting in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we only see rivers of tears daily, there is no boasting in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our tone should be one that rejoices in His salvation, one that shouts victoriously in His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When our cricket team won, we brought the victory to our school, and our classmates boasted in this victory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the same way, our Lord has won the victory and brought this victory to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we can boast continuously in this victory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is Victor!"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All those who cannot say hallelujah may not be defeated, but they certainly do not have the tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A man from Kiangsi may speak the Peking dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The words may be right, but the tone is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those who cannot say hallelujah have the wrong tone.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to not only overcome but also have the right tone.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If our tone is wrong, others will doubt whether we have overcome, and we also will doubt whether we have overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Peter's tone was that of a Galilean, and even a maid could detect it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we lack the "Galilean" tone, our voice will betray our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every day we need to have the "Galilean" tone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should be identified as those who have followed Jesus, who have the "Galilean" tone.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>THE BOASTING OF KING JEHOSHAPHAT</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the Old Testament, there was a king of Judah by the name of Jehoshaphat.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let us read 2 Chronicles 20 to learn about his tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At that time, "the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other besides the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle" v. 1 . At the time of Jehoshaphat, the kingdom of Judah was very weak and helpless in fighting against its enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Jehoshaphat was, of course, afraid when he looked at himself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He could do nothing before, and he could do nothing now.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the enemies came again, what could he do?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He could do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Yet he was a man who feared God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He "set himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah" v. 3 . He could do nothing except come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He prayed to the Lord, "O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee" v. 12 . He acknowledged his helplessness, and his eyes were set upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Brothers and sisters, during the past few days, we have repeated the conditions for surrendering many times.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They are: 1 to realize that we cannot make it, and 2 to stop trying to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should also believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This was what Jehoshaphat did.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He acknowledged this by saying that he did not have the strength to withstand the enemy and did not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He could only look to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God sent a prophet to him immediately, and said to him, "Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's" v. 15 . The battle is the Lord's! Victory or failure has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Temper, pride, doubt, unclean thoughts, greed, and all kinds of sins have nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The battle is not ours, but God's. God has said, "Ye shall not need to fight in this battle" v. 17 . God only demands that we stand still.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He wants us to put down our hands and leave everything up to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We only need to stand still and "see the salvation of the Lord" v. 17 . Brothers and sisters, we are not the ones who are fighting; we are the spectators.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Whenever we stop boasting in victory, we fail.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We do not have to be afraid before God, because He is the One who will battle for us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Jehoshaphat did one thing more.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He not only stood still and watched the battle, but he also fell down on his face to worship God when he heard the word of the prophet!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem also fell before the Lord and worshipped Him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Others were joining hands to attack them, but what were they doing on their part?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They asked a group of Levites to stand up to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They were "in holy array" v. 21, ASV , and they went before the army to praise Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Were they crazy?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They were not afraid of rocks and arrows; they were singing praises to God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is the tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They had the tone of victory because they knew that Jehovah had given them the victory and that the enemies were already defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>They knew that they had already won the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Some believe that when temptations come, they should struggle and withstand them.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But God said, "And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten" v. 22 . Whenever songs of praises are sung to the Lord, the enemies are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>What was the result?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>"And when Judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped" v. 24 . Either God does not give the victory at all, or He gives a victory in which no one escapes.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If it were up to us, we might leave five or six persons behind.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But God did not leave one.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The words "when they began" in verse 22 are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>As the people were beginning to sing, the Lord set an ambush against the Ammonites, Moabites, and children of Mount Seir.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Brothers and sisters, God can only work when we begin to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Whenever we begin to praise, God begins to work.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Brothers and sisters, I know that we are faced with many temptations, and I know that we have many trials.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>There may be physical weaknesses, adverse circumstances, or various difficulties at work.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We may say, "What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>How can I overcome?"</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Brothers and sisters, we know that we should overcome, but our tone is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When temptations come, we should say, "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>When trials come, we should say, "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When we see difficulties come, we should say, "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Once we shout "Hallelujah," the enemies will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Whenever we praise, our God will begin to work.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Once we begin to sing, He begins to work.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Brothers and sisters, it is not enough to acknowledge that we cannot make it, and it is not enough to believe that God can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We have to shout from our heart, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Thank You God because I am under trials.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Thank You God because I cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Thank You God because the victory is mine."</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Jehoshaphat continued to sing because he believed that he had overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>In the eyes of Jehoshaphat, everyone was already a dead corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Consequently, he could go on and sing.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>He was not afraid of the rocks because he considered his enemies as already being dead.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>When they went up to the watchtower and looked, there were only dead bodies fallen to the earth.</S>
