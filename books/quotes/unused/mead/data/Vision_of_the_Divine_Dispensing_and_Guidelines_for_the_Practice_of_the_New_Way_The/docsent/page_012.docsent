   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we worship You from the depths of our being, that You have separated us from this dark age.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although the age is dark, we have Your word as a lamp that shines in a dark place.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are gathered together before Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We believe that You are with us here.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Release Yourself through Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Shine on us with Your light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>O Lord Jesus, we really look to You.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At this end time, this crucial time, may You open our eyes and gain our hearts so that we would be open to You and to Your desire.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>May You enlighten us, speak to us, that we would be fully enlightened and would have the morning star rise in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, You know that the age is dark and that it is not easy for us to overcome its tide while living in it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>O Lord, we look to You.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are here not only pursuing some biblical knowledge, but are here pursuing Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Your word is Your embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We desire to gain You through Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are not here to listen to some so-called prophecies in a curious way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, we are here seeking after You.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>May You open Yourself to us and dispense Yourself to us, so that every one of us may gain You from Your word once again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lord, we confess our weakness and poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is You who give life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, we look to Your blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Cleanse us with Your blood that we would please You and would receive Your anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May You speak in our speaking, and while we speak, may You truly be one spirit with us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Prove to us that You are here with us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lord, bind the enemy for us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rebuke the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We hide under Your blood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Cover us, and oppose for us anything that opposes us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this message I will share with you the proper revelation concerning the coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not have much commission from the Lord to mention the prophecies in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But concerning this matter I have studied much for exactly sixty-five years, from the day that I was saved until now.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What I have touched are all writings by some of the better scholars.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These scholars not only were familiar with biblical history, but they also were very well acquainted with the types in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Their interpretation of prophecy is both fundamental and accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From them we have received the best help.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, my understanding of biblical prophecy has been gained fully by standing upon their shoulders and by further development of what they have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE SEVENTY WEEKS APPORTIONED OUT BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to understand the prophecy concerning the coming of Christ, we must go back to the book of Daniel in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Daniel's time, the children of Israel were in captivity in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Later, Babylon was taken over by Persia.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Cyrus, the king of Persia, was one who feared God and did things according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the first year of his reign, King Cyrus made a decree to the whole nation that the Israelites were to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple of God Ezra 1:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even before Cyrus became king, and as the time of the Israelites' captivity was approaching seventy years, Jehovah sent His messenger and spoke to Daniel: "Seventy weeks are apportioned out for your people and for your holy city, to close transgression, to make an end of sins, to make propitiation for iniquity, to bring in the righteousness of the ages, to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the most holy place" Dan 9:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These seventy weeks are divided into three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first section consists of seven weeks, from the decree put forth for the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the completion of the building, a total of forty-nine years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At that time, Jerusalem would be rebuilt with street and moat Dan 9:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The second section consists of sixty-two weeks, from the completion of the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the cutting off of the Messiah, who is Christ, a total of four hundred thirty-four years.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After that, the people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary, and the end of it will be with a flood, and even to the end there will be war; the desolations are determined Dan 9:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this way, the first section plus the second section equals sixty-nine weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From the end of the sixty-nine weeks, the seventy weeks are interrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This continues for a long time until the coming of the last week.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>During this interval, God has set the Israelites aside and has chosen another group to be His people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This group is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, this period is called the age of the church, or the age of grace, or the age of mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Generally speaking, this period began from the first coming of Christ and will continue to the second coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The two comings of Christ become the beginning and the end of this age of mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>During this age of mystery, everything that God does is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For example, the Lord's incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, becoming the Spirit, and entering into the believers are all mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Furthermore, redemption, forgiveness, and regeneration, also are mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Not only Christ is a mystery; even all of us are mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although we have not seen Christ, we love Him and are willing to pay the price to pursue Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One day we will be changed in form.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All these are mysteries hidden from the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the seventh trumpet blows, that is, at the end of this age, all these mysteries will be fulfilled, completed, and will come to pass Rev 10:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By that time everything will become open and manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At the end of all these matters, the last week will come.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It will begin at the time when Antichrist makes a seven-year covenant with the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the middle of the seven years, Antichrist will break the covenant and will cause the oblation and sacrifices offered to God by the Israelites to cease, and will set up his image of abomination in the temple to replace God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then he will persecute for three and a half years all those who worship and serve God, until Christ comes to earth to destroy him and to cast him into the lake of fire Dan 9:27; Matt 24:15; 2 Thes 2:8; Rev 19:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The end of the second half of that week will be the end of this age Matt 28:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>From this we see that the last week is the key to all the prophecies, and Antichrist will be the chief character in that week.</S>
