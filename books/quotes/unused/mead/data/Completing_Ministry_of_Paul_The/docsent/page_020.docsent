   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For many years I tried to find out what is meant by the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible does emphasize the need for us to grow in life, or for the divine life to grow in us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I could not come to a clear understanding of what this meant or how it could come about, even after studying the Bible, reading various spiritual books, and considering my own experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now I realize that the real growth in life is the transformation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the parable of the ten virgins Matt 25:1-13 , the Lord Jesus speaks of their lamps and their vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both the prudent and the foolish had oil in their lamps see v. 8 , but only the prudent took oil in their vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Two portions of oil were needed, one for the lamp and the other for the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Proverbs 20:27 says, The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord lit .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The virgins lamps, then, refer to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 9:21 and 23 tell us that our being is God s vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that our soul is the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who are saved all have oil in the lamp; that is, we have the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether we have an extra portion of oil in our vessel, however, is another question.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While the prudent virgins took oil in their vessels, the foolish did not.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whether we are foolish or prudent, then, depends not on our spirit but upon our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our spirit has been regenerated, but is our soul now saturated with the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do we have the extra portion of oil in our vessel?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a matter we must seriously consider.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now that we have been regenerated, we need to be transformed; that is, we need to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To grow is to increase.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The life abiding in our spirit needs to spread out into our soul until it is saturated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Otherwise, our soul remains natural and old.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the new elements of the divine Spirit enter into our soul, it is organically transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This transformation is the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are many Christians who have virtually no growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is because the indwelling Spirit has been given no opportunity to spread into their soul and saturate it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A FARM AND A BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Where does the Scripture indicate that transformation and the growth in life are one and the same?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Corinthians 3 says: I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow....You are God s farm, God s building....But if anyone builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble, the work of each shall become manifest vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>6, 9, 12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul says that we are God s farm, God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are here to grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul planted, Apollos watered, and God gave the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These terms all pertain to the matter of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How is growth the same as transformation?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are also a building, with gold, silver, precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We start out as plants growing on God s farm, but the end result is gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Is this not transformation?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Frail plants are transformed into such solid things!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is possible, we are warned, for the result to be wood, grass, and stubble, suitable only for burning.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet we may be transformed into another category, that of gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose we take three brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are young, perhaps having only recently come into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may consider them as plants.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One is a small tree, another is a shrub, and the third a tender flower.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are growing on God s farm, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>See how delicate they are!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They cannot take any kind of harsh treatment or damage.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yet, though they are young, they are growing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord expects that one day this small tree will change into gold, this shrub will become silver, and this flower will be a precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This flower, this shrub, and this small tree look lovely to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose, however, that after three years we find them still the same.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They have not grown and been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They may be lovely to look at, but they are not suitable for building material.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Can a house be built with flowers?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Can a little tree be used for a doorpost?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Can a shrub be part of a wall?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There could not be such a building!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Nor can these be the building materials of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The New Jerusalem is built of gold with walls of precious stone and gates of pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God s building is not with fragile flowers, delicate shrubs, and tender saplings!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These three brothers all need to change.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They need an organic, metabolic transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After three years we do not want to find this brother still a flower, lovely to look at but useless for building.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We want him to be a precious stone, even though the beautiful blossoms are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We want to see this shrub changed into a pearl perhaps, solid and transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This tree also needs to be transformed, perhaps into gold as pure as glass.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Dear saints, are you content to be trees, shrubs, and flowers?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Or do you long to be precious stones?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>On this farm in Stuttgart, which do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I believe you have a variety growing here.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There are plants, but also some gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This farm that is also a building illustrates the way the indwelling Spirit spreads from our spirit to permeate our soul and thus transforms us.</S>
