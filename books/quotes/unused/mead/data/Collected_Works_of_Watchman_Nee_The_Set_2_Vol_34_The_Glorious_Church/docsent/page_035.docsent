   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE HOLY CITY, NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have already seen that the woman in Genesis 2 is the same woman seen in Ephesians 5 and in Revelation 12.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now let us look at another woman, recorded in Revelation 21 and 22.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although there is a long distance between them, the last two chapters of Revelation correspond with the first three chapters of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God created the heaven and the earth in Genesis, and the new heaven and the new earth are in the last two chapters of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In both Genesis and Revelation there is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Genesis there is a river flowing out from Eden, and in Revelation there is a river of living water flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Genesis there is gold, pearl bdellium , and a kind of precious stone onyx , and in Revelation there is gold, pearl, and all kinds of precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Genesis 2 Eve was Adam's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Revelation 21 the Lamb also has a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lamb's wife is the New Jerusalem, and God's eternal purpose is fulfilled in this woman.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Genesis 3 man's fall was followed by death, sickness, suffering, and the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But, when the New Jerusalem descends from heaven in Revelation 21, there is no more death, sorrow, crying, or pain because the former things have all passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we read the Scriptures carefully, we will see that Genesis 1 through 3 does indeed correspond with Revelation 21 and 22.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They face each other at the two ends of the expanse of time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we have seen four women: Eve in Genesis 2, the wife the church in Ephesians 5, the woman in the vision of Revelation 12, and the wife of the Lamb in Revelation 21.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These four women are actually one woman, but her history can be divided into four stages.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When she was conceived in the plan of God, she was called Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When she is redeemed and manifesting Christ on earth, she is called the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When she is persecuted by the great dragon, she is the woman in the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When she is completely glorified in eternity, she is the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These four women reveal God's work from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The woman in Genesis 2 is the woman purposed in God's heart in eternity past, and the woman in Revelation 21 is the woman who fulfills God's purpose in eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of the two women in between, one is the church, prepared for Christ by God, and the other is the woman who will bring forth the man-child at the end time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words, these four women show us the four stages of the history of one woman: one stage is in eternity past, two stages are between the eternities, and another stage is in eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even though these four women appear to be different when we speak of them separately, they are the same when we put them together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The wife of the Lamb is the woman of Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since the Lord Jesus is the Lamb, it is impossible for the woman in Ephesians 5 to be anyone other than the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The woman in Ephesians 5 is also likened to Eve, and Eve is also likened to the wife of the Lamb in Revelation 21.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When there are overcomers, whose work represents that of the whole church, the woman in Revelation 12 will introduce the woman in Revelation 21.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, God in eternity future will indeed obtain a woman, a ruling woman who has dealt thoroughly with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God will truly obtain a wife for the Lamb, and His purpose will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us see how the woman of Revelation 12 becomes the woman of Revelation 21.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE FALL OF BABYLON</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of the two women spoken of in Revelation 17:1-3 and 21:9-10, one is called the great harlot, and the other is called the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Revelation 17:1 says, "And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits upon the many waters."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Revelation 21:9 says, "And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Revelation 17:3 says, "And he carried me away in spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Revelation 21:10 says, "And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the Holy Spirit inspired man to write the Scriptures, He purposely used a parallel structure in pointing to these two women so that we would have a clear impression.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let us first consider the things relating to the harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The harlot spoken of in Revelation 17 and 18 is Babylon, whose deeds are extremely displeasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Why is her conduct such an offense to God?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What does Babylon represent and what is the principle of Babylon?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why does God deal with Babylon and why is it necessary to wait until Babylon is judged before the wife of the Lamb appears?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May God open our eyes so that we would really see Babylon according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The name Babylon originates from "Babel."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We remember the story of the tower of Babel in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The principle of the tower of Babel involves the attempt to build up something from earth to reach unto heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When men built this tower, they used bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is a basic difference between brick and stone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Stone is made by God, and bricks are made by man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Bricks are a human invention, a human product.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The meaning of Babylon relates to man's own efforts to build a tower to reach unto heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Babylon represents man's ability.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It represents a false Christianity, a Christianity which does not allow the Holy Spirit to have authority.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It does not seek the Holy Spirit's guidance; it does all things by human effort.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Everything consists of bricks baked by man; everything depends upon man's action.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those who are according to this principle do not see that they are limited; rather, they attempt to do the Lord's work by their own natural ability.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They do not stand in a position where they are truly able to say, "Lord, if You do not give us grace, we cannot do anything."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They think that man's ability can suffice for spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Their intention is to establish something upon the earth that will reach to heaven.</S>
