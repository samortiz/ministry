   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Sending Timothy and Epaphroditus</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us continue with Philippians 2:19: "But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged by knowing the things concerning you.''</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 25 says, "But I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus.''</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here the sending of two other brothers is spoken of; one was Timothy and the other, Epaphroditus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Timothy was like a son to Paul, as was Onesimus, whom we mentioned earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These two were young brothers, and Paul sent them out.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Epaphroditus was a co-worker of Paul and was raised up after Paul was; therefore, Paul sent him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, the Bible clearly shows us that in the coordination of the work, the leading workers are those who send people out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The young workers need to take orders.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only when the older ones have the assurance before God, can they send people out.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul said, "I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly.''</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was very clear before the Lord that he should send Timothy; he was sending Timothy according to his hope in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I hope that you will learn something from this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Tychicus Also Going to Ephesus</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ephesians 6:21 says, "But that you also may know the things concerning me, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make all things known to you.''</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Tychicus was sent to Colossae earlier; now he was being sent to Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 22 says, "Him I have sent to you for this very thing.''</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Tychicus was also sent by Paul to Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Entreating Titus and Sending Another Brother</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>to Go with Him</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At another time Paul entreated Titus to go to Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second Corinthians 12:18 says, "I entreated Titus and sent with him the brother.''</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word used here is quite interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This time he did not send Titus but entreated him to go.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul often did not like to send people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is what you can see in the book of Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul was a person with much authority as far as Titus was concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Titus was a young person and was sent out by Paul; Paul had much authority over him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But here Paul only entreated him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes there was only the entreating, not the sending.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are two brothers in this verse; Paul did not mention the name of the other brother whom he sent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, some were sent.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some were sent because of the assurance that Paul had before God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some were left in a place like Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul entreated him to go.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Titus went because he obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He received the entreaty; therefore, he went.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was different from Apollos in 1 Corinthians 16.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Urging Apollos, His Not Wanting to Go,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>but His Going in the Future</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First Corinthians 16:12 says, "And concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him many times to come to you with the brothers; yet it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity.''</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you see the beauty here?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is very beautiful!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul entreated Titus, and Titus obeyed and went.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Titus was a young man, so he obeyed the entreaty.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Apollos was not a young man; he was about the same age as Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In other words, he and Paul were of the same generation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Cephas, though, was ahead of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the church in Corinth some said, "I am of Cephas''; some said, "I am of Paul''; and some said, "I am of Apollos.''</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Apollos's standing in the church in Corinth was that he belonged to the same generation as Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For this reason he was entreated, not sent.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul did not send Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul could not send Apollos; he could only entreat him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Furthermore, Paul entreated him not only once, but again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The good point here is that Apollos did not go.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul entreated him and said, "You go with the brothers.''</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He urged him once, twice, and three times.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Apollos was willing to go, but he said that he definitely could not go at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Apollos was quite serious that he definitely did not want to go at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But Paul added a word: He was quite certain that Apollos would go.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is very beautiful!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The older ones should be entreated; if they do not listen, do not worry.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They will go because this is their way before God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, the entreating of Apollos in 1 Corinthians 16 and that of Titus in 2 Corinthians 12 are different.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Paul could have ordered Titus, but he did not; rather, he entreated him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But Titus took Paul's entreaty as a command.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Paul could entreat Apollos, even twice or three times, but Apollos did not go.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, Paul was certain that he would go.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thus, the arrangement of the work is such that there is the authority and the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is very precious.</S>
