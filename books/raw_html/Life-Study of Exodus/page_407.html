<h2 class="head1">THE FORMATION AND CONSTITUENT<br />OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>The workmanship and material of the breastplate were the same as that of the ephod. Verse 15 indicates this: &ldquo;And you shall make a breastplate of judgment, the work of a skillful workman, like the work of the ephod you shall make it; of gold, blue and purple, and scarlet, and fine-twined linen you shall make it.&rdquo; What is the significance of the workmanship and material of the breastplate being the same as that of the ephod? It is important that we rightly interpret this and understand it. If we can answer this question correctly, it shows that we understand the type here.</p><p>I believe that the best answer concerning the significance of the materials and workmanship of the ephod and the breastplate being the same is that the formation and constituent of the church are the same as those of Christ. The phrase &ldquo;work of a skilled workman&rdquo; signifies the way the church is formed, that is, the formation of the church. The materials of the ephod and the breastplate signify the constituent of the church, that with which the church is constituted. In its formation and constituent the church is exactly the same as Christ. The church is formed in the way Christ is formed, and the church is constituted of the same elements of which Christ is constituted.</p><p>This understanding of the workmanship and material of the breastplate includes a great deal. It certainly helps us to know the church. The breastplate is not the ephod, but it is the same as the ephod both in materials and in workmanship. This indicates that the church is not Christ Himself. Nevertheless, in its formation and constituent the church is exactly the same as Christ. Otherwise, the church could not match Christ. Just as Eve could match Adam because she was the same as Adam in formation and constituent, so the church can match Christ because she is the same as Christ in formation and constituent.</p><h2 class="head1">A PERFECT TESTIMONY</h2><p>According to verse 16, the breastplate was squared and doubled. This verse says, &ldquo;It shall be squared and doubled; a span its length, and a span its width.&rdquo; Squared means that there was no defect in the breastplate. The breastplate was a perfect testimony. The word doubled implies something that is twofold, hence, a testimony, since two is the number of testimony. Therefore, squared and doubled signifies a perfect testimony.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S UNLIMITED CARE FOR THE CHURCH</h2><p>According to verse 16, the breastplate was a span long and a span wide. What is the meaning of this? Why does the record here not speak of cubits, but of a span? A span signifies something that is within the limit of a person&rsquo;s hand, something that does not reach beyond the capacity, the ability, of the hand. Anything that is smaller than the span of our hand can easily be held in our hand. This indicates that it is within our ability to care for that thing. The significance of the breastplate being a span in length and width is that the church is fully within the limit of Christ&rsquo;s hand, Christ&rsquo;s hand is altogether sufficient to take care of the church. As signified by the breastplate, the church is a perfect testimony within the capacity of Christ&rsquo;s care.</p><p>In Exodus 28 we have a picture of the church being within the span of Christ&rsquo;s hand, within the capacity of the Lord to care for her. In the New Testament, of course, we see the care of the Lord, but it is not portrayed in the way found in Exodus 28. In this chapter we have a picture showing that the church is fully within the span of Christ&rsquo;s hand. It is within the capacity of the Lord&rsquo;s care. Actually, the Lord&rsquo;s care and capacity are unlimited, for He Himself is unlimited. Because Christ is unlimited, His care for the church is likewise unlimited. Therefore, the need of the church cannot exceed the span of Christ&rsquo;s hand. It cannot go beyond Christ&rsquo;s unlimited care.</p><p>Since Christ&rsquo;s care is unlimited, we should not excuse ourselves for failing to be a perfect testimony. The church has no excuse for failing to be such a testimony. However, Christians often make excuses for themselves. Some may say, &ldquo;The Lord knows that we are weak and that this modern age is sinful and worldly. Surely He will overlook our failures. Eventually, we all shall go to heaven. But now we are living in a very sinful place. It is impossible for us to avoid temptation. But the Lord knows our weakness and sympathizes with us.&rdquo; This is to make excuses for our weaknesses. Because the Lord&rsquo;s span is immeasurable and His care is unlimited, we should not make excuses. The Lord&rsquo;s hand is much greater than any evil thing on earth. No matter where we may live, even in a very immoral city, the Lord&rsquo;s hand is wide enough to preserve us, large enough to keep us in His care. We need not be contaminated by anything evil. Although you may work in an environment filled with temptations and sinful things, you should not try to excuse your weaknesses or failures. Remember, you are still in the Lord&rsquo;s care. Do not think that because you live or work in an evil environment, it is impossible for you to be holy. If you think that holiness is impossible in such a situation, this indicates that you do not believe that the Lord&rsquo;s hand is greater than that situation.</p><p>The span of His hand is unlimited. He has clearly said that no one can snatch His believers out of His hand: &ldquo;And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand&rdquo; (John 10:28). The evil of this present age is not greater than the Lord&rsquo;s hand. Actually, the more evil the environment is, the easier it is for us to be the testimony of Jesus. Because the hand of the One who cares for us is wide, strong, and capable, we can be a perfect testimony of the Lord in any situation. The breastplate being a span in length and width indicates that the span of Christ&rsquo;s care for the church is unlimited.</p>
