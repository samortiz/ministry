   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THEY WILL NOT HUNGER OR THIRST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To hunger and thirst is to have a hope that is not yet satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Who are the ones who will not hunger and thirst?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst" John 6:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life" 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ promises that everyone who believes in Him will be satisfied and receive a satisfying life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not us satisfying ourselves with Christ but Christ becoming our satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The world can only satisfy us temporarily; it can only satisfy us for a moment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It cannot satisfy us forever.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God does not say that we can be satisfied only when we reach heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can be satisfied even today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do we believe that we will not hunger and thirst today, just as we will not be hungry and thirsty in heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today the Lord Jesus can satisfy our heart as much as He will satisfy us on that day in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord said, "But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once we drink, we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This satisfying life can be ours today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>NEITHER WILL THE SCORCHING HEAT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>NOR SUN STRIKE THEM</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who live in subtropical lands do not feel the scorching of the heat and the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if one travels to tropical lands, he will realize the intensity of the striking from the heat and the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A brother once said that when a man walks out of the house without his umbrella in a tropical country, he will be sick for a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once three people went to a certain land.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Two of them died of heat on the way; only one survived.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if one is inside a house, he will not be hurt by the sun because there is a shelter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without a shelter, one will be hurt by the heat.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible mentions God's overshadowing as a kind of shelter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is one kind of life that is under God's overshadowing; it is a life that is hidden in God Psa 36:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Are you sheltered?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In spiritual warfare, we have the helmet of salvation Eph 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our life is a hidden life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are hidden under God's wings on earth today as little chickens are hidden under the wings of their mother.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Psalm 91, we find that those who dwell "in the secret place of the Most High/Will abide in the shadow of the Almighty" v. 1 . The Lord will deliver these ones from many perils.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a blessed life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are a sheltered people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>HE WHO HAS MERCY ON THEM WILL SHEPHERD</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>AND GUIDE THEM TO SPRINGS OF WATERS OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Springs are with God Psa 87:7 , while the river of water of life flows from the throne of God and of the Lamb Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In other words, we are very close to God; we are right beside Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God leads us to His presence, and the Lamb shepherds us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To put it another way, it is the Lamb who shepherds; it is Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who feeds the lambs with His experience as the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can never improve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need a Shepherd to feed us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What a restful enjoyment this is!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This again is something that we can enjoy today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>GOD WILL WIPE AWAY EVERY TEAR FROM THEIR EYES</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today we can enjoy the three blessings above.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But this does not mean that we will have no tears.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to wait until we reach heaven before our tears will be wiped away.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Isaiah 49:10 does not mention this kind of blessing because it records the condition on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our Lord Jesus was completely restful while He was on earth; He could walk through all difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet He wept beside the tomb of Lazarus, and He also wept on His way to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Finally, He wept in Gethsemane.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hebrews 5 says that He prayed "with strong crying and tears" v. 7 . This shows that tears are unavoidable in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, our tears are put into God's bottle and recorded in His book Psa 56:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One Christian said that even though tears are bitter, God remembers them; therefore, they are a blessing!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although we cannot avoid tears today, if we believe in God's word, we can be satisfied, and we can have God's sheltering and the Lord's shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God has promised that we can enjoy these three items of blessings today.</S>
