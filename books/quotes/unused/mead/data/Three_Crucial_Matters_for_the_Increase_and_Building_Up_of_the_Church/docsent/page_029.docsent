   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PROBLEMS FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the home meetings we frequently encounter problems.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After some people believe in the Lord, they do not want to destroy their idols.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a difficult problem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In principle, if a person is not willing to destroy his idols, we should not be quick to baptize him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But what should we do when a person believes in the Lord and knows that he can no longer worship idols but still wants to keep them?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we force him to destroy his idols, he will stop contacting us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot force him, and we cannot push him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should simply explain to him that all idols should be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether we should baptize a person who has believed in the Lord but is unwilling to destroy his idols depends on the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some people should not be baptized; they should wait.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Other people should be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There have been people who refused to destroy their idols before they were baptized, but after they were baptized, they experienced a turn and destroyed their idols.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, we should not be strict concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A person who has believed and been baptized is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, it is not acceptable for him to partake of the Lord s table if he has not destroyed his idols.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must have proper discernment in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A household that has not destroyed their idols must not partake of the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is also the problem of the new ones who smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We believe in the Lord, have His life, and are sanctified; therefore, we do not like to see believers smoking cigarettes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is especially true because we know that smoking is hazardous to their health.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, we have seen many examples of believers who read the Bible and attend meetings even though they smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After a short period of time they will stop smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are overzealous if we insist that people who are addicted to smoking should stop before we baptize them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A more difficult situation to deal with involves new ones who drink alcoholic beverages.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In America it is difficult to find a family that does not drink alcohol.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many families have a small glass of wine with every meal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It seems as though they cannot eat their meal if they do not drink wine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must exercise discernment in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some people should be baptized, and others should wait.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no definite rule.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should observe the situation and then decide.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>People cannot change their habits immediately after we preach the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord s life must grow in them, and then their habits will spontaneously change.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There are testimonies of believers who smoked, drank alcoholic beverages, and went to the movies but gradually stopped doing these things because the Lord s life in them grew.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are wrong to expect people to drop their bad habits immediately after hearing the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such an expectation is unrealistic.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we should not do too much or too little; instead, we should maintain our contact with the new ones according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we feel that their condition is such that they should not be baptized, we should continue supplying them in the home meetings until we feel that they are ready to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then they should be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must all be able to discern these conditions because there may be only two saints coordinating together for a home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, we must learn the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Regardless of the situations we encounter, we must deal with them in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should be neither too much nor too little.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must maintain our contact with people, and we must always give them grace whenever we contact them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are frequently asked, What church do you belong to?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should learn how to answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to know the meaning of the word church and the source of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should also know how the Lord raised up His recovery in mainland China more than sixty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is no need to give too many details when we speak; instead, we should give people an overview and let them know that there are fifty to eighty thousand saints in approximately one hundred local churches in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, we should explain that the recovery has more than six hundred local churches in over thirty countries on all six continents.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we speak to people in this way, they will want to come and see the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When they express such a desire, we should not hesitate; rather, we should invite them to the Lord s table to break bread with us so that they can touch the atmosphere of loving the Lord in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The full-time trainees do not know how to respond when people ask about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They hesitate to give a straight answer.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not hesitate to bring people to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We simply need to explain that our church is different from the denominations in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should explain that we have big meetings in the meeting halls and that we have home meetings like the meeting in their home.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should also explain that a few households with eight to ten people can eventually combine to have a group meeting and that perhaps two groups with a few dozen people can come together to have a joint meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In addition, we go to the meeting hall to have a large blending meeting every one or two months.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The large blending meetings can be like the meetings we have had in the stadium.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should explain all these things to the new ones so that they are clear about the church life and understand that this is the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should not avoid responding to a question; otherwise, the new ones will misunderstand us or become suspicious.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When they ask about our occupation, we should tell them that we serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If they ask how we take care of our living expenses, we should say that we look to the Lord to meet the needs for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord touches the church, and the church gives us support regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord may also touch the brothers and sisters to give an individual offering to us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If a person says that he wants to give an offering, we should explain the principles of material offerings to him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must not withhold anything when we speak to people, because when we hide things, we become mysterious, and this causes people to either misunderstand us or become suspicious.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should be prepared to answer in a good way the questions that people ask.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We can explain that we do not write our name on the envelope when we make an offering and that it does not matter how much we give.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We follow the principle presented in the Bible in Matthew 6:3, which says, When you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If a new one asks how the offerings are used, we should explain clearly that the general offerings are used to build, repair, and renovate meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The offerings are also used to purchase chairs, tables, and other items that are necessary for the regular operation of the halls.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We may also explain that offerings designated to support those who serve full time should also be placed in the offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After the offering box is opened, the envelope will be given to the full-time serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If the new ones express concern for the poor brothers and sisters, or if they are burdened for someone who is sick and unable to pay his hospital expenses, we should teach them to write the saint s name on the envelope and put the envelope in the offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When the offering box is opened, the envelope will be given to the saint.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We should explain these things clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We may eventually suggest that the new ones have an offering box in their home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should explain that two brothers who are trustworthy should be responsible to count and record the offerings and to take care of the matters related to the offerings.</S>
