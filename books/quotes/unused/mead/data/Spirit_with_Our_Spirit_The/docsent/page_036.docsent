   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. With the Breath of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Job 32:8 says, "But there is a spirit in man,/And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the poetic structure of this verse, the spirit and the breath of God, the Almighty, are in apposition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, the spirit is the breath of God, and the breath of God is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Job 32:8 shows that God made our spirit with the breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>B. As the Lamp of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Proverbs 20:27 says that the spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When God created man, He put a lamp into man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Among all the creatures, only man has an inner lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God created a spirit within man as God's lamp, but this lamp does not function.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is why most of the human race is in darkness, without light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One day, however, we were saved by repenting and believing into the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we did this, we began to feel that something within us was shining to enlighten us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That was the functioning of our spirit as the lamp of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In ancient times a lamp burned to give forth its light by the oil within it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The oil typifies the Spirit of God Isa 61:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have our spirit as a lamp and we always have to contact God through this lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then this lamp will be refilled all the time Eph 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The light shining in the lamp comes from the oil, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, when the oil burns in the lamp to shine, the oil has mingled itself with the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the oil soaks the wick, the oil and the wick become one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then they burn together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, the wick is burning; on the other hand, the oil is burning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without the wick, the oil could not burn, and without the oil, the wick could not burn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They must be mingled together by soaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This shows that we can be soaked by God and with God in our spirit, which is the lamp of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>C. For Us to Worship God</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our spirit was created by God as our particular organ for us to worship God to contact and contain God John 4:24; 2 Tim 4:22a .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot worship God without contacting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To worship God actually is to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 4:24 says that those who worship God must worship Him in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then 2 Timothy 4:22a says that the Lord Jesus is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How could someone be with our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I can be with you, but I cannot be with you in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only the Lord Jesus can be with us in our spirit, because He is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our spirit is a container and a recipient of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thank the Lord that we have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, God created our spirit; second, He regenerated our spirit; third, He strengthens our spirit; and fourth, He refills our spirit.</S>
