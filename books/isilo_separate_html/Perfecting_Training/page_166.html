<p>No doubt the law of the Spirit of life is for living. And life is for living. Every item is for living. The regenerated spirit is for living. God regenerated our spirit for us to live a life, not for us to be someone great. The things of the Spirit and the mind set on the spirit are also items of our living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PEACE BEING FOR LIVING</h2>
<p>The matter of peace also is something of the living. If you don&rsquo;t have peace, that is a sign you are not under the leading by the Spirit. If you don&rsquo;t have peace with God or with your wife or with your husband or with your neighbor or with people on the street or with your own thinking or your own emotion or your own love, that is a sign you are not under the leading by the Spirit. If you are under the leading by the Spirit you have peace with God, with everyone, and with every matter.</p>
<p>You will have peace even with yourself, with your thinking, with your loving, with your hating. Your inner being will become so tranquil. There will not be even one wave within you. There will be no storm, just absolute peace within and without. If you don&rsquo;t have such an absolute peace, that is a red signal. That is not a green signal. The green signal on your spiritual way is peace. If you don&rsquo;t have such a signal, peace within you in everything, you have to realize at that very moment you are not under the leading by the Spirit. All this is a matter of living. The leading of the Spirit or by the Spirit is altogether for living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD BEING FOR LIVING</h2>
<p>Then the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of the One comprising all of the Three of the Trinity are also matters of living. Eventually if you live such a life with all these conditions you are a son of God having the life of God, having the nature of God, having peace with God, living Him out, living for Him, living with Him, and living before Him. So you inherit God&rsquo;s joy and God&rsquo;s peace. You inherit whatever God is and whatever God has. You also inherit whatever God is able to do. Eventually you will inherit much more. You will progress from being a son to being an heir. Then you won&rsquo;t have any sense or consciousness that you owe anything or anybody. You are not a debtor but a son of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING YOURSELF INTO THESE ITEMS</h2>
<p>All these points prove that the leading by the Spirit is a matter of daily living. I have received much help by considering all these items. I would encourage you to pray-read all these items into your being and to pray-read yourself into all these items. &ldquo;Lord, infuse me with the law of the Spirit of life. Infuse me with the life. Infuse me with the regenerated spirit, with the mingled spirit.&rdquo; This kind of prayer or pray-reading will help you a lot. It will help you to live such a life. And it will help you to bring your entire being in your daily life under the leading by the Spirit. Then whatever happens to you, it will be so easy for you to have the leading. If you are faithful and not doubting and not analyzing, it will be so easy for you to have the leading. If you will just believe, you will be clear. Then every situation and every happening will spontaneously be clear to you. You will see what is under the leading by the Spirit and what is not. You will not need to seek this or to seek that. You will be entirely under the leading by the Spirit. Of course to say this is very easy, but to live such a life will cost you something. You have to pay a price.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_165.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_167.html">Next</a> </body></html>
