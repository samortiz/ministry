Brother Kaung will work there for a week and then return to Ch'eng-tu."</p><p>(2) Brother Hsu Jung-jieh wrote on August 15 that he and Brothers Hu Yi-min and David Hsu had set off from Wei-Si on June 28 for work around the Nu River. They returned on August 9 to Wei-Si via Shang-Pa County and intend to go to Nu River again during the eighth month.</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</h2><p>Issue No. 18 of this magazine was published in June. We have delayed the publishing of this issue for two reasons. First, mail delivery has been very difficult in many places during the past two months. Since this magazine cannot be considered government-registered printed matter, it is better to wait before mailing it out than to have it stuck in the post office. Second, the chief editor, Watchman Nee, returned from abroad at the beginning of July, and I have respectfully handed the responsibility of editorship back to him. After Mr. Nee arrived in Shanghai, he had a special conference for eleven days. In addition, many affairs of the church were waiting for his decisions, and there was the need for the work to go on in a positive way. As a result, he was not able to do any editing work on the magazine. Because two months had already elapsed since the publication of the last issue, we were afraid that many would become concerned. As a result, I reluctantly agreed to prepare another issue of this magazine. We cannot say anything about the future until Mr. Nee has settled other aspects of the work.</p><p>During this period of my substitute-editorship, I have only been able to gather and collect news from various sources. It remains Mr. Nee's job to fulfill the original intention of this magazine, which is to edify the workers, improve the work, give guidance to the churches, and answer questions. We take this opportunity to make this clarification and ask that all the brothers and sisters pray for this.</p><p>We have not been granted a license to publish this magazine as official printed matter yet. Since there are many problems in mail delivery, we cannot put too many pages into the magazine. Therefore, we have again postponed publishing "The Dynamics of Service."</p><p>We did not inform too many people about the special conference in Shanghai this time. Many of the co-workers in nearby places were not able to attend because of the inaccessibility of transportation. Brothers Witness Lee, Chao Chi-gwang, and Chang Tze-jieh returned to Tsingtao and Chefoo after the conference. Brothers Hwa Shi-bin, James Chen, Chang Yu-zhi, and Liu Bei-min are still in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother Chu En-seng was the first one to testify for the Lord in Chi-Shien-Chiao, Pu-Dong. During the past two or three years, he has been conducting a small business on the one hand and preaching the gospel in the villages on the other hand. When he came to Shanghai for the conference, he mentioned that he intended to sell his shop so that he could serve the Lord full-time. Unfortunately, he died of sickness three days after he returned home from the conference (August 13)! The co-workers were both shocked and saddened! By the Lord's grace the local church in Shanghai has remembered the needs of his family. May the Father comfort and protect the widow and orphans of this family!</p><p>We have passed on the money designated for the family of Brother Zhang Gun-jih to the designees. It is better to forward money to the provinces in the southwest directly rather than transferring it through Shanghai.</p><p>Ruth Lee, Shanghai<br />August 29, 1939</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENT 1</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENT 2</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_117.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 32: The Open Door (2) &nbsp; pg 118</div><br></body></html>
